=Childe Xie's Wine=

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,840
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,600
Don't despair.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,440
At least,

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
you've got an audience.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,240
Yeah.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,480
Childe Xie,

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
your problem

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,520
isn't very serious.

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,480
I know a Taoist of Qingcheng Sect.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,600
The cousin of his disciple's grandfather

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,080
has a folk prescription for epilepsy.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
When I compete with him some day,

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,040
I'll get it for you.

15
00:00:30,152 --> 00:00:30,871
Well,

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,000
Fengren,

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,840
you've never told me about the Taoist

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,840
of Qingcheng Sect.

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,520
Which school of martial arts does he do,

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,000
the southern or the northern?

21
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,440
Let me tell you about him.

22
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,560
He was abandoned by Wudang Sect.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,800
When the Five Sects had a battle,

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,520
he and I were young.

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,000
Cousin,

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
I didn't understand

27
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,200
what you were singing.

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,040
But I think it sounded very good.

29
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
When is your next performance?

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,160
There won't be another performance.

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
Xie Tingfeng.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
Xie Xun.

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,040
I'm in bed.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,160
I made some pear soup.

35
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,680
Would you like some

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
to moisten your throat?

37
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,760
No.

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
Would you like to chat with me, then?

39
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm sleepy.

40
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,760
Oh.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, Xie Tingfeng.

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,320
You'll be a rising star.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,080
You'll have a bright future.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Xie Xun,

45
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,760
you're a loser!

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,720
You can do nothing,

47
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
but make trouble.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
Isn't this Childe Xie Tingfeng?

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
Childe Xie sings and dances.

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,480
He doesn't feel shy
even when he's out of tune.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Kid,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,480
some sweetmeats for you.

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,640
Xie Tingfeng.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,000
Childe Xie.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
Do you come to laugh at me too?

56
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,560
This is what I can draw

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,040
when I first learned to draw

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
at the age of three.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,960
This is what I can draw
at the age of eight

60
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,080
after learning from teachers
for some time.

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,920
At the age of 15,

62
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I thought I could draw very well.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,240
Then I sent the whole comic book

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,480
to the magazine.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,200
I thought it could be serialized.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
Unexpectedly,

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,760
it was rejected.

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,240
I've been drawing comics
for a dozen years.

69
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,760
But I only won one prize.

70
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
Guess when.

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,760
When I was eight.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,240
Surprising, isn't it?

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,080
I thought I drew terribly.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,200
However,

75
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,400
the judge told me

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
that he saw my talent for drawing

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
from my picture

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
and then gave me a prize.

79
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,080
So,

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
the failure in your eyes

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,120
may not be the real failure.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,280
What's more,

83
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
a man should never be defeated

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
by one failure.

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,160
I was rejected by the magazine.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Think about it.

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,520
At that time,

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
if I stopped drawing,

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
how could I draw such a cute you?

90
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,080
Look.

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,000
Isn't it lovely?

92
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,320
But no one likes my performance.

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
I do.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,320
Because you're my teacher.

95
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,400
Who kept begging me

96
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
to teach him?

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
Who said I could dance greatly?

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,640
But now,

99
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,720
even my reassurance can't satisfy you.

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,640
Xie Xun, you're so full of yourself.

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,800
No.

102
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
I don't mean that.

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Think.

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
Think about the wine.

105
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,280
It tastes salty, bitter,
spicy, and stinky.

106
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,680
But in the end,

107
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,320
you have a sweet taste.

108
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
It's only because of you that...

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,920
It's because you didn't give up.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,520
All you want in your life is
music and dance.

111
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,840
Will you give it up

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,920
because you failed

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760
for just once?

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Besides,

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
who told you that no one
liked your performance?

116
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,640
Come with me.

117
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,800
Cousin,

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,120
I didn't hear clearly

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,680
the first part of your song.

120
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Could you sing it for me again?

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,800
Sir,

122
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,040
we're running out of candles.

123
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
For your next performance,

124
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,880
I'll go buy some.

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Childe Xie sings and dances,

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
just like a shining star.

127
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,080
What are you doing?

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
Drawing the poster
for your next performance.

129
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,240
Meng Yufan,

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,680
why are you so nice to me?

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,520
Because I like...

132
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,920
...such a clever student as you.

133
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
If you fail,

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,880
it means I'm not a good teacher.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,040
Anyway,

136
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,560
thank you.

137
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,120
Xie Xun,

138
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
your dream of performance

139
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,360
will be realized soon.

140
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,080
The stage is quite big.

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,360
When you stand on it alone,

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,800
you may be scared.

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
But don't worry.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,640
From this day on,

145
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,600
you're no longer alone.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,320
What does it mean?

147
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,760
Everyone

148
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,560
can find his place.

149
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,720
They may be ordinary,

150
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,200
weak,

151
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,600
lonely,

152
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
or disheartened.

153
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,960
But everyone is born to be different.

154
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
Why must we strive

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,200
to be the same as others?

156
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,120
Maybe only the unique people

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,960
make up this wonderful world.

158
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,960
You must believe

159
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,720
that in this world,

160
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,240
everyone

161
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
can find the right place for himself.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,320
Just like this tavern

163
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,880
that doesn't bring honor nor wealth.

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
I can glitter like this.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Even if it's only a dream,

166
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,800
I'm getting attention,

167
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,360
applause,

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
and him.
