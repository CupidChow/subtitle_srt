(Wuti Tavern)

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,320
You're wrong.

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,760
It's not that you're not good enough,

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,120
but I'm not good enough.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
I just hope

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,880
that when I'm away,

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,680
you can accept a new girl

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,160
without too much consideration.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,080
Is it because one day

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,080
you will leave like a meteor?

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,760
You heard what I said

14
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,200
that night?

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,680
You keep saying that you'll leave.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,280
Then could you tell you

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
where you're going?

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,120
Anyway,

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,600
I don't belong to this place.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,800
I have to return to my world one day.

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,120
Your world?

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
The fairyland?

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
I can hardly explain.

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,240
Whatever you say.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,040
Are people there

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,480
different from us?

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,120
In terms of appearance,

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,720
no.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
Will your face change in that place?

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,680
Face?

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,440
I don't know what happened to me.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,160
I haven't figured it out yet.

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,920
Are there taverns?

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,760
Yes.

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,800
There are not only taverns,

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,440
but also live houses.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Live houses?

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,920
That's a wonderful place, huh?

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,480
It's more attractive

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
than anything here,

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,360
right?

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
Frankly speaking,

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
that's indeed a wonderful place.

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,680
We can have plenty to eat and drink

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,400
without leaving home.

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,800
We can go out of the home
and buy anything we want

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,480
without taking heavy silver bars.

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Even when two persons stay far away,

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,240
they can see each other.

50
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,720
Do you live a happy life

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
in that place?

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Life there is rather too convenient.

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
I can do anything alone.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,640
I don't need to see people

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,880
or go out of home.

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
I don't even

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
need friends.

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Many times in my life,

59
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,240
I feel very lonely.

60
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
Are you saying

61
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,480
that people there

62
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,240
don't need friends?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Not all of the people.

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Maybe,

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,200
it's just me.

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,760
I have few friends.

67
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,920
When I'm in college,

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,440
I even spend every birthday

69
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,800
on my own.

70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,280
I buy a small cake

71
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,680
and sing Happy Birthday.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,600
I do the same things every year.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,880
To a lonely girl like me,

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
this may be a good life already.

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,880
I said something

77
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
that you couldn't understand again.

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Yufan,

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't understand what you just said.

80
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,200
But I can feel

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,080
that you're sad.

82
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,040
Now that you live a worse life

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,200
in that place,

84
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,720
what about

85
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,080
staying here?

86
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,080
When Murong said I was a fairy,

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
I was thinking

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
"If only I were

89
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,280
a real fairy!"

90
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,680
But I'm not.

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,520
I can't decide
whether I'll leave or stay.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm only asking if you want

93
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
to stay with me.

94
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,280
I...

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,920
I certainly do, but...

96
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,680
No buts.

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
As long as you want it,

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
I've got a plan.

99
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
Is this your so-called plan?

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,880
When we're tied like this,

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
we won't leave each other.

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
Do you really think

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,400
a rope like this

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
can change our destiny?

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,360
How childish!

106
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
But I...

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
I love this.

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,080
Don't underestimate the rope.

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,720
God of Love match couples

110
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
with such ropes.

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,120
From this day on,

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,040
no one can take you away from me.

113
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,320
All right.

114
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,280
The distillation equipment is done.

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
Now,

116
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
we're going to make wine.

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
Why are you still up?

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,080
I can't fall asleep.

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,640
I'm thirsty.

120
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll go get you some water.

121
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,520
What's wrong?

122
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,200
(Wuti Tavern)

123
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me introduce you.

124
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
This is

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,880
my girlfriend,

126
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Meng Yufan.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,720
Girlfriend?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,040
What does that mean?

129
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,440
I know.

130
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
Fengren told me about it.

131
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
A girlfriend is a girl
in a relationship with a man.

132
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,400
You're indeed a couple.

133
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
Sorry, Xiaotang,

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,200
for not telling you before.

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,120
It doesn't matter.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Without you,

137
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,840
I wouldn't have found my Mr. Right.

138
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
- Mr. Right?
- Mr. Right?

139
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Well, Xiaotang,

140
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,440
I give you my sincere blessing.

141
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Murong!

142
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Take care of my cousin.

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

144
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,720
Now that our relationships
are known to each other,

145
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
let's celebrate together.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,440
Wait a minute.

147
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,000
I've kept a secret

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,080
from you.

149
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,000
Actually, I don't belong to this world.

150
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,240
You don't belong to this world?

151
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
Then are you really a fairy?

152
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,240
No, no. I'm not a fairy.

153
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,920
I know.

154
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
You had a time-travel, right?

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,920
You know time-travel?

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
I certainly do.

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,040
Fengren told me about it.

158
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,600
He had a childhood friend
named Fan Xian

159
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
who had a time-travel, too.

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,280
Yufan,

161
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,080
you don't need to worry.

162
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,800
We're a family.

163
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,320
No matter where you're from,

164
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,560
we'll just be happy for you

165
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
as long as you find

166
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,640
your true love.

167
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,640
Thank you, Shang.

168
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,760
Murong,

169
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
what is a time-travel?

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,280
Let me explain to you.

171
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,880
Xiaotang, a time travel means...

172
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
Fan Xian...

173
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,280
A thousand years later...

174
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,680
You know?

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
He came from a thousand years
after our age.
