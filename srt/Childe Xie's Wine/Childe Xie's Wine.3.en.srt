3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,400
Are those pimples

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,440
on your face?

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,440
Pimples?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,200
Never mind. I don't care.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,120
Pay me the money sooner.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,880
Mr. Xie.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,000
Going to the House of Art again?

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,240
Trying to get
more orders for the tavern?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,200
You are quite nosy, aren't you?

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,280
No, no, no.

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,440
I regressed.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,320
What to do?

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,160
The wine here is pretty strong.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,320
Drink some,

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,800
and good things ensue.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,200
Drink a cup of wine

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,680
in every 12 hours

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,800
to maintain your pretty face.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,840
Is it because of the wine?

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,440
No.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,760
Nothing's happening.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,000
Wrong wine?

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,600
It's not good.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,960
It doesn't taste like wine at all.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
This looks like good wine.

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,800
You're different from them.

29
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,680
Smells so good.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,320
Don't listen to them.

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,760
I tell you what?

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
We're sworn brothers

33
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
starting tonight.

34
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,280
You'll be calling me big bro.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,480
And you're my little brother.

36
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,440
Right?

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,080
Why are you drunk?

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,080
Give me a minute.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,640
Who gave you the audacity

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,520
to drink the wine of Wuti Tavern?

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
It is you.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
I know you.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,680
You're the first one

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,560
who are willing to help me.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,720
And you're handsome.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,960
You're way too nice.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
I hate drunkards.

48
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
Hey, wait a minute.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,200
You need to do me another favor.

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Get off me!

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
You're so annoying.

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,400
Destination,

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
my room.

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Please set the route.

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,200
Let's go.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,960
I've been walking in circles.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
I couldn't find

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,920
where my room is.

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,880
Like I owe you money.

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,800
Here we go.

61
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Why did you drink so much?

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,280
I feel bad.

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,240
It's been 21 years.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,280
No one ever liked me.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll dock the wine money
from your wage.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,400
I know.

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,520
That you think I'm ugly.

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
You asked me out

69
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,920
to make you look pretty.

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
I know everything.

71
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,120
But I don't care!

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,560
I wish

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,560
to have a relationship

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,880
with someone like you,

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,680
even if for one day.

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
Do you know?

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
Next year.

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Next year, I'll graduate.

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,800
I want… I want

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
to have some good memories

81
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,480
as a student.

82
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,720
Is it funny?

83
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,960
What the heck are you talking about?

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,520
You're pretty. You're gorgeous.

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,200
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

86
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,760
Me?

87
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,600
So…

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,480
So let's have a relationship.

89
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,360
Relationship?

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,400
You know.

91
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,040
I love you.

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
You love me.

93
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,200
MX ice cream and tea.

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,480
Look at you.

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Still playing dumb.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,640
You think I'm ugly.

97
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,720
You don't like me.

98
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,560
I don't even like myself.

99
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
How do I like anyone?

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,120
Why don't you like yourself?

101
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,720
You're so handsome.

102
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,280
I bet every girl likes you.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
You wouldn't understand.

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,400
But…

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,800
But

106
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,480
I like you.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,200
When I saw you for the first time,

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,040
my heart raced

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,280
