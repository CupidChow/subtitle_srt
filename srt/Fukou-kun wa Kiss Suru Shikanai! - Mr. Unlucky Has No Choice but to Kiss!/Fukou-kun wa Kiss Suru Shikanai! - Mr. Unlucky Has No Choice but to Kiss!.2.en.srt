00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:10,709
My name is Kota Fukuhara.

2
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:13,025
They say names are reflected in one's nature,

3
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:16,548
but not in my case.

4
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:24,539
As you just saw, bad luck has showered down on me since long ago.

5
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:31,861
I'm glad it's not a raw egg.

6
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,437
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:40,231
Finally, a crack. It's my lucky day.

8
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:43,260
Lucky?

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,680
- Wait. Naoya is dating someone?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,435
Do you know what he said when I invited him to hang out?

11
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,786
What did he say?

12
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:56,955
He doesn't want his partner to misunderstand.

13
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,845
What a perfect answer!

14
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:00,503
So, who's he dating?

15
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:03,367
I have no clue.

16
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:07,062
He can hear you guys, you know.

17
00:01:07,062 --> 00:01:10,556
So, who are you dating?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,931
- I won't tell you.
- Come on, you can tell us.

19
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,306
I don't want to spread gossip.

20
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,166
Well, is that so?

21
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,177
Dude, spill it already.

22
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:23,825
- No.
- Just tell us.

23
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:28,853
Oh, man! Word is spreading too fast.

[Episode 2 | Mr. Unlucky Has No Choice but to Go on a Date on Saturday!]

34
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:27,580
Okay, let's stay together.

35
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:33,494
Really? Thanks...

36
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:49,196
He totally misunderstood me.

37
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:51,295
Now we're dating.

38
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:57,153
Wait, that was my first kiss.

39
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:02,496
But it's either this or going back to my miserable days.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,145
Great, let's date.

41
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,446
Okay.

42
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,786
- Who is it?
- I told you, I don't know.

43
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:14,107
- You don't know?
- I don't.

44
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,032
Do you guys know?

45
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:18,559
Of course not!

46
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,199
I've had a lot of bad luck so far,

47
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,171
but today might be the day I get murdered.

48
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:29,207
I have to be careful when going home at night.

49
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,420
- He's dating me.
- Whatever.

50
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,920
Kota!

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,619
Don't come to me. They'll catch on if you act like that.

52
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,044
How was your class?

53
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:54,796
He's so close.

54
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:59,205
It was good. Thanks.

55
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,585
Kota.

56
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:09,710
Hey, do you know who Naoya is dating?

57
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,988
- What?
- Hey, stop that!

58
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,843
This guy is keeping his mouth shut.

59
00:04:15,844 --> 00:04:20,277
Come on. Do you know?

60
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:24,432
I... don't think so.

61
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,932
You don't know, either?

62
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:31,499
His cheek is so bouncy.

63
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,097
Bouncy?

64
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,070
This feels like... we're friends?

65
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,417
Is this also thanks to Naoya?

66
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,677
- This is crazy.
- So bouncy.

67
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:45,371
Hey, stop making him uncomfortable.

68
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:48,730
- Don't keep him all for yourself.
- Shut up.

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,440
Hey, shouldn't you get to class?

70
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,191
Oh, crap!

71
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,974
- Let's go, Mugi.
- Oh, man.

72
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:57,380
He won't tell us, and you've missed too many classes already.

73
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,280
I know, but...

74
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:05,739
Hey... I'm sorry.

75
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,495
Did I do something wrong?

76
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:12,745
No, I just didn't like it.

77
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:19,485
I couldn't stand by and watch other people touch you.

78
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,820
What?

79
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:24,347
Sorry, I got jealous.

80
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:26,744
Those words from that face...

81
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,810
will completely make me fall head over heels for him!

82
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,572
Kota, about yesterday...

83
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,914
What's with that guy?

84
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:45,076
He's like a manga character.

85
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,596
He would be popular for sure.

86
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:52,146
Oh, crap! I'm losing my cool.

87
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:55,521
If I can't control myself,

88
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,358
we will have to break up before everyone finds out.

89
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,738
Seriously?

90
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:12,945
I wasn't even away from him for that long. Darn it.

91
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:22,209
No, I can't break up with him.

92
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,882
I've decided. I have to stay with him no matter what.

93
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,634
Naoya!

94
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:31,575
Even if that means...

95
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:33,709
Naoya!

96
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,307
that I have to betray his trust.

97
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:40,081
Naoya!

98
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:45,965
Where is he?

99
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:52,143
Hey, can you stop dragging Sho to your mixers?

100
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:56,148
He's the reason why I couldn't go eat pancakes as we promised.

101
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,900
- Right?
- What a pity.

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,710
- It's all his fault.
- What?

103
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:04,831
Sho told me you kept forcing him to go to your mixers.

104
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,076
Yeah, he keeps forcing me.

105
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:10,578
I told him I didn't want to go, and I even begged on my knees.

106
00:07:10,578 --> 00:07:13,326
I told him I didn't want to go.

107
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:16,045
- I was bawling.
- What?

108
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,769
I just wanted to be with you, Nacchan.

109
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,204
He's a horrible guy. Isn't he awful?

110
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:25,442
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Hey, what?

111
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:29,734
Just blame him. I did nothing wrong, okay?

112
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:33,432
- Why are you running?
- What a cute face.

113
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:36,800
Getting pulled into that stupid couple's quarrel

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,840
is because that guy's not canceling out my bad luck right now.

115
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,733
He isn't here, either.

116
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:49,707
In that case, I need to do my best to stay with him.

117
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:59,078
The lunch my beloved wife made for me...

118
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:10,591
What the hell is this? Flower pin holders?

119
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,245
- Isn't that next week?
- Yeah, I hope it'll be nice weather.

120
00:08:18,245 --> 00:08:20,584
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

121
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:23,807
- We were almost done with it.
- Sorry.

122
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,228
That's weird. Where did he go?

123
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,837
Naoya!

124
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,636
I'm so glad I found you.

125
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:54,311
Hey, what happened to you? You're soaking wet.

126
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:59,580
It's okay, I have a change of clothes.

127
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,844
I'm worried. I can't let my boyfriend get sick.

128
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,645
What?

129
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,007
You're so lucky to have a spare set of clothes.

130
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:25,816
Yeah.

131
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,852
- Phew.
- Oh.

132
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,795
Here, chocolate and vanilla.

133
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:36,152
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

134
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:41,741
Ah, this is so good!

135
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:45,729
I've never had ice cream from the cafeteria before.

136
00:09:45,729 --> 00:09:48,053
Because whenever I had ice cream,

137
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,785
it always fell to the ground without fail.

138
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,351
Hey, can I have a bite?

139
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,217
What?

140
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:58,818
Oh.

141
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,005
Yeah, that's good.

142
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,180
- Do you want to try mine?
- Oh, sure.

143
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:11,946
Yeah, that's good too.

144
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,447
Right.

145
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,751
Finally!

146
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:44,735
For the first time in my life, I ate all my ice cream without any spills!

147
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,166
Oh, sorry.

148
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,955
I got so excited all of a sudden.

149
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:57,462
It's fine. I don't mind seeing you get excited like a kid.

150
00:10:57,462 --> 00:11:00,145
Actually, I like it.

151
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,525
Look at that gaze.

152
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,672
It's totally like we're a couple.

153
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:12,437
Hey, Kota, are you free this weekend?

154
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,462
Oh, yeah.

155
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:18,156
Let's go out then.

156
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:24,438
What? You and me, just the two of us?

157
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:26,852
Yeah, how does that sound?

158
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,861
But I...

159
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,817
Goats bite me at the zoo.

160
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:36,718
A fight breaks out and the baseball game gets canceled.

161
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,591
The beach is unusually cold for the season.

162
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:43,593
The wood at the camping site is wet and won't catch fire.

163
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:50,492
Even the people around me have gotten affected by my many nightmares.

164
