What? There's a hole in your ceiling?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:12,110
Yeah. The washing machine upstairs leaked.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,030
Wow. That can happen?

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,529
How could a washer leak so much water?

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,879
- What's this about?
- A hole? Where?

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,349
- In Kota's ceiling at home.
- What?

8
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,450
It just suddenly burst open last night.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,649
What? What are you going to do now?

10
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:35,270
I have to find a place to stay for two weeks during the repair.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,149
I'd love to house you, but I live with my parents.

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:41,219
I live with my big sister.

Thanks, but I'm fine.

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,110
I'll find somewhere to stay.

Oh, he gave you this penguin?

- Yeah.

Yeah, anything is okay.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,469
I'm so overly conscious of this guy.

39
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,140
I don't think I can keep this act up for a week.

40
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,570
By the way, do you eat bread or rice in the morning?

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,799
Um, I usually eat bread.

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,729
But sometimes, it's rice.

43
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,630
Got it.

44

Oh, okay. Thanks.

Get it together, idiot.

I made some tea.

54
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,790
What's wrong?

55
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,339
Oh, it's nothing.

56
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,389
Oh, right! I'll get your bed ready.

57
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,630
Sorry for the trouble.

Yeah, the bed dryer.

64
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,600
Found it. I'll dry your blanket.

65
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,029
It's fine. I know it was sudden.

66
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:07,180
Honestly, I wanted to invite you over after cleaning the place up better.

67
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,639
What?

68
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,700
I mean, it's normal to want your partner to relax.

69
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,310
Oh, what scents do you like?

70
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,999
What? Scents?

71
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,410
The blanket dryer can add a scent.

72
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,279
Which one do you want?

73
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,519
I have lavender, orange, bergamot, ylang-ylang,

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,050
and more, so take your pick.

75
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,950
Um, I don't know much about this stuff.

76
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,699
Lavender is good for sleeping well.

77
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,269
Orange or bergamot is best for relieving stress and relaxing.

78
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:53,749
And for something relaxing and a bit sensual, ylang-ylang.

79
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:56,169
S... Sensual?!

80
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:59,040
You have a scent for that?

81
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,610
Are you interested? Then I'll use ylang-ylang.

82
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,779
- That's not what I meant.
- Okay, wait here.

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,120
I got drawn into his pace again.

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,700
I'm sure he's always been a clean person,

85
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,500
but I can tell he took extra time to clean for me.

86
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,610
And then there's this penguin.

87
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,210
I wanted to give this to you.

88
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,280
Why go to all that trouble?

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,639
Because I want you to be happy.

90
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,880
I like it when you smile.

91
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,500
I think I understand why I feel comfortable around him.

92
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,540
It's because he's always thinking about me.

93
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,270
It's not because he has good luck.

94
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,830
Maybe I'm slowly starting to...

95
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,100
All right.

96
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,580
Now your pillow and blankets will smell good tonight.

97
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,219
- Naoya.
- Yes?

98
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,230
Thanks.

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,619
Of course.

100
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,750
Let's have a good week.

101
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,870
Sounds good.

102
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,830
What was that just now?

103
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,300
Wow, that was so good.

104
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,760
Thank you.

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Not at all.

106
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,040
Let me wash the dishes.

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,559
It's fine. You can go wash up first.

108
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,410
Oh... okay.

109
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,369
Kota?

110
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,940
I'll leave your towel here.

111
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,610
Thanks.

112
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,930
The time has finally come.

113
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,340
Why're they lined up side-by-side?

114
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,610
So this is ylang-ylang.

115
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,269
Did you smell it?

116
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,960
What? Oh, yeah.

117
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,929
I guess you could say it's kind of sweet and exotic.

118
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:42,660
Apparently, in some countries, the ylang-ylang flowers

119
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,000
are decorated in a newlywed's room.

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Newlyweds?!

121
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh no! This situation is not looking good.

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,720
We have class in the morning, so let's go to bed.

123
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,130
Oh, sure.

124
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,119
Good night, then.

125
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,040
Good night.

126
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,070
What is it?

127
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,230
I forgot.

128
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,490
Forgot what?

129
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,050
Could he mean a goodnight kiss?

130
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,729
Rui will be lonely on his own.

131
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:55,850
Use it as a body pillow.

132
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,200
Oh, yeah! You're right.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,100
That'll be great.

134
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,400
Good night, then.

135
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,100
Good night.

136
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,280
Is he asleep?

137
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,780
Or could it be

138
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:44,310
that sleeping next to me is actually making him nervous, too?

139
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Is he really sleeping?

140
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,670
Wait! What am I even thinking?

141
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,810
I need to sleep.

142
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,090
Nothing happened.

143
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,720
Good morning.

144
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,309
Morning. Did you sleep well?

145
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,499
Yeah. I did.

146
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,120
Good to hear.

147
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,959
Help yourself to whatever is in the fridge.

148
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,139
What? Isn't it too early to go to school?

149
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,420
I have somewhere to go.

150
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
See you later.

151
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,600
See you...

152
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,030
later.

153
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,780
What is going on?

154
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,210
I don't...

155
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,080
I don't get it at all!

156

With who?

158
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,329
Is it his girlfriend?

159
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,699
It's not.

160
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,609
It's Kota.

161
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,490
What?

162
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,169
His ceiling broke, and he needed a place to stay until it was fixed.

163
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,179
Oh, it's just Kota?

164
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:14,249
Wow! A ceiling can break like that?

165
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,479
Seriously.

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,780
I hope mine breaks, too.

167
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,860
Then he might let me stay over.

168
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,840
How do they know already?

169
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,760
Kota.

170
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,909
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

171
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,270
- Morning.
- How do you like living with Naoya?

172
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,999
What do you mean?

173
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,169
There's... nothing going on.

174
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:37,190
Nothing? Is there usually something?

175
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,510
No, that's not what I meant.

176
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,250
What do you mean?

177
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,620
Well, you know...

178
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,860
Anyway, I mean it's peaceful.

179
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,280
Peaceful.

180
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,061
Naoya's here.

181
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,619
Oh, good morning, Kota and friends.

182
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,810
Good morning!

183
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,150
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

184
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,040
To Harajuku.

185
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,470
- We haven't been there for ages.
- Then we're going to Harajuku this weekend.

186
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,000
- Are you coming, too?
- Are you free?

187
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,669
Have you ever heard a song over and over in commercials,

188
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,669
only to start humming and downloading it?

189
00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:28,690
Sometimes you end up liking something after repetition.

190
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,449
For example, if you repeatedly interact with someone you don't like,

191
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:37,580
the amount of affection you have for them will go up.

192
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,990
This is called the mere-exposure effect.

193
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,900
This was proven by American psychologist Robert Zajonc,

194
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,070
and is thus also called the Zajonc Effect.

195
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,739
I know what he means,

196
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:57,210
even touching hands makes you super aware.

197
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,270
Well, that situation would never come my way.

198
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,300
Yeah, nothing happened.

199
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,110
He didn't lay one finger on me.

200
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,740
What happened to his enthusiasm from earlier?

201
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,169
This can happen with anything.

202
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,249
Brands.

203
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,489
Services.

204
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,459
Ads, music, scents, and more

205
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,880
can all make you experience this effect.

206
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,820
Could it be he's avoiding me?

207
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,829
Hey, the water!

208
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,239
What? Oh, Yashiro.

209
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,099
No, stop the water. It's overflowing.

210
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,090
- Oh, crap!
- Turn it off!

211
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,569
Geez, are you all right?

212
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,550
Oh, this is nothing.

213
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,130
No, not that.

214
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,470
You looked deep in thought.

215
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:07,000
I bet that's bothering you a lot more than that water.

216
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,710
Oh, this is the first time I'm thinking about something...

217
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,350
other than my own bad luck.

218
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,260
Kota?

219
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,009
Hey, Kota? Are you doing okay?

220
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,989
You look like your soul has been sucked out. Seriously, what happened?

221
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,980
No, it's nothing.

222
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,330
Come on! What's with the face?

223
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,199
- Something's up, right?
- It's nothing, really.

224
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,609
Come on, you can tell me.

225
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,699
It's nothing.

226
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,190
- Come on.
- It's nothing.

227
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,440
Don't be shy. You can tell me.

228
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,270
- Seriously, it's nothing.
- No, it's not.

229
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,570
- Yashiro, I'm telling you, it's nothing.
- Come on. Tell me.

230
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,599
- I'm back.
- Hey, there.

231
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,909
You're home late.

232
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,419
Damn, he's so cool.

233
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,809
What's wrong?

234
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,359
Well, your muscles are incredible.

235
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,949
Oh, I go to the gym. That's where I was this morning.

236
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,009
Oh, so that's why you left early.

237
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,250
Well, I go there every day, so it's a habit now.

238
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,910
Wow, I wish I had muscles like that.

239
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,400
Then, let's work out together.

240
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,970
I have equipment at home.

241
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,360
What? You won't laugh at me? I know it doesn't suit me.

242
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,490
Why would I?

243
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,439
People say working out wouldn't suit me.

244
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,680
And would you be okay if I had a body like this?

245
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,680
Super buff like this?

246
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:00,040
Hey, that's so funny.

247
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,530
What?

248
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,110
It's my first time seeing you laugh so much.

249
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,920
I laugh too, you know.

250
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,130
Hey, laugh for me again.

251
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,580
I can't do it on command.

252
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,270
Come on, laugh.

253
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,239
Kota, you're too close.

254
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,310
S... Sorry.

255
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:39,090
Why am I acting so aggressive? Isn't it usually the opposite?

256
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,900
What were you saying to Yashiro today?

257
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,750
How did you know...?

258
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,100
We were just catching up, I guess.

259
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,810
I see.

260
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,290
Why?

261
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,990
Well, um...

262
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,130
I was just wondering since you two seemed to be having fun.

263
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,980
Huh? What do you mean?

264
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,400
Then there's something I want to know, too.

265
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,440
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

266
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,769
You don't like me anymore?

267
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,010
Let me hear your answer, Naoya.

268
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,970
That's not it.

269
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,390
You're really important to me.

270
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,490
Wait, hold on.

271
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,590
But when we're together, I want to reach out to you.

272
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,170
Or I mean, I can't hold myself back.

273
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,430
Wait, hold on. He's so close.

274
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,710
He's way too close. I can't think straight now.

275
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,689
I get it, so just step away...

276
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,340
This positioning...

277
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,220
No, this is bad.

278
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,650
Kota.

279
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,840
I...

280
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,110
think it's too soon for that!

281
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,049
Oh god! I've done it now.

282
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,140
W-What do I do?

283
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,380
I'll get him to bed first.

284
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,049
But he's naked.

285
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,660
And he's lost consciousness.

286
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,139
I shouldn't move him.

287
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,900
Oh, I'll call an ambulance.

288
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,690
Wait.

289
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,040
Ouch. Sorry.

290
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,480
Are you okay?

291
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,660
- I can't do this!
- Wait—

292
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:42,110
What the hell was that?! I can't hold it in anymore!

293
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,040

If Naoya tries, he can get tickets for sure.

Naoya is more than just his good luck.

Thanks. You were angry for my sake, right?
