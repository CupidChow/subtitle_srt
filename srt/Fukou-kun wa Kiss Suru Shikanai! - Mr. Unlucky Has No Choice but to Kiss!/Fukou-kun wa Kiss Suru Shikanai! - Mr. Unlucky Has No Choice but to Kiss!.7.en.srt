1
00:00:02,933 --> 00:00:07,601
Making the people around me happy was my greatest joy.

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:13,053
Um, I was wondering if you could go out with me.

3
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:15,763
Oh...

4
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,609
Sure.

5
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,123
Wait, really?

6
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:26,403
I'm so glad! Thanks, Naoya!

7
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:28,230
Yeah.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,522
I wanted to be happy with everyone.

9
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:33,352
So, instead of focusing on my happiness,

10
00:00:33,352 --> 00:00:36,363
I always did things to please others.

11
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,583
Sharing my happiness is more fun.

12
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,223
However, others didn't feel the same way.

13
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:49,173
I sold the rare card Naoya gave me for three times the price.

14
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,973
What a useful guy.

15
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,900
He can get you any rare card you want.

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,633
He's a legend.

17
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:02,767
I'm going to college in Osaka, so let's break up.

18
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:05,443
It'll be good for us.

19
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:08,973
Okay, got it.

20
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:14,243
Aren't you going to object to it? Bye then.

21
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,533
Then what did you want me to do?

22
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:30,998
Always keeping my guard up or getting disappointed was a bit tiring.

23
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:32,743
Oh, Naoya!

24
00:01:32,743 --> 00:01:36,443
Hey, the afternoon class will be held in a different room.

25
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,312
Right.

26
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:41,352
- Let's go.
- Time to go.

27
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,608
Where'd you run off to alone?

28
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,751
Mugi is in his own world and Saku lives by his own rules.

29
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,849
I feel comfortable whenever I'm with them,

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,629
because they don't rely on others.

31
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,809
It's really cool.

32
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:04,059
And... on that day,

33
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:06,099
I met Kota.

Kota, we're in the same department.

Hang out with us too, okay?

40
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:22,449
Okay. Of course, let's hang out.

41
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,139
What a breath of fresh air.

I have to go over there. See you tomorrow.

- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

After the entrance ceremony,

45
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,729
I happened to see Kota's smile. It was so cute.

46
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,769
Yes, it was exactly like

I couldn't keep my eyes off of him.

49
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,958
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

50
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,919
- Whoa!
- Watch where you're going!

51
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:02,864
Okay, I will! I'm sorry!

52
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,601
But for some reason,

53
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:09,848
I felt our similarity in his lovable smile.

54
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,554
Who the hell are you telling to be careful?

Yesterday, we officially began dating as a couple.
[Episode 7: Mr. Unlucky Has No Choice but to be a Boyfriend

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,846
Hm? A couple?

76
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:45,933
Now that we're a couple, does anything change in between us?

77
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:54,924
What do couples even do?

78
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:59,953
Think about it. Being friends and boyfriends are completely different.

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,198
Things you can do as a couple that you can't as friends.

80
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:12,418
Is that... it?

81
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:29,053
What should I make?

82
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,500
These are dishes.

83

Oh, there are tomatoes and eggs.

84
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:43,986
I should make some coffee, too.

85
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:03,108
All right.

86
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:06,568
Wow, smells great.

- Did you make breakfast?
- Yeah.

00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:55,186
Wait! What?

169
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:58,976
Miki got rejected the same way last year.

170
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:02,196
She was so determined this year.

171
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:05,076
She has a high standard for men.

172
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,874
Oh, that.

173
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,236
I guess I'll use it as a reference.

174
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:13,759
Oh, I asked Lord Kirari about the broken bracelet

175
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,096
without telling Miki.

176
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:20,715
- Okay.
- It was online counseling. And he said...

177
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:23,705
When your bracelet breaks, it is not a bad sign.

178
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:26,836
It is proof that it has protected you from bad things.

179
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,915
I believe it has sucked up

180
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:32,206
the evil aura around you.

181
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:36,485
Apparently, Miki was surrounded by evil aura.

182
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:40,400
Seriously? But it turned out great.

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,790
If it sacrificed itself for her,

184
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,916
that means her romantic luck is still intact.

185
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:50,416
In fact, Naoya is too high-level for her.

186
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,386
No, I think Miki's level is just as high.

187
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,856
Yeah, but...

188
00:11:55,856 --> 00:12:00,410
That high-level guy is currently with me...

189
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,660
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight.

190
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,306
I'm scared of the nightfall.

191
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,528
Even if someone falls in love under false pretenses,

192
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:18,966
feelings of love grow after this happens.

193
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:23,576
I was completely out of it during my afternoon class

194
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,116
until I was struck by what Professor Kawahara said.

195
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:32,018
By the way, everyone,

196
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:37,502
is there anyone you want to meet no matter how tired you are?

197
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:42,260
Hm, no one comes to mind.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,706
Someone I want to meet no matter how tired I am?

199
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,779
I have one.

200
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,580
Who?

201
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,300
Anna.

202
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,840
- Huh? Me?
- Not only in times of fatigue,

203
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,814
but also in times of terrible hardship,

204
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:18,387
or times of depression, the person you want to meet...

205
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,620
it could be the person you love.

206
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,590
Perhaps that could be the case.

207
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,555
The person you love?

208
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,510
The person you love...

209
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,478
W-What?

210
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:41,099
That is the one difference between a partner and a friend.

211
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,614
The difference between a partner and a friend.

212
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:49,651
The situation changes after lovers get married.

213
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:53,014
Falling in love in the first place...

214
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:56,238
is a state of psychological arousal.

215
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:59,242
In other words, there is much to gain

216
00:13:59,242 --> 00:14:01,618
from that spark you feel inside.

217
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:04,992
That means I don't love anyone right now.

218
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:08,564
Me neither. When I'm tired, I want to be alone

219
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:10,708
and sleep after a nice bath.

220
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:13,130
I know what you mean.

221
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,887
It's true that I...

222
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:24,710
So, one way of getting that spark...

223
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,368
is to smooch.

224
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,505
"Smooch"? In this day and age?

225
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,661
- A kiss from a prince...
- Totally.

226
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:39,190
a princess regains consciousness in a fairly tale.

227
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,569
And in legal studies,

228
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:47,609
this would be considered indecent assault.

229
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:53,560
But in psychology, this is a very curious scene.

230
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,062
Now that I think about it, he...

231
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:05,017
What? Just now...

232
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:07,424
Couples normally kiss, right?

233
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:09,079
What?

234
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:13,184
Why did he suddenly kiss me back then?

235
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:34,581
My last night living here...

236
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,621
I'm home!

237
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:43,445
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

238
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,303
What're you doing?

239
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,590
Oh, I'm packing.

240
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,480
You can do that tomorrow.

241
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,000
You still have one more night.

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,973
- I'm taking this.
- But...

243
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,373
We promised to enjoy ourselves tonight, right?

244
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:06,233
Kota.

245
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:12,102
W-Wait... What?

246
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,900
You're so cute when you're flustered.

247
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,430
What?

248
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,533
I told you not to laugh.

249
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:22,083
Don't worry. I promised you, didn't I?

250
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,373
I'll kiss your lips when you consent.

251
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:35,200
Are you keeping the promise?

252
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,965
Didn't you hear what Professor said today?

253
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,646
Without permission, it's indecent assault.

254
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,787
Then why did you... back then...

255
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,246
You kissed me all of a sudden.

256
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,717
Oh, that's...

257
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:58,471
People I've dated loved it when I did that,

258
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:02,946
so I thought you'd like it too.

259
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,951
What the hell?

260
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:13,685
Because your ex-girlfriends liked it,

261
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,200
you did that to me?

262
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,759
Yeah.

263
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:26,080
I'm a guy, too.

264
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,786
I hate to be the one who is always passive.

265
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,823
Hey, Naoya.

266
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,780
What are you doing?

267
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,304
A kiss, of course.

268
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:37,867
Stay still.

269
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,480
Wait! A kiss?

270
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,184
Who cares about the law?!

271
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:47,563
Shut up and give me your mouth!

272
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:50,060
Sure, here.

273
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:01,303
Aren't we kissing?

274
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:02,542
Yeah, we are.

275
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,620
Okay.

276
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,120
Go on then.

277
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:31,024
Are we not kissing?

278
00:18:31,024 --> 00:18:33,333
What? Well...

279
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:37,255
I think I'm still not ready for that kind of thing.

280
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,845
If you can't kiss, how about we sleep together?

281
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:44,769
What? You've got the order mixed up.

282
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:47,259
Stop laughing!

283
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,080
What?

284
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,815
I'm the only one who gets to see this side of you.

285
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:00,500
Don't show it to anyone else.

286
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:05,863
No one wants to see that face, except you.

287
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:09,665
Then I'll refrain from sleeping with you,

288
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,364
so how about that?

289
00:19:11,364 --> 00:19:14,178
That? Together?

290
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:17,122
Yeah, that.

291
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:22,378
Does he mean...

292
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,273
a bath together?!

293
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:32,493
I guess not.

294
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:35,139
Why are we working out?

295
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,434
We talked about this before.

296
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:42,196
Wow, I wish I had muscles like that.

297
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:45,183
Then let's work out together.

298
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:53,586
And if you exercise, you won't trip and fall anymore.

299
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:57,427
All right, let's sweat it out.

300
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:00,029
Here. Hold it.

301
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,193
- Okay.
- You ready?

302
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:02,024
Sure.

303
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:03,688
One.

304
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:04,970
Nice!

305
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,838
Two.

306
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,462
You can do it!

307
00:20:09,452 --> 00:20:12,101
Come on, more!

308
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,281
Two more times.

309
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,570
Let's go.

310
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:28,457
You can do it. Is it hard?

311
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:31,552
This is really hard.

312
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:42,332
My muscles will be sore tomorrow.

313
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:45,644
But that felt kind of good.

314
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,189
Really? Glad to hear that.

315
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,889
Yeah.

316
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:04,439
Because we were exhausted from the intense workout,

317
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:09,446
we both fell asleep right away without doing anything at all.

318
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,486
On the next day,

319
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,018
I left Naoya's apartment.

320
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:56,971
I even bought matching tableware.

321
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:17,602
I'm so hungry.

322
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,256
Totally empty.

323
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:32,089
To the store.

324
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,401
What?

325
00:22:45,606 --> 00:22:47,877
I am Kota Fukuhara.

326
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:51,101
My name implies happiness.

327
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:53,098
Or not.

328
00:22:53,098 --> 00:22:58,033
In the end, I'm a super unlucky guy without Naoya.

329
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:21,300
♫ Let's go on this path ♫

330
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:27,700
♫ Together while holding hands ♫

331
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,890
♫ Let's get to know each other ♫

332
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:43,960
♫ Entirely till the day we die ♫

333
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,578
[PREVIEW]

334
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,477
It's thanks to my bad luck that I met you.

335
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,644

I was happy, even if it was a fake relationship.

00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,469
