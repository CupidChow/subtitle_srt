I... still think it's too soon for that!

I've done it now.

9
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:02,951
I punched him without thinking. And...

10
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:14,407
- I can't do this!
- I just left him like that and ran away.

I should apologize before he goes home.
[Episode 5: Mr. Unlucky Has No Choice but to Fall in Love!]

I mean, I want to keep being... with him...

Wait, this isn't right.

25

Don't forget why you're with him.

It's to get rid of your bad luck and have a happy life.

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,558
I decided to stay with him even if I have to lie.

Things need to go back to how they were before.

- Naoya!

- Sure.

- Want one?

- I'll take it.
- Here.

34

- Thanks.
- Let's go then.

In that case, it's time to wait by the door.

Oh, it's nothing.

You're naturally unlucky?

70
00:05:54,113 --> 00:05:56,880
That's hard to believe.

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,408
Yeah, it was wrong of me to bring it up.

72
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,126
It depends on how you look at it.

73
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:07,483
You wouldn't understand my struggles.

74
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:10,685
Do you know Alexander Fleming, the microbiologist?

75
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,443
He discovered penicillin.

76
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:16,073
Oh, sure, I know the name.

77
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:22,114
They say mold got in a Petri dish during his experiment.

78
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:26,649
Usually, when you see mold, you'd consider it a failure

79
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,232
and would throw the entire dish out.

80
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:33,633
But he kept the dish and continued to observe it.

81
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,140
Then, he noticed that the staphylococcus

82
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:39,221
didn't grow in the moldy Petri dish.

83
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:43,071
So he accidentally discovered how mold works as a sterilizer.

84
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:46,108
That's how the penicillin we use for pneumonia and tetanus,

85
00:06:46,109 --> 00:06:49,689
or what we call antibiotics, were born.

86
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,974
Is that so?

87
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:53,768
So what I'm trying to say

88
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:57,332
is that good luck comes to everyone in equal measure.

89
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,777
What's important is to notice

90
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:03,857

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,049
I won't help you with that.

163
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:50,089
You're so annoying.

164
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,133
What a pain!

165
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,498
He's so obnoxious.

166
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,270
What's with him?

167
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,575
So useless.

168
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:07,151
What the hell, Naoya!

169
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,175
You're so cool!

170
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,561
Until now,

171
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:24,864
I thought he was only being nice

172
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:28,020
because he was the guy who had it all.

173
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,776
But I was wrong.

174
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:35,189
He doesn't just have good luck.

175
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,445
He has a big heart and thinks of others.

176
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:42,445
- Kota, over here.
- Oh, okay.

177
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,499
That's great.

178
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,016
I got seats for a dolphin show.

179
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:49,231
He thinks about giving others joy

180
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:52,224
and works hard so that others are happy.

181
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:54,410
Then let's use ylang-ylang.

182
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:59,861
Anyone would look up to someone like that

183
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,466
and fall in love.

184
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:13,896
After thinking about how to face him,

185
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:17,014
it's suddenly night now.

186
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:27,338
That Naoya is totally useless.

187
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:28,910
You can be pretty awful, huh?

188
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,016
You said so yourself earlier.

189
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:36,029
I mean, Naoya is guaranteed to get the tickets.

190
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,776
- I thought we'd rake in some money.
- Those guys were talking to Naoya earlier.

191
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:43,320
You wanted to get some cash to play around with Naoko, right?

192
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:44,288
You're an idiot.

193
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:49,275
He's not taking advantage of his luck, so I'm doing it for him.

194
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,684
I feel sorry for Naoya, getting liked by a jerk like you.

195
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,253
I don't really like him.

196
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm only interested in his good luck.

197
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,994
Just think, if I bet money on some horse races...

198
00:12:58,994 --> 00:12:59,930
Who's this guy?

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,213
What the hell are you doing?

200
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:08,988
Shut up, you trash!

201
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,351
What the hell did you say?

202
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,613
Shut up. Why don't you fix your attitude?

203
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:14,560
- You're full of shit.
- No, you are!

204
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,977
- What the heck?
- Hey, hold on! Stop it!

205
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:20,367
You shut up, too!

206
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,728
Looking at you two makes me pissed off.

207
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:28,389
It's like looking at myself in a mirror.

208
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,521
Stop spouting nonsense!

209
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,143
Come on, get up.

210
00:13:42,144 --> 00:13:44,437
Hey, get up, you punk.

211
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:46,765
What happened to your truculence earlier?

212
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,801
Come on, fight back.

213
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,467
Come on.

214
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,813
I'm the same as these guys.

215
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:11,000
I only paid attention to Naoya's good luck and nothing else.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,142
- Watch out!
- What?

217
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:19,802
You can choose what we do.

218
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:21,847
- I used him.
- Really?

219
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:24,817
I can't let my boyfriend get sick.

220
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:37,571
I took advantage of such a kind, honest guy.

221
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,993
The date ends once your lover gets home, right?

222
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:42,972
Of course, I want my partner to feel comfortable.

223
00:14:45,253 --> 00:14:48,587
I'm the worst.

224
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,878
Naoya is an amazing guy.

225
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:04,807
He has everything he wants.

226
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,074
I'm boiling with envy.

227
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:16,115
But his good luck isn't all there is to him!

228
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:21,654
He is able to share his luck.

229
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,885
That's why people love him.

230
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:27,864
It's not something anyone can do.

231
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:35,207
Scum like you two who don't hold any remorse

232
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,718
have no right to talk about Naoya!

233
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

234
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,760
- Are they fighting?
- So scary.

235
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,010
Should we go get a professor?

236
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,180
Who is that?

237
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,360
- Do you know him?
- Isn't that Kota?

238
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,150
- No way.
- Yeah, it's him.

239
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:57,015
- Kota?
- It can't be him.

240
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,980
I'd never have imagined...

241
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,140
This is crazy.

242
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,150
Let's go get a professor.

243
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,410
He found out.

244
00:16:09,237 --> 00:16:11,037
O... Ouch.

245
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:14,594
Sorry.

246
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:16,094
It's fine.

247
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:20,039
So awkward. I can't look up at him.

248
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,360
All that's left is the band-aid.

249
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,025
- Kota.
- Yes?

250
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,152
Thanks.

251
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,268
What?

252
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:50,948
Earlier, you got mad for my sake. Right?

253
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,906
So... it made me happy.

254
00:16:56,055 --> 00:16:57,563
Thanks.

255
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:04,205
I have no right to hear those words from you.

256
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,609
Show me your wound.

257
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:28,031
Come on.

258
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:32,319
What's wrong?

259
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,560
You're wrong.

260
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:42,029
I... um...

261
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:48,374
was lying and taking advantage of you, too.

262
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:49,774
What?

263
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:54,887
I've always naturally had bad luck.

264
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:59,106
But when I'm by your side, all of that goes away.

265
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,366
I think it's because of your good luck.

266
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:11,213
Dating you was a lie, too.

267
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:17,800
- Naoya, I have something else I want to talk about.
- Okay.

268
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,114
If I want to use this guy and his good luck,

269
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:25,193
I'll have to...

270
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:28,551
I was hoping we could stay together always.

271
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,607
Sure.

272
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:40,705
You misunderstood me and I took advantage of that.

273
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:42,515
I put on an act.

274
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:45,971
The only person I know on this campus is you,

275
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:49,616
so I was wondering if we could tour the place together.

276
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:50,982
Sure thing.

277
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:53,464
Really? I'm so glad.

278
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:55,476
Naoya!

279
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,001
The strawberry parfait is delicious.

280
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:02,274
I wanted to win that for you.

281
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,829
As long as you're by my side,

282
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,246
I'm happy.

283
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:14,023
Disappointed, right? This is the real me.

284
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:20,996
Sorry for lying to you.

285
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:29,197
We were only together for a bit, but thank you.

286
00:19:29,198 --> 00:19:31,168
I had fun.

287
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,507
Hey, hold on a second.

288
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:44,416
I'm... really sorry.

289
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,493
It's over.

290
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,678
It's all over.

291
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:56,237
What the hell? Why am I crying?

292
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:06,765
What the hell? Why am I realizing this now?

293
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:14,940
All of those superficial faces I put on...

294
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,515
The happiness I felt when I was with him...

295
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:33,130
None of that matters. I just don't want to hurt him.

296
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:45,370
That's how much I loved him, and yet...

297
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:44,729
How could I realize this now?

298
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,334
I'm so stupid.

Can we try again?

304
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:48,189
I hate being pitied

It's okay, you'll fall in love with me.
