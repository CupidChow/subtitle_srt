I'd hate to go home now.

171
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:06,462
So you know, let's stay together and...

172
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,552
Then... do you want to come over?

173
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,960
What?

174
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:20,531
Originally, I planned on just going on a date today, but...

175
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,608
Oh, well...

176
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:29,997
I did "that thing" the other day because I'm serious about you.

177
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,908
"That thing"?

178
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:45,601
My... first kiss.

179
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:50,472
I'll take responsibility.

180
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,939
Damn it, he has such a nice face.

181
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,336
That was close!

182
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:04,258
I definitely shouldn't go.

183
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:10,075
Well, I feel really nervous going to your place all of a sudden.

184
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:13,150
Um, maybe next time?

185
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,960
Then, how about a kiss?

186
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,476
What?

187
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:22,443
We're dating, right?

188
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:29,667
A... kiss...

189
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:32,811
It's fine. We're alone here.

190
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,445
I'll wait five seconds.

191
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,145
Five seconds?

192
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:40,945
Five.

193
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:44,422
Four.

194
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,319
W-W-Wait.

195
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,708
No, I can't do this.

196
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,713
Three, two, one.

197
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,720
I'll kiss your lips when you agree.

198
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,262
What?

199
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:13,652
Let's go then.

200
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,710
Um, sure.

201
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:26,069
I could've told him I didn't want to or stayed back.

202
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,447
But I couldn't.

203
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,644
Not only that...

204
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:35,551
But why is my heart racing?

205
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,061
See you at school tomorrow.

206
00:12:46,062 --> 00:12:48,482
Okay, see you tomorrow.

207
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,452
Aren't you going home?

208
00:12:56,453 --> 00:12:59,290
I'll leave after you get inside.

209
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,142
You don't have to.

210
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:04,959
The date ends once your lover gets home, right?

211
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,251
Huh? Why's he treating me like an elementary kid?

212
00:13:14,023 --> 00:13:16,556
Okay, thanks.

213
00:13:16,556 --> 00:13:18,977
- Bye then.
- Bye.

214
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:43,629
I'm happy just being with you.

215
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,120
It all still feels like a dream.

216
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,908
Thank you.

217
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:00,649
This feeling...

218
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,329
[Don't mind kissing a man.]

219
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,985
Wait! What the hell am I doing?

220
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:33,254
The study of psychology... Where do feelings come from?

221
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:36,610
...looks at what kinds of feelings are born from certain scenarios.

222
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:42,762
Psychology also looks at what kind of response is shown.

223
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,352
In our society...

224
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,992
What'd you do over the weekend, Anna?

225
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:50,775
- Work.
- I see.

226
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:55,383
I was so bored. I kept watching Lord Kirari's good luck videos.

227
00:15:55,384 --> 00:16:00,347
Have a happy day, Sparkling Kirarin!

228
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,917
It's fine to have days like that.

229
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,218
No, it's not.

230
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,985
I decided this is the year I'm going to find a boyfriend.

231
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,216
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend, huh?

232
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,673
Don't you want one?

233
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:15,844
Speaking of which, where's Naoya?

234
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,109
I don't have time for studying.

235
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,579
I wonder why isn't he here?

236
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,509
And because of that,

237
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,157
psychology can also help you find a date.

238
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:30,539
It could happen.

239
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,255
What? How does that work? I need to know.

240
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:39,604
- It won't work.
- One technique you can use is...

241
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:45,400
reciprocity of attraction.

242
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:50,141
Reciprocity of attraction?

243
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:55,235
Basically, if you receive affection from someone

244
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:58,516
or feelings of deep love,
[- I like you. / - I like you too.]

245
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:03,030
you also end up feeling attracted to that person.
[I like you.]

246
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:09,708
Basically, this rule states that you want to return feelings of love.
[I like you, too.]

247
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,645
Could it be the same with me?

248
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:19,171
Is he trying to trap me with this reciprocity of attraction?

249
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,449
I'll take responsibility.

250
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,018
We're dating, right?

251
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,358
No, that's not it.

252
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:38,049
I'm the one who caused this misunderstanding.

253
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,974
Hey, Naoya.

254
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:45,255
I was hoping we could stay together always.

255
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,759
Bam!

256
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,803
Endless thoughts of romance.

257
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:56,119
If you can ensnare them into this, it's as good as done.

258
00:17:57,638 --> 00:17:58,886
No way.

259
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:04,390
I'm already trapped by endless thoughts of romance.

260
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:07,439
Kota, what's wrong?

261
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:17,597
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:31,208
- Hey, Kota.
- Oh, hello.

263
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:37,235
- Have you seen Naoya?
- No, not sure. Is he not at school?

264
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:40,386
He's not. He rarely misses class.

265
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,030
And he hasn't texted.

266
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,140
- What is going on there?
- Is that a penguin ?

267
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,353
What's that?

268
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,009
A penguin?

269
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:18,197
Hey, it's Naoya.

270
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:23,418
- Hey, what's with that?
- I won it in a lottery.

271
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:25,476
- Wow.
- What lottery?

272
00:19:25,477 --> 00:19:27,437
Where would you win that?

273
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,128
Does it matter?

274
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,936
Well, you always have the best luck with lotteries.

275
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,737
- Very impressive.
- Is it?

276
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:39,185
- Hey, you missed Professor Kawahara's lecture.
- Oh, right.

277
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,199
- I answered for you during roll call.
- Thank you.

278
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,811
- See you later, Kota.
- See you.

279
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,972
- Bye.
- Bye.

280
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:50,761
You owe us lunch, Naoya.

281
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,582
- Something expensive.
- You owe us.

282
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:57,063
Could that be...

283
00:19:57,063 --> 00:20:00,287
No way, it can't be.

284
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:16,126
Naoya.

285
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:26,409
We're finally alone.

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

287
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,757
I wanted to give this to you.

288
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:38,603
Then does that mean...

289
00:20:38,603 --> 00:20:40,803

All right.

Why go to all that trouble?

Because I want you to be happy.

Oh, it's a bit big. Want me to walk you home with it?

No, it's okay! I can carry it alone.
