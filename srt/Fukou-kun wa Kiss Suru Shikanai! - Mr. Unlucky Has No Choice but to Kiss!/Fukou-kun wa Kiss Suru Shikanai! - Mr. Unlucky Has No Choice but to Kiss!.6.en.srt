1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,290
- That was close.
- You almost caught me.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,530
- Tag! Oh, that was so close.
- You almost had me.

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,349
- I'll surely get you this time.
- No, you won't.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,480
- Whoa!
- So close.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,330
I can't tag you.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,909
Why won't you play with Kota?

7
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:31,119
I told you to play together, right?

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,420
Kota gets hurt too easily.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,300
Teacher, when Kota gets hurt, you always blame us.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,400
Things always go wrong when we're with him.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,750
I bet he's doing it on purpose.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,669
Oh, right.

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,449
Last night, I...

14
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,090
I was lying and taking advantage of you, too.

15
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,259
What?

16
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,099
I've always naturally had bad luck.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,990
But when I'm by your side, all of that goes away.

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,510
I think it's because of your good luck.

19
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,660
Dating you was all an act, too.

20
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,120
I'm sure he hates me now that he knows who I really am.

Please don't let me bump into him.

32
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,170
All clear.

33
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,520
So far, so good.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,380
Itsuki. Minato.

35
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,420
Hey, Naoya, good morning.

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,720
Morning.

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,539
Have you seen Kota?

38
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:11,809
- What? Kota?
- Yeah.

39
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,049
No, not yet.

40
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,329
- Tell me if you see him.
- Sure.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
- Bye.
- See you.

42
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,090
What was that?

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,660
Geez, where did Miki drop it?

44
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,759
- It's not here.
- Hi.

45
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,390
Naoya, good morning.

46
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,000
Morning. Hey, have you seen Kota?

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,420
- No, I haven't.
- I see

48
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,740
You see, Miki dropped her bracelet.

49
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,390
Miki, where did you get the bracelet?

50
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,379
This? It's nice, isn't it?

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,369
These rose quartz stones are for luck with romance.

52
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,170
Have you seen it, Naoya?

53
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,410
I haven't. I'll bring it if I see it.

54
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,919
Thank you. I'll tell you if I see Kota.

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,820
Thanks.

56
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,770
- Hey.
- Naoya!

57
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,329
- Have you seen Kota?
- Have you?

58
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,699
I don't think I have.

59
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,260
Why is he looking for me?

60
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,860
Thanks.

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,270
Could it be he wants to tell me off

62
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,080
because he's mad about my lie?

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,479
You jerk. How dare you lie to me!

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,540
Trash. Idiot. Scum. Dirt.

65
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,010
That'll be rough.

67
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,030
But I deserve it.

68
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,790
I just have to accept it.

69
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,990
I can't find it anywhere.

70
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,079
It's too dangerous around here.

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,150
Not here either.

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,740
It's not here...

73
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,030
There you are, Kota! We found you.

74
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,279
- We were looking for you.
- Good morning.

75
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,699
Why are you stepping back?

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,130
- Are you running away?
- No, I'm not.

77
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,740
- Kota, let me tickle you then.
- I'm not running away.

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,390
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

79
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,530
Don't tell me you hate us.

80
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,650
Where have you been hiding?

81
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,170
There it is!

82
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,009
Kota, stay back!

83
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,489
- Whoa!
- Oh, no!

84
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,399
- Whoa!
- Step back!

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,210
- Step back?
- Wait! Hold on!

86
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,010
- Oh, no!
- Don't! Just step away from there.

87
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,630
Kota!

88
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,830
Safe.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,580
Kota, hey! Wake up!

90
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,229
What's going on?

91
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,939
What is this warm embrace? I feel so safe.

92
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,010
Hey, Kota!

93
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,559
Are you okay? Kota!

94
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,850
Hey, snap out of it!

95
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,550
Kota!

96
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,350
Um, I...

97
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,600
What a relief.

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,390
- I'm sorry.
- What have you done?

99
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,790
- I'm going to punish you.
- Please, don't.

100
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,820
I can't believe you used your friends. That's unfair.

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,540
Come on, I said I'm sorry.

102
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,490
Here you go.

103
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,110
Take it.

104
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,619
What? This isn't funny, you know.

105
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:20,949
No. I'm just happy you're showing me your true self.

106
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,210
Wh...

107
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I had something to tell you.

109
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,269
Then say it already.

110
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,660
Call me a fool, an idiot, trash,

111
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,040
a beetle, or whatever you want.

112
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,330
Is that how you see yourself, Kota?

113
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,680
That's how bad my actions were.

114
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,050
Besides, I...

115
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,420
I wanted

116
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,730
to say thank you.

117
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,000
I was indeed surprised when you got in that fight.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
But his good luck isn't all there is to him!

119
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,269
He's generous enough to share his luck with others.

120
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:10,530
That's why people love him.

121
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,600
It's not something anyone can do.

122
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,800
After all, that guy tried to use me.

123
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,110
I was using you too, though.

124
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,190
Not for anything bad, right?

125
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,890
But...

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,140
No one has ever stuck up for me like that.

127
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,220
You got so riled up for another person. You're amazing.

128
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,710
Thanks.

129
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,699
Th... That's because you...

130
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:52,040
were so kind to me.

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,110
Um, so...

132
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,130
Well, it's because...

133
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,700
you're a nice guy,

134
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,580
and I liked you.

135
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,620
I couldn't forgive them for what they did.

136
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,280
Kota.

137
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,810
Can we try again?

138
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,979
What?

139
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,220
How we met seems to bother you,

140
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,750
but that's what brought you to me

141
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,190
and we're close now.

142
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,060
You're tricking me,

143
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
what you said

144
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,990
and your true self,

145
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,890
I've thought all that through.

146
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,470
If you're okay with it,

147
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,260
I want to get to know you better.

148
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,780
Of course, I'm okay with it.

149
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,250
At first,

150
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,490
I just didn't want to be unlucky.

151
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,790
But now it's different.

152
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,490
It's not about luck anymore.

153
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
I just...

154
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,470
want to be with you.

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,470
I'm really sorry.

156
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,340
Listen. I want to be with you, too.

157
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,260
Thank you.

158
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,540
Here.

159
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,640
Thanks.

160
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,660
Sorry, I'm fine now.

161
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,440
Good.

162
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,500
I'll wash this for you.

163
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,890
So what do we do now?

164
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, it's fine. I won't miss our next class.

165
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,869
Not that.

166
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,939
What?

167
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,660
If we're starting over, do you want to date or be friends?

168
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,329
I... I don't know what to say.

169
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:17,899
This is important. We have to talk it out.

170
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,930
He's so serious.

171
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,610
So, which is it?

172
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,510
Dating...

173
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,860
am I asking for too much?

174
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,200
F... Friends.

175
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,450
Wh... What is it?

176
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,070
I want to date you.

177
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,719
Isn't our next class in here?

178
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,480
I thought it was on the upper floor.

179
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,549
Wait, um...

180
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,750
What he meant was, "I hope I can find a date."

181
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,570
Look at me. I'm serious.

182
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,460
Think about it.

183
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,250
Being friends and boyfriends are completely different.

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,840
Well, I guess so.

185
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,620
I'm only interested in being your boyfriend, not a friend.

186
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,810
That's, um...

187
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,760
It's okay, you'll fall in love with me.

188
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,650
I'll make you look my way.

189
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,610
Don't give up on me just yet.

190
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,340
Make me look your way?

191
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,640
I've already...

192
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,130
fallen for you.

193
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,420
Hey, why do you hide your true self?

194
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,920
There's no point.

195
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,550
It's fine to show yourself to others.

196
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,840
It feels miserable.

197
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,190
Miserable?

198
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:34,070
I hate being pitied when something unlucky happens.

199
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:41,190
And it's annoying when people think I hurt myself on purpose.

200
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,210
I thought about how should I handle this.

201
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,300
So I decided to put a smile on my face,

202
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,869
and say, "I'm fine, it doesn't bother me."

203
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:56,980
No one gets hurt that way, and it's less hassle for me.

204
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,690
That's amazing.

205
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,410
How is that amazing?

206
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,760
I mean, you put in so much effort to get to that point. Right?

207
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,710
What?

208
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,980
I'm falling for you more and more, Kota.

209
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,959
Hey, tell me how to make you fall for me.

210
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,840
You're asking me that?

211
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,399
And that's not really necessary.

212
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,210
I already...

213
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,200
- Kota, don't step there!
- What?

214
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,010
Are you okay?

215
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,970
Yeah, I am.

216
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,270
This was down there.

217
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,550
Oh, I'm pretty sure that's...

218
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,620
It's apparently a power stone for romantic luck.

219
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,980
Maybe this brought us together, too.

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,400
Yeah.

221
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,870
Hey, about what we were just talking about...

222
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,699
What were we talking about?

223
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,409
Hey, you've already forgotten.

224
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,840
You've fallen for me more and more,

225
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,220
so you want to know how to make me fall for you.

226
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,720
Oh, that?

227
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,830
Why'd you make me say it?

228
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,340
I told you it was not funny.

229
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,110
I'm so happy to see the real you.

230
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,200
Stop making fun of me.

231
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,030
So, what'd you want to say?

232
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,090
So, um... I...

233
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:59,130
Well... I mean...

234
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,430
I also...

235
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,020
li...

236
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,590
I like you, Naoya.

237
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,070
Kota, you...

238
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,120
Hey, wait! Kota!

239
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,530
I can't do this!

240
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,069
I can't do this!

241
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,110
- Kota?
- What's up with him?

242
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,500
Naoya, what are you doing here?

243
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,830
And where's Kota?

244
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,990
I don't see him.

245
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,519
Well, I'm glad it went well.

246
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,490
What?

247
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,730
It's written all over your face.

248
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,700
Do you know how long we have been friends?

249
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,099
We met in 10th grade, so... 6 years.

250
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,420
Did you really think we didn't know that?

251
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,499
Oh, right.

252
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,130
- Let's go.
- All right.

253
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:19,110
- We haven't hung out in a while.
- We haven't!

254
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,350
- Let's go somewhere.
- Seriously?

255
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,620
I said it!

256
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,640
I told him I like him!

257
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,870
How should I face him next time we meet up?

258
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,890
But now that I've said it,

259
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,390
it'll be awkward to go to his house tonight.

260
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,550
Hello? This is Kota.

261

What? Is it really?

I'm back, Naoya.
