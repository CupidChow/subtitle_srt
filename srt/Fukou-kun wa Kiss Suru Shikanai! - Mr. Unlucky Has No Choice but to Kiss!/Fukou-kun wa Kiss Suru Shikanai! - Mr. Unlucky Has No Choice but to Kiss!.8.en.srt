I've had all kinds of bad luck ever since I was born.

I'm glad I was able to meet him.

may have been the only good thing in my life.

You over there, please stay back.

00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,713
I wonder who the victim and the robber is.

62
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:40,729
Come out after you've done your time.

63
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,443
Yes, I'll atone for what I've done.

64

Officers, please take her away.

65

Please let them through.

71
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,810
Stay back. Make a way for them.

What? You looked like her first love?

75
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,006
Apparently, we look exactly alike.

76
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,655
You shouldn't do this.

77
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,360
You can always start over.

78
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:35,279
I know you can.

79
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,066
See, you're shaking so much.

80
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:47,273
You're not the type to do something like this.

81
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:04,693
I fell hard for a pop star and wanted to support him.

82
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:08,493
So I needed money.

83
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:15,034
Okay, so the robber listened to Naoya just like that?

84
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:15,966
Yeah.

85
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,267
That's amazing.

86
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,167
You've really got something.

87
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,510
Yeah.

88
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,870
Kota, it was a mishap for you.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,437
But I'm glad you're okay.

90
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:27,110
It could've been so much worse.

91
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,949
Yeah. I guess so.

92
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:35,227
Hey, Naoya, can we talk about next week's seminar?

93
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:35,938
Sure.

94
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:37,812
Thanks.

95
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,079
I'll be right back.

96
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,602
- See you.
- See you.

97
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:51,938
You sure are loved, Kota.

98
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,071
What? Are you flustered?

99
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:01,446
No, not at all.

100
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:04,659
Kota, over here.

101
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:08,354
I've been called over. I'll be back soon.

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,089
You know, Naoya,

103
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,695
when I was taken hostage, I thought my life was over.

104
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:42,153
And at the same time, I really wanted to live more.

105
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,820
Since I was a kid,

106
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:49,539
I always had small instances of bad luck everywhere.

107
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,294
I caused a lot of trouble for people.

108
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,170
I was worried that my bad luck would continue forever.

109
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,811
I really hated it at one point.

110
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:05,563
But ever since I met you,

111
00:09:05,564 --> 00:09:09,626
I realized that I can enjoy my life

112
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:12,345
for the first time.

113
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:15,752
Hey.

114
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,083
Move in with me.

115
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:24,501
What's this all of a sudden?

116
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,411
Well, I'm worried about you.

117
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:33,408
If I'm nearby, you can live a normal life. Right?

118
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:39,827
I don't want you to be in danger like that when I'm not around.

119
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:40,866
So...

120
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:45,269
Oh, don't worry about that.

121
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:48,663
I mean, think about it.

122
00:09:48,664 --> 00:09:51,436
Do you plan on being with me 24/7?

123
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:54,272
It's obviously impossible.

124
00:09:54,273 --> 00:09:56,279
I know, but...

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,555
I'm really happy you're caring for me.

126
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:04,388
But I'm not with you to get rid of my bad luck.

127
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:10,542
And I've been thinking lately

128
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,831
that having bad luck isn't bad.

129
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:19,819
It's thanks to my bad luck that I got to meet you.

130
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:24,870
I'm truly grateful for that.

131
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:31,608
What? Stop staring at me.

132
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:38,451
Well, there's something I've been keeping from you.

133
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,007
What?

134
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,059
You know...

135
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,470
I knew about you before we met.

136
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,679
What? Since when?

137
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,171
The entrance ceremony.

138
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,452
Seriously?

139
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:58,468
To be more exact, on the way home after the ceremony.

140
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,272
- We have the same major.
- Let's hang out one day.

141
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:03,001
Okay! Of course, let's hang out.

142
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,897
What a breath of fresh air.

143
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,912
At first, you caught my attention because I liked your face.

144
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,811
You liked my face?

145
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,772
But that wasn't all.

146
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,459
Be more careful!

147
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,344
Okay, I will! I'm sorry!

148
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:26,038
Who the hell are you telling to be careful?

149
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:28,641
Don't you know the law, you bastard?

150
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:34,146
That sudden change in your attitude made me fall hard for you.

151
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:38,347
Then I got more and more curious about you.

152
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:43,053
You were always cautious and stayed at a distance from others.

153
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:44,896
You kept shallow relationships

154
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:48,800
to avoid getting too involved with people.

155
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,677
It reminded me of myself.

156
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:56,031
What? How does that remind you of yourself?

157
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:00,787
You have super good luck and I have bad luck.

158
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,990
We're complete opposites.

159
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:08,186
People always wanted something from me because of my good luck.

160
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,513
Some even tried to use me.

161
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,560
I mean, Naoya is guaranteed to get the tickets.

162
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:17,670
You're only interested in his good luck.

163
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:23,201
You always manage to get the tickets, so they used you

164
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:25,061
for a profit.

165
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:27,513
After seeing you,

166
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:32,718
I realized that I avoided deep relationships with people, too.

167
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:36,922
You and I are the same.

168
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,349
That's why I was happy

169
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,328
when you called me out.

170
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:46,184
Excuse me...

171
00:12:46,185 --> 00:12:48,072
Hey, it's you, Kota.

172
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:52,578
Can I talk to Naoya for a second?

173
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:54,775
- Naoya?
- Sure.

174
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,693
So, at that point, you already...

175
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:03,404
Of course, I knew your real personality.

176
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:07,131
I was wondering if we could tour the place together.

177
00:13:07,132 --> 00:13:08,256
Sure thing.

178
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,365
Really? I'm so glad.

179
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,720
You were happy just being with me.

180
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,828
It broke evenly!

181
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:20,746
And even the smallest things brightened up your eyes.

182
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:22,847
Really?

183
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:27,210
When I saw you like that, your happiness spread to me.

184
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:30,904
And you looked for me...

185
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:32,964
Naoya!

186
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:44,180
I'm so glad I found you.

187
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,755
Nobody had ever looked at me with such eyes before.

188
00:13:55,586 --> 00:14:00,152
So I was certain that you'd never stand me up.

189
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:04,949
I got worried that something happened.

190
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:09,014
Hello? Do you know where Kota lives?

191
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:23,914
So when you showed up at the meeting place...

192
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:26,806
I'm really sorry.

193
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,841
I was relieved that you were okay.

194
00:14:32,842 --> 00:14:37,683
Then, you were looking for me that whole time?

195
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:46,730
The time we spent together made me like you even more,

196
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,324
so I was fine with whatever reason you had for approaching me.

197
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:58,013
But then you said that...

198
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:02,521
Naoya, I have something else I want to talk about.

199
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:06,104
I was hoping we could stay together always.

200
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,507
I was really happy.

201
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,975
Even as fake boyfriends,

202
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:15,904
I was content with just seeing your happy face.

203
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:20,852
No, we aren't fake boyfriends.

204
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:27,271
I told you, my bad luck isn't why I'm with you.

205
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:32,116
I'm with you because I really like you.

206
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:37,236
So just stay with me and be my boyfriend like you wanted.

207
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:46,769
Oh, I, um...

208
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:53,701
Hey, I told you it's not funny!

209
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,919
Hey, don't laugh.

210
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,720
- Don't laugh.
- Say it again.

211
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,619
- No way!
- Just say it!

212
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,920
- I don't want to. You say it then.
- Why do I have to?

213
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,600
- I won't say it.
- Just smile for me then.

214
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:13,572
Hey, Naoya, what is this?

215
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,061
You didn't win the ticket? For real?
[Sorry, you did not win the ticket.]

216
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:18,592
Wow, that's rare.

217
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:21,467
You were so famous for your 100% success rate.

218
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,014
This has been happening a lot lately.

219
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:29,580
Maybe you did something to make your luck disappear.

220
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,283
- Didn't you?
- What happened?

221
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,886
Could it be... my fault?

222
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,200
Tell us what happened. Don't you find it too odd?

223
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,020
- Nothing happened.
- Are you sure?

224
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:47,319
Kota, do you want to go on a date again?

225
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,952
Sure.

226
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:54,383
Oh, but if you're with me...

227
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,249
Remember earlier?

228
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,874
Maybe your luck is disappearing because you're with me.

229
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,850
Sorry, if that's the case.

230
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,860
Don't apologize.

231
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,655
Rather than something invisible like luck,

232
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:10,729
being with you is far more important to me.

233
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,858
Thank you.

234
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:21,413
Yeah. Then let's spend the night somewhere next time.

235
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:23,214
Sure.

236
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:28,124
See you tomorrow.

237
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,642
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

238
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:49,225
I'm a bit lonely going home alone without Naoya.

239
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,960
But I want to move in

240
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:58,349
only when we really want to live together one day.

241
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:03,194
Until then, no matter what bad luck comes my way,

242
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:06,918
I think I can be optimistic and overcome it all.

243
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:15,731
After all, I have Naoya now.

244
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,741
Hey, there.

245
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:52,554
I heard your breaker exploded. Sounds awful.

246
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,499
This is so exhausting.

247
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,895
Well, I'm glad you're not hurt.

248
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:00,226
And you can stay here until it's fixed.

249
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:04,562
Oh, I'm just staying one night.

250
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:07,452
What? Really?

251
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:10,567
I thought you were coming back.

252
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:18,561
Oh, I wasn't thinking it at all

253
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:20,919
when I called Naoya.

254
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:28,007
Oh, I didn't want to rely too much on you.

255
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:29,881
I've already told you this.

256
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:33,176
It makes me happy when you rely on me.

257
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:47,143
Then... Then please...

258
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:50,920
let me stay at your place for a while.

259
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,522
Of course.

260
00:20:04,281 --> 00:20:06,036
It's heavy, right? Come in.

261
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:10,308
Okay, thanks for letting me stay.

262
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:22,194
Even though I was experiencing bad luck at the moment,

263
00:20:22,195 --> 00:20:25,119
I felt lucky.

264
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:32,865
Hey, where's your air mattress from last time?

265
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:36,030
Oh, I punctured a hole when I folded it up,

266
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:37,983
so we can't use it anymore.

267
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:41,416
Wait! Is it because I used it?

268
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,188
But thanks to that, we can sleep together like this.

269
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:48,646
So close.

270
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,991
Don't worry, I won't do anything.

271
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:54,991
You won't?

272
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:58,794
What? Can I?

273
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:03,041
No, that's not what I...

274
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:06,755
Good night, Kota.

275
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:10,550
Good night.

276
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,833
No way, I can't believe we're sleeping in the same bed.

277
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Are you asleep?

278
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,955
Yeah.

279
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:35,341
You're awake. Why are you lying?

280
00:21:36,781 --> 00:21:39,136
Just because...

281
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:43,280
And why the hell would you ask if I'm sleeping?

282
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:46,204
How am I supposed to sleep?

283
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:05,294
And I woke up that morning after an uneventful night.

284
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:21,566
It seems Naoya will wait until I feel more comfortable.

285
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,768
But I do feel a bit unsatisfied.

You just woke me up.
