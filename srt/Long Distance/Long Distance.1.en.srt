00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,710
Team Leader, I am not that close with James,
also it is not that easy to negotiate with him.

169
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,030
Now please go! I have to work.

Roses are great. And it's used the most for red rose.
Then please prepare me a large bunch of red roses.

They’re awesome!

334
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,360
I’m so glad that you are a florist!

335
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,590
But I must be nervous, I’ve got indigestion.

336
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,400
Eh! Do-ha Oppa, don’t be so nervous.

337
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,880
Anyway, thank you!

338
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,680
Without you I would have been in trouble.

339
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,480
Later let’s have a nice dinner with Tae-in.

340
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,150
Alright, Propose well! I’ll send these flowers later, on time.

341
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,260
You’re the only one we can count on!

342
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,340
It’s not a big deal, then I’ll hang up!

343
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,000

351
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,710
Today is Halloween!

352
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,640
There’s someone who wants to meet you,
whose young and rich.

353
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:32,560
She has a few buildings, she saw you in our last live,
thinks you are cute and wants to meet you.

354
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,980
Even I don’t meet her often. If you meet her, it will be nice, I think.

355
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,710
I’m Sorry, but today is the anniversary and I planned to be with my girlfriend, so I can’t go.

356
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,630
Oh no dude!

357
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,030
Also, the musician friend, I told you about, is also coming today.

361
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,930
Ah wait! It’s really an important date with my girlfriend today, so I can’t go.

362
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,330
What a disappointment!

363
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,470
Hey Do-ha, I told that girl that you’re going to come,

364
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,900
And if you don’t come, I’ll be embarrassed, right?

365
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,050
But…

366
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,720
Also, isn’t this a nice opportunity for you as well?

367
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,260

It’s an important day for us today, I can’t!

382
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,020
Aha! It’s not like we are new a couple.

383
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,900

384
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,240

What's the problem? It's just a crazy party.OK?

520
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,990
You might think it's just a prank, but for me,

521
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,970
what if my GF watches it?

522
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,440
I'll be dead! I'm going crazy!! And, that video…

523
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,870
Do-ha, calm down!
-I maybe fired, too!

524
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,600
Hmm…The video that was uploaded on my SNS was reported and got deleted.

525
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,560
But, the things others upload on their SNS, I'm not able to delete.

526
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,200
It's not my ID, how can I delete it? Right?

527
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,600
But,who uploaded that video? And in that video,

528
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,560
there's Lady Gaga, who's that person?

529
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,710
I've no idea.She received a friend request.

530
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,190
Someone might have sent the request, isn't it?

531
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,980
She also didn't know who it was.

532
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
She just received the request.

533
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm going insane.

534
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,800
Wait a minute, it was your party,right!

535
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:35,710
Person who sent the request might be among the people you invited to your party.

536
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,200
Go after all the people you invited and find out who it was, right this moment.

How is this flower? Huh? Mmm…so smelly.

573
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,250
What's with this nonsense?

574
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,510
You said you didn't know who uploaded the video?

575
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,510
You said you didn't know that person, Ga-eun or whatever!

576
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,530
Are you sure she clicked the video? Of Course I didn't know.

577
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:26,330
Yesterday she said she wanted to see you. Didn't you remember?

578
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:28,640
Let's not talk about that!

579
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,360
Ask that Ga-eun to take that video down immediately.

580
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,110
Otherwise, I'll report a complaint. She's..

581
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,000
Oh shit!!

582
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,430
-She's not seeing my DMs.

583
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:48,250
Do-ha, she's completely…lunatic. Complete psycho!

584
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,480
You got it? Yeah, but she's kinda cute.

585
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,750

Hello.

591
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,990
Is it Miss Ga-eun?The person who uploaded my video?

592
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,860
Yes, you are right. Your followers suddenly went up,right?

593
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,220
There's no need for the long talk,

594
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,280
please delete the video right now!

595
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,680
Yes? Why are you doing this to me?

596
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,530
You asked me for a favour, so I uploaded it.

597
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,840
Are you getting mad at me right now?

598
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,300
Me?

599
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,720
You're right.

600
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,910
But still you should not have uploaded that video,yes?

601
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:51,500
Yes but, I did that to help you. I'm too upset.

602
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,100
Okay, I understand. First delete that video.

603
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,220
You make it like I'm the wrong one here.

604
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,160
It's so unfair. I'll not delete the video.

605
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,300
What,what did you say?

606
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,920
I'll continue to see you getting mad, then I'll decide!

607
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,080
Hey,wait…

608
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:19,020
OK, I already gave you the warning. She's a total nutcase.

609
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,600
And unlike me, she's a lot of followers.

610
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,080
If Ga-eun personally gives out your number,

611
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,690
either you get famous OR your life is ruined.

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,230
Tae-in, I'm the wrong one here.

661
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:41,880
Even if we meet, what'll it change? You did it last time too,

662
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,430
you were busy somewhere but said it was your mother and made a fuss about it.

663
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,680
You weren't like this before.

664
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:58,270
That's because you keep trying not to listen to me. That's that.

665
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,040
After that, when I went to Geoje Island, we lost contact. Isn't it?

666
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,100
And, now about the party, I really didn't want to go,

667
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,760
but I went because I heard a famous record producer was coming

668
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,800
and I wanted to introduce him to you.

669
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,480
I thought you might like it. That's why I went there.

670
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,690
Listen,Lee Do-ha, stop making excuses. You went because you wanted to.

671
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,760
I wasn't the only one who wanted to be nice.

672
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,010
Tae-in, please,try to understand.

673
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,270
Didn't you go to do business?

674
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,250
What? Why are you saying like that?

675
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,000
Did I just go there to be nice?
What's good for me is also good for you,

676
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
so you can enjoy music comfortably.

677
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,010
Comfortably??  You did it for me?

678
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,480
When did I ask you to do that?

679
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,480
I've no idea why you are talking that way.

680
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:03,080
Hey, to be honest, we'll be 30 soon.

681
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,680
We can't live in such an unstable way. We should at least

682
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,490
do something so that you can do music comfortably and I can also live a decent life.

683
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,350
When did someone push you to earn money? I don't need that much!

684
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:21,880
Huh? You don't need it?

685
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,060
Tae-in's resume

686
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,500
Tae-in, you don't need it, so why did you secretly apply for part-time jobs?

687
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,130
Hey, Tae-in,

688
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:43,520
there’s no way this could work properly
while working part-time and leaving your music behind.

689
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,280
That's why I told you to tell me if you have any difficulties.

690
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,670
What if I told you?

691
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,950
You'd have definitely said to leave the part-time job and focus on my music.

692
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,630
Hey, are you curious about what I'm thinking about?

693
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,260
You would have judged what I needed and what I wanted to do.

694
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,560
Doing music or not is a matter for me to decide.

695
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,340
Then quit it! Why are you still doing it?

696
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:14,190
Tae-in, no one will say anything when you say you quit.

697
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,540
Old days were good.

698
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,030
Don't you think so?

699
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,270
You are a jerk. Let's stop right here.

700
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,500
What did you say? Hey, Tae-in!

701
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,660
What? Did she block me?

702
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,170

-I feel like I've spoken words emotionally without even realising.

705
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,530
-It's all my fault.
-I really regret saying all that to you.
-We've been doing well for 5 years.

-I beg you. I don't want to end everything with you like this.

724

Oh yeah, all thanks to you. Thank you!

Got nothing to say? I'm hanging up.

726
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:32,510
Oh,wait,wait, Do-ha. Let's not talk online.

727
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,450
And shall we meet up, huh?

728

What's this? You did some shopping? Why is the box so huge?

729
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,620
Hey! Do-ha,what is it? What happened?

730
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,040
It seems I really broke up.

731
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:18,730
She has sent all the presents back that I bought for her.

732
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:24,460
Ohhh! That's not cool! I mean,

733
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,280
you both are weird, but watching you guys is so funny.

734
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,210
She's really bad.

735
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:47,520
OH..Love is pain. You just have to take it.

736
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,340
Oh, this too? Really bad, she's the worst!!

737
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:58,650
Aaee!!! It's noisy. Bro, is this a phone?
- It hurts so hard.

738
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,380
You gave her a phone too? God!!!

739
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,760
Yes.

740
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:13,320

Nice to meet you all! Today's weather is outstanding. Isn't it?

785

-Tae-in is cheating with the writer?
-Is it real?

805
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:26,660
You’re the one who was actually cheating.

806
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:26,670
This is too much, Tae-in.
You’re the one who was actually cheating.

807

-Pathetic

809
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:32,040
It’s a bit disgusting, Tae-in.
-Is this real? -I’m so disappointed.
-Pathetic

810

Let’s talk about this peacefully, okay?

Since when were you doing this to me?

820
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,020
This jerk…

821
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,770
James TV Party guy, causing panic in a book-talk conference

822
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:50,490
Was it fun treating me like a pushover?

823
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,820
James Han

824
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,360
What is it?

825
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:32,360
Hey, Do-ha.

826
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,360
I’m eating.

827
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,430
You’re also bragging about eating lunch now?

828
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,040
Oh, no.

829
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,040
I’m just eating.

830
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,920
I wanted to introduce you to a big client.

831
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,310
Head over here immediately.

832
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:47,370
I’ll introduce you.

833
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:49,980
Fine.

834
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,300
I should continue working hard.

835
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:53,880
I’ll be right there.
Wait for me.

836
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,210
Okay.

837
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,800
Hi, guys. It’s James time.

838
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:14,040
Today, ‘Party guy’ will be here with us again for ‘Love Signal’.

839
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,610
Let’s start right now.

840
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:20,980
‘Party guy’ is here.

841
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,240
Where’s James Han?

842
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,340
Ah, okay.

843
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,850
Perhaps, where’s James..?

844
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:34,940
Please have a seat.

845
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,240
But…

846
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:41,280
Where is he?

847
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:50,120
Right now, he’s waiting for someone.

848
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:52,030
Right then…

849
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,720
Oh?

850
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,370
Hello.

851
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,360
Ga-eun, why…?

852
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,340
-Why is Ga-eun there?  -Gosh. She’s so pretty.
-So pretty.

853
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:09,000
-What is she doing there?
Wait a minute.

854
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,430
-Not ‘Party guy’, please.
Wait a minute.

855
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:12,930
-Not ‘Party guy’, please.

856
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,730
He’s calling but I’m won’t answer.

857
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,540
What is this?

858
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,750
Well, I wanted to buy a car.

859
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:35,230
I also sent you a DM to apologize but you weren’t reading them.

860
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,400
So, I planned this lunch with James.

861
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:42,540
Is this how you apologize?

862
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,370
I’m sorry.

863
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,160
But…

864
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,550
Can’t you go out with me?

865
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:52,430
What?

866
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,280
Don’t waste your feelings on someone who already moved on.

867
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,890
Do you know you’re bullying as you are the client?

868
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:05,530
Even the excellent ones got clients who hang on them would complain it like this.

869
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,100
Just relax.

870
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:10,640
Let’s just have some fun.
Excuse me.

871
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,960
You can go and hang out with James.

872
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,830
You’re on the same level.

873
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:22,380
James doesn’t even have the spirit of hunger.

874
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:25,680
Look at yourself.

875
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,830
You work hard while dating.

876
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,480
That’s impressive.

877
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,140
I like that.

878
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:40,400
Please stand up.

879
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:41,350
I said stand up.

880
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,590
-Definitely scripted. -He looks sexy when he’s mad.
I said stand up.

881
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,850
-Definitely scripted. -He looks sexy when he’s mad.

882
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:45,870
Hey.

883
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,110
Am I a joke to you?

884
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:49,260
Is that it?

885
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,660
Why are you working so hard, Do-ha?

886
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:20,970
I should be.

899
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,110
Hi, Tae-in.

900
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,360
It’s our 5-year anniversary.

901
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:04,600
We’ve spent 5 seasons together.
Time is quickly passing by.

902
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:13,240
On the day I saw you busking, the day that first talked to me,

903
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:18,340
our first date, and even when we first fought,

904
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:19,550
Angry

905

Angry

906
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,050
Stop shooting

907
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:26,720
every moment of it is precious.

908
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:45,770
Thank you that I was able to meet you when you performed on the street that day.

909
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,050
Although I’ve been nagging you a lot lately, just know that…

910
01:09:52,190 --> 01:10:02,920
Even when we’re far apart,
I will always love and support you no matter what.

911
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,240
I want to be someone that you can always rely on.

912
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,110
It might not be enough, but I’ll do my best.

01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,320
Will you marry me?
Tae-in…

916
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,440
Will you marry me?
Will you marry me?

What’s this?

924
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,810
Hi, Do-ha.

925
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,340
Today is May 24th.

926
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,620
I know you think that I’m in Geoje but
I had to do something in Seoul.

927
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,410
Right now, I’m at the Han River.

928
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:50,160
-What?

929
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,580
I have something embarrassing to share but it’s being resolved.

930
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:59,020
You can’t be mad when I tell you later, okay?

931
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:04,320
I didn’t want it to bother you because you’re busy with work recently.

932
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,510
Do-ha…

933
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,830
My dream was to become an amazing musician.

934
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:24,220
But recently, I just wanted to be someone that you can be proud of.

935
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,710
This is cringy.

936
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,070
Anyway, Do-ha…

937
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,180
I think you’re so busy nowadays.

938
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,770
But my boyfriend is so cool.

939
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,780
I will be hiding this video carefully as a surprise.

940
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:50,430
I think you’ll like it once you find this.

941
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,080
I hope you can this quickly.

942
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,530
Bye.

943
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,000
Wait a minute.

944
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,420
I have something embarrassing to share but it’s being resolved.

945
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,420
What embarrassing for?

946
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,540
Oh, wait.

This is the last time.

959

Ah-young FaceTime

962
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:50,760
Hey, Ah-young.

963
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,190
Something is troubling Tae-in, right?

964
01:15:55,530 --> 01:15:57,610
She’s just not telling me.

965
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,030
You two broke up anyway.

966
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:00,940
It’s better that you don’t know.

967
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,230
She wouldn’t also like it.

968
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,950
I know we broke up.

969
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,320
But don’t you think I should know?

970
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:21,690
She got scammed.

971
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,200
Scammed?

972
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,470
Hey.

973
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,150
Was it that someone named ‘Beat wildcat’?

974
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:40,110
I found some files on her laptop and it’s not Tae-in’s music style.

975
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,810
After Se-hee left, she lost her job, too.

976
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:50,700
She got tricked into producing a song
but she was only used as a ghostwriter.

977
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,620
When she complained and wanna to stop, they told her to pay the penalty.

978
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,610
How much?

979
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:01,340
They told her to pay 50million won.

980
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,840
I also helped her find a lawyer but she signed that contract so…

981
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,960
Why didn’t she just tell me?

982
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:13,600
Do-ha…

983
01:17:13,930 --> 01:17:16,060
You were also busy then.

984
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:25,310
Honestly, she wanted to tell you but there wasn’t a right timing.

985
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:29,560
She didn’t want to be a burden to you.

986
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,720
I don’t know what to do now.

987
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,440
No, it’s okay.

988
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:42,240
You two broke up anyway.

989
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,320
Let’s hang up for now.

990
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:09,700
-I’m sorry, Tae-in.. I just woke up.

991
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,980
-You’re so mean
-I told you yesterday that I wanted to tell you something.

992
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,580
-I got drunk entertaining the clients. I’m sorry. I fell asleep right away.

993
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,620
-Fine. I can’t do anything about that. How’s your stomach?

994
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:22,630
-Do-ha. Are you busy? I want to tell you something.

995
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,650
-Sorry. We’re having a company dinner. Have a talk with Ah-young first.
-Do-ha. Are you busy? I want to tell you something.

996
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:25,470
-Sorry. We’re having a company dinner. Have a talk with Ah-young first.

997
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,240
-Doha.. I miss you so much today.

998
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,850
-Why? Did something happen?

999
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,690
-Nothing..

1000
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,560
I’m a fool.

1001
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:53,980
-Doha… You’re always on my side, right?

1002
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,320
-What? Of course!

1003
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:01,960
-Then that’s enough.

1004
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:17,270
James Han(SS)

1005
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,100
Hey, James.

1006
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,510
It’s been a while.

1007
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,680
I haven’t been on SNS recently.

1008
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,350
I was busy.

1009
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:31,770
Oh, you were busy.

1010
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:35,280
By any chance…

1011
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,850
Do you like Ga-eun?

1012
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,080
That psycho? Did you eat something bad?

1013
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:49,690
Your face looked uncomfortable when I watched the video.

1014
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,360
Am I right?

1015
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,310
That you like Ga-eun?

1016
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,810
If not, can I go out with her?

1017
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:02,320
That’s on you. Why are you asking me?

1018
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,600
From what I can see…

1019
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:08,920
I think Ga-eun is interested in you.

1020
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,800
You didn’t know, right?

1021
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:17,660
When we were talking at the restaurant, she kept checking your reaction.

1022
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:21,210
Try calling her and ask her out.

1023
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:23,880
No. I’m not interested.

1024
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,800
I don't even have the spirit of hunger.

1025
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:31,450
Hey, Han Bok-dong.

1026
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,380
Have you dated before?

1027
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:37,050
Huh. You were acting all tough.

1028
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:37,710
Hey!

1029
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,820
Until when are you going to live like that?

1030
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,680
Why are you calling me that?

1031
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,460
Why?

1032
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,360
That’s the unique name your parents gave you!

1033
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,200
-Right, Bok-dong? -I hate that name so much.
-Stop it! -You’re wasting your name.

1034
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:02,380
Bok-dong, you have to tell someone
you like them even if you get dumped.

1035
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:05,040
What are you talking about?

1036
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,220
I also just want to do everything that I can.

1037
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,340
So…

1038
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:15,150
Why are you not throwing any party?

1039
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,360
I’m the popular ‘Party guy’ on your channel
but why are you not throwing me any?

1040
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:26,680
Well, I can just go and seduce Ga-eun if you don’t throw one.

1041
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:33,050
Hey! I know her type and it’s not you, honestly.

1042
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,250
You jerk!

1043
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,050
Fine.

1044
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,160
You know ‘Beat wildcat’, right?

1045
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:46,670
I wanted to meet that jerk… I mean guy.

1046
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,410
Please introduce me to him.

1047
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:52,510
People always come when you invite them.

1048
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,120
Hey, a lot of people watches your channel because of me.

1049
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,360
You can do that much, right?

1050
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,200
Lee Do-ha.

1051
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,750
You’re really acting strange.

1052
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,570
Did you know why I invited you?

1053
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:09,070
It’s not because of Ga-eun.

1054
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,890
Then what?

1055
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:15,720
Is it fun seeing people talk?

1056
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:19,160
I don’t think you remember.

1057
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:33,540
You were the only one who stood up for me
when other kids were bullying me in 6th grade.

1058
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:37,860
I got stuck in my mind.

1059
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,890
You’re the only one who knows me as that Bok-dong.

1060
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:47,390
Everyone else only know me for James Han, SS Class, right?

1061
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:58,570
Anyway, I’ll do that for you since I keep
thinking all of this happened because me.

1062
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:01,900
Hang up. I’m busy.

1063
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,750
X-MAS Live broadcasting will start soon

1064
01:23:07,770 --> 01:23:12,560
We’re having a Christmas Eve party.

1065
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:17,370
You’ll soon meet that person you’ve always wanted to see again.

1066
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:21,390
You’re curious as to what ‘Party guy’ will do this time.

1067
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,570
Oh, ‘Party guy’.

1068
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,220
Hello, everyone.

1069
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,920
About what you said last time, I apologize for that.

1070
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,180
I’ll apologize. I’m sorry.

1071
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:40,840
Never mind, I'm sorry, too.

1072
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,530
Are we really friends now?

1073
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:46,590
Look at this.

1074
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:53,560
‘My friend Bok-dong’

1075
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,490
His real name is Bok-dong Han.

1076
01:23:59,040 --> 01:23:59,660
-Damn it. -Hey, pal.

1077
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:05,080
A new identification, Han Bok-dong.

1078
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:05,900
He’s here.
A new identification, Han Bok-dong.
A new identification, Han Bok-dong.

1079
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,230
Just in time.

1080
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:12,820
Hey, 'Beat wildcat', what's up?

1081
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,490
Is it 'Beat wildcat'?

1082
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,480
Someone really wanted to meet you.

1083
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:23,630
Is he the one you mentioned last time?

1084
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:24,570
The car dealer?

1085
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:26,270
You're trying to introduce him to someone?

1086
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,370
No, he broke up with his ex.

1087
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,660
Hey, Do-ha.

1088
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,650
Why did you want to see me?

1089
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,680
I bought a new car recently.

1090
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,970
I’m ‘Beat wildcat’, Choi Chul-hee.

1091
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:47,400
I’m also not here to offer you a car.

1092
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,470
Goodness.

1093
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:53,120
A genius’ grip sure feels different.

1094
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,850
Oh, wait. Let me get some of that strength, too.

1095
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:56,510
What is this?

1096
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:57,840
War of nerves.

1097
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,630
Guy battle.

1098
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:06,360
I’m Do-ha Lee, Kim Tae-in’s manager.

1099
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:11,000
Tae-in Kim? Who’s that?

1100
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,150
You don’t know?

1101
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:15,920
Your memory is kind of weak.

1102
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:19,720
If you scam people, you should have a good memory, you jerk!

I’m sorry.

01:26:44,260 --> 01:26:52,390
Don’t give up on music.

1120
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:59,940
You know that I have good music taste, right?

1121
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:04,990
Take care.

1122
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:12,450
Bye.

I enjoyed listening to your music.

Let’s give a hand of applause to ‘Into Space’ for being here with us.

1138
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:02,060
In my opinion, the lyrics…

1139
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,980
Lyrics?
In my opinion, the lyrics…

1140
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:06,150
Not crying
‘Disappear like smoke’…

1141
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:10,440
It kinda sounds like an old song…

1142
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,450
I thought you were having problems excavating a land…

1143
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:14,490
Isn’t it more sentimental?

1144
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,490
Counterattack
Isn’t it more sentimental?

1145
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,160
Sentimental…

1146
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:18,410
What
Sentimental…
What

1147
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:19,620
Oh, okay.
What
Oh, okay.
Just stick to it, then.

The fourth attack
Just stick to it, then.

Stop is...
The fourth attack
Just stick to it, then.

No, no.
By the way, you’re not offended, right?

1152

Not in a bad mood.
No, no.

1153
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:27,670
Not in a bad mood.
This is just an interview concept. We have to do this to gain more subscribers.

Hello, this is ‘Party guy’.

1162
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:16,860
Just like what we did before, It’s guerilla interview day.
Once I hear nice music, I will approach them right after.

1163
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,880
There’s nothing attracting my ears yet.

1164
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,820
Too famous now.

1165
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:42,270

You’re handsome.

1170
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:53,260

Do you hear what I hear?

01:31:08,970 --> 01:31:10,350
I think it sounds good.

1176
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,280
Shall we go closer?

1177
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:34,990
This is…

1178
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,420
Hello, I’m musician, Tae-in Kim.

1179
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,280
Are you ‘Party guy’?

1180
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:51,640
Are you not going to interview me?

1181
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:56,150
-What’s her name??? -Musician Tae-in Kim
-Is this scripted? -He recognized her

1182
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,660
PD, cut!

1183
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:08,620
Live broadcast has ended

1184
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:18,130
‘We’re back here by Tae-in Kim’

1185
01:32:25,370 --> 01:32:28,810
‘It’s really been a long time.’
this lonely word that echoes deep in my heart

1186

1189
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:36,480
Preparing…

1190
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:40,360
Goodness. I almost couldn’t upload it.

1191
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:41,930
Tae-in!

1192
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,020
What are you doing?

1193
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,970
It’s almost time to go live.

1194
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:45,850
Hurry up!

1195
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:49,880
Let me just set up more things.

1196
01:32:54,990 --> 01:32:56,840
Should we just do mukbangs?

1197
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,390
I think it’ll suit you better.

1198
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,760
Do you want to die?

1199
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,290
We’re about to start.

1200
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:08,520
We’re going to sing the CM song to celebrate your channel for having 100 thousand subscribers today.

1201
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:09,960
Really irritating.

1202
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,120
Why are you asking the artist to do things I don’t want to do as a manager?!

1203
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,810
If you do what I ask, we’ll immediately reach 150 thousand!

1204
01:33:17,150 --> 01:33:22,880
Also, next week we’ll be meeting James, the Seoul Collection Music Director!

1205
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,460
So, you are so strict now.

1206
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:30,080
I thought you’d like it.

1207
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:30,830
Should I cancel?
We can cancel.

1208
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,750
Are you crazy?
It’s a lot of money.

1209
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,190
I’ve already received something from him.

1210
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,550
Wait a sec.

1211
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,100

You can just go to his channel, right?

1227
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:20,210
-I’m a newbie. What’s your relationship status?

1228
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,880
Do-ha is my manager, PD and CEO.

1229
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,240
He does everything.

1230
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,810
-Are you dating 'Party guy’? -Are you back together?
-They probably are dating again.

1231
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:34,810
‘Are we dating?’

1232
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:39,160
I don’t know.

1233
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,770
Okay. We’ll be the candles after counting to three.

1234
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:46,780
Are you ready?

1235
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:48,540

What are you doing?

1238
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:59,070
It’s delicious.

1239
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,250
Where did you buy this?
The cake…

1240
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,180
We should take it again.

1241
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,070
What?
Are you mad?

1242
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,480
Just because of the whipping cream? I will wipe it for you.
