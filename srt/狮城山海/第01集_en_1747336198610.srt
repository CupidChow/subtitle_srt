We have the best cakes.

6
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,660
We're selling cakes.

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,660
Bring some cakes back to the night market.

8
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,660
You're tired, right?

9
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,660
I've been waiting for you for years.

10
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm waiting for you to be done.

11
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,660
Don't touch me.

12
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Come on.

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
Hit me.

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,660
Hit me.

15
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,660
Hit me.

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,660
How is your daughter?

17
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,660
She's not well.

18
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,660
She's crying.

19
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,660
Huile.

20
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,660
She's still so young.

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,660
What should we do?

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,660
Didn't you call the police?

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,660
I did before.

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,660
I did call the police.

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,660
But the police didn't care.

26
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Why?

27
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
That bastard.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,660
He's doing business with foreigners.

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,660
He's hiding in the car.

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,660
How could the police care about him?

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,660
So I had to come to beg you.

32
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,660
At the market,

33
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
only the three pirates

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,660
could pay for our suffering.

35
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,660
Chief, we've found out everything.

36
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,660
Everything is true?

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Yes.

38
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
Where is he?

39
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,660
He's with two of the officers of Feng Yun Hall.

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,660
He's a good drinker.

41
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
He drinks like water.

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Then let him drink enough.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,660
Officer Sili Wen and I

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,660
went to the second floor of the Lai Po Hotel.

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,660
That's a foreign bar.

46
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
There are a lot of foreigners here.

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,660
They don't wear much.

48
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
You can make friends with foreigners.

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
That's great.

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,660
We can't miss any brothers in the future.

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,660
That's easy to say.

52
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,660
At that time, Sili Wen gave me a snowman.

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
I stole one.

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,660
It's stinky.

55
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,660
Chief, I didn't bring any men.

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,660
You don't have to do this.

57
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,660
You can do it yourself.

58
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
I'm not a thief.

59
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm a man.

60
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm a man.

61
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm a man.

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
I'm a man.

63
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,660
I'm a man.

64
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,660
I'm a man.

65
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm a man.

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,660
I'm a man.

67
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,660
I'm a man.

68
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,660
I'm a man.

69
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,660
You don't have to do this.

70
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,660
Chief, enough.

71
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,660
Give it to me and Qi.

72
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
I have to kill him.

73
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
I've been watching the girl who bullied me grow up.

74
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I've been watching the girl who bullied me grow up.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,660
She's selling cakes in the West.

76
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,660
She's earning money to support her siblings.

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
She's a good girl.

78
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
She's only 17 this year.

79
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,660
Chief.

80
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
Chief.

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,660
A'Fa.

82
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
The doctor who treated me last time was good.

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Let him treat that girl.

84
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
No matter how much it costs, he has to treat me.

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,660
Yes, Chief.

86
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
She was thankful to God.

87
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
Director...

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,700
Oh,

89
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,700
then you guys check it out.

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Zhigao.

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Answer me.

92
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Did you kill this person?

93
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,700
You're so annoying.

94
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Look at that kid. He's so big. How dare he hit me?

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
I...

96
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
What do you want?

97
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
You're a police officer.

98
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I'm a son, so I'm a police officer.

99
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Zhendong,

100
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
this is not a joke.

101
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Chief, you're wrong.

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
The kid is a police officer now.

103
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,700
How can he hit me?

104
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm wrong?

105
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
You're wrong.

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,700
If you're wrong, I apologize.

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Liu.

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Zhendong,

110
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
take off your coat.

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
Let me see the joke.

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
All right.

113
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
All right.

114
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Son, come on.

115
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Zhigao.

116
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Don't think I don't know where this cake came from.

117
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
You killed the enemy for him.

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
He hit Guo Gao

119
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,740
to repay you.

120
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,740
I didn't want this cake.

121
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,740
But that girl kowtows at the door of Shanhai Gang every day.

122
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,740
She couldn't even leave.

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
She almost got sick.

124
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
We can't irritate her anymore.

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
This cake is made by a master.

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,740
Yes.

127
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,740
Yes.

128
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
I think the master did a good job.

129
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,740
It's really delicious.

130
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
You taste it.

131
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,740
You admit it?

132
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,740
What did I admit?

133
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,740
This cake was really hit by the girl.

134
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
What else did I say?

135
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,780
A'Fang.

136
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
No, no.

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
I warn you.

138
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,780
Don't make trouble in my house.

139
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Otherwise,

140
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
I'll take you back to jail.

141
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Son.

142
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
Liu Zhendong.

143
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Your uncle asked you to wear this coat

144
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
for the benefit of you.

145
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
That's enough.

146
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Go back to Shanhai Gang.

147
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
Otherwise,

148
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
I'll kill you.

149
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
You dare?

150
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
You dare?

151
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
You forgot to follow me, right?

152
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
I can't see it.

153
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
You said you wanted to get her name.

154
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
What did she say?

155
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
She said you dare.

156
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
I can't bear it.

157
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
Go.

158
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
Go.

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Mr. Yang, long time no see.

160
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Long time no see.

161
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,860
Go in.

162
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Mrs. Liu.

163
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
New tea.

164
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Come and have a try.

165
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Look.

166
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Come here.

167
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,860
Hurry up.

168
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,860
My new tea.

169
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
How is it?

170
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Is it from Zi Yuan?

171
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Is it forced?

172
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
It's from Zi Yuan.

173
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
You...

174
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
You'll be more confused after being a police officer.

175
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Li Wen is like you.

176
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Listen.

177
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Do business well.

178
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
If you break the law, the police will arrest you.

179
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
If you don't follow the rules,

180
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,900
you'll be punished by Shanhai Gang.

181
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
I know.

182
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Put this on the table.

183
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
Gentlemen.

184
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Coffee time.

185
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Thank you.

186
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Hurry up.

187
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Thank you.

188
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Thank you.

189
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Come.

190
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
You're welcome.

191
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
You're welcome.

192
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
You're welcome.

193
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
Mr. Liu.

194
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
Just one cup.

195
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,940
I've had it.

196
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,940
I bought this for you.

197
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

198
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,940
Young Master.

199
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Young Master.

200
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,940
Young Master.

201
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Come with me.

202
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Are you done?

203
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
Yes.

204
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
Okay.

205
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,940
I've told you many times.

206
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Don't call me Young Master.

207
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,940
You're here.

208
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,940
You're here.

209
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
Did you call the police?

210
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Something happened, Young Master.

211
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
What happened?

212
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Boss was killed.

213
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,980
What?

214
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,980
Qi, you're really something.

215
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,980
It's okay to joke.

216
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
But this joke is too much.

217
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
The toilet is in pain.

218
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,980
You've got a hole in your chest.

219
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Come on.

220
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
Come back.

221
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Come on.

222
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
It's okay.

223
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
It's okay.

224
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
It's okay.

225
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
It's okay.

226
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Calm down.

227
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Calm down.

228
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,020
Calm down.

229
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
No.

230
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
Come on.

231
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Come on.

232
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
Come on.

233
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,020
Come on, boss.

234
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,020
Coming.

235
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
Coming.

236
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Coming.

237
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
Coming.

238
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Let's drink first.

239
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
Come on.

240
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
Come on.

241
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
Your chicken.

242
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,020
Fish.

243
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Fish.

244
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Fish.

245
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,020
Coming.

246
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,020
Come on.

247
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
Come on.

248
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
More.

249
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,020
More.

250
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,020
Hey.

251
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,020
Move.

252
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Move.

253
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,020
Let's go.

254
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Come on.

255
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,020
Let's go.

256
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
Hey, boss.

257
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
It's time to pay the protection.

258
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,020
Come on.

259
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
Bring the money here.

260
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Guys.

261
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Two days ago, we just paid...

262
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
Give it to Ankeng.

263
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
Yes.

264
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,020
Ankeng has been killed by me.

265
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
The floor is changed.

266
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Now this floor is mine.

267
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,060
OK.

268
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
OK.

269
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
OK.

270
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,060
The shop is in good condition.

271
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
I'll tell you more.

272
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Wait a minute.

273
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Wait a minute.

274
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Sit down.

275
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
You think I can't ride?

276
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Hey, old man.

277
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
Don't play dumb.

278
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Stop talking.

279
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Give me the money.

280
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Sorry.

281
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
I just paid.

282
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
I'll pay you later.

283
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Look at you.

284
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
You're so stupid.

285
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
OK.

286
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
They're coming.

287
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Stop fighting.

288
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Stop fighting.

289
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Stop fighting.

290
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Stop fighting.

291
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
Don't fight.

292
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Kneel.

293
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
You're so stupid.

294
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
You're so stupid.

295
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,100
We kill them.

296
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Stop fighting.

297
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Boss Chen.

298
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Boss Chen.

299
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Boss Chen.

300
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Boss Chen.

301
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
The messenger is here.

302
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Something happened to Shanghai Gang.

303
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Shanghai Gang?

304
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Boss Chen.

305
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Is this...

306
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Is this Chen Hui?

307
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
Chen Hui?

308
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
No way.

309
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Lao Bu Xi has been in the Lord of the Rings.

310
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Boss Chen.

311
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
We remember it wrong.

312
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
You can't call my father's name.

313
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Boss Chen.

314
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
Sorry.

315
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Sorry, Boss Chen.

316
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Please spare us.

317
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
Sorry, Boss Chen.

318
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Please spare us.

319
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
Please.

320
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Please.

321
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
Please.

322
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
Please.

323
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
Please.

324
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
Lao Xu.

325
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Yes.

326
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Get the boat ticket.

327
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
Okay.

328
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
Officer You.

329
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
Please.

330
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Why are you here?

331
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Didn't the police give you a mission today?

332
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm wondering.

333
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,140
It's a big deal that the Lord of the Rings is sick.

334
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,180
The police have to be on guard.

335
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
I see.

336
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,180
You can go back.

337
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Officer You.

338
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,180
You have to be careful with the Lord of the Rings.

339
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
What do you mean?

340
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,180
I got news from the county magistrate.

341
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
They are gathering people.

342
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
I was wrong.

343
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I'm worried that he will cause trouble.

344
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,180
I think it's better to hurry up with the Lord of the Rings.

345
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,180
Okay.

346
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,180
I see.

347
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Uncle.

348
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,180
It's time to treat the patient.

349
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Zhendong.

350
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
You came at the right time.

351
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
We should discuss how to treat the patient.

352
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Isn't Uncle Liu here?

353
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180
I've been watching him do nothing since I was a child.

354
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Why can't I do it when it's my father's turn?

355
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
I'm old.

356
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,180
I'm not loyal anymore.

357
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
How about I just don't care about it?

358
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
Liu.

359
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,220
You can't go.

360
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Everything else is ready.

361
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,220
But we haven't decided who will be the judge.

362
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
If it's an ordinary family,

363
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,220
it's a filial son.

364
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,220
The more sons, the more elders.

365
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,220
But we are Shanghai Gang.

366
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,220
We are the most powerful family.

367
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
But we are Shanghai Gang.

368
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
Brother Wu is the leader of the gang.

369
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,260
So we should discuss it with everyone.

370
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Shanghai Gang has been established for more than 30 years.

371
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
This is the first time the leader is in charge.

372
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,260
In theory,

373
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,260
whoever is the leader of the next gang will be the leader.

374
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I think

375
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
the leader is not a good person.

376
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
He is tired.

377
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,260
The key is to lead the brothers to a good life.

378
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,260
The business of Feng Yun Tang is doing the best.

379
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,260
I suggest Dapeng to be the leader.

380
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
A'Rou,

381
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
everyone knows you can get close to Dapeng.

382
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
You are helping him to get the power.

383
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,260
If you are tired, I will do it.

384
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
I'm the youngest anyway.

385
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,260
No one can save you.

386
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
The leader was in the warehouse.

387
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,260
He didn't find the murderer.

388
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
That's your territory.

389
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
You are suspicious.

390
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
What did you say?

391
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
A few days ago,

392
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Brother Xiong Wu was scolding you.

393
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
What happened in your warehouse after release,

394
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
you are suspicious.

395
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
You are lying.

396
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,300
I will kill you.

397
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
A'Rou, try it.

398
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
A'Rou,

399
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
you shouldn't have said that.

400
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Who taught you to play tricks with your own people?

401
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Dapeng,

402
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,300
can a man who is a man

403
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
face his own brother?

404
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
I think

405
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
we should talk about the credit

406
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
to take the new leader position.

407
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
I have the talent.

408
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Of course I won't give up.

409
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,300
I gave my life to the Shanhai Gang.

410
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm not inferior to you in terms of credit.

411
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
You finally can't help talking.

412
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
I thought you were not inferior.

413
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
So you want to take the position.

414
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
I, Xiong Wu,

415
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,300
fought with Boss Chen.

416
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I can't think about the old people of Shanhai.

417
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
What age is it?

418
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
The leader should see his ability.

419
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Am I less capable than you?

420
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,300
Enough.

421
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
I think

422
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
the leader can't be appointed for now.

423
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Then according to the rules of ordinary people,

424
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
I will fight back.

425
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
I will fight back.

426
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
I will fight back.

427
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
I will fight back.

428
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
I will fight back.

429
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
I will fight back.

430
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
I will fight back.

431
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I will fight back.

432
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I will fight back.

433
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
I will fight back.

434
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
I will fight back.

435
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
I will fight back.

436
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
I will fight back.

437
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
I will fight back.

438
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,300
I will fight back.

439
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
I will fight back.

440
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
I will fight back.

441
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
I will fight back.

442
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
I will fight back.

443
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
I will fight back.

444
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
I will fight back.

445
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
I will fight back.

446
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I will fight back.

447
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
I will fight back.

448
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I will fight back.

449
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
I will fight back.

450
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I will fight back.

451
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
I will fight back.

452
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I will fight back.

453
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
I will fight back.
