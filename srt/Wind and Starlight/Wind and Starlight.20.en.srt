1
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,340
Everyone, quiet down!

2
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,759
Folks, please be quiet.

3
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,920
I have good news for everyone.

4
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,680
That woman Qi Shuang

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
and her company

6
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,080
have been fined for fraud and violations.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
So her development plan

8
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,680
has completely fallen through.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Great! That's wonderful!

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,440
We've finally won.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,840
There's even better news coming.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,600
Qingqing.

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,360
The resort development rights for our Haizhu Village

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
The relevant authorities have considered

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
how you led the villagers

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
to completely resist Qi Shuang.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
They've also seen

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
the development plan you wrote

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
for our village

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,600
and found it very innovative.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,079
So they've decided

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,520
to give the development rights to you

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,440
and our village

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,000
to manage together.

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,520
Qingqing,

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,700
your dream has finally come true.

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,360
Qingqing.

28
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,060
Say a few words.

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,900
Fellow villagers.

30
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:53,000
This isn't just my own effort,

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,540
it's the result of everyone's hard work.

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,060
Let's keep up the good work

33
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,760
and strive to make our Haizhu Village

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,200
into

35
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,900
a dream home for everyone.

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,840
Good. Applause. Good.

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,440
Tell us.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,520
How should we develop our Utopia project?

39
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,680
It must be more impressive than Qishuang's mining project

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,140
and catch more attention.

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't you think so, K?

42
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,360
Yes.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
You're truly a city workaholic.

44
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,600
This presentation is very well done.

45
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,520
My work ethic isn't important.

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Have you noticed

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,079
more and more people are coming to our Haizhu Village lately?

48
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,300
On this matter,

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,280
Comrade Yu Xichen should know best.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Please share your thoughts.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
Because your art exhibition was a huge success,

52
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
the promotional efforts were strong,

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,000
and the surrounding cultural and entertainment facilities have been improving,

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,800
so the foot traffic here has gradually increased.

55
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Simply put,

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,650
it's about bringing

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
people with similar lifestyles

58
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,920
and work patterns

59
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,279
together,

60
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,820
providing accommodation

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,330
and co-working spaces.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,280
More importantly,

63
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
everyone can work and live together

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,250
and share experiences.

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,250
No longer will people be

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,760
alone at home

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,080
or in coffee shops.

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,920
Do you understand?

69
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,720
I understand.

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
This kind of place

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,920
is exactly made for

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,760
people like me, isn't it?

73
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,900
I have a small suggestion.

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,000
Shouldn't we give our utopia a name?

75
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,170
You're knowledgeable,

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,300
why don't you suggest something?

77
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
What name should I come up with?

78
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,940
How about 'Nomads' Commune'?

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,080
A harbor for drifters,

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,280
a place for temporary stay where everyone is equal,

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,440
and where people can start anew.

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,960
You truly are a master of catchy titles.

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,000
So, A K,

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,920
would you like to officially become

85
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,360
the Joint External Relations Director

86
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,200
of our Nomads' Commune Preparatory Office?

87
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,000
What do you mean?

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
What director are you talking about?

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Simply put,

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
we'd be fools not to use your million followers.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
She wants to use your account

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,680
to advertise our Gaming Commune

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,200
(which hasn't been established yet)

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000
to the public.

95
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
Even the worst swindlers can't match you guys.

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
You talk too much.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm in.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,920
Cut the crap.

99
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,360
Just tell us directly

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
what you want us to do.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
I owe you

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,900
for my entire life anyway.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Step one:

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
location selection.

105
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,650
Nomad Commune site selection.

106
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,340
This is the one.

107
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,290
The Haizhu Village project

108
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,140
cost the company 800 million.

109
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,320
The board decided to fire you.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,980
I stopped them.

111
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Thank you, boss.

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,810
I'm giving you one last chance.

113
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Within one month,

114
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,960
either

115
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
get Lu Qingqing's land,

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
or

117
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,920
pack your things and get out.

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,480
Mr. Qi.

119
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Lu Qingqing has started a Nomad Commune.

120
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
She's helping villagers develop homestays and art workshops.

121
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
It's trending online now.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
She's in my way

123
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,340
and still wants to rise to the top.

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,680
We'll see about that.

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,580
Ladies and gentlemen.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Our Haizhu Village is as beautiful as a painting.

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
Like a hidden pearl.

128
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,760
So I was wondering if we could invite

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
creative young people to come here.

130
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,680
We can both start creative businesses

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,320
and let the beauty of Haizhu Village

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,650
be known to more people,

133
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,440
as well as promote the village's development.

134
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Fellow villagers.

135
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
What do you think?

136
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Is this reliable?

137
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,760
With so many outsiders flooding in,

138
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,400
what about

139
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,920
our village security

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
and sanitation then?

141
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
Auntie, why wouldn't it work?

142
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,600
Wasn't I attracted by the beauty of our Haizhu Village

143
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
and those lovely

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
smiles on everyone's faces?

145
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,120
Although the process

146
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,400
was a bit complicated,

147
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,080
I think

148
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,680
Qingqing's plan is excellent.

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,600
It can not only attract young people like me,

150
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,680
but also promote our village to the outside world.

151
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,840
Isn't that killing two birds with one stone? What's not to like?

152
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,159
That's right.

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
Isn't that great?

154
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Auntie, please sit down.

155
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,940
Please sit down, sit down.

156
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,080
Well then,

157
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
let me say a few words.

158
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Our Qingqing

159
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,880
grew up in our village since childhood.

160
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,120
She has our Haizhu Village in her heart.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,159
She

162
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
would absolutely never do anything

163
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,090
that would harm our village's interests.

164
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
Trust me.

165
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
Qingqing's mother is right.

166
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,760
Everyone knows.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
I've been watching over our Haizhu Village for sixty years.

168
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,480
I hope it gets better and better.

169
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,240
Qingqing's ideas

170
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
are exactly the same

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,690
as what I've been thinking.

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,080
I fully support it.

173
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,080
We agree.

174
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,400
We support Qingqing.

175
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,160
Support what? Qingqing,

176
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,679
that so-called Nomad Commune of yours.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
If you ask me,

178
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
you just want our villagers' land

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,600
to make money for yourself.

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,320
Well, well, Lu Qingqing,

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,600
you went to the city and learned some tricks,

182
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
now you're back to cheat your own people?

183
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
Exactly!

184
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
All this talk about entrepreneurship

185
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
is just a scam.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,560
She'll take all the benefits

187
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,620
and then tell us the business failed.

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
In the end, we'll have nothing left.

189
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,640
That's right!

190
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
This Amu,

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,660
why do you two stick your noses into everything?

192
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Exactly!

193
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,320
Qingqing's plan is good!

194
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,160
With Qingqing staying in the village

195
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,480
and if we can attract more young people from outside,

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,540
our village won't just be filled with old folks like us.

197
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,160
At least with Qingqing here,

198
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,160
if my granddaughter wants to learn painting,

199
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,480
she can find excellent teachers.

200
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
That's right!

201
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,060
Qingqing, we support you.

202
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't listen to those two.

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,240
Even if you don't involve us in these plans,

204
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
that Qi woman

205
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
has her eyes on this land.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,160
What does village development have to do with us?

207
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,840
Whether it's Ms. Qi or Qingqing,

208
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,920
we'll all just end up as spectators.

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,500
Don't listen to his nonsense.

210
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,240
I've signed an agreement with the village.

211
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,480
As long as we make a profit,

212
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,920
everyone will get dividends.

213
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Bullshit!

214
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,400
Your so-called Nomad Commune

215
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,570
deliberately avoids my house.

216
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,080
You won't let me make money, huh?

217
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,610
None of you will get a share.

218
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
Stop talking nonsense here.

219
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,000
We bypassed your house

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,160
because your family didn't agree.

221
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
None of your damn business.

222
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,000
What are you doing?

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,760
What's your problem?

224
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
Why are you everywhere?

225
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,000
If you keep talking like this,

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,860
I'll expose you on my livestream.

227
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,920
Bro, did you hear that?

228
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
We're going live on TV.

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,970
Livestream?

230
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,260
I've been wanting to be on camera.

231
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,480
Go ahead.

232
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,480
Stream it.

233
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,160
You can't even take the opportunity.

234
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,600
What are you doing?

235
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,920
I'd like to see

236
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
what benefits Lu Qingqing gave you all

237
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,010
that makes everyone side with her.

238
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,000
Who took the bribes?

239
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,000
Are you Lu Qingqing?

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,480
I think

241
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,560
it's you.

242
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
Who are you talking about?

243
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,210
I'm talking about you, kid.

244
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
Why are you getting physical?

245
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,400
Ouch!

246
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
I'm calling the police!

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Everyone, look at this!

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
Lu Qingqing's boyfriend is hitting people!

249
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,160
Everyone, come see this!

250
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,840
Let go!

251
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,400
You punk!

252
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,690
You'll pay for this!

253
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
Get out of here now!

254
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,040
You'd rather believe these two thugs

255
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,250
than Lu Qingqing whom you've known since she was a child.

256
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,450
Her grandfather

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,800
maintains the root systems of ancient trees in the mountains.

258
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,520
Her mother

259
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,280
provides essential supplies for everyone in the village.

260
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,340
And what about her?

261
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,260
Has she ever done anything to harm your village?

262
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,720
Qi Shuang and her gang

263
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,180
just want to mine the mountain

264
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,880
and would even resort to blasting it for convenience.

265
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,680
This approach

266
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,290
is not what we advocate.

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,960
We shouldn't just make money

268
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,940
but also protect our homeland

269
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
and our environment.

270
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm an outsider

271
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,520
and I could easily take Qingqing and leave.

272
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,040
But have you considered

273
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
that this is our home?

274
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
Protecting our home means protecting ourselves.

275
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
Taking care of the Earth

276
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
means taking care of ourselves

277
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
and our future generations.

278
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,200
That's right! What Xiao Yu says is correct!

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
Isn't that right?

280
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,200
Yes, exactly!

281
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
As for those two thugs

282
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
and the evidence of their bribes,

283
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,680
That woman Qi Shuang

284
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,850
and the evidence of her crimes,

285
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,960
Just wait.

286
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,760
You'll see it all sooner or later.
