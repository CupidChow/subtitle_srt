13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,490
Qing, this painting is quite good.

14
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,400
This starry sky is so beautiful.

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,080
Of course.

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
My daughter's work.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,240
Look at this painting.

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,080
It can rival international masters.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,280
This painting

20
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,010
was completed under

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,759
the guidance of my mentor, Zhong Tianshuo.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,800
I would like to

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,240
thank him for all his help.

24
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,100
This shattered starry sky

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,720
has a particularly unique meaning.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
Especially these two white light waves.

27
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,060
Do they have some special significance?

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,400
It represents hope.

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
It's also a kind of

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,850
protection that transcends reality.

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,400
So many people here.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,300
It's quite lively.

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,960
This is an art exhibition.

34
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,540
A female boss has arrived.

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
Don't tell me we're about to witness some rich family drama.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Sunflower seeds and bottled water for sale in the front row!

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,300
Ready for the show!

38
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,640
Ms. Qi, what brings you here?

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm here to tell Lu Qingqing.

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,640
You're suspected of plagiarizing

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,000
our contracted artist's work

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,640
'Guardian Under the Star Trail.'

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,320
This is a court summons

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,480
and copyright infringement notice.

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
That's nonsense!

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
How could Qingqing possibly plagiarize?

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
Everyone can see!

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,880
This painting was created by my daughter

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
stroke by stroke.

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,400
How could it possibly be plagiarism?

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,480
Nonsense.

53
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,320
I've never even seen

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,640
your 'Guardian Under the Star Trail' painting.

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,240
Everything needs evidence.

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,600
Qingqing's painting

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,320
was created stroke by stroke

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,800
with all of us as witnesses.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Yes, exactly.

60
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,400
Right.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,850
I have our company artist's draft here

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,210
created six months ago.

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,480
Whether it's the color, composition,

64
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
or the core elements,

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,940
they're highly similar to this piece of junk

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,800
in every way.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,120
It's just a coincidence.

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,880
My painting

69
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,880
has my own ideas and story.

70
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,000
Everyone,

71
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,160
now you all see it, right?

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,720
We're fighting for our home turf,

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,050
we can't afford to lose!

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
What evidence do you have?

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,480
This can't be photoshopped, right?

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,400
Exactly.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,720
You photoshopped this, didn't you?

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,960
Who are you? Who do you think you are?

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you have any right to speak here?

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,079
Who am I?

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm the unofficial spokesperson for Haizhu Village.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,080
A social media influencer with over a million followers.

83
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,560
Come on, look at the camera.

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Qingqing,

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,570
we're not afraid of her.

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,400
Qi Shuang.

87
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,480
I started creating this painting

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
seven years ago.

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,280
Every stroke was done by me personally.

90
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
To improve it,

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,480
a month ago,

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
I asked Mr. Zhong for some guidance.

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,140
How could I possibly plagiarize your company's painting?

94
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,820
So you've admitted

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,880
that this painting

96
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,340
was created by both of you.

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
Well, let me tell you.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
Our company's contracted artist

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,580
is Mr. Zhong Tianshuo.

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,720
According to the contract,

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,000
anything he participates in creating

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
or provides guidance for

103
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,560
has its copyright owned by our company.

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,000
And before getting our company's authorization,

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,640
you used his creative ideas without permission.

106
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,770
This is infringement and plagiarism.

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,320
Qingqing.

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,080
Mr. Zhong,

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
what does this mean?

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,480
There's a problem with the contract.

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,240
Qi Shuang,

112
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,080
you deliberately set me up,

113
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,720
used me.

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I didn't use you.

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
You signed the contract voluntarily.

116
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,080
We have a mutually beneficial relationship.

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,720
Qingqing,

118
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,720
And also,

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,000
do you all know?

121
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,480
This great artist Lu.

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,890
I've investigated her.

123
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
At her previous company,

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,400
she liked to snoop on her colleagues' work.

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,960
She hasn't changed this habit.

126
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,640
And also,

127
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,080
she brags everywhere,

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,080
claiming to be some art director.

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
But as far as I know,

130
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
at her previous company,

131
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,080
she was just a low-level employee serving tea,

132
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,800
not even an assistant.

133
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,860
This 'art director' title

134
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,000
is just self-proclaimed.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Isn't Qingqing a director in the city?

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,400
How could she be just a tea server?

137
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,560
Shut up!

138
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,720
So you're saying

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
she's been lying to all of us.

140
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,159
Don't talk nonsense.

141
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,720
How could Qingqing lie?

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Exactly, how could she lie?

143
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
How could she lie? It's impossible.

144
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I didn't.

145
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,560
Don't be afraid.

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm here with you.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,730
Lu Qingqing.

148
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,840
I suggest you be reasonable.

149
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,720
You can use your land as collateral for compensation.

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,380
We can settle this privately.

151
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,080
Otherwise,

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,740
just wait for a court summons.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,320
I'll make sure you never

154
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
show your face in the art world again.

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,880
You can forget about painting for the rest of your life.

156
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,810
I believe in her.

157
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,730
She didn't plagiarize.

158
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,960
Whether she plagiarized or not,

159
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,220
the court will decide.

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
But right now,

161
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,060
you owe our company 5 million in copyright fees.

162
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,480
5 million.

163
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,880
Where would we get that much money?

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,940
You must be joking.

165
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
If you don't have the money,

166
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,800
use your land as collateral.

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,730
I'm not completely unreasonable.

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,130
I'll give you one day

169
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,570
to think it over.

170
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,080
Qingqing.

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,159
I'm sorry.

172
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,640
The sketch for that painting

173
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
was indeed drawn by me six months ago.

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
I never thought Qi Shuang would...

175
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,640
Qing.

176
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,120
You really plagiarized?

177
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,290
How could it be plagiarism?

178
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
What nonsense are you talking?

179
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,800
All of you, be quiet!

180
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
Listen to me.

181
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,880
None of you are allowed to gossip about this.

182
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,280
Plagiarism? No way.

183
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,800
Qingqing, come home with mom.

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,960
Get up. Get up. Get up.

185
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,640
Let's go home. Let's go home.

186
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,570
Get up. Make way.

187
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Get up.

188
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Our Qingqing is innocent.

189
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,640
Mom.

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,400
It's not a big deal.

191
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,640
When I was working outside,

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I saw this kind of thing all the time.

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,530
There's nothing your daughter can't handle.

194
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,720
Silly girl.

195
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
I've known for a long time

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,290
that you're not an artistic director.

197
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,210
How long were you planning to lie to me?

198
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,500
The reason I let you move back home

199
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,880
was hoping you could find peace.

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,940
That's why I never called you out.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Then when

202
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
did you find out?

203
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,800
One time I missed you,

204
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
so I went to the city to see you.

205
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I didn't tell you.

206
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,420
I'll be waiting for you downstairs at your company.

207
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Qingqing.

208
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
Working overtime again?

209
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,800
This month's perfect attendance award is definitely yours.

210
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,530
Almost done.

211
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,170
Just need to finish this revision.

212
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,980
The office assistant is about to rise up!

213
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,240
I heard the director praised your edits.

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,480
Said they were very inspired.

215
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Keep up the good work.

216
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,000
Maybe after grinding for 10 years,

217
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,799
you could become a director too.

218
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,160
Mom's heart at that moment

219
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,130
felt like it was being carved with a knife.

220
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,540
Hey, Qingqing.

221
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,980
Have you eaten?

222
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
Yes, I have.

223
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
What did you have?

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm having dinner with colleagues. It's quite fancy.

225
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
How's your daughter doing?

226
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,220
You know very well.

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,210
Your daughter would never shortchange herself.

228
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm asking you.

229
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,920
Your colleagues...

230
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,250
Are they treating you well?

231
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes, they are.

232
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,300
Your daughter is so outstanding.

233
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
I have good news.

234
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,520
I've been promoted to senior director.

235
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
I got promoted.

236
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,640
Are you happy?

237
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
My Qingqing is now a senior director.

238
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,490
When will you come back?

239
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,320
To see me?

240
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Mom.

241
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
My colleagues are calling for me.

242
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,320
I have to go now.

243
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,240
