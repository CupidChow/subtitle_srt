1
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,660
How about this one?

2
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,330
Does it look like me?

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,090
Not as lively as you.

4
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,420
None of that liveliness reached your heart.

5
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,289
Everyone, look!

6
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
This elderly lady at such an advanced age

7
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,340
is still struggling to make a living.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,120
K.

9
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,060
It's him again.

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,200
I must talk to him today and sort this out.

11
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,800
Qingqing.

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,320
This is real life at its most authentic.

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,479
Sister Qingqing,

14
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,410
I got the old lady's permission for today's filming.

15
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,360
Grandma

16
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,850
Did he really get your permission?

17
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,720
Yes, dear.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,130
You misunderstood.

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,160
This young man

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,060
has been helping me these days

21
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,680
weaving all sorts of things.

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,320
He not only helps me weave,

23
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,000
but also helps me sell my goods.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
K is really a good young man.

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,490
I'm not that good, Grandma.

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,100
Then I misunderstood you.

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
No, Sister Qingqing.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
I was immature before

29
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,920
and caused a lot of trouble for everyone.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,380
And last time I started a fire while smoking,

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,000
but I've changed now.

32
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,810
I've paid all the compensation

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
and quit smoking.

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
I've also joined the village's

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
fire prevention team.

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,079
So you've become a volunteer now.

37
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,680
If you don't believe me, ask the village chief.

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,800
After making

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,460
such a big mistake before,

40
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,020
I've come to my senses now.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,880
I plan to

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,720
document real life

43
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,140
and discover what people truly need.

44
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm here today to help promote Grandma's products

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,320
and hopefully help her sell more goods.

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Well, you'd better keep your word.

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
No more clickbait titles.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,900
Relying on gimmicks for views

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,130
is not a sustainable approach.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,800
If you want to earn respect from others,

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
you must first learn to respect others.

52
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,880
I understand.

53
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,720
I promise

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,700
I won't exploit others for content anymore.

55
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,740
If you don't believe me, look.

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,960
I've changed all my previous video titles.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,320
See?

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,720
Right?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
Admitting mistakes and making changes is the greatest virtue.

60
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,240
Keep up the good work.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,040
Alright then,

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,579
I'll continue now.

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,120
Hey everyone!

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at this fan.

65
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,400
It's handmade by Grandma.

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,840
Susu.

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,060
This time I'm really leaving.

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
Don't worry.

69
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,600
When I return home triumphantly,

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
my collaboration with Director Zhang

71
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,250
has been very pleasant.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
I believe

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,000
the album will be released soon.

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,620
I'm looking forward to it.

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,160
Susu.

76
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,380
I was wondering

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
if there's a possibility

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
that

79
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,520
we could all stay in Haizhu Village and not leave.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,920
It's that idea I mentioned to you before.

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,780
A place where everyone

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,159
can socialize and have fun together.

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,780
Opening an art studio,

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,000
plus a café,

85
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,240
and a library area,

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,159
making it a comprehensive entertainment space.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Mr. Lu's rural utopia

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,400
is already on the agenda?

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,000
You could say that.

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,680
I've watched many videos by A-K.

91
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
Although those titles

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
made me angry enough to hit someone,

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,720
but when I read the comments carefully,

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
there are still many people who like

95
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,100
the kind of life we're living now.

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,200
Qingqing,

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
I support you.

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,380
Can I sign up to be the first resident?

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,920
I'm the founder.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
I should be the first one.

101
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,450
Then being the second one shouldn't be a problem, right?

102
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
Then you can live next door to me.

103
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,060
Great, I'll be your neighbor.

104
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,050
Let me clean this up for you.

105
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,240
Go ahead.

106
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,159
Susu.

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,680
These are persimmon cakes my mother just made.

108
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,810
Eat them on your way.

109
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,290
Take good care of yourself.

110
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,920
Don't worry.

111
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,360
Qingqing.

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,760
Thank you for organizing the materials for the exhibition.

113
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Once Susu is settled,

114
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,700
I'll come back.

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,490
Don't worry, Mr. Zhong.

116
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,160
Thank you for making this trip.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
It's on my way.

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,400
I need to go to the city

119
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
to discuss the art exhibition collaboration.

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,210
Let's go.

121
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
Bye-bye.

122
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,010
What's wrong? Finding it hard to say goodbye?

123
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,780
Now that they're gone,

124
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,620
this place feels so empty.

125
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,520
Farewell in this life,

126
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,920
I made a promise with you.

127
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,440
To hold your hand,

128
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,800
and grow old together.

129
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,820
I think that's Grandpa Liang.

130
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,810
Let's go see.

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,380
Grandpa Liang.

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
This is the tea

133
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,740
you and my grandfather used to enjoy.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Thank you.

135
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,920
Qingqing,

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
you've grown up so much.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,680
Xichen.

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,180
Why did you call me here

139
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,490
so urgently?

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,400
Use your talents.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,600
This time,

142
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,900
someone who really needs help

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
is right here.

144
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,400
Sir,

145
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,480
can I use my camera

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,600
to record your story?

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,520
I'm a content creator with millions of followers,

148
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,050
known as K the Soul Catcher.

149
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,090
If you need help,

150
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,000
I can share your information across all platforms.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Sure.

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you.

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,100
The doctor said

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,680
I don't have

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,770
much time left in this life.

156
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,400
I want to use

157
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,330
the power of your online reach.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
Help me find someone.

159
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,010
I want to find my first love.

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Before I go,

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,500
I want to see her one more time.

162
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,660
I understand, sir.

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Let's begin then.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,330
Her name is Zhu Wanqing.

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,000
She studied Hu Opera.

166
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,650
She has a good voice.

167
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,060
And looks beautiful on stage.

168
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,780
When she stands there,

169
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,720
she's like Chang'e from heaven.

170
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,520
Sixty years ago, in summer,

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,799
that was when I

172
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,000
first saw her perform.

173
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,159
She wore pink opera costume,

174
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
and when she flicked her water sleeves,

175
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,320
With a glance of her eyes.

176
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
My heart

177
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,900
felt like it was struck by something,

178
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,080
pounding rapidly.

179
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,320
Later,

180
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,980
I often went to see her performances.

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,080
I said I was going to see the opera,

182
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
but actually,

183
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,840
at that time,

184
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,730
I was working in the mine

185
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,000
as a miner.

186
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,080
As for her,

187
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,300
she didn't look down on me.

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
During her breaks,

189
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
she would come to the mine

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,520
and bring me delicious food.

191
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
We made a promise.

192
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,410
That when I saved enough money,

193
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I would marry her.

194
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
She agreed.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Back then,

196
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,500
we usually sat under that old locust tree

197
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,960
watching the sunset.

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,360
I listened to her sing opera just for me.

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,240
That was truly

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,840
the most beautiful music in the world.

201
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,040
Our love

202
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,960
forever connected,

203
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,160
eternally bound.

204
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,340
Later, there was an accident at the mine.

205
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,120
Several people died.

206
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
I was injured too.

207
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,240
My family was afraid I'd be in danger again,

208
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,730
so they forced me to return to my hometown.

209
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
I left in such a hurry

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,680
that I didn't even have time to say goodbye to her.

211
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,810
I wrote her a letter,

212
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
arranging to meet

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,400
at the opera stage.

214
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,080
That day,

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,800
I waited there

216
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,680
for her all day long.

217
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,000
But she never came.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,760
I thought

219
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,380
she didn't want me anymore

220
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,760
or

221
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,140
her family disapproved of me.

222
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,520
But later

223
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,000
I heard she got married.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,160
My heart

225
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,530
felt like it was being cut with a knife.

226
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,130
I was young and proud back then.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,480
I was stubborn

228
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,180
and didn't go looking for her.

229
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,480
But in my heart,

230
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,600
I could never let go.

231
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,000
For my entire life.

232
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,240
I could never move on.

233
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
Until recently,

234
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
when an old friend told me

235
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,940
that back then,

236
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,980
she never received my letter.

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,570
She thought something had happened to me.

238
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
She kept waiting for me.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,160
Later her family

240
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,490
They forced her to marry

241
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,920
someone she didn't love.

242
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,840
Her life was miserable.

243
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
Later on,

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,160
that man fell ill and passed away.

245
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
She raised her child alone

246
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,760
and never remarried.

247
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,600
So it turns out,

248
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,600
we've both been

249
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,570
misunderstanding each other.

250
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,760
Wanqing.

251
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm sorry.

252
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,240
Are you okay?

253
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
This is the most touching story

254
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
I've ever filmed.

255
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,000
Then hurry up

256
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,400
and edit the video

257
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,220
to release it soon.

258
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,760
We'll try to

259
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,980
find Grandma Zhu as soon as possible.

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,240
We still need a catchy title.

261
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,010
I'm an expert at clickbait titles.

262
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,690
Tonight,

263
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,080
I'll come up with one.
