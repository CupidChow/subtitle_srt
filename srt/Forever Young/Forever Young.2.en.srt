1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,501
(All characters, organizations, places,
and events in this drama are fictional)

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,003
(and have no connection to real life.)

3
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,952
Don't read the notebook without me.

4
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,179
You can never look at this.

5
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,447
Let's write one thing
we each want to do on the last page.

6
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,283
- What we each want to do?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,918
So, something I want to do alone?

8
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,085
Yes, on your own.

9
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,387
Here, you go first.

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,556
- Me?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,091
There's nothing I want to do alone.

12
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,827
Just write whatever then.

13
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,129
Come on, hurry up.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,730
I'm going to forget mine.
Hurry, hurry up.

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,832
Alright, okay.

16
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,942
All done?

17
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,277
- All done?
- Yeah, all done.

18
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,112
Here.
Wait a minute.

19
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,451
- What are you doing?
- Where is it? Is it here?

20
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,787
- Here.
- Here?

21
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:28,789
Okay, good.

22
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,224
- Good?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,860
You can open this only when
we've finished everything here.

24
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,828
And you can do this
only when we've finished the list.

25
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,496
What?

26
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,064
If you even take a peek at this first...

27
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,632
Then for the coming ten years...

28
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,601
- No, for 30 years.
- What?

29
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,871
Nope, everything you want
will forever turn out the opposite.

30
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,138
Serious?

31
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,173
Okay?

32
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,141
That's lame.

33
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,743
Pen, please.

34
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,249
Don't look.
I'm not looking.

35
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,419
No peeking.
I can't see it.

36
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,324
- I'm done.
- Okay.

37
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,761
- Are your eyes closed?
- Yeah, where is it?

38
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,263
- Here.
- Here?

39
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,164
Here.

40
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,303
You can never look at this.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,005
Fine, I won't.

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,107
Never...

43
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,409
look at this.

44
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,977
That makes me wanna look at it more.

45
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,312
No, you can never look at this.

46
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,281
Look how many exclamation marks
I put here.

47
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,249
Hey.

48
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,322
Cheater.

49
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,961
It's 12 o'clock.

50
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,469
Meet me in front of the cafe
at 12 o'clock.

51
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,439
Why?

52
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,842
I need to buy something.

53
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,179
Something to buy?

54
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,019
Bring your ID.

55
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,858
My ID?

56
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,728
So you're on board?

57
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:17,063
(Lottery shop)

58
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:21,034
(Lottery tickets can be purchased
up to 100 dollars per person...)

59
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,808
How do you feel?

60
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:33,814
Is there a reason why
you wanted to do this?

61
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,885
Hey, you think winning the lottery
is as easy as it sounds?

62
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,654
Who knows?
We might win.

63
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:41,855
It's not that easy.

64
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,057
Because life's a gamble.

65
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,296
Come on.

66
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:53,267
I seriously felt like an adult
when I bought the lottery.

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,369
What should I do
if I get the first prize?

68
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,870
Should I keep it a secret?

69
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,039
It's like, you're getting
this huge amount of money.

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,941
How should I put this...

71
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,410
It feels like I just purchased...

72
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,812
a humongous, grown-up problem.

73
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,915
I'm excited.

74
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,082
It's also giving me butterflies.

75
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,350
Wouldn't it make us adults?

76
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,686
I'm so excited.
It's giving me butterflies.

77
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,824
But...

78
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,198
I guess I kind of read too much into that.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,401
Let's go.

80
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,773
Wait.

81
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,507
(Prove that you're an adult with your ID.
Buy a lottery ticket!)

82
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,475
Wait for me.

83
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,178
Thank you.

84
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,180
Hey, wait up.

85
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,715
I thought of another one.

86
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,150
What?

87
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,252
At a library...

88
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,321
Have a mature relationship.

89
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,623
- A mature relationship?
- Yeah.

90
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,428
Our eyes suddenly meet
between the bookshelves.

91
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,441
It really feels like we're in college.

92
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,724
Then, he'll get that book for you
that you can't reach.

93
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,360
That has nothing to do
with a mature relationship.

94
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,995
Come on.

95
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,598
As he gets the book,

96
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,005
an accidental touch happens.

97
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,141
So romantic.

98
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,424
("All Who Are Not in Love Now Are Guilty")

99
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,498
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,301
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:09,002
Hey.

102
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,823
Like, you fall asleep from studying,

103
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,824
and they block the sunlight for you?

104
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,027
That's super romantic.

105
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,063
How do you even know that stuff?

106
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:55,215
(Go watch a late-night movie.)

107
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,089
So, this is the movie
we're watching, right?

108
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,565
(Go watch a late-night movie.
It has to be R-rated.)

109
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,566
(A photo must be provided.)

110
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,368
What?

111
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,537
There was more to it?

112
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,938
When a steamy scene comes on...

113
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,940
Hey!

114
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,441
How could you write that?

115
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,310
You totally ruined it just now.

116
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,746
Ha Young, you little...

117
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,213
You're so clever.

118
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,482
We'll do this for sure.

119
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,116
Finish what you were about to write.

120
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,184
Why are you so excited?

121
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,952
Who's excited? No, I'm not.

122
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,021
(When a steamy scene comes on,
no gulping!)

123
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,391
We have to go in.

124
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,256
You know,

125
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,259
I think the person
who wrote this was a pervert.

126
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,039
You know,

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,275
I didn't write the list.

128
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:57,738
Give it.

129
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,816
Wait for me later near the main street.

130
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,808
This is the next one.

131
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,177
(Go for a night of romantic stargazing.
Get a license and drive yourself.)

132
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,048
Should we leave at about 10 o'clock?

133
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:43,951
Yeah,

134
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,687
I have a driving license.

135
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,325
You're nervous.

136
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,293
That's understandable.

137
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,429
Then, should we try something else first?

138
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,699
(Dress up and go to a whiskey bar.)

139
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,567
Whiskey bar?

140
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,104
(Alcohol tolerance test at 20)

141
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,041
(First kiss)

142
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,477
First kiss...

143
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,247
Let's not.

144
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,118
Why?

145
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,708
I told you I have a license.

146
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,744
No, wait.

147
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,922
You're going to walk from here?

148
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:00,060
I bet we'll see so many stars tonight,
don't you think?

149
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,162
I said I don't want to do this.

150
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,899
I know.

151
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,734
I get that you're nervous.

152
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:10,170
I might be slower than a bike, but...

153
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:13,040
We'll get there for sure.

154
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:16,210
Listen.

155
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,047
Please help me this once.

156
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,684
I don't think I can do this alone.

157
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:31,859
I've gotten the hang of it now.

158
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,696
Can I just walk from here?

159
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,864
We're almost there.
Why would you walk?

160
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:40,033
I'm doing so well right now, aren't I?

161
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,169
Yes, a red light.

162
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,838
My record's clean.

163
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,443
I think I'm quite good at this.

164
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,545
Okay, green.

165
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,080
Let's go... Slowly...

166
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,982
You have to make a right soon.

167
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,751
Okay, left.

168
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,987
Right.

169
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:03,123
No, I said a right turn, you idiot!

170
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,333
So many stars.

171
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:34,888
This is the best spot in the area
to see the stars.

172
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,959
Well, because it didn't specify where.

173
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,396
If you don't remind me,

174
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,532
I can't even remember
what's on the list anymore.

175
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,335
Liar.

176
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:50,504
I know you remember everything.

177
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,715
I was wondering...

178
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,389
Do you need to be back home early?

179
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,601
Why?

180
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,371
Even if we go now,

181
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,508
I think we'll get there tomorrow.

182
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,847
I forgot.

183
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,716
One second.

184
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,230
Happy birthday to you

185
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,800
Happy belated birthday.

186
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,437
I know I ruined your birthday cake.

187
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,107
Now, make a wish
and blow out the candle.

188
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,381
That was quick.

189
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:33,878
What kind of a person...

190
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,578
was your friend?

191
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,361
I'm just curious.

192
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:57,130
You don't need to tell me.

193
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,635
You really don't need to.

194
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,040
Look at all the stars.

195
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,009
We were going to part anyway.

196
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,347
Why waste the energy?

197
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,782
Once the clock hits midnight,

198
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:19,353
we'll be adults,
and the list will start.

199
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,190
I'm excited.
It's giving me butterflies.

200
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,560
I think I'll be about five minutes late.

201
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:28,896
I'm running over, sorry.

202
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,798
I always thought
Hui Won would be right there.

203
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,905
It was always "forever" with Hui Won.

204
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:53,420
Your friend...

205
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,523
must be so proud.

206
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,031
Look.

207
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,669
Look how many we've done already.

208
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,639
The weather was so nice on this day.

209
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,910
Look at this.

210
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,413
You're a college student.

211
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,966
We've done so much.

212
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:53,547
Time only flows forward,

213
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,884
but memories don't stop.

214
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,053
Maybe that's why it's forever.

215
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,297
If it's okay with you,

216
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,503
could we do the rest together as well?

217
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,445
I'll be your Forever-mate.

218
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,918
"Young" from Ha Young,
and "Un" from Do Un.

219
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:32,953
Young Un.

220
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,126
It's Young Won.

221
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:41,929
It's not Young Un.

222
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:06,519
(I think I was being too sensitive...)

223
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,720
(I'm sorry.)

224
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,556
(I want to apologize...)

225
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,674
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,520
So...

227
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,925
Was it bottoms up?

228
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:49,496
Was it?

229
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:55,869
Hey!

230
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:57,804
Why would you drink it all like that?

231
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,408
No, well...

232
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:06,813
Shouldn't the first shot
always be bottoms up?

233
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,385
Bottoms up?

234
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:13,787
(Dress up and go to a whiskey bar.
You have to down the first shot.)

235
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,927
Do you need help with that?

236
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:23,063
No, I can down this in one go.

237
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,602
Bottoms up.

238
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:45,919
It burns.

239
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,423
I feel bad, so tonight's on me.

240
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:55,128
Why...

241
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:58,298
would you feel bad?

242
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,169
Excuse me.

243
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,004
Yes.

244
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,206
- Two more shots, please.
- Sure.

245
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,407
You're taking two shots?

246
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,243
I told you that you wouldn't be able
to handle two shots.

247
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,913
We need to drink the liquor too.

248
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,449
Everything's spinning.

249
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,451
The liquor...

250
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,218
(Alcohol tolerance test at 20)

251
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,656
Hey.

252
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,459
Hey, wake up now.

253
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,028
Wake up.

254
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:13,473
What was that?

255
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,814
- Did we...
- What?

256
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,250
Did we drink the liquor yesterday?

257
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:24,718
The liqu...

258
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,354
We had...

259
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,256
What?

260
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:31,225
We had it?

261
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:36,430
If we had it, I wouldn't feel
so wronged right now.

262
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,065
Then where is it?

263
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:40,734
We threw it away.

264
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:43,337
We threw it away?

265
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,106
Don't you remember?

266
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:54,314
The notebook.

267
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:56,983
Where's the notebook?

268
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,851
We drank a lot yesterday.

269
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,521
You didn't lose it, right?
We brought it back?

270
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,856
You don't remember, do you?

271
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,560
Do you have it or not?

272
00:22:07,027 --> 00:22:08,228
It's not here.

273
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,800
It's not?

274
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,570
It's not here?

275
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:20,541
I didn't get to read all of it yet.

276
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,778
Hey, I told you to give it back.

277
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,348
If you had given it back to me,
this wouldn't have happened.

278
00:22:29,216 --> 00:22:30,416
You said I'd always be first.

279
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,818
I know. I'm stupid.

280
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,222
Real adults are supposed
to take responsibility.

281
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,894
Then,

282
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,464
should we come on the 30th?

283
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:46,465
No, it's not...

284
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,367
Move.

285
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,271
You need to keep the promise.

286
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:54,041
That's the first item you wrote,
exactly how you wanted it.

287
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:56,877
How I wanted it?

288
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,012
You chose this.
You're the one who dragged me here.

289
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,949
If you're already this irresponsible
from the start...

290
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,184
You always talk about being a real adult.

291
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:06,467
You'll never be one.

292
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,296
Would that have...

293
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,100
made a difference?

294
00:23:22,302 --> 00:23:23,170
No.

295
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:27,808
It would've been the same.

296
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:30,978
But...

297
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,748
what's wrong with that?

298
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,420
Do I have to be okay?

299
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,290
Why can't I be in pain?

300
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,729
Does your friend...

301
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:52,466
want that too?

302
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,936
How would I know?
She's not here anymore!

303
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,810
Leave.

304
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:43,584
The notebook...

305
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:45,752
It's downstairs.

306
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,061
Hey.

307
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,167
It's over there. That's ours.

308
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,301
(Alcohol tolerance test at 20)

309
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,304
We need to drink it.

310
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,238
Why?

311
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,774
No, stop. We can't.

312
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:43,744
The thing is...

313
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,712
We need to drink this too.

314
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:48,382
No. Hey, stop.

315
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,957
- Hey, are you okay?
- It hurts.

316
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,260
- Where are you?
- It hurts.

317
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,535
I feel like...

318
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,340
that happened to her because of me.

319
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,042
It really hurts.

320
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,546
It's all my fault.

321
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:23,584
Hui Won,

322
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,686
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:30,290
I miss you so much.

324
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,461
It's...

325
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:37,397
driving me crazy.

326
00:26:52,546 --> 00:26:53,380
It's cold.

327
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,138
I can't do this.

328
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:23,376
(Go for a picnic on a sunny day
with beer and wine or soju.)

329
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:24,278
It's all wet.

330
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,664
You can never look at this.

331
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:58,011
(Continue writing the list.
Maybe forever?)

332
00:27:58,612 --> 00:28:00,214
- All done?
- Wait.

333
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:01,648
All done?

334
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:02,649
Wait.

335
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,060
Doing the next one on the list
together too,

336
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,262
forever.

337
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,031
I'm done.

338
00:28:19,433 --> 00:28:20,367
Friends for life, okay?

339
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:23,303
My Forever-mate.

340
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,508
You'll come first, no matter what.

341
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:29,610
Forever.

342
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:45,759
The number you've dialed
is not available...

343
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,321
Hello.

344
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:16,590
Good to see you.

345
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,227
I bet you two have things to talk about.

346
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,136
Hey.

347
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,541
You can't be...

348
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:38,345
You worried about me.

349
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,985
I must've pushed myself too hard
these past few days.

350
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:53,327
I'm okay.

351
00:29:57,497 --> 00:29:58,465
I'll be out soon.

352
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,742
Why did you just leave?

353
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:12,646
What...

354
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:15,883
You didn't even do anything.

355
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,787
Why did you leave without saying anything?

356
00:30:25,158 --> 00:30:26,345
You told me to leave.

357
00:30:30,097 --> 00:30:31,031
Don't go.

358
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:42,109
Do it with me.

359
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:09,803
Are you okay?

360
00:31:17,311 --> 00:31:18,145
Sorry.

361
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,283
Yeah.

362
00:31:25,819 --> 00:31:26,753
Thanks.

363
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:28,922
Me too.

364
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:33,093
I look totally fine, don't I?

365
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:35,095
No.

366
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:42,636
Liar.

367
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:49,476
I...

368
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,746
really enjoyed school,

369
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:54,748
but I missed a lot of days
because I was sick.

370
00:31:55,716 --> 00:31:58,852
So, I never got to even wear the uniform.

371
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,092
I used to stand
in front of your school a lot too.

372
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,063
Hurry up. Come on.

373
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,599
Wait for me.

374
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:16,537
If I weren't sick,

375
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,440
we would've gone together.

376
00:32:23,577 --> 00:32:25,179
I had to wake up at a certain time,

377
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:28,549
get shots, eat, and take medication.

378
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,918
That's all I did on repeat.

379
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:33,587
Then it was over.

380
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,423
I could go back to normal life.

381
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,426
It was the freedom I'd always wanted,

382
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,463
but I didn't even know
what normal was anymore.

383
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,689
But...

384
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,959
the girls who wrote the list had
so many things they wanted to do...

385
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,261
while I didn't know what to do.

386
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,197
That's why I started doing them.

387
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:29,510
I didn't think it would work,

388
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,446
but once the tomatoes actually grew,

389
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,916
it felt like I've found a path.

390
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:40,821
The attic used to be my room.

391
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,289
What?

392
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,493
I heard from my mom.

393
00:33:47,995 --> 00:33:48,929
Mom?

394
00:33:51,732 --> 00:33:52,699
Mom?

395
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:55,969
Yeah.

396
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,574
Please...

397
00:34:02,242 --> 00:34:03,677
let me stay here.

398
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,145
You were so different
from when I saw you,

399
00:34:06,146 --> 00:34:07,214
so I got worried.

400
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:34,707
When I realized you were part of this...

401
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,576
It's mine.

402
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,577
This is yours?

403
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:38,412
It's mine.

404
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:39,880
It was even better.
Even better.

405
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:51,124
That's how I made a new goal.

406
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,127
It was...

407
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,430
to make you smile again.

408
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,465
Let's do this together.

409
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,002
Kim Ha Young.

410
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:05,972
Come on!

411
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:07,975
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

412
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:16,782
Happy birthday to you

413
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,719
Happy belated birthday.

414
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:21,722
It burns.

415
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,399
So...

416
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,703
how about...

417
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:40,774
trying to smile a bit?

418
00:35:45,078 --> 00:35:46,079
I'll...

419
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:52,419
wait with you until then.

420
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,285
Hey,

421
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,022
you're gonna get written up.

422
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:42,636
All those cute baby photos were of you?

423
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:57,718
There are still some left.

424
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,388
We haven't gotten around to some.

425
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:04,958
We've done a lot, though.

426
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,295
(First kiss
The first person has to share tips.)

427
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,631
(Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! First kiss!)

428
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,439
What was that?

429
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:20,641
What?

430
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:23,210
I already saw it.

431
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,013
Nope.

432
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,787
But we need to finish
doing everything on the list.

433
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,491
Should we go through it again?
Let's check.

434
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,326
No.

435
00:37:40,294 --> 00:37:41,261
- Let's look at it.
- No.

436
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,497
One second.

437
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:45,798
- No.
- Come on. Let's look.

438
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:46,866
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

439
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:47,868
Let me see.

440
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,697
(First kiss)

441
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,304
But...

442
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,709
that wasn't a kiss.

443
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:34,781
It was just a peck.

444
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,297
You guys had a fight?

445
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:25,232
- Nope.
- No.

446
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,601
That's how you grow close, you know.

447
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:35,342
(Ha Young, Hui Won, Do Un)

448
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:43,816
I'll pour you some.

449
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:44,917
One, two, three,

450
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:46,186
cheers.

451
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,240
There are so many.

452
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:10,210
Excuse you.

453
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:15,281
- Hey, over there.
- What?

454
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,216
A shooting star.

455
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:17,618
Come on.

456
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,485
You're lying.

457
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,753
You're right.

458
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,022
They're sweet potatoes.

459
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:26,393
Alright.

460
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,530
I think these need to be cooked more.

461
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,331
Look.

462
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,436
We finally get to drink this.

463
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,304
You need to be careful with that.

464
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,505
Is this really your first alcohol?

465
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:40,506
Of course.

466
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:43,242
I've never had drinks before.

467
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:44,645
That other time, someone...

468
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:46,079
No.

469
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,513
- Is it too sour?
- Why are you copying me?

470
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:48,714
What do you mean?
I had it first.

471
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:50,850
The colors are different.
Your tomatoes...

472
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,351
- I told you.
- No, it's not.

473
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:54,387
What? What are you denying?

474
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:56,355
You're talking about earlier?
That guy?

475
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:58,524
Yeah.

476
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,893
That guy.
You looked excited.

477
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:01,795
You saw it, right?
Like this.

478
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:07,267
Wait.

479
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:09,570
I need to hurry.

480
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,405
Come on, run.

481
00:41:12,105 --> 00:41:13,073
Let's go, Ha Young.

482
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:24,718
(Forever young)
