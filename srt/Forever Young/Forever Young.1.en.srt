1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,468
(All characters, organizations, places,
and events in this drama are fictional)

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:02,971
(and have no connection to real life.)

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,677
Not everything
in the chicken coop is a chicken.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,515
If it's not a chicken...

5
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:24,651
Then what is it?

6
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:37,956
You're not from around here, are you?

7
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:45,472
If you were from here,
you wouldn't be staring at it like that.

8
00:00:58,752 --> 00:01:00,086
Then what could it be?

9
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,766
If it's not chicken...

10
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,077
Hey, I was wondering...

11
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:27,647
Can I have that drawing?

12
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,285
I really like what you drew, so...

13
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:49,169
Thanks.

14
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:53,807
I've been learning how to draw recently, too.

15
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,343
I forgot.

16
00:01:58,778 --> 00:01:59,613
One second!

17
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,129
Where did she go?

18
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,966
(Forever young)

19
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,768
(1 Year Later)

20
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:56,936
What's that?

21
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:57,737
Right?

22
00:02:58,405 --> 00:02:59,739
Apparently, she's from Seoul.

23
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:01,907
I heard her dad sells booze.

24
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,809
Yagwanmunju? What is that?

25
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,536
I don't know. My dad said
it's something super weird...

26
00:03:05,537 --> 00:03:06,638
that only adults drink.

27
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:09,749
So disgusting.

28
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,387
Hey, can you make booze out of this too?

29
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,258
Can you?

30
00:03:24,064 --> 00:03:27,400
Roses, chrysanthemum,
wild pear, quince, maesil,

31
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:30,736
pomegranate, sour cherries,
strawberries, deodeok,

32
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,505
ginseng, and bokbunja.

33
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:34,908
These are some of the ingredients
her dad uses to make liquor.

34
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:37,077
Yagwanmun is just one of the ingredients.

35
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,552
Seriously?

36
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:48,788
Kim Ha Young,

37
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:50,724
to celebrate your transfer,
there's somewhere we need to go.

38
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:52,692
Let's go.

39
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:54,728
Careful.

40
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:57,164
What's this?

41
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,900
Hey, wanna try this?

42
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:01,934
No, I don't want to.

43
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,470
Why not? You don't like tomatoes?

44
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,137
I don't like them.

45
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:06,472
You don't like them?

46
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:07,607
What are you, a baby?

47
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:08,975
I like this more.

48
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:10,610
Isn't it too much?

49
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,613
I'll try my best.

50
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:15,615
Alright.

51
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:18,685
"Young" from Ha Young,

52
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,021
"Won" from Hui Won.

53
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,355
"Young Won"

54
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:28,294
Twenty at midnight.

55
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:30,297
It'll start as soon as it hits midnight.

56
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,933
This will come into effect
once we become adults.

57
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,936
It's the Young Won, the Forever, List.

58
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:39,172
The Forever List?

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,907
Friends for life, okay?

60
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:42,876
You'll...

61
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,780
be my Forever-mate.

62
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,752
No, wait,
not for life, but forever.

63
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,324
There's no forever.

64
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,359
Everyone dies.

65
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,843
Hey, are you serious?
What's with you?

66
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,545
Why would you say that?

67
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,881
But...

68
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,551
since you're always eating
things like these,

69
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,286
you'll probably die before me anyway.

70
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,821
No...

71
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,857
You need to knock on wood right now.

72
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,260
No matter what happens,

73
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:36,196
promise me we'll finish this list, okay?

74
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:39,165
No.

75
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,432
Come on!

76
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,502
You haven't knocked on wood!
Do it now, hurry.

77
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:45,305
What's next here?

78
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,169
(Monday, July 7th
8 AM)

79
00:06:54,074 --> 00:06:55,341
(July 7th
Congratulations on our 20th birthday.)

80
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,643
How do we have the same birthday?

81
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:12,385
I'm sorry!

82
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,821
I'm really sorry!

83
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:15,956
I'm sorry!

84
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:05,338
I'm home.

85
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,919
Iced chocolate?

86
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,122
When will you grow up?

87
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,858
And that tomato juice makes you an adult?

88
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,927
I'm drinking veggies. It's a superfood.

89
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,229
Adults love this.

90
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:32,231
Want a sip?

91
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,501
No, I don't want it.

92
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:40,473
You know, I think she's basically our mom.

93
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,210
What?

94
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:44,511
I mean,

95
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,413
this isn't even on the menu,
but she makes it every time.

96
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:48,515
It must be annoying.

97
00:09:50,617 --> 00:09:52,819
Plus, she makes it only for me.

98
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,457
And it's free.

99
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:03,096
Come to think of it,
how selfish of you, Lee Hui Won.

100
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:07,067
You're right.

101
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,937
Real adults are supposed
to take responsibility.

102
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:14,039
Responsibility...
Let me think.

103
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,376
Responsibility, responsibility...

104
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:21,213
I know.

105
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:24,784
From now on, I'll bring my own tomatoes.

106
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,153
- Give me.
- What?

107
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:30,590
Now...

108
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,560
The first thing
we're going to put on this list is...

109
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,896
planting tomato seeds
and harvesting them ourselves.

110
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,098
What are you doing?
Are you actually writing that?

111
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:41,133
Why would you put something like that
as the first thing?

112
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:42,368
This is our bucket list.

113
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,769
Wait, listen to me.

114
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,704
Hear me out.

115
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,173
We'll get a super plump tomato
and get seeds from it.

116
00:10:47,174 --> 00:10:48,541
Then, we plant them.

117
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,142
Grow them and harvest them.

118
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:52,244
Then, we take seeds
from a plump tomato again,

119
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,580
and plant them, grow them,
harvest them.

120
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,682
Forever.

121
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,854
- What?
- I actually got it.

122
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:02,761
- What the...
- Look.

123
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:03,435
What is it?

124
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:05,558
Look. This is our first seed.

125
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,993
Are we doing this correctly?

126
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:18,371
We've just planted
5,000 seeds at the very least.

127
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,974
My legs hurt.

128
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:25,812
- Hurry up.
- Fine.

129
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,749
At least four of these will sprout, right?

130
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:33,520
I didn't want to go all out
like this from the start.

131
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,522
Excuse me, ma'am,

132
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:36,890
don't you worry.

133
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,860
You need to think positively
for anything to work.

134
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,931
This is the first thing
we're doing together.

135
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll make it work, no matter what.

136
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,437
Let's check these every week.

137
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:51,705
I'm worried.

138
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,077
We have to come every week.

139
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,914
No matter what plans you have,
this always comes first.

140
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:03,517
Okay, fine.

141
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:07,020
You'll come first, no matter what.

142
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:09,055
Forever.

143
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,553
I told you there's no such thing as forever.

144
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:05,312
<i>Tomatoes</i>

145
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:07,013
<i>Tomatoes</i>

146
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:10,116
<i>Also called tomatoes in English</i>

147
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,256
I've arrived.

148
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,816
Don't want to use it though.

149
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:09,543
Alright.

150
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:11,978
Happy birthday.

151
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:13,980
I should've given it to you yesterday,

152
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,652
but you two insisted that I give it to you
on your 20th birthday.

153
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
We can make liquor out of this?

154
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:28,562
(White sugar)

155
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,997
And this won't taste sweet?

156
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:32,866
No.

157
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:38,638
- Look.
- There we go.

158
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,074
Look how pretty.

159
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:44,009
Look.

160
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,845
Alcohol tolerance test at twenty.

161
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:47,780
You have to down the first shot.

162
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:49,382
I'm seriously so excited.

163
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:53,152
Kim Ha Young, yes!

164
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,188
I really wanted
to try doing something like this.

165
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,692
Dad said this was the best jar he had.

166
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:00,659
I wish it were prettier.

167
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,762
No, this is perfect!

168
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,131
Ma'am, you have to give this
to us on our 20th birthday, okay?

169
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,367
What? That's a year from now.

170
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:10,103
It'll be here before you know it.

171
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:13,973
Hey, let's finish writing down everything
we're gonna do when we turn twenty.

172
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:14,808
Yeah?

173
00:15:24,851 --> 00:15:27,454
Happy 20th birthday
to Ha Young and Hui Won!

174
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,291
<i>Congratulations</i>

175
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,359
Congratulations!

(19-year-old Ha Young and Hui Won)

179
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:40,534
Stop.

180
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,036
(Happy 20th birthday to us.)

181
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,238
Stop it, please!

182
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,210
You should go.

183
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:06,693
Well, actually...

184
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:09,296
I'm here as a customer.

185
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:22,108
One tomato juice and four yakgwas, please.

186
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:25,010
We don't sell tomato juice here.

187
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,912
What?

188
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:28,849
Yes, you do.

189
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,816
It's a drink just for me.

190
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:32,885
This isn't even on the menu,
but she makes it every time.

191
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,721
She makes it only for me.

192
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,734
I'm sorry!

193
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:50,170
I'm really sorry.

194
00:16:50,437 --> 00:16:51,171
I'm sorry!

195
00:16:58,945 --> 00:16:59,813
The cake...

196
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:02,716
Pardon?

197
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:04,885
You bumped into me yesterday, right?

198
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:10,123
Yesterday...

199
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,694
The cake! You're the part-timer!

200
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,165
I'm so sorry. I was in such a rush
to take care of them.

201
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,033
Did you get hurt?

202
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:23,570
I'm really sorry about that.

203
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,072
I'll buy you a more delicious cake.

204
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,909
I'm really sorry.

205
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,225
Are these your amazing creations?

206
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:48,562
That's what I always order
when I come here, though.

207
00:17:48,995 --> 00:17:51,230
May I ask for your name,
Ms. Amazing Part-timer?

208
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,299
Kim Yu Yeong.

209
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:56,670
No, not you, ma'am.

210
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,038
I write the menu,

211
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,639
and these are my creations,

212
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,910
so I think I'm the person
you want to shake hands with.

213
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,943
(January 28th
Started watering them)

214
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,712
(If you've followed the notebook,
there will be tomatoes around here.)

215
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:41,114
(It's cold, I'd better shut the door properly.)

216
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:54,026
(May 22nd
Fruit growing in progress)

217
00:18:54,027 --> 00:18:56,296
(I'm totally a tomato expert now.
Hang in there, you little ones.)

218
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,112
Why are you here?

219
00:19:47,113 --> 00:19:48,548
That's what I want to ask you.

220
00:19:51,117 --> 00:19:52,085
Are you stalking me?

221
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,386
What?

222
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,388
What's with the look?

223
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,257
I'm kinda starting to feel this is unfair.

224
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,529
Why would you come here?

225
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,599
I'm obviously here
to check on my little ones.

226
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:10,704
I mean, they suddenly started wilting
really badly a little while ago.

227
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:12,472
So...

228
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,678
I'm here to save them...

229
00:20:19,713 --> 00:20:20,814
with my hands of life.

230
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:23,950
Stop joking around and leave.

231
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:26,185
I'm busy here.

232
00:20:26,186 --> 00:20:28,154
Excuse me? No.

233
00:20:29,256 --> 00:20:30,823
If one of us has to leave,

234
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,459
then that's you, not me.

235
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:38,330
You have no idea
how hard I've been working...

236
00:20:38,331 --> 00:20:42,202
to save those little wilted ones.

237
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:53,613
It was you.

238
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,321
You've been giving
my little ones pesticides.

239
00:21:02,722 --> 00:21:04,191
I said to leave!

240
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,061
Please don't shout near the little ones.

241
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:12,232
I'm sorry, but shall we talk outside?

242
00:21:38,825 --> 00:21:41,161
What? What's happening now?

243
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:44,831
Where did you get that notebook?

244
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:52,639
It's mine.

245
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:56,343
Give it.

246
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:59,446
Come on. You need to explain
to me what's happening...

247
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,955
This is yours?

248
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,790
Yes.

249
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,928
It's mine.

250
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:20,734
Then those tomatoes...

251
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:22,836
must be yours too.

252
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:26,840
Geez.

253
00:22:29,409 --> 00:22:30,243
Even better.

254
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:37,082
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

255
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,218
You've heard of that saying, no?

256
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:40,987
Whatever.

257
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,658
Give it back.

258
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,026
Let's do this together.

259
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:48,061
Then I'll give it back.

260
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:49,863
Don't joke with me.

261
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:52,532
I'm not joking.

262
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,003
It wasn't only me.

263
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:02,509
We worked on this together.

264
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:08,448
I'm going to report you to the police.

265
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:12,686
I'm sorry,

266
00:23:13,854 --> 00:23:15,555
but I really need this.

267
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:21,995
And now I need it even more.

268
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:25,398
Let's do it together.

269
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,234
Come on. Look.

270
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,870
We've already been working together.

271
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,405
Think about it!

272
00:23:35,642 --> 00:23:36,676
Are you okay?

273
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,745
Water the weak ones in there
before you go!

274
00:23:39,746 --> 00:23:40,614
I'm sorry!

275
00:24:01,134 --> 00:24:03,435
This is the first thing
we're doing together.

276
00:24:03,436 --> 00:24:06,806
We worked on this together.

277
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,279
I really need this.

278
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:14,281
Let's do it together.

279
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:32,365
That scared me.

280
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:02,394
(Harvest tomatoes every year
from our own seeds.)

281
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:04,598
(Check on them every week.)

282
00:25:10,136 --> 00:25:11,104
Have you thought about it?

283
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:19,211
You know, we still haven't
introduced ourselves.

284
00:25:19,212 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm Do Un.

285
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,014
Lee Do Un.

286
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:28,121
And you are?

287
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:32,325
I guess you're still thinking.

288
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:33,927
Alright.

289
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,864
Kim Ha Young.

290
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:49,843
We're actually the same age.

291
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:00,320
That can't be right, yes.

292
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:26,880
How in the world...

293
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:29,883
did you think to plant them
in the middle of winter?

294
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:32,919
It was seriously so hard
to take care of them.

295
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:34,721
No one told you to.

296
00:26:35,021 --> 00:26:35,956
The notebook did.

297
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:40,827
No, I mean,

298
00:26:41,962 --> 00:26:42,896
you two did.

299
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,697
We really need to go today.

300
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,004
This might be the end.

301
00:27:27,807 --> 00:27:28,909
When will you stop?

302
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:33,079
This is the last time I'll do this.

303
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:42,923
Throw it all away.

304
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,594
I don't care what happens.

305
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:01,808
Then,

306
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:04,945
I'll just go alone.

307
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,911
Hey!

308
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:40,580
Are you serious?

309
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:43,115
- No, don't come down!
- Why, why?

310
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,684
It's dangerous. Don't come down.

311
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,419
It's okay. I'll be fine.

312
00:28:55,462 --> 00:28:56,263
No!

313
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:08,508
That's not gonna work.

314
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:12,311
Try kicking your feet hard like this.

315
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:14,280
- Okay.
- Try it.

316
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,614
- Kick hard?
- Hard.

317
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:16,416
Yeah.

318
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,051
Kick!

319
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:19,218
There!

320
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:20,352
- It's working.
- Why?

321
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:21,154
It is?

322
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:25,491
Why? What's wrong?

323
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:26,625
I think I'm about to cramp.

324
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,595
You've got to be kidding me!

325
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:35,468
I can't do this.

326
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:38,972
Hey! Hold my hand!

327
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,341
Come on!

328
00:29:43,543 --> 00:29:44,311
One...

329
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,881
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

330
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:03,663
I almost died.

331
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:06,099
Are you joking with me?

332
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:10,971
I've never joked with you.

333
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,576
Look at this.

334
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,351
I'm totally beat.

335
00:30:28,054 --> 00:30:29,222
Good job.

336
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:52,913
This?

337
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:55,916
It's just...

338
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:58,885
I wanted to fit in here.

339
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:01,821
I never said anything.

340
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:24,411
Hey,

341
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:25,645
are you crazy?

342
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,781
No, I didn't mean...

343
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:45,932
But still...

344
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:49,536
You came.

345
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,449
You could've thrown it all away.

346
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:05,886
To me,

347
00:32:08,722 --> 00:32:09,823
they hold a special meaning.

348
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:16,463
They're the result
of my first real effort.

349
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:28,108
I couldn't plan anything by myself...

350
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:30,377
until recently.

351
00:32:38,218 --> 00:32:39,085
So...

352
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:44,791
Could I do it with you?

353
00:32:59,973 --> 00:33:00,874
This...

354
00:33:01,675 --> 00:33:03,043
was harvested from the weak stem.

355
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:06,246
It's the firmest, though.

356
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,920
It was asking to be saved...

357
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:20,260
just like me.

358
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:39,880
Let's go.

359
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:45,452
Come on. Get up.

360
00:33:46,152 --> 00:33:47,187
You need to wash up first.

361
00:34:05,105 --> 00:34:12,078
(Forever young)
