Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 22

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,640
Zhaozhao.

6
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,400
What brings you here?

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,920
I heard that my father-in-law is unwell,

8
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,720
so I've come to pay a visit

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,440
and brought you the bride price.

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,240
What on earth do you want?

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,480
Tell me the truth.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
The truth is

13
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,960
I missed you

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,160
every single day

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,880
and night.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,840
Let me go.

17
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,600
Since I could poison you,

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,200
I can poison the others here.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,200
Do you get me?

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,720
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,200
Master Huangfu.

22
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,280
Zhaozhao is my fiancée,

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,880
so I've come to send the bride price.

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,640
Don't you talk nonsense again.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
Zhaozhao and I are intimate

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,680
and have agreed

27
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,000
that I'll marry her

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
in three days.

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
I hope you can come

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
to join the wedding feast.

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Zhaozhao.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Is it true?

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,880
Zhaozhao.

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,120
I've checked some wedding dresses

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,160
and haven't decided yet,

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,560
why don't you

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
come to take a look?

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,880
OK.

39
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,760
Make it clear.

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
I need to talk to him.

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Just a moment.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,160
Is what he said true?

43
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,360
Yes.

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,080
Impossible.

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,680
Nothing

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
is impossible.

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Tell me

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,000
what do you like about him?

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Mister Luo Bai

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
is a gentle, kind

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
and amiable man.

52
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
He is the...

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,760
right man.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,480
Right man?

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Is he the right man?

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
What about me?

57
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,680
Young master.

58
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,160
You will meet someone better than me.

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
So

60
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,840
this is it.

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,600
Talk to it.

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,840
Do you

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,880
still want this?

64
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,720
I can manage

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,640
to accept it.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,920
Manage?

67
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Then forget it.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,440
How could you take back

69
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,880
the thing you gave out?

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,120
Then how could you

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,880
break the other's gift?

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,880
It won't be broken again,

73
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
It will never be broken.

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,680
For all that I said today,

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,680
I said it

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,520
sincerely.

77
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,880
The love breaks with the jade.

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
What?

79
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,520
Zhaozhao is marrying Luo Bai?

80
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
That's impossible.

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Obviously, Zhaozhao

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,520
likes my nephew.

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm experienced in relationships,

84
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,640
I won't make a mistake.

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
It's true.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Mister Luo Bai's bride price

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
was sent to her home.

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,520
What happened?

89
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,600
I've been admiring you,

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
so I sneaked into this mansion

91
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,640
to take a look at you.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
As for the drug,

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,720
I

94
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
have no idea about it.

95
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:05,960
You...

96
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,840
You...

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
You what?

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Find me

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,080
a physician right now.

100
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
Young master.

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,320
Your lips

102
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
are

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,520
so soft

104
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,440
to kiss.

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
This

106
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,560
is for you.

107
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,680
I engraved the words on it.

108
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,840
It's kind of ugly.

109
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,920
Give it back to me then.

110
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,560
Come on.

111
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,920
Young master.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,440
You will meet someone better than me.

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,960
So

114
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,280
this is it.

115
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,320
Talk to it.

116
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,200
For all that I said today,

117
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,320
I said it

118
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,320
sincerely.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,280
The love breaks with the jade.

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
If she loves Luo Bai,

121
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,600
why did she tell me she loved me?

122
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
Is everything all fake?

123
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
She got close to me

124
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,520
to kill me

125
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,760
and wipe out the Huangfus.
