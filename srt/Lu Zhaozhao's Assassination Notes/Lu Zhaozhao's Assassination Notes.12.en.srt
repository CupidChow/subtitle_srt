Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 12

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,160
Isn't that Riyue's bracelet?

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
You said you ditched it.

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,080
Your heart is pure and tranquil,

8
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,160
then nothing scares you.

9
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
Come in with me.

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,840
You are an adult,

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,440
so stop dawdling.

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,480
How dare you

13
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,520
get on top of me?

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
Get off me now.

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,640
No way.

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,920
You'd better get me off you

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,000
or I will...

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
What?

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,320
What will you do?

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
This.

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,320
What are you doing?

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,160
So itchy.

23
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,280
Nannan.

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,240
Why did he keep my bracelet after picking it up?

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,160
Did he...

26
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
- The bell bracelet... - It's so late...

27
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
- I can't sleep... - The bell bracelet...

28
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
Young master.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,560
The bracelet you stole...

30
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
I didn't steal it.

31
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,440
I picked it.

32
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,360
Did you pick it up

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,560
without returning it to me

34
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,480
because you wanted

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,560
to give it to Meng Ziran?

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,080
What?

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,200
What did Meng Ziran have to do with it?

38
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,160
Aren't you getting married?

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
Didn't you think

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,640
my bracelet was pretty

41
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,040
and want to give it to her?

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,640
I accepted her proposal for Ying.

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
As for the bracelet...

45
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,320
Meng Ziran and Ying?

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,600
Then it doesn't make sense

47
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,680
that you kept the bracelet

48
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
without giving it

49
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
to Meng Ziran or me.

50
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,200
Un...

51
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,920
Unless...

52
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,800
Unless...

53
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,120
what?

54
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Unless?

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
My virginity

56
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
was robbed by this black-hearted woman.

57
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,640
Unless?

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Ying.

59
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,360
A friend of mine

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,920
picked up someone's stuff

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,880
without returning it

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
but carried it.

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
He meant nothing else,

64
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,680
but...

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
You are in love.

66
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,520
It's not me,

67
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,960
but a friend.

68
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,520
Your heart is pure,

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,960
then nothing scares you.

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,760
Tranquil in spirit,

71
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,480
and be selflessly devoted to one,

72
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
you will be calmed.

73
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
Unless...

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,120
Unless

75
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
you like me.

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,800
Lu Zhaozhao.

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Calm.

78
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,000
Calm.

79
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't be too happy.

80
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,400
Be cool.

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,240
It's weird.

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
Why am I so glad?

83
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,880
Young master.

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Why are you up

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,200
so late?

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,280
Aren't you afraid of being late?

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,880
Didn't you forbid me to go there?

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
Go if you want.

89
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,960
Up to you.

90
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,060
"The Memorial Tablet of Fu Han"

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
Traitors

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
go to hell.

93
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,820
None of you can escape.

94
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,480
Look, she's coming.

95
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
A woman of easy virtue.

96
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,960
Right.

97
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
Gossip?

98
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
Many people said

99
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
that she walked with two men

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,560
on the street yesterday

101
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
and didn't want to let anyone go.

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,120
Right.

103
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,520
She is embroiled with Huangfu

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
and also tries to get close to Mr. Luo Bai.

105
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Shameless.

106
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Yes.

107
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
It's not true.

108
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,680
What do you mean?

109
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,600
Hey.

110
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,080
Stop gossiping.

111
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
You all misunderstood her.

112
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,280
This

113
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,280
can't be true.

114
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
Meng Ziran.

115
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,520
I didn't expect that you'd speak for me.

116
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,440
Thank you.

117
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,200
Come on.

118
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
Look at her background,

119
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,080
appearance

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,240
and figure,

121
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,040
how can Huangfu and Mr. Luo Bai

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,280
love her?

123
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't talk nonsense.

124
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,640
I...

125
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,640
Go.

126
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
The street vendors all saw you that day.

127
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
Huangfu and Mr. Luo Bai were all...

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,760
Enough.

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Now you own

130
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,480
what I dreamed of.

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm so furious.

132
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
What do you want?

133
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,040
What do I want?

134
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
I will teach you a good lesson.

135
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,200
Riyue, take care.

136
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,960
- Mr. Luo Bai. - Thank you, Mr. Luo Bai.

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you doing?
