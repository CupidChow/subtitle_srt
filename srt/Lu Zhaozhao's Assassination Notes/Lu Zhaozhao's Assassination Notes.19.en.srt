Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 19

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
You always bear it all yourself.

6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,840
Since you don't say it,

7
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,360
I'll find out myself.

8
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,720
What do you want to know?

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
You again.

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,360
Lu Zhaozhao.

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,360
How are you doing?

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,160
Why did you come here?

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
So naive.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,920
What can you find in this way?

15
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,440
It was you,

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,440
who made those troubles

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,640
with the Huangfu Bank.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,120
Why would you always do that to them?

19
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,800
Just do whatever I ask you

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,640
because I'm the rule.

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,240
Well,

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,520
by the way,

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,880
there is no cure

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,320
for Cloud Nine Powder.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,040
Zhaozhao.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,320
Aunt.

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,200
You have been worried recently.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,560
Does my nephew neglect you?

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,640
No.

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,120
I can't help with his business.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,120
He, since childhood,

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,440
has been such a lad.

33
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
His mother

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
passed away early

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,000
and his father became a Taoist,

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,680
so he had to carry the heavy burden of the bank.

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,280
Now he's used to handling things alone.

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,120
What do you want to do?

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,160
I want to do nothing.

40
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
Here is the tea

41
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,600
I'm leaving.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Young master.

43
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
What do you want to do?

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
I want to do nothing.

45
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,600
You are mimicking me.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Can't I?

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
Don't tickle me.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,880
I'll fight back.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,400
What's wrong?

50
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,560
You passed out in the daytime.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm fine.

52
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,880
Maybe I haven't rested well recently.

53
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,920
I didn't care much about you

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,480
but got you implicated.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,120
I...

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,960
Huangfu Yi.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,640
What's up?

58
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
You don't feel well?

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm fine.

60
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,720
I...

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,360
I just want to look at you.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,320
Then do it.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
Huangfu Yi.

64
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
I wonder how much longer

65
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
we can be like this.

66
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
What is wrong with her?

67
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
Is she upset?

68
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,920
Young master,

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,160
What's up?

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,560
Nothing.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
I just want to call your name.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
If one day,

73
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm not around you...

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,440
No way,

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,800
I won't let it happen.

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,320
It's the last Soul Return Pill.

77
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,280
Young master.

78
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
Why do you want to let off fireworks?

79
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,000
Young master.

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
When did you become

81
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,160
such a romantic man?

82
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,960
I am a romantic man

83
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,160
from

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,760
the very beginning.

85
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,040
Huangfu Yi.

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,920
Thank you.

87
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
The time I have spent with you

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,480
is short and wonderful like the fireworks.

89
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,280
Your qi and blood are abundant,

90
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,320
but your pulse is drifting

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
and erratic

92
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,320
which is hard to judge.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's not like an illness,

94
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,520
but

95
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
poison

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
which is long-lost.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
The Cloud Nine Powder?

98
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,040
Right.

100
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,080
It's the Cloud Nine Powder.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
So far as I know,

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,880
few people can make such poison.

103
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
It smells like honey

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,040
and tastes like ordinary rice wine.

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,800
By the way,

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,480
there are red spots on the wrist of the person who made it.

107
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
Can it be...

108
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,320
The red spots like before.

109
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,880
You are Fu Yu.

110
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Brother Yu.

111
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,280
You finally recognized me.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,360
How can it be him?

113
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,360
It smells so good.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Is there honey in it?

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
Don't drink it.

116
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Brother Yu.

117
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,080
I wasn't stealing it.

118
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,600
It smelt specially,

119
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,200
so I...

120
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,400
You are such

121
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,960
a curious lass.

122
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Anyway, it's not a big deal to tell you.

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
What's in it is poison.

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,560
It smells like honey

125
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
and tastes like rice wine.

126
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Won't it hurt people?

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
Brother Yu,

128
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,520
why do you have such a thing?

129
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,280
Don't be afraid.

130
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
My family's poison

131
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,600
is only used on the bad guys and the outsiders,

132
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,760
and you are my family.

133
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,560
I cherish you so much.

134
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,840
Zhaozhao.

135
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,120
Where are you going?

136
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you know the person who made it?

137
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,039
Let me go with you.

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,280
No.

139
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,679
I want to take a walk

140
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,520
to loose.

141
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,799
Linlang.

142
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,440
Please keep this thing

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,600
from anybody,

144
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,440
especially the young master.

145
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,000
OK.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,120
I agree.

147
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,280
Nannan.

148
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,040
Here you come.

149
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Did you send me

150
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,080
to kill Huangfu Yi?

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,320
What are you talking about, Nannan?
