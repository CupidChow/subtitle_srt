00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 17

5
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,680
Are you going back?

6
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,280
Because

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,760
you can't leave him, right?

8
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,520
Since my childhood,

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,040
I've been cherishing my life.

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
I thought about nothing

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,760
except for living well.

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
Now I have realized

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,840
that there is someone for whom

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,680
you'd risk your life.

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,680
How was your life outside?

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,240
Explain it clearly to my nephew later.

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
I know him so well.

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,840
Hey,

19
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
are you available?

20
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,880
Riyue has something...

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,440
Aunt.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
She is Lu Zhaozhao,

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,520
not Zhou Riyue.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
It's fine.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Don't worry.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
Take your time.

27
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,600
Young master.

28
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
Where are you going so late?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
From now on,

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm living at the study.

31
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,040
How can you sleep there?

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,600
You don't need to worry about that.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,640
I think

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
it's a safe place at least

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,040
because there is

36
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,920
no assassin.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Since my childhood, I've been cherishing my life.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
I thought about nothing

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,640
except for living well.

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,560
Now I have realized

41
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,880
that there is someone for whom

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
you'd risk your life.

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
Can't you bear it?

44
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Who are you?

45
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,440
You know the answer.

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
I am you.

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
What on earth do you want?

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,360
Did you forget how our elder sister died?

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,960
She was forced to death by the Huangfus.

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,480
I have let go of the past.

51
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
That's what I hate the most.

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
You can't be too considerate of others,

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,960
why not think much of yourself

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
and satisfy yourself?

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,040
It's reasonable in the world of the survival of the fittest.

56
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Come on.

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
Trust me.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,400
Only I

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
will always be with you.

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Huangfu.

61
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,000
Eat.

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,080
Huangfu.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,160
I will come again.

64
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,280
Young master.

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,080
Why was Meng Ziran here?

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,800
Is that your concern?

67
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,840
I was wrong

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,400
to try to kill and lie to you,

69
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,360
but I...

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,520
You did try to kill me

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
and lie to me,

72
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
so no need to explain it.

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Young master,

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,820
are you gonna keep treating her like this?

75
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,360
Not your business.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,240
Nephew.

77
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,220
If you see a thing from different aspects,

78
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
you will get distinct results.

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
I was so nervous to be an assassin the first time.

80
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,680
The stupid young master is so pretty.

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,120
Ms. Linlang was so unreliable

82
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,400
that she mistook the aphrodisiac for the poison.

83
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
Anyway, I like that.

84
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,640
No.

85
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,840
I mean

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,480
I don't want to kill him so much.

87
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
But if I don't,

88
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,000
I will die.

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm so annoyed.

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,040
What should I do?

91
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm kindly fond of him.

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,440
This

93
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,440
is for you.

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
A present in return for your turtles.

95
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,320
Stop drinking.

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,320
You deceived

97
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,240
my imposing,

98
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,920
talented,

99
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,200
just and slender brother Huangfu,

100
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,440
so how can you be grieved?

101
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,400
I will never love Huangfu Yi.

102
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,680
Just drink.

103
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Huangfu Yi?

104
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,720
Why did you come here?

105
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,360
Didn't you say you'd never talk to me?
