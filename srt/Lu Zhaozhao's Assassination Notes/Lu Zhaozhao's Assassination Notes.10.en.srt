Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 10

5
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
Young master,

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,600
her pulse shows

7
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,360
that she is all right.

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,520
As for the reason she passed out,

9
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,760
I couldn't find it out.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,640
Thank you anyway.

11
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,120
Riyue.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,880
Time to take the medicine.

13
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Mother.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,080
I don't want to have it.

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,520
It's too bitter.

16
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
Unless

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,840
you read a poem for me.

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,680
O geese, O geese, O geese!

19
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,720
You crane your neck and sing to sky your song sweet.

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,120
Your white feathers float on green water with ease.

21
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,880
You swim through clear waters with your red-webbed feet.

22
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,760
You have come to.

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
Thank you, young master,

24
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,920
for taking care of me last night.

25
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,600
You must not have a good rest.

26
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,760
I rested so well

27
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
as I didn't look after you.

28
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,280
Thank you.

29
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,400
Huangfu Yi.

30
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,200
Tea is alkaline

31
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
and may offset vinegar in your body.

32
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,960
You've been uneasy recently.

33
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
Are you afraid that Riyue

34
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,280
is too close to Mister Luo Bai?

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,480
No.

36
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,880
So it's true.

37
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,400
I will find you a wife later

38
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,600
so I can kick you out of my mansion.

39
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,440
Huangfu.

40
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
Huangfu.

41
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,760
I,

42
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,600
Mengzi Ran,

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,480
is proposing to you.

44
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,480
It's just a small part of my dowries.

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,400
My family

46
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,160
have 22 mines.

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Huangfu,

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
what do you think?

49
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,080
My pleasure.

50
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,280
He is getting married

51
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
with Meng Ziran.

52
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,440
Why does this feels so strange?

53
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,040
I must be worried that I can't finish the task

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
and can't get the cure.

55
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,720
Right.

56
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,680
Riyue?

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
Mister Luo Bai.

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,000
Is there something bothering you?

59
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,560
Tell me

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
if you don't mind.

61
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Mister Luo Bai.

62
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,320
It's not me,

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,040
but a friend of mine

64
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,000
who has met a nasty master.

65
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,280
Huangfu.

66
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,160
Why don't...

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,400
Alas.

68
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
I'm too shy to say it.

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,520
We may fix the wedding day

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,400
just in case.

71
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Very well.

72
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
I'll make the call for Ying.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,080
What?

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,320
Ying?

75
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,760
Yes.

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,520
These present the affection of your wife-to-be.

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
Huangfu.

78
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,920
What do you mean?

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,680
You came to propose

80
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
without saying who that man was.

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,240
Well,

82
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,440
Ying is of your age,

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,280
so you two

84
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,760
are matched very well.

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,960
We are not.

86
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,440
Huangfu.

87
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Get lost.

88
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,200
You're not qualified.

89
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,280
How do you know

90
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
I think you are not qualified?

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
You...

92
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm so mad.

93
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
So you...

94
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,920
your friend

95
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,800
and her master, how are they now?

96
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,160
Nothing special.

97
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
It's just

98
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,480
her master is getting married.

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,360
The heart...

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,640
She said her heart

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,240
didn't feel so good.

102
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
You mean feeling

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
a bit upset,

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,400
suffocated

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
and a bit angry?

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,120
Right, Mister.

107
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,120
That's what you're taking about.

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
This friend of yours

109
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,680
might be in love with her master.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,520
No...

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Absolutely impossible.

112
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,160
It seems you know your friend

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,680
pretty well.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,720
Well...

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,560
Of course.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,040
We have known each other

117
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,720
since we were kids.

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
Since you are worried...

119
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,680
I mean

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,000
since your friend is worried,

121
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,040
why don't you come to the academy

122
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
and paint a picture for her?

123
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
A good painting is a nice gift

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
for it calms the heart.

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Young master.

126
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,280
Riyue went to Sihan Academy.

127
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,960
No need to report such a trifle

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,080
to me.

129
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,280
She has no class today,

130
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,880
then why did she go there?

131
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,280
Huangfu.

132
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,480
Lin Zyizhi.

133
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
Is this your home?

134
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,240
You don't even knock the door.

135
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,440
Huangfu.

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,150
I just saw Zhou Riyue and Luo Bai

137
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
flirting

138
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
with each other.

139
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,030
Are...

140
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,440
Are they in love?
