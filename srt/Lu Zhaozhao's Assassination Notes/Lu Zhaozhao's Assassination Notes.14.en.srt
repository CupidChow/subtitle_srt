Episode 14

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Dear nephew.

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,040
I've asked about it.

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,000
Riyue's birthday is approaching.

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,400
It's the manual of love I wrote

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,680
with all my experiences this life.

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,240
Read it carefully

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,920
before it's too late.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,160
I don't need it.

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,200
Yes,

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,880
you need it desperately.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,160
Trust me.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,400
When you choose the right way,

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,760
you'll get there easily.

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,000
Huangfu.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,480
Ms. Linglong said you read her manual...

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,160
This Linglong's Mystique on Love is a bit difficult.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,880
Ms. Linglong's skills

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,320
are different from mine.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,880
So we need to practise carefully.

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,680
No.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,160
Linglong's Mystique on Love?

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
Are you sure you'll learn it?

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
It's from Aunt Linglong.

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,200
She told me secretly

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,120
to learn it before my birthday.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,639
So do you just follow her order?

31
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,160
I don't want to,

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
but she said

33
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,840
that Huangfu Yi would learn it, too.

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,720
Then I'd better learn it.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
It's just out of curiosity.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,600
Anyway,

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,320
I won't learn it

38
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,560
because it doesn't match my charisma.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,040
She also said

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,800
that I'll get the silver as a reward.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,200
With the silver,

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,480
I can buy your stuff.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,600
I'm in.

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,120
Get close to her suddenly

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,680
and praise her

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,360
to make her bewildered.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
What a beauty,

48
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,880
elegant and graceful.

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,200
Come on.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
It works a bit.

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,200
Then

52
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,600
use the intentional or unintentional touching

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
to make her fall into a reverie.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,880
At last,

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
take a bite of the thing she eats

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,440
to make her heart beat faster.

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
Lower.

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,880
Woman,

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,360
there is no way out.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,520
You have...

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,840
You have drawn my attention successfully.

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,840
That's a good line.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll use it next time.

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,440
All right.

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,920
Happy birthday

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,120
to our Riyue.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,960
Cheers.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,280
Thank you, Aunt.

69
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Nephew.

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,920
Eat.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,480
My hands hurt.

72
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,080
I need to be fed.

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,160
Open your mouth.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,560
Is it yummy?

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
I think...

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
Certainly, it is.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
My views are

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
yours.

79
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,040
I screw up.

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,680
I must have given them the wrong versions.

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Come to my room later.

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
I have a surprise for you.

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
That's my boy.

84
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,320
What's the surprise?

85
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,680
Zhou Riyue.

86
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
It's the most popular way of proposal in the West.

87
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,680
Mr. Zhou.

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
Are you willing to be my wife

89
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,000
and spend the rest

90
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,120
of your life with me?

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,760
This is a surprise for you.

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,360
This one is called Forever Happiness

93
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
and this is Eternal Life.

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,200
You like it?

95
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,200
Yes.

96
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,280
I can't like it more.

97
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,880
The birthday gift you prepared is...

98
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
so unique.

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,120
I do know her.

100
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,320
It's Nannan's birthday.

101
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
I wonder if she'll like

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
this painting.

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
Did you forget who you are

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,160
after being Luo Bai for so long?

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,840
Fu Yu.
