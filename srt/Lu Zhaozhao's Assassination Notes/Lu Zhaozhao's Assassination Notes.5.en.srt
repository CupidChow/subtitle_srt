Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 5

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,160
Huangfu Yi.

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
I have no choice.

7
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
Don't blame me.

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,400
Don't revenge on me.

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,680
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,600
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
- I'm sorry. - What are you doing?

13
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,200
Are you incensing the dead?

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,840
I...

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,540
Aunt Linglong.

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,120
Meng Ziran, cousin of Lin Yizhi.
Aunt Linglong.

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,360
Meng Ziran, cousin of Lin Yizhi.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,160
Like I said,
Meng Ziran, cousin of Lin Yizhi.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,240
Meng Ziran, cousin of Lin Yizhi.
this suspicious bad woman
Meng Ziran, cousin of Lin Yizhi.

20
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,880
this suspicious bad woman

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,560
is scheming against brother Huangfu.

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,120
Ms. Meng,

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,280
Riyue won't do that.

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,160
She even pricked

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,680
my imposing,

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,840
talented,

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,480
just and slender brother Huangfu.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
Why does it sound familiar?

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,160
Brother.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Is Lin Yizhi your...?

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,800
My cousin.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,480
Cousin.

33
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,600
That makes sense.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
One can't be acupunctured

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,560
after taking tonics

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
or he may die.

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,040
Is that severe?

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,880
Riyue!

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
You wicked woman.

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Give me my brother Huangfu back.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,160
Be quiet.

42
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
My boy.

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,880
Things may be different

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,680
if

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,080
the correct acupoint is pricked,

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,240
and one's meridians may be dredged.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,360
That is why the young master woke up.

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,800
Let me prescribe him later

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,720
and I'm sure the residual poison will be cleaned up.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,920
She didn't mean to cure him.

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Huangfu,

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,080
you can't be blinded by that vicious woman.

53
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,120
You used the needle accurately,

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,320
so it was not by accident.

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,680
You are a good doctor.

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,800
I admire you.

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,240
I'm flattered.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,240
It's good anyway.

59
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
I didn't want him to die actually.

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,120
However,

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
as long as he's alive,

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
I'll be killed by the poison.

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,200
How will you handle this notebook?

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,680
How could he find that book?

65
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,000
I have to get away now.

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,240
What do you think?

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,520
A girl will be shy

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,080
when her thought is exposed.

69
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
I think you will bury it

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,680
back where you found it.

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
Nonsense.

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
If he finds out that it's my notebook,

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,360
I can survive

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,200
a few days more by leaving now.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,440
Riyue.

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,400
Young master.

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,880
Are you

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
leaving here?

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,440
No.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
I just climbed up...

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,800
to see the moon.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Where is the moon?

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,120
I have

84
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,240
to climb up there to know it.

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Hell.

86
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,920
He won't let me go.

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Ying is right.

88
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,800
A girl is too shy

89
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,760
to let the others know her thoughts.

90
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
Is this yours?

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,440
It's not mine.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,080
It's not mine.

93
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,120
She refuses to admit it.

94
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,280
So Ying knows girls well.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
It's not yours?

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
I haven't read it anyway.

97
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
If it's not yours,

98
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,480
I'll ditch it.

99
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,680
Wait.

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,400
Haven't you read it?

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,800
And Ying?

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,840
He hasn't, either?

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,640
No.

104
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,520
Well, it hits me

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
that maybe it's mine.

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,320
It's mine.

107
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
It's good you haven't read it.

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
This is my painting book.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
My poor paintings

110
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,240
may be intolerable to your eyes.

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
Since you like painting,

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,680
let me send you to Sihan Painting Academy.

113
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,200
It's late.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
You need to rest.

115
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
He hasn't read it.

116
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,520
It freaked me out.

117
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,880
Wait.

118
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,840
Sihan Painting Academy?

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
What is that?

120
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,800
According to Huangfu Yi,

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,640
the Sihan Painting Academy

122
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,360
was just opened

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,400
by Luo Bai, a great scholar.

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Isn't that the place where I tried to kill him before?

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Is this a coincidence?

126
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,600
Did Huangfu Yi arrange for it on purpose?

127
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,840
I have

128
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,000
to learn to paint before killing someone.

129
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,880
What?

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
It's you.

131
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,400
You did it deliberately.

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
So what?

133
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
How dare you snatch Huangfu from me.

134
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,320
You wicked woman.

135
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Do you know who I am?

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,560
I am Meng Ziran,

137
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,960
the niece of the Lins,

138
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,760
and I grew up with Huangfu Yi

139
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,280
as a childhood sweetheart.

140
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,880
I don't want to compete with you,

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,040
but

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,600
I have shared his bed already

143
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,600
It was he

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,240
who sent me here just now

145
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,720
and he was so reluctant

146
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,200
to leave me

147
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,920
that he must kiss

148
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,440
and hug me.

149
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,600
Come and make it clear.

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
How could Huangfu...

152
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Let go.

153
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,320
Why does he seem familiar?

154
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,520
Are you alright?

155
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes.

156
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
You have to explain it to me.

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,280
Meng Ziran.

158
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,040
- Let go. - No.

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
Let go.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,720
You are supposed to help each other.

161
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,480
I'd better stay out of their business.

162
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,400
The class begins now.

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,520
There are four grades in painting.

164
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Skillful Grade,

165
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,080
Carefree Grade,

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,520
Divine Grade,

167
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,840
and Marvelous Grade.

168
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
The Skillful Grade

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
means...

170
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,200
Young master.

171
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,520
What's up?

172
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,760
Riyue fought Ms. Meng

173
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
at the academy

174
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,000
and said she shared your bed.

175
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,520
She also said

176
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,559
that you kissed

177
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,960
and hugged her each time she left.

178
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,920
No need to report it

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,480
from now on.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,360
Yes.

181
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,000
Then

182
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,920
will you return the bracelet to her?

183
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,280
What bracelet?

184
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,280
I ditched it long ago.

185
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,920
OK.

186
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
This is Lin Yizhi's new tavern.

187
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,080
It's nothing special.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,280
It seems no one is here.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
I can hide the book here.

190
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
That's it.

191
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,160
Welcome to Water Cloud Dream.

192
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,280
I am...

193
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Bumpkin?

194
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Why are you here?

195
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,960
I need a room

196
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,040
for 53 days.

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,400
Are you kidding me?

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Can

199
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,080
you afford it?

200
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,680
My tavern is built

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,000
by Golden Phoebe

202
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,240
and I have spent so much on each thing here.

203
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,160
Even a day here costs...

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,920
The deposit.

205
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
Welcome.

206
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,160
The notebook should be safe in that room.

207
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,200
But what's the point of keeping that junk?

208
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,640
Do they know how hard it is to deal with Huangfu Yi?

209
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Now

210
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
there are only 53 days left.

211
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Why am I so unlucky?

212
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,360
So,

213
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,080
could I be unluckier?

214
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,960
Sorry.

215
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,400
Yes.
