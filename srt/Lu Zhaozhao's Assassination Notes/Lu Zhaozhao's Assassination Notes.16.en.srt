00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 16

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,360
Huangfu Yi.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,200
Mister Luo Bai.

8
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,040
You seem to be worried.

9
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,280
Something happened at the Huangfus' mansion?

10
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,520
Nothing.

11
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Maybe

12
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,400
you should stay at the academy for a while.

13
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm good.

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,960
I have a room at Water-cloud Dream.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,240
It occurs to me

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,280
that I need an assistant,

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
would you like to help me?

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,800
An assistant?

19
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,440
I don't think I'm a good fit.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,600
I've looked for one for so long

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,760
and can't find anyone suitable.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Besides,

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
won't it

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
cost you much to stay in a hotel?

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
Right.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,600
All right then.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,240
Eat something, nephew.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,000
You can't hold up if you don't eat.

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:32,960
Aunt.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm fine.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,000
About Riyue...

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,520
Aunt,

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,320
I have to handle many things at the bank.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,680
So why don't you go to rest?

35
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,040
Mister.

36
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,240
The paintings are sorted out.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,560
Thank you.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,960
Mister,

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,240
something is wrong with your eyes?

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,520
I'm fine.

41
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,840
An old problem.

42
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Mister,

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,480
don't underestimate the ailment.

44
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,520
All right.

45
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Nannan.

46
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,400
How do you know my pet name?

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Isn't it obvious?

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,560
You are...

49
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,920
Same red spots as when I was a kid.

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
You are Fu Yu.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,720
Brother Yu.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,200
You finally recognized me.

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,600
Brother Yu.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Why did you change your name?

55
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,920
By the way,

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,120
where is sister Fu Han?

57
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,600
Let me

58
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
explain it to you later.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
You shall call me Luo Bai

60
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,160
when there are other people.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,800
My sister

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
is no longer in this world.

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,320
When

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,840
I was mistreated by the mistress,

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,080
it was you and Fu Han who saved me.

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,080
I would have been eaten

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,600
by the beasts in the mountains

68
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,080
without you.

69
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,320
I  knew you were Nannan,

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
but I didn't know

71
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,520
that you were from the Lus.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,720
Nannan is my pet name.

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,200
I went to look for you afterward,

74
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,480
but you moved away.

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,320
I wanted to repay you when I found you,

76
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,400
to think sister Fu Han...

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,640
She will rest in peace

78
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,160
since you've come to see her.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Lu Zhaozhao.

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
So you are Lu Yao's daughter.

81
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,800
How dare you deceive

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,440
my talented,

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:21,960
righteous

84
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,240
and handsome Mister Huangfu

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
as well as me?

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,000
Lu Zhaozhao!

87
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
You should apologize.

89
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,360
To think I helped you to chase Huangfu.

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
Lady Linglong came here

91
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,400
and I led her to your room.

92
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
Should you have any difficulties,

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,080
just tell her.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Thank you,

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
Lin Yizhi.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
I'm not taking you as my friend,

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm just doing this for Huangfu

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
though I don't think you are a bad person.

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,680
Just go.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,080
Thank you.

101
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,560
Aunt.

102
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,720
Sit.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
I never investigated you

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,640
because I believed that you're a good girl.

105
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry, Aunt.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
Don't say that.

107
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,960
You are not supposed to apologize

108
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
to me.

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,520
The notebook...

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
I get it.

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,120
I've read the last part

112
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
which records

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
your affection and sincerity

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,960
to my nephew.

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,920
We've been living together for a while,

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
so I have faith in your personality.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,280
Nannan.

118
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Brother Yu.

119
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,680
I didn't see you just now,

120
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
so

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,600
I put it on your table.

122
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
You are going back?

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000
Is it because

124
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
you can't leave him?
