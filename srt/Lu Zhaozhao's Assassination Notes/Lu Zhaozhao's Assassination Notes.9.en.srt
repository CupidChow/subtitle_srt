Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 9

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,960
This is a sectional examination for your study.

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,560
I hope you can take it easy.

7
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,480
Do you wanna make it a race?

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
And the last place will be punished.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Me?

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,080
Raise your hands if you agree,

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,520
and the minority obeys the majority.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,160
Well,

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,720
that's the deal.

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,560
Young master.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,520
What's up?

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Riyue left a note to you

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,880
to invite you to grade the paintings at the Academy today.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,760
I'm busy.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,320
I'm sure a girl wants her Mr. Right

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
to be there at every important moment

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,160
in her life.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,440
There's nothing to do with me.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,520
Your heart is pure,

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
then nothing scares you.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,760
Tranquil in spirit,

26
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,600
and be selflessly devoted to one,

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
you will be calmed.

28
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,920
Isn't it too ugly?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Right.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm sure it's the last place.

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,360
What a mess!

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
That painting is...

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
With no doubt.

34
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,240
It's so unsightly

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
that it must be Zhou Riyue's.

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Sir,

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
it wasn't like that when I finished it.

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Huh?

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
Don't you dare admit it?

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
How did you have the cheek

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
to hand such junk in?

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Sir.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
Tell us

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
which one is the worst.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,760
Horseradish,

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
also called mustard,

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,760
it's juice is so spicy.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,640
Come on.

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,360
Drink it up.

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,240
Last place.

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,560
Hurry up.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,840
That asshole,

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,280
why is he so slow?

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,960
Now.

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
What are you looking at?

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,560
I'd better not intervene.

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,520
Don't waste our time.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Come on.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,320
Hurry up.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
Drink it.

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,920
Now...

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,480
Huangfu?

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
Young master?

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
Young master.

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,920
It was my fault.

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,440
I was so useless

67
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,960
that I couldn't keep my painting intact.

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
What?

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,600
Don't worry about me anyway.

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,360
You...

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,920
Since I rank the last,

72
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,560
I deserve the punishment.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,079
It is not spicy

74
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,200
or gross.

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,480
You, wicked woman,

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,520
stop acting.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,520
The rest

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,480
is mine.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,960
Huangfu.

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
Huangfu.

81
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
You are amazing.

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
Zhou Riyue is a member of my family.

83
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
If you do it again,

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,440
I will not be so polite.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,000
Huangfu.

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,720
Young master.

87
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,320
Thank you for helping me today.

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,000
No need.

89
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,600
I just happened to see it

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
and didn't want you to humiliate my family.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Thank you.

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,240
By the way,

93
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
if someone bullies you again,

94
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,520
tell her you are a member here.

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Young master.

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,960
I find

97
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,560
that you're a good man

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,120
though

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,240
you are a bit serious.

100
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,720
Serious?

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,400
The new tonic.

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,080
Put it away.

103
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
Where's my nephew?

104
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,840
He went to Niucheng to collect Mr. Tang's debt.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
He just keeps working all the day.

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
So how can I have my grandnephew

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,280
once his vitality is weakened?

108
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Riyue.

109
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,480
You should try

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,000
to make my nephew love you more.

111
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,760
Ms. Linglong,

112
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,360
Mr. Luo of the Sihan Painting Academy

113
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,640
came for a visit.

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,240
Luo Bai?

115
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,680
See him off.

116
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
How can anyone

117
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,600
come to see the Huangfus as he wants?

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Aunt Linglong,

119
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
but he is...

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
Riyue.

121
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,280
Grow up

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,960
and don't be deceived by his appearance.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,920
The bad guy outside is so...

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,680
good that I like him.

125
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,040
Since Riyue drank too much mustard juice,

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm worried about her.

127
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
Thank you, Mr. Luo,

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm fine.

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
Mr. Luo

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,360
isn't just attractive,

131
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
but thoughtful.

132
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,400
I'm sure your parents are proud of you.

133
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,080
They passed away early,

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
so I was brought up by my sister.

135
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,200
Then I'm sure your sister

136
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,840
is charming like me.

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
She...

138
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,560
is fine.

139
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,520
Seriously?

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,720
I just didn't take Soul Return Pill today,

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
how can I feel sick at once?

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Riyue,

143
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,200
are you all right?

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,160
Mr. Luo Bai.

145
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,320
Master Huangfu.

146
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,240
Young master,

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,240
didn't you go to Niucheng to collect debt?

148
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,040
Ying isn't here,

149
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,880
so you come with me.

150
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,520
No.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,000
Mr. Luo Bai,

152
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
what do you mean?

153
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,880
Riyue doesn't feel well,

154
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,760
so she needs a rest.

155
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,520
Don't bother

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,240
to worry about my maid.

157
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,600
I don't agree.

158
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
Riyue is my disciple,

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,480
so I'm obliged to be responsible

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,480
for my disciples of the Academy.

161
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,960
You do care about your disciples so much.

162
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,760
That's my responsibility,

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
and you don't have to worry about it.

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
This is the Huangfus' mansion,

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,600
not the Academy.

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,280
Young master.

167
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,560
Put me down.

168
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,080
Put me down.

169
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,880
Young master.

170
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,040
What's wrong?

171
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes.

172
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,680
What is wrong with me?

173
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,320
Nothing.

174
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
- But you just... - Do you...

175
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,720
... know Mr. Luo Bai so well?

176
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,160
Mr. Luo Bai

177
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
is an upright,

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,120
aboveboard

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
and gifted man.

180
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,160
He took care of me at the Academy

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,000
and came here because he worried about me.

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
An upright,

183
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,560
aboveboard

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,800
and gifted man

185
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,600
who worries about you.?

186
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,840
Zhou Riyue,

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,360
are you

188
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
fond of him?

189
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,920
No.

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
I'm just speaking the truth.

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Between him and me,

192
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,680
who is more upright,

193
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,160
aboveboard

194
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,280
and gifted?

195
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,040
Zhou Riyue!
