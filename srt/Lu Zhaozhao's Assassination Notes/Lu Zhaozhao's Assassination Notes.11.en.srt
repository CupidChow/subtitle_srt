Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 11

5
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Your painting

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,200
is quite artistic,

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
but here I think

8
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,360
you should draw in this way.

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,800
What a coincidence.

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,960
Why are you here?

11
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Huangfu and I...

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
came here together.

13
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,600
Mr. Luo was so careful while teaching.

14
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,240
Riyue

15
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,640
is my most sensitive disciple.

16
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,600
Sensitive?

17
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,520
She?

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,760
- I... - Don't talk nonsense even if you want to please her.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Drink your tea.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm just

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,160
speaking my mind.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,880
So hot!

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Young master.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,840
Are you alright?

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes.

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't bother.

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
It's quite ordinary tea.

28
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,320
Master Huangfu.

29
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,160
I disagree.

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,600
There are numerous kinds of tea

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,040
with different flavors,

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,600
It's like everything,

33
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,200
including people.

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,840
Each person is like a unique kind of tea.

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
How dare you provoke

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,840
my imposing,

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,400
talented,

38
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,640
just and slender Mr. Huangfu?

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,440
A toast of tea to you all.

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,120
Didn't you say you were fine?

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,240
What happened?

42
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,760
Lin Yizhi.

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,280
Take your fan away.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,680
It's about my dignity.

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,040
Take it away.

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,390
His lips are so hot.

47
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,680
Is there any ointment to cure his lips?

48
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,200
The wound is severe,

49
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,480
so the medicine won't work fast.

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,680
Why don't you stay here

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
so I can

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,720
use this to heal you?

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,960
You, animals!

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,640
Where are you going?

55
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,200
Our mansion is that way.

56
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,560
I haven't finished my painting yet.

57
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,840
- So I want to... - No.

58
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,120
Why?

59
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,040
Whatever.

60
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,000
What is wrong with him?

61
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,080
So strange.

62
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,160
Riyue has made such progress in painting.

63
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,400
What's this?

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,840
The sun and the moon.

65
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,560
I will

66
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,000
always end the painting like this.

67
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,440
Your name is Nannan,

68
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,040
but why do you end it in that way?

69
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,440
I won't tell you, brother.

70
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,800
It's you.

71
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
I finally found you.

72
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,880
Was Huangfu Yi

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,640
mad just now?

74
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,280
Why was he mad?

75
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,280
How could he be mad?

76
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm not mad yet.

77
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,280
Wait.

78
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
I have no reason to be mad.

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,680
It's so annoying.

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,600
Forget it.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,760
Get something to eat.

82
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,400
Is Luo Bai

83
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,480
as outstanding as me?

84
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,680
Weird.

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,280
Why did I think about that?

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,520
Great.

87
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,680
Zhaozhao.

88
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Mr. Luo Bai?

89
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,880
I found you at last.

90
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,440
What do you mean?

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
I mean

92
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
I'm here to take you back to the Academy.

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,080
I have painted a picture

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
and I'd like to ask you to take a look.

95
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,600
Excuse me.

96
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,480
Check, please.

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,440
I can pay for this.

98
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,200
It's fine.

99
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,800
The maid of the Huangfus

100
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,480
doesn't need the outsider's silver.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,280
Hey.

102
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,080
Check.

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,320
From now on,

104
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,760
you don't have to go to the Academy.

105
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,560
Why?

106
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,440
No reason.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,840
You insisted on letting me go there,

108
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,150
but now you're telling me not to go there.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,030
You are my maid

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,200
so you just

111
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,670
follow my order.

112
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,960
All right.

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,150
As you wish.

114
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,360
When you take from someone,

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,400
your hands are weak.

116
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,640
What did you say?

117
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,840
I said

118
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,120
all right.

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll tell Mr. Luo Bai later.

120
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
He is kind to me after all.

121
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,600
No need.

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,160
I'll send someone to tell him.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,560
How kind is he?

124
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Isn't that my bracelet?

125
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,880
It's not yours.

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,560
Let me see it.

127
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
- It is my bracelet. - Young master.

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
Mr. Tang of Niucheng awaits you in the hall.

129
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,200
Isn't that Riyue's bracelet?

130
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,160
You said you ditched it.
