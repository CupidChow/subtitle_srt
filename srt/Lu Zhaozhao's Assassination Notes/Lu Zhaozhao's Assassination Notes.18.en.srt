Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

4
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 18

5
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,160
Huangfu Yi?

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
Why did you come here?

7
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,880
Didn't you say you'd never talk to me?

8
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,560
Lu Zhaozhao.

9
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,000
I've realized

10
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
that I don't know you at all.

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,600
Do you know

12
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
how unlucky I am?

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,480
When I was a kid,

14
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,280
my dad left my mother and me

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,600
for the rich.

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,840
Then

17
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,000
my mother died of illness,

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
and I had to live a tough life

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,840
as a maid at my father's family.

20
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,280
The hostess...

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,080
often beat or scolded me.

22
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,120
Why did you try to kill me?

23
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,960
I don't know the reason, either.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,030
That man

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,920
forced me to do it.

26
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
I just know

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,360
I will be dead

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,120
if I don't kill you.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,440
Why?

30
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Huangfu Yi.

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,360
I used to be afraid

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,600
of death

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,360
so much,

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,680
but

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,560
now I realize

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
that I'm more scared

38
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,400
of losing you.

39
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,240
I see.

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
Young master.

41
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,400
Zhou Riyue,

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,240
assume we have never met,

43
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
let us...

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
I see.

45
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
What's wrong?

46
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,920
Didn't you tell me to assume we had never met?

47
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm leaving here.

48
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,720
I mean

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,200
we need to get to know each other again.

50
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,080
Hi, Lu Zhaozhao.

51
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,800
I am Huangfu Yi.

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640
Why so sudden?

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,320
Didn't you say you wouldn't talk to me?

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
I treated you sincerely,

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
so I hoped you could be honest, too.

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,160
You were wrong at first.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
So shouldn't you show some sincerity

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,960
and sweet-talk me?

59
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,760
I did.

60
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,320
I...

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,800
I did many things sincerely,

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
but you refused to talk to me

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
and picked on me.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,280
Then you should sweet-talk me

65
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,400
repeatedly

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,240
into forgiving you.

67
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,280
Repeatedly?

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,440
Then

69
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,840
I quit.

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,520
Goodbye.

71
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:13,960
Then forget it,

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,440
let me pursue you.

73
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,600
Huangfu Yi.

74
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,440
Have we made up?

75
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,640
Foolish Riyue.

76
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
Foolish Zhaozhao.

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,960
I'm no fool.

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
You have to promise

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,600
that no matter what happens

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,640
or how much we fight,

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,800
you can be mad at me

82
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,040
but you can't stop listening

83
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,440
to my explanation.

84
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,400
OK.

85
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Pinky promise.

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
It never rains but it pours.

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,360
Several storekeepers and accounts resigned.

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Things are thorny already,

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,360
now we're framed for making fake money.

90
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,600
Our family has run the bank

91
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,880
in an orderly manner

92
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,120
in the capital for many years.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Aunt.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,760
Take it easy.

95
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,720
I can't.

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,240
Haven't you seen how triumphant

97
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
the weasels are outside?

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,480
It feels like our family will collapse tomorrow.

99
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,400
Aunt.

100
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,560
It's late.

101
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,080
Why don't you go to rest?

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,080
Zhaozhao.

103
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,480
Then I shall no longer disturb you.

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,920
You ate so little recently.

105
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
Take care of yourself anyway.

106
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,400
Young master.

107
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Is the bank in trouble?

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
You can tell me

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
if you want to.

110
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Though I may not be helpful,

111
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,800
it will make you feel better to talk to someone.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,640
It's fine.

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,600
Don't worry.

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,200
All right.

115
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,680
If you say so.

116
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
It's hot.

117
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,360
Young master.

118
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
I've found something new.

119
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,080
Let's go to the study.

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,240
You'll spend the night there again?

121
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,160
Have an early rest.

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
No need to wait for me.

123
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,520
All the troubles of the bank

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,880
should be related to the Zhihui Villa.

125
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
But its stupid second master

126
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
couldn't come up with such a plan.

127
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
Isn't there

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,360
a big boss who hasn't shown his face?

129
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,200
It seems so.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,240
I don't know it, either.

131
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,360
That man

132
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,240
forced me to do it.

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,080
I just know

134
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,680
I'll be dead

135
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,600
if I don't kill you.

136
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
Check Zhaozhao's notebook.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,080
Find out why she assassinated me

138
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
and who asked her to do it.

139
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,640
Young master.

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Why don't you ask her directly?

141
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,400
There's got to be

142
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,000
something else going on.
