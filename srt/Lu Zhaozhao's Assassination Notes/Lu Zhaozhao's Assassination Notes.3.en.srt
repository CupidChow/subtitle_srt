Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 3

5
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,020
What do you want?

6
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,140
I want...

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,600
to give you

8
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,040
a present as a newcomer.

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,760
A present?

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,240
As the saying goes,

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,720
boys should know how to protect themselves.

12
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,640
Once I can't help it,

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
you may use it to protect yourself.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,760
No.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't think about

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,480
those ridiculous things again.

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,440
How can I say that?

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,280
These assassination skills are awesome.

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
I have no grudge against Huangfu Yi,

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
do I have to kill him?

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
But I will die

22
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,120
from the Cloud Nine Powder

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,840
if I don't kill him.

24
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,900
Maybe I can pretend to kill.

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
Riyue.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,860
La... Lady Linglong?

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,820
You will go with the young master

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,160
to the account meeting this afternoon.

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
I have an appointment.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,680
The account meeting?

31
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,240
What's that?

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,840
No... nothing.

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,600
Ma'am.

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,900
Mr. Ling is back

35
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
and  has opened a new tavern

36
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,720
named Water Cloud Dream.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
That nasty man

38
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,080
is always badgering my nephew.

39
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
I'd better use force

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,680
than poison.

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Have you seen enough?

42
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
I'm sorry, young master.

43
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,800
I'm lost

44
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
in your beauty.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,640
Well, are you?

46
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
Yes.

47
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm speaking

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
my heart.

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,520
Young master.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Something is in our way.

51
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,560
Who is that?

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,720
The only son of the second large bank

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,280
of the Yin Dynasty,

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
Lin Yizhi.

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,240
Huangfu.

56
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,200
My brother.

57
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,880
I've just returned from a study tour.

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
Dad told me the account meeting

59
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,280
was about to begin,

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,760
so I came to see you at once.

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,480
I asked them to paint you and me.

62
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,360
Who is this creature?

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,320
Me?

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Mr. Ling,

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,840
she is my young master's maid.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
What?

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
Is she the maid

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,800
of my imposing,

69
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,480
talented,

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,760
just and slender brother Huangfu?

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,960
Are you?

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,760
Yes.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm the maid

74
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,720
of the imposing,

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,240
talented,

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
just and slender brother Huangfu.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Aren't you to dowdy?

78
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,440
Are you done?

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,240
You've been nagging for so long

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,200
and wasted so much of our time.

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,240
Who are you?

82
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,680
We can pay you.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,640
I take a firm stand:

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,920
we want both

85
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,400
your money and your lives.

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Guys.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,680
Go.

88
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,960
Lin Yizhi.

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,600
Leave now.

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,640
No, brother.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,440
I can't leave you alone.

92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
I'm telling you to get someone help.

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Huangfu Yi.

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
Die...

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,800
You...

96
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't say nonsense.

97
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,840
Just find me a physician.

98
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,480
Zhou Riyue.

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
She risked her life

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
saving me.

101
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,920
Why did she do that?

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,260
What did she do it for?

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,320
Young master.

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
The physician dressed her wound

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,520
and said

106
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,480
that she would recover

107
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,160
in a couple of days

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
since she was shot in the hip.

109
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,280
So don't worry.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm not worrying.

111
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,400
Riyue has been furtive recently.

112
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,360
I dug this out in the yard.

113
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,640
100 Ways to XX Huangfu Yi?

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,240
What does XX mean?

115
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,240
Does it mean wooing?

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,480
Wooing?

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Disguising as the dancer,

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,320
pretending to be the valet,

119
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,440
using the aphrodisiac,

120
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,880
and saving your life

121
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,680
were all done

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
to get close to you,

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
then she can have you.

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
If these were not done out of love,

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,960
how could she know your habits so well

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,440
and be willing to save you?

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
I see.

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Huangfu Yi.

129
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,760
Huangfu Yi.

130
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,600
She even calls me in her dreams.

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,640
Who are you?

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm no one.

133
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,560
What do you want?

134
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,040
Your life.

135
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,149
You will die today.

136
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,960
Huangfu Yi.

137
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,239
Huangfu Yi.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,640
You woke up.

139
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,800
No.

140
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,720
He knows I want to kill him.

141
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
She even dreams of me.

142
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
So Ying has a point.

143
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,880
She must have a crush on me.

144
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
He must have found something.

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,920
I should

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,200
get away now.

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,760
Gosh.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,040
There is no getting away.

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
You will sleep here.

150
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,240
Always?

151
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
No way.

152
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,240
Till you recover.

153
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,960
Understand, sir.

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
No need to be so humble.

155
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,680
Thank you for saving me.

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,280
I am a fair man.

157
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
What Aunt gave you was the volume Summer.

158
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,360
The other three are here.

159
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,760
Good night.

160
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
He's kind to me abruptly.

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
Is she playing hard-to-get?
