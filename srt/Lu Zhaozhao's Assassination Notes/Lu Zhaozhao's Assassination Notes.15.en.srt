Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 15

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,640
If one day

6
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,200
he knows that I tried to kill him,

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,870
will he...？

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,840
Young master,

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,840
well,

10
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,080
if

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,400
one day...

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,160
Young master,

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,360
I have got rid of those stores

14
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,640
that cheated you before.

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
I hate liars the most.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,840
What did you say?

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Nothing.

18
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,960
This

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,080
is for you.

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,280
A return present for your turtles.

21
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,120
I engraved the words on it.

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,440
It's kind of ugly.

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,480
Give it back to me then.

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,000
Give me.

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,920
I understand what you meant by

26
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,000
saying "unless".

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,760
Then it doesn't make sense

28
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
that you kept the bracelet

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
without giving it

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
to Meng Ziran or me

31
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,200
un...

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,160
unless...

33
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Unless...

34
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,120
what?

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,000
Zhaozhao

36
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm waiting for you at Water Cloud Dream

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
to discuss something crucial.

38
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,360
Come now.

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
It's my father's handwriting.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,560
Why did he come back at this moment?

41
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,640
What happened to my family?

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Huangfu.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Why do you go out before the meeting is over

44
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't you feel well?

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
You've been watching that jade pendant

46
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,960
for so long.

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,720
What's the fancy of such an ugly thing?

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,640
Zhaozhao.

49
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,880
Father.

50
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,640
What's up?

51
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,200
Nothing.

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Anyway,

53
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,960
how is it going with

54
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
killing Huangfu Yi?

55
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,960
Father.

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,720
How did you know that?

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
That's not the point.

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,080
Listen to me,

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,520
Huangfu Yi is a cunning man.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,280
Killing me?

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Huangfu Yi?

62
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Huangfu Yi.

63
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,400
It's not what you think.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,640
I can explain it.

65
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,320
Tell me,

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
did you come

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
to kill me?

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,920
I...

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Tell me,

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,280
yes

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,880
or no?

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes,

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,120
but...

74
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,440
I'm such a joke.

75
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,340
Ms. Lu.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
You're not as straightforward and honest

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
as your name suggests.

78
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,360
Very well.

79
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Lu Zhaozhao.

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm right here now,

81
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,680
then how do you kill me?

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
Listen,

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
I was forced.

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,160
Huangfu Yi.

85
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
Huangfu Yi.

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
Boss.

87
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
Everything goes as you expected.

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,600
When Huangfu Yi

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,240
learned that Lu Zhaozhao wanted to kill him,

90
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,400
he collapsed,

91
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,160
upset

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
and plainful.

93
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,920
It's painful.

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,800
Huangfu Yi,

95
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,880
does it feel good to be betrayed

96
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,280
by the person

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
you love?

98
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,360
But why did you bother

99
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,760
to do it?

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,120
I think

101
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,000
we'd better take our men

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,320
to break into the Huangfu's mansion

103
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,600
to take revenge.

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
That is too boring.

105
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,640
What makes one suffer the most

106
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,280
aren't the bleeding wounds,

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
but those

108
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,800
that

109
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,440
can't be seen or touched.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Huangfu Yi,

111
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,200
I'd like to tell you something.

112
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,280
In fact, I...

113
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,080
Riyue...

114
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,760
Ms. Lu.

115
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,320
Please go

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
and leave him alone.

117
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,480
Huangfu Yi,

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,800
don't you want to talk to me?

119
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,920
Sometimes I feel

120
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,040
as if there is another person in my body.

121
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,520
It's called multiple personality disorder.

122
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Multiple personality?

123
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,640
It's two different personalities generated

124
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
by some significant stimulus.

125
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,800
Different personalities?

126
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,200
How to do with it?

127
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
Let me prescribe you.

128
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,120
It may alleviate it,

129
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,160
but can't cure it.

130
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,400
It depends on your own willpower anyway.
