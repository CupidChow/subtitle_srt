Episode 20

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,360
Nannan.

6
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,000
Here you are.

7
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
Were the one who sent me

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,160
to kill Huangfu Yi?

9
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,440
What are you talking about, Nannan?

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
The red spots.

11
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,160
My memories serve me well.

12
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,600
So your family's poison is the Cloud-nine Powder.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,600
How did you know that?

14
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,720
You sent someone to poison me.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,040
Nannan.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,040
I have no idea what you are talking about.

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,160
How could I poison you?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Wait.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,520
You are poisoned by the Cloud-nine Powder?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
When did it happen?

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
A while ago,

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,480
I was forced to take that drug

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,960
and threatened to kill Huangfu Yi.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,880
I have just learned

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,720
that its producer has red spots on the wrist

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,280
and

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
few people

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
could make such a worm poison.

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,040
I can't think of

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,880
anyone else who would do that but you.

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,720
It was him.

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,400
What the hell do you want?

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,000
It's pointless to know the reason.

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,030
Sister is dead,

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,520
so I will make the Huangfus pay for it.

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,880
I will make Huangfu Yi experience

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,480
the feeling of watching his love

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,040
die in front of him

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,960
helplessly.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,800
Nannan.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
It's hard to explain

42
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,720
to you in a short time.

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,200
Anyway,

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,840
the Cloud-nine Powder is an extraordinary poison

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,920
and its cure...

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,720
What's wrong?

47
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,320
Your eyes...

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
It's fine.

49
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Where were we?

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,840
Right.

51
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
The Cloud-nine Powder.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Yes,

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
I poisoned you.

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,920
I asked servants to look for an assassin

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,560
but I didn't expect that they found you.

56
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,920
You disappointed me so much at first,

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,000
to think

58
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,080
you surprised me a lot afterward.

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,480
What's the matter with you?

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Why are you different?

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,840
You just...

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,400
You just need to follow my order

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,520
because nobody can save you

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,920
except me.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
What do you mean?

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,720
Not all worm poison have cures.

67
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,520
As the worst worm poison of all,

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,040
the Powder's cure is pretty unusual.

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
You're lucky

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,400
to experience it.

71
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,880
I don't get it.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,520
Why are you doing this?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
To revenge.

74
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,240
To make Huangfu Yi suffer.

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
He deserves this.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,800
Do you get it?

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,720
Have you heard about a woman

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,920
who hanged herself at his home?

79
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
It was my sister.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Sister Fu Han?

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,800
How could it be her?

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,280
The murderers

83
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
shall pay with their lives.

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,440
It's time to make the Huangfus pay.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,920
What happened then?

86
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,360
Why did sister Fu Han...

87
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Enough.

88
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,360
Well,

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,080
you don't believe me?

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Right,

91
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,080
you think

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
all the Huangfus are good people, right?

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,800
Those hypocritical

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
and stupid men!

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,920
Instead of colluding with them,

96
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
why don't you

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,200
marry me?

98
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,040
Maybe I will detoxify you

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,440
when I feel happy.

100
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,960
What happened to brother Yu?

101
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
Why was he suddenly different?

102
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,200
Why did he ask me to marry him?

103
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,600
Shameless.

104
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,400
How could you poison Nannan with the Powder?

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,960
You know

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,880
there are only two antidotes.

107
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,960
One is the one poisoned

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
consummates with the poisoner

109
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
and the other is...

110
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Shut up.

111
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
Isn't the first way better?

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,280
So you may be with your Nannan.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm not the one she loves,

114
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,960
I won't push her.

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,640
Don't be so hypocritical.

116
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,120
You'd better face your lust.

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
You don't get it.

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
I will never push Nannan.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
I'm warning you

120
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,480
that if you tell someone

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,600
the second antidote,

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,960
I promise

123
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,640
that your Nannan will die earlier.

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,640
Don't you hurt her.

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
Her safety is my bottom line.

126
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,400
Nannan.

127
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,720
You'd better get out of my way.

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,960
All my enemies

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,800
will end up miserably.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,560
So the wedding is fixed.

131
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
The bride-price will be sent to the Lus' home later.

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
All right.

133
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,640
Though there were misunderstandings between us,

134
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
given the wedding is approaching,

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
we shall make up.

136
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Since my Zhaozhao

137
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,120
has gained the favor of master Huangfu,

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,600
I'm glad for her as her father.

139
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,480
So the wedding feast and the bride-price...

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,560
The wedding feast?

141
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,760
The bride-price?

142
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,000
Zhaozhao.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Come here.

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,520
Right in time.

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,560
Your marriage to master Huangfu

146
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
has been settled.

147
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
Look at her.

148
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,320
Did I say something wrong?

149
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Zhaozhao.

150
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,560
Zhaozhao.

151
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Why did you ignore me?
