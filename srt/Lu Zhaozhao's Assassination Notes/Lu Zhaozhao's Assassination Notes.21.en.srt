Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 21

5
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,240
Zhaozhao.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,200
Zhaozhao.

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,720
Why don't you talk to me?

8
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Is it because

9
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,120
I didn't tell you

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,840
that I discussed the wedding with your family?

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,160
I didn't mean to keep it from you

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
or disrespect you.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,680
It's just

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720
that Ying and Lin Yizhi told me

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,880
that girls all like surprises.

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,800
Huangfu Yi.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,720
Your father said

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
that the bride's family

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,160
should hold the feast there.

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,920
I'm not a punctilious man,

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,840
so do it according to

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,200
your custom.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,040
- What's more... - We'd better calm down.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
What do you mean?

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,960
I mean

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
marriage is a crucial thing

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,680
and I haven't made up my mind.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,360
Is it possible

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,160
that we're not a good match?

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
Anyway, I'm confused now.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,960
I...

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,480
I'd like to leave here

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
and go home with my father.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,560
Boss,

35
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,679
what a brilliant move

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,640
to make Huangfu Yi love Lu Zhaozhao

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,080
and then let him watch

38
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
his love die.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,560
I can't believe a plain girl like her

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,560
was troubled by the famous Luo Bai.

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,960
You...

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Huangfu.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,720
Listen to me.

44
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,520
Girls are prone

45
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,120
to fear the marriage life before getting married,

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,960
so it's understandable that she wants to chicken out.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Mr. Lin has a point.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Besides, it's Ms. Lin's first wedding,

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
so she will

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
be shy.

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,160
She's just shy?

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,520
Of course.

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,520
Or who will refuse

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
my imposing,

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,840
talented,

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
just and slender Mr. Huangfu

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
You need to show your unique advantage.

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,360
Which is?

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,960
What?

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,460
You ask me

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,920
to roll my eyes

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,540
and

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
twitch suddenly?

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,520
That...

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,960
That is absurd.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,960
As long as you can keep Zhaozhao here,

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,080
this

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
will be yours.

69
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,480
I can act,

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,080
but

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,280
it's just one silver ingot...

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,800
You'll have eight times of it.

73
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,480
Deal.

74
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,840
Father.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,560
Father.

76
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,320
What's wrong?

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,120
Father.

78
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,280
Father.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
What's wrong?

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
What happened?

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
Are you all right?

82
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,960
What is going on?

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,960
Don't worry, Huangfu.

84
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,560
Zhaozhao will stay here.

85
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
His dad performed so well.

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,520
Why should I be worried?

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
What is going on?

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
Linlang, come to help.

89
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,080
My dad twitched suddenly.

90
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,120
Take a look.

91
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,440
No.

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Black-hearted woman.

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,800
She's gonna spoil our plan.

94
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,800
Zhaozhao.

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
- According to my diagnosis... - Blacke-hearted woman.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:14,840
What?

97
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,840
Black-hearted woman.

98
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,000
Look into my eyes

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,480
and try to get what I want to say.

100
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,240
I...

101
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Have you forgotten our links?

102
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,600
Hey.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
How dare you get on me?

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Get off me now.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
No way.

106
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,520
You'd better get me off you.

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,560
Wh...

108
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,360
What do you want?

109
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,200
Black-hearted woman.

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
It's a plan of Huangfu and me

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,400
to keep Zhaozhao here.

112
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,920
So your diagnosis shouldn't be like that.

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm informing you,

114
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,800
not discussing it with you.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,680
So?

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,680
Zhaozhao.

117
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
According to my diagnosis,

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,840
your father's disease isn't serious,

119
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,920
but acute,

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,680
so he needs to rest for a while

121
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,880
and can't take a long trip.

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,640
He'd better

123
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,800
stay here.

124
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,920
Are you sure?

125
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,640
What?

126
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,840
Black-hearted woman.

127
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,160
Thanks for your help.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Lower.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,040
It's not a big deal.

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
After all,

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,760
you are my man.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
Who is your man?

133
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,480
However, you're not

134
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
hot enough today,

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,320
I'm not satisfied.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Enlighten me.

137
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,120
Your lips

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
are too thin,

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
they were better before.

140
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,360
Man...

141
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,280
Zhaozhao.

142
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,480
What brings you here?

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,520
I heard that my father-in-law was unwell,

144
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,400
so I came to pay a visit

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,920
and bring you the bride price.

146
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,200
What on earth do you want?

147
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,520
Tell me the truth.
