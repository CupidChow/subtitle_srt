Lu Zhaozhao's Assassination Notes

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,900
Episode 2

5
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,040
Huangfu Yi.

6
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,080
I don't have a choice.

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Trust me.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,840
I will burn a gold abacus for you

10
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,080
so you may run a bank in the underground.

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,160
Please forgive me.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,680
Who are you?

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,760
I'm a new valet of Lady Linglong

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
and I'm here to send you the medicine.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,440
When did Aunt change her taste?

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
Young master.

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,880
Drink it.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Didn't Mister Jia tell you

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,880
that the one who sends it shall drink first?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,760
Yes, he did.

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,680
He told me specially.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
Then what are you waiting for?

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
I'd like to drink it outside

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,640
in case I'll disturb you.

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,920
Aunt will make a scene

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,520
if she sees you drink outside.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
Drink now.

29
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,280
Well...

30
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,280
What?

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,360
Is the medicine

32
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,440
poisonous?

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
No.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,080
Drink it now.

35
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,600
Lu Zhaozhao.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,080
You are so down

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,520
on your luck.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,440
What?

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,080
Can't you swallow it?

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
I'll die if I drink this

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,280
and I'll die also

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,600
if I don't.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,200
Though I'm doomed,

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,240
I have to take a chance.

45
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,560
Swallow it.

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,720
Hey.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
How dare...

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,600
Ouch.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
It's you.

50
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,440
It's not me.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,040
You are mistaken.

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
Why do I suddenly feel so hot?

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,200
So dizzy.

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
It's so hot.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,200
No.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm poisoned by...

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,040
This poison is Red Dot,

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,640
then the one I sold out was...

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
What are you doing?

60
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,480
What do you want?

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,400
Young...

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,560
The old tree is blooming.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,760
The boy is growing into a man.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,520
No.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,880
I need to tell Lady Linglong.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,640
OK.

67
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,920
I get it.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,520
Young master.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Continue.

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
Tell me the details tomorrow.

71
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,240
No.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Why did you cut me?

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,600
We were drugged by the aphrodisiac

74
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,440
and could only be chilled by pain.

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,160
Then why didn't you cut yourself?

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
I can control myself,

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,840
but I'm afraid you can't.

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:37,880
I...

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,840
I have looked into it.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,360
You were not the real dancer at the party.

81
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Tell me

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,640
the reason you disguised as her.

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,920
She didn't feel well,

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,160
so I replaced her.

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,000
Liar.

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,720
She passed out

87
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,480
and was hidden in the cabinet.

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
Didn't you know the illness called epilepsy?

89
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,400
She didn't want to lose her job,

90
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,760
so she asked me to cover for her.

91
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,720
Then why did you disguise as my aunt's valet

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,920
to enter here

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,320
and feed me

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
with the aphrodisiac?

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,080
Because...

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,520
Because I wanted to kill you, you fool.

97
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,240
Because

98
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Because I've been admiring you,

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,520
so I sneaked into this mansion

100
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,560
to take a look at you.

101
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
As for the drug,

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,680
I have no idea about it.

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,400
You fool.

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
I wanted to poison you, OK?

105
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
Then why did you feed me

106
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
with your mouth?

107
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,520
I thought about it

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,160
and believed that I shouldn't

109
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,880
take a good tonic alone.

110
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,120
Young master,

111
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,120
I was wrong.

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Please forgive me.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,520
Young master,

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
Ying told me what happened last night.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
What's your name?

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,520
How old are you?

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,120
Where do you live?

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,560
Are you married?

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,480
Zhou

120
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,840
Riyue.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,960
17 years old.

122
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,520
I live in Guicheng.

123
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Unmarried.

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
Unmarried?

125
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
That's good.

126
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,200
She used drugs,

127
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,720
disguised as the dancer

128
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
and the valet.

129
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Is she

130
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,160
a green hand?

131
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,440
Who was so stupid enough

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,160
to send such a clumsy girl to assassinate you?

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Go check it out.

134
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,400
Yes.

135
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,000
I have walked a long way

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,520
from Guicheng

137
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
to Hudu

138
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
to see the young master.

139
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,360
Now

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
my wish is fulfilled

141
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
and I have no regret.

142
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,040
Well then,

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
I give you an album of him

144
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,760
so you may watch it anytime.

145
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,440
An album?

146
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,920
That's a real eyesore.

147
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,920
So vulgar.

148
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,680
You've got so excited.

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,480
I'll make you

150
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,520
the maid of Huangfu Yi.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
No...

152
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm a coarse person

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,240
and I'm afraid I'll insult him.

154
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:28,880
I agree.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,320
He agreed?

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,760
What does he want?

157
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,800
It seems

158
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
I have to spend a while here.

159
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,480
- Let me bury it. - What are you doing?

160
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,040
What to do?

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,080
Young master.

162
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,440
I... I am

163
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
hiding this album.

164
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,960
Since it's such a precious thing,

165
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,960
I need to find an auspicious place

166
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
to bury you.

167
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,440
To bury it.

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,000
Why are you taking a pack?

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm going to your room

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,560
since I'm your maid.

171
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,080
Didn't Aunt arrange a room for you?

172
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,240
Lady Linglong told me

173
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,840
to live with you.

174
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
Hao Congming,

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,280
you failed again.

176
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,880
I didn't expect

177
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,000
that Lu Zhaozhao

178
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,560
was so dumb

179
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,360
and useless

180
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,040
that she took the aphrodisiac for the poison.

181
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,920
Boss.

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,000
Trust me.

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,760
I will get it caught next time.

184
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Get it done.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,560
Young master.

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Why did you agree to accept Riyue

187
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,480
as your maid?

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,080
Could you see through

189
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,440
her foolish way

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
of getting into our mansion?

191
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
She fed me with the aphrodisiac first

192
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
and then got a nosebleed while watching my album,

193
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,520
so she must be up to something.

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm keeping her beside me

195
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
to find out

196
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,400
what her scheme is.

197
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,840
Maybe she wants you.

198
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Nonsense.

199
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,080
Hold on.

200
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
That is my bed

201
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,320
and that's the young master's.

202
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,160
Look.

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
You agreed to live with Huangfu Yi

204
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
so you could assassinate him easily.

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,600
To think he agreed at once.

206
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,200
Now what?

207
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,960
I will be living in the same room with him.

208
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,880
There is

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,240
indeed a distance between the beds,

210
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
but that screen

211
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
is useless at all.

212
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Is

213
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Huangfu Yi up to something?

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,400
Lu Zhaozhao.

215
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,120
You are so sloppy.

216
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,760
No.

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,720
I need a weapon.
