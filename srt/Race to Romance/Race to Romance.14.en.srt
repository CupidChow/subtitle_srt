00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,310
Lately,

3
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,800
I've fallen for someone
I shouldn't love.

4
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,830
Are you kidding me?

5
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,400
It's been years since we met.

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,520
You asked me out the first time,

7
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,510
and you told me

8
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,160
you're in love with someone
you shouldn't love.

9
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,590
Hey, Senior,

10
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,390
stop laughing. I'm serious.

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,070
You're the only person I know

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,240
who helps people in love.

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,800
What does it mean
to help people in love?

14
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm a relationship counselor.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
In your free time,

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,760
you can listen to my radio channel

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
and learn from it.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,430
Wait a moment, don't move.

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,160
Still so clumsy.

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,990
However, I'm quite interested.

22
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,120
What is the person you said

23
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,520
you shouldn't love like?

24
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,520
Actually, not a...

25
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,080
Is she a married woman?

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,430
How is that possible?

27
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,920
Am I that kind of person?

28
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,830
I don't think so.

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,590

You asked me out to talk,

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,870
but you've been silent.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
And you look so upset.

Do me a favor.

64
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Tell me.

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,070
I want to move back home.

66
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,430
But your home is very far.

67
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,000
It's okay.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,350
Okay.

71
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,920
Thank you, Sister Li Su.

72
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,310
Hey, Shen Nan,

73
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,360
why are you moving out?

74
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,080
We only have a few cities to go.

75
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
I want to try my best.

76
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,160
Wait.

77
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
Did I affect your sleep?

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,240
Do I snore or grind my teeth?

79
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,950
I'm the one who affected you.

80
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,600
I not only snore

81
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,590
but grind my teeth.

82
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,800
I don't think so.

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,310
Anyway, I'm not going back.

84
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey, Shen Nan!

85
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,550
Did I do something wrong?

86
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,880
You didn't.

87
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,950
Then why are you avoiding me?

88
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm not.

89
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
You are.

90
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
You think I can't tell?

91
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,150
I'm not.

92
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,190
Gu Yichen,

93
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,750
who started it?

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,550
Didn't you avoid me first?

95
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,680
I...

96
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
You what?

97
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,510
Gu Yichen, listen,

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,190
we are just teammates.

99
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm not your personal property.

100
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,750
I can go wherever I want.

101
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,940
(Gu Yichen)

102
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,510
Qizhang, oh, Qizhang,

103
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,510
your son is much better than you.

104
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,480
Back then, you insisted on

105
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,990
becoming a driver,

106
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,280
but you gave up your dream

107
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,480
for the group's interests.

108
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,320
Look at your son.

109
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,320
He's somewhat made

110
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,360
your dream come true.

111
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,020
(Let)

112
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,360
However, your son

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,990
is too stubborn.

114
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,150
He wouldn't return

115
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,680
to the company.

116
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,300
(Gu Yichen)

117
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
Do I really have to

118
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,670
hand over Dayuan Group to Shang Yijiang?

119

Gu Qizhang!

121
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,080
I'll make it crystal clear.

122
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,480
That woman

123
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,630
can never join the Gu family!

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,240
And that child

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,120
can never

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,480
inherit our family business.

127
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,600
I have only one grandson.

128
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,790
Only Gu Yichen

129
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,790
can inherit our family business.

130
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,440

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,910
Do you understand?

132
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,480
They're both my grandsons.

133
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,120
