Shen Nan...

3
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,040
You've occupied my mind.

4
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,470
You've occupied my heart.

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,960
What should I do?

6
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,070
Shen Nan,

7
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,430
I wish you were a girl.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,600
Shen Nan...

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,030
Shen...

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,160
Shen Nan...

Gu Yichen...

12
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,630
Actually...

13
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm a girl.

14
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,910
Idiot!

Gu Yichen.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
Pay back the money.

32
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,200
What money?

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
You tell me.

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
Don't you remember?

35
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,150
Did you black out yesterday?

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,710
So, you really don't remember.

37
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,710
I just remembered!

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
You paid for it.

39
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,870
Right?

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,760
Yes!

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,910
I paid for it!

42
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,240
So, pay back the money now!

43
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,870
Moreover,

44
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,080
pay me for bringing you back.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,870
Do you know how heavy you are?

46
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,830
You're like a fat animal.

47
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,480
I was exhausted.

48
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,750
More tiring than training.

49
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,710
I'll pay you back

50
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,430
a hundred times more.

51
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,550
Shen Nan!

52
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,800
Don't be angry, okay?

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,760
Try it.

54
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,150
It's good.

55
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,280
If you move back,

56
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,920
I'll cook different food

57
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,280
for you every day.

58
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,080
Gu Yichen.

59
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,550
I haven't been myself lately.

60
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,870
Not just because...

61
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,080
I argued with you.

62
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,390
Actually...

63
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,360
Actually, I'm scared.

64
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,680
Every race of

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,750
the City Championship

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,280
is important to us.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
But our opponents

68
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
are too strong.

69
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,190
I'm scared I can't beat them.

70
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
This might be my only chance.

71
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,550
Racing is

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,600
like a war.

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
We set goals, make plans,

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,360
and give it all we've got

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,430
to make it.

76
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,790
Shen Nan.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
We're teammates.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,430
Everyone on the team

79
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,430
is our reliable backup force.

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,000
You have to believe in

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,960
them and yourself.

82
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,430
What we need to do

83
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,120
is clear our minds

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
and do our best

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,920
in the races.

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,190
As for the rest,

87
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,950
just leave it to them.

88
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,920
Thank you, Gu Yichen.

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,510
I'll do my best.

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll believe in our team

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,760
and you.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,550
Besides, you've already done a good job.

93
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,870
Our rankings are very high now.

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,390
As long as we don't

95
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,510
make mistakes,

96
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,630
we'll definitely make it to the podium.

97
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, speaking of which,

98
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,840
Zhang Yang targeted you

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
in the previous races.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,830
But he hasn't

101
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,240
taken bold actions.

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm still worried.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Is he planning

104
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,430
for something big?

105
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,230
Mr. Shang,

106
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,830
I tried so hard to get

107
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,790
these things.

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,310
He's playing with fire.

109
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,590
How is it?

110
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
Is it enough to take him down?

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,000
Not now.

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,550
If we ruined him so quickly,

113
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,120
wouldn't that be boring?

114
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,800
Don't worry.

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,750
I won't back down anymore.

116
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,390
We're teammates.

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,310
I can't let these external factors

118
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,390
affect us,

119
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,280
especially you.

120
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,800
We'll tackle whatever comes.

121
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,800
So,

122
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,950
when are you moving back?

123
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,990
Didn't I tell you?

124
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,630
It depends on my mood.

125
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,040
Hey, why are you always like this?

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,630
They placed us

127
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,630
in the same room

128
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,190
so that we can grow together and

129
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,320
understand each other.

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,680
How can you do this?

131
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:52,950
But at the beginning,

132
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,000
you called me a pervert.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,960
I...

134
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,760
I...

135
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,560
I...

136
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,360
I...

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
I did have some biases

138
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,800
back then.

139
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,230
I apologize.

140
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,710
Look,

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,200
you can hit me.

142
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,270
Hit me back.

143
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,310
I promise

144
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,190
I won't hit back

145
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,150
or talk back.

146
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,200
- Really?
- Yes.

147
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,040
Come on, hit me.

148
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,800
Hurry, hit me.

149
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,760
Then I'll hit you.

150
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
Come on.

151
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,430
I won't hit you.

152
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,510
That's barely a slap on the wrist.

153
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
I knew you wouldn't hit me.

154
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,680
Move back.

155
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,630
Shen Nan,

156
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,720
please move back.

157
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,630
Move back, and I'll do anything for you.

158
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
Hey, does it smell good?

159
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,900
(Men's Locker Room)

160
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,830
Shen Nan...

161
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,830
What are you doing?

162
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,510
I... I'm really sorry.

163
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,870
I just want to ask you

164
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,120
to move back.

165
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,440
You use the public bath every day.

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,400
It's so inconvenient.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,240
No, go away!

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,150
Please don't be angry.

169
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,870
Maybe you can think about it.

170
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,630
I said no!

171
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,600
Go away!

172
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
Okay, okay.

173
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,990
Shen Nan.

174
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,160
I just want to say

175
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,510
maybe you can move back.

176
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,960
You're living alone.

177
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm worried.

178
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,240
Shen Nan,

179
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,480
actually, I think

180
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,910
there must be some misunderstandings.

181
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,990
We're such good teammates after all.

182
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,790
These days,

183
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,390
I haven't been able to sleep
without you.

184
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,560
If there's a misunderstanding,

185
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,870
we can solve it and...

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,590
- Bye.
- Wait, Shen Nan!

187
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,270
I haven't finished...

188
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,320
You're getting along well

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
with each other, right?

190
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,750
Why don't you move back?

191
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,120
Sister Li Su!

192
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,270
Are you two

193
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,120
flirting with each other?

194
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,560
What are you talking about,
Sister Li Su?
