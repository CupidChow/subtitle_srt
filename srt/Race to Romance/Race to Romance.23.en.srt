00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,040
Is Gu Yichen serious?

3
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,270
How could he leave you alone
for the interview?

4
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,400
This is a critical point.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,960
What if the reporters...

6
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,630
Can you really handle it alone?

7
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Sister Li Su,

8
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
trust me.

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,190

Shen Yi, is your
cross-dressing in the races

12
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,830
just for hype?

13
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,710
Do you think you can win the race

14
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,070
as a female driver?

(BYTV - 4)
Please answer us.

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,550
Many candidates want to disqualify you.

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,320
What's your response to this?

19
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm doing this

20
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,180
because I love racing.

21
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,860
It's also my dream.

22
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,340
As for hype,

23
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,100
I don't think it's necessary.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,900
Because my ability

25
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,340
can prove everything.

26
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,860
As for my gender,

27
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,620
I have a question for you.

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,860
Is gender

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,620
a standard for racing drivers?

30
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,160
I believe that ability and skill

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,600
are more important, right?

32
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,620
If anyone questions my ability

33
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,140
because I'm a girl,

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,780
then let's meet on the track.

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,580
Great.

36
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,780
Everyone,

37
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,180
over the years, the chairman

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,780
has worked hard for the group

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,260
and become ill.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,780
Now, he is in the hospital.

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,340
I think,

42
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,700
to continue his unfinished work,

43
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,460
we need a smart,

44
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,660
capable,

45
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,620
and young chairman

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,820
to lead our group

47
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,060
to success.

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,020
That's right.

49
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,300
Mr. Shang is

50
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,580
Mr. Gu's grandson

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,060
and has made great contributions

52
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,300
to our group.

53
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,060
I hope Mr. Shang can make

54
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,420
our group even greater.

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,620
We have discussed it.

56
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,580
We recommend Mr. Shang

57
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,180
for the next chairman.

58
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,860
Agree.

59
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,780
Wait a minute.

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,300
Yichen.

61
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,860
Welcome, welcome.

62
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,460
Just in time.

63
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,860
Now you can witness

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,900
my big moment.

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,180
Witness what?

66
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,660
Why are you raising hands?

67
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,700
- Chairman?
- Chairman?

68
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,260
Chairman, why are you here?

69
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,420
You've recovered.

70
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,620
You left the hospital.

71
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
- I'm fine.
- This...

72
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,420
While you were in the hospital,

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,180
the situation almost changed.

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,060
It's really changed.

75
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,900
Haven't you elected

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,180
the next chairman?

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,100
If I was late,
it would definitely change.

78
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,340
Will you change?

79
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,860
I... Oh, no, no...

80
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,860
Okay, you can leave now.

81
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,140
Okay, okay.

82
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,060
I came here to see

83
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,260
whether this would be

84
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,700
your miracle

85
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,660
or

86
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
my miracle.

87
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,700
Yichen,

88
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,820
you should also leave.

89
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,220
I need to speak with Grandpa.

90
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,660
Okay.

91
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,140
You can speak now.

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,140
Grandpa, do you want to listen?

93
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,540
I do.

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,660
Grandpa,

95
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,540
since I was brought

96
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,220
to you as a little boy,

97
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,700
I've lived my life

98
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,500
according

99
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,980
to your plan every step of the way.

100
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,780
I've been so cautious

101
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,260
and careful.

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,540
I've never dared

103
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,980
to go against your wishes.

104
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,820
Since I joined the group,

105
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,060
I've worked hard.

106
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,820
I've worked so hard

107
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,780
that everyone knows it.

108
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,500
Why can't you see it?

109
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,060
He can do whatever he wants

110
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,620
just because

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,220
his surname is Gu!

112
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,460
My surname is Shang!

113
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,740
No matter how good I am

114
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,700
or how hard I try,

115
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,740
you still can't see me

116
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,860
even if I'm in front of you, right?

117
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,420
Grandpa, have you ever thought

118
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,660
I could have had the surname Gu.

119
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,980
I am your eldest grandson!

120
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,420
Because of what you did today

121
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,780
and the way you speak to me,

122
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,300
you don't deserve our surname.

123
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,460
Yes.

124
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,220
Grandpa, you're right.

125
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,730
I'm not worthy of the name.

126
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,500
I had it all coming.

127
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,460
I deserve it.

128
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,820
I deserve to

129
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,860
end up like this.

130
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,980
I deserve to be born

131
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,220
into such a family!

132
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,460
I deserve it!

133
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,860
I deserve a grandfather like you!

134
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,100
Yijiang.

135
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,340
Do you know why I've been

136
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,220
biased against you all these years?

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,900
Because of your personality.

138
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,100
You're eager for success and dishonest.

139
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,620
If I entrust Dayuan Group to you,

140
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,780
you'll destroy it sooner or later.

141
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,780
So, I've tried to stop you

142
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,980
from doing many things.

143
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,300
However,

144
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,180
you've never realized it.

145
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,900
You've never improved.

146
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,980
You haven't changed.

147
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm so disappointed.

148
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,300
Fine, Grandpa.

149
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,980
If you're

150
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,420
so disappointed in me,

151
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,300
you can use this chance

152
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,460
to formally

153
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,180
kick me out of this family.

154
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,900
You don't need to say anything.

155
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,140
I'll leave on my own.

156
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,620
Wait.

157
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,900
That was pretty cool, huh?

158
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
Here are all the shares

159
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,340
of one of

160
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,540
our branches.

161
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,180
They're under your name now.

162
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
Be a righteous person.

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,180
If you've realized your mistakes

164
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
and want to be better,

165
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,100
show me.

=Episode 23=
=Family, Our Silent Protectors=

167
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,740
Grandpa, you've watched

168
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,580
many dramas, haven't you?

169
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,500
So cunning.

170
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,340
How could you fake illness?

171
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,180
Do you understand me now?

172
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,300
Your brother

173
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,140
is eager for success,

174
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,260
dishonest,

175
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,500
and too greedy.

176
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,180
I'm worried about his personality.

177
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,820
If I hand over

178
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,180
our big company to him...

179
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,140
If...

180
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,780
If anything goes wrong,

181
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,060
my life's work

182
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,660
will be in vain.

183
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,900
Yichen,

184
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,180
I faked

185
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,580
illness this time,

186
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,940
but

187
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,340
honestly,

188
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm really old

189
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,660
and tired.

190
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,900
I can no longer manage

191
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,300
such a big company.

192
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,260
So,

193
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
I'll say it again.

194
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,300
I hope you can come back to help me.

195
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,420
Of course,

196
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,100
I won't push you

197
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
to agree

198
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
like I did before.

199
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,500
I can still hang it there for a while.

200
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,140
Take your time to think.

201
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Take your time.

202
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,740
By the way,

203
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,940
you love racing, don't you?

204
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,340
I can offer you

205
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,700
great support

206
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,420
in some aspects.

207
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,540
Okay.

208
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,300
Chairman, time to take meds.

209
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,300
What medicine is this?

210
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,380
For high BP and heart issues.

211
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,060
Wait, Grandpa,

212
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,780
didn't you fake illness?

213
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,860
Whether it's true or not doesn't matter.

214
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,980
Don't you have a race tomorrow?

215
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,660
Hurry back and rest.

216
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,500
Grandpa,

217
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,500
give me some time.

218
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,100
I'll think it through.

219
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,500
Take care of yourself.

220
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,900
Yichen.

221
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,620
For tomorrow's race,

222
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,380
good luck.

223
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,740
Zhang Yang?

224
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,200
I have Shen Yi.

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,720
Think about it.

226
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,300
