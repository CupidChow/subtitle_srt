2
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,120
(Oh my god.)

3
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,630
(What did I do last night?)

4
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,350
(Why am I sleeping on)

5
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,400
(Gu Yichen's...)

6
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,760
(bed?)

7
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,550
Check the time! Get up!

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,240
The coach is going crazy!

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,070
Wake up! You're late!

10
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,070
Why are you running so fast?

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,640
I...

12
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,470
I...

13
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,480
How did I

14
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,120
end up on your bed last night?

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,480
You really wore me out last night.

16
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,430
I...

17
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,310
wore you out?

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,860
=Episode 2=
=What Did I Do Last Night?=

19
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,590
(Yesterday)
Welcome Party has begun!

20
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,750
No return till we're drunk!

21
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,400
Cheers, cheers!

22
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,640
Cheers.

23
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,940
Upstairs.

24
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,020
(Why is he alone over there?)

25
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,860
(Gu Yichen)

26
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,140
(seems handsome)

27
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,780
(when he's quiet.)

28
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,020
Can you drink or not?

29
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,300
(When did they become this close?)

30
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,540
No problem. Is this alcohol?

31
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,820
I can't feel anything.

32
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,020
I won't get drunk.

33
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,660
- (I remember he can't drink much.)
- Go ahead.

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,980
Take it easy.

35
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,260
- (None of)
- It's strong.

36
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,320
- (my business.)
- I'll be back

37
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,820
- after talking to them.
- Okay, just go.

38
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,780
Don't worry about me.

39
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,980
Don't drink too much.

40
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,940
Handsome boy.

41
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,780
Your skin is whiter than mine.

42
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,980
You look like a girl.

43
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,420
You're really cute.

44
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,660
We'll definitely watch your races.

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,060
No problem.

46
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,220
Cheers.

47
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,180
- (Shen Nan)
- Cheers.

48
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,620
(is more popular than me.)

49
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,580
Goodbye.

50
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,060
(Men's Room)

51
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,700
This way.

52
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,740
How much did you drink?

53
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,740
Aren't you going to pee?

54
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,900
I... I'll take a dump.

55
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,160
(Why is this nuisance)

56
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,220
(so good-looking?)

57
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,380
Hey, why are you staring at me?

58
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,980
Am I that handsome?

59
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
Get up! Get up!

60
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,300
What a narcissist!

61
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,580
You're so annoying!

62
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,940
I can drink more!

63
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,460
I can drink more...

64
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,420
Alcoholic.

65
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,980
Drink...

66
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,540
Can you stand up on your own?

67
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,420
Don't help me.

68
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,860
I'm not drunk...

69
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,140
Listen, Shen Nan,

70
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,020
if you throw up on me,

71
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,380
I'll kill you.

72
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,140
Shen Nan!

73
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,540
Are you insane?

74
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,620
Gu Yichen...

75
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,820
I need water!

76
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
Okay, okay.

77
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,100
Here you go.

78
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,780
Gu Yichen, what are you doing?

79
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,060
You spilled water on my bed.

80
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,900
How can I sleep?

81
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,140
Fine.

82
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,300
You'll put up with it.

83
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,380
Just sleep like this.

84
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,860
(Gu Yichen,)

85
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,500
(you're so handsome.)

86
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,060
You're pretty sexy.

87
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,740
(He's really)

88
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,780
(a pervert.)

89
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,180
You're so handsome.

90
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,820
Why did you drink so much?

91
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Hurry up!

92
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,180
Did you miss me, handsome old man?

93
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,180
You still remember home?

94
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,060
Didn't you ask my brother

95
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,260
to tell me to come back?

96
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,140
It's still about that matter.

97
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,380
You are the heir of the Gu family.

98
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,460
The group needs you.

99
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,700
I'm getting old.

100
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,900
You'll take over the group

101
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,260
sooner or later.

102
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,860
Grandpa.

103
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,820
My brother

104
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,700
has managed

105
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,660
the group well.

106
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,980
The group will be fine

107
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,020
without me.

108
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,220
I founded Dayuan Group.

109
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,620
How could I let a Shang take over it?

110
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,420
Gu, Shang,

111
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,780
you're always talking about this.

112
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,180
No matter what,

113
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,040
Shang Yijiang and I

114
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,500
are both my dad's sons.

115
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,300
Besides,

116
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,220
he could've shared our surname.

117
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,660
It's not as simple as you think.

118
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,420
You don't know

119
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,340
what happened back then.

120
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,300
Your brother...

121
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,140
Anyway, you must

122
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,220
take over our family business.

123
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,060
When will you come back?

124
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,980
Grandpa,

125
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,180
I can't take over

126
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,820
the company right now.

127
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,140
Don't ever tell others

128
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,900
that you're from the Gu family.

129
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,700
Please rest well.

130
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,060
(The things that I've always desired)

131
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,300
(are so valueless)

132
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,180

135
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,260
(You leave me no choice)

136
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,020
