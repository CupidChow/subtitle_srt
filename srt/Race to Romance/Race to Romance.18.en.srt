2
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,460
(Gu Yichen)

3
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,960
Hello.

4
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,030
Hello,

5
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,110
it's me.

6
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,070
You freaked me out.

7
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,550
Isn't today a day off?

8
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,590
I thought I missed training again.

9
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,190
I figured you'd be up at this hour,

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,680
so I called you directly.

11
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,190
Are you up?

12
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,910
Yes.

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,640
What's wrong?

14
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,910
What do you need?

15
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,310
Nothing serious?

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,590
I just want to take you somewhere.

17
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,630
Are you free today?

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm free.

19
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,190
Then wait for me.

20
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,550
I'll be quick.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,640
Okay.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,910
I'm waiting outside your door.

23
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,160
You've arrived?

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,870
Have you been waiting?

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
Not so long.

26
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,710
Just two hours.

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,800
Why are you so nice?

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,270
Please wait a minute.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,320
I'll be quick.

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,480
You should come in.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,830
Is this the place you mentioned?

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,520
Do you like it?

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
Yes.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Gu Yichen.

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
Well,

36
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,150
we're spending time together every day.

37
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,360
Will it hinder you
from finding a girlfriend?

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,760
No.

39
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,550
Good then.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,240
Gu Yichen.

41
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,430
What was your first love

42
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,310
like?

43
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,080
My first love...

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,430
Does she has

45
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,830
a pretty face,

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
a great figure,

47
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
and excellent

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
grades?

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Actually, it's not.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,830
Well, my first love

51
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
is short-haired,

52
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,520
not in great shape,

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
and not good-looking.

54
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,110
Well,

55
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,520
have you kissed?

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
Yes, we have.

57
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,320
Jealous?

58
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,480
Why would I be jealous?

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,000
I just think

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,510
you're too flirty.

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,200
You had your first love,

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
and you two kissed.

63
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,390
The other day, I heard you were with

64
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,870
a pretty girl

65
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,750
with long hair.

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,840
Who told you that?

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,310
When? Who told you?

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,480
I just heard it from others.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
The other day...

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,520
I got it.

71
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
Jiang Yiyi.

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
My senior from college.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I wanted...

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,710
I wanted...

75
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,310
to ask about something.

76
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,800
So,

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,840
she's not your girlfriend?

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,840
Of course not.

79
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,390
What else do you want to ask?

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,680
You can ask anything.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
So, do you have

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,950
someone you like now?

83
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,630
I do.

84
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,600
Who is it?

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
My first love.

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,750
And he's looking at me.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,390
What do you mean?

88
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,390
What do I mean?

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
I've made it so clear.

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
You still don't understand?

91
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,230
Shen Nan.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
I like you.

93
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm serious.

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,320
I've thought it through.

95
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,280
No matter what others say

96
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,840
or think of me,

97
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,430
I don't care.

98
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,720
I really like you.

99
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,750
I want to be with you.

100
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,040
I want to be with you forever.

101
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,840
I mean it, Shen Nan.

102
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,830
Gu Yichen...

103
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,910
Me too.

104
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
I also like you so much.

111
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,710
Hello.

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
Why did you answer so quickly?

113
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,430
What's wrong with that?

114
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,710
No.

115
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
It's good.

116
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,120
I just...

117
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,870
I kind of miss you right now.

118
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,880
What a coincidence.

119
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,190
I'm also thinking of you.

120
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,480
Have you arrived at the dorm?

121
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,680
Yes.

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,080
But...

123
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,830
you're not here.

124
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,350
Okay.

125
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,070
We'll meet tomorrow.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
But it's tomorrow.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
Without you

128
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,360
in the room, I feel empty.

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
Time feels so long.

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,550
I feel so lonely.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,840
Then you can go to sleep.

132
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,990
Let's meet in our dreams.

133
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,510
Okay.

134
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,630
I'm going to sleep.

135
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,080
Don't hang up.

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,680
I want to

137
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,630
listen to your voice as I sleep.

138
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,790
Okay.

139
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,750
Then

140
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,750
let's keep the line open.

141
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,750
Shen Nan.

142
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,240
Why don't you move back?

143
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,460
(I agree.)

144
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,870
(Forget it.)

145
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,560
(I shouldn't reply now.)

146
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,900
(Gu Yichen.)

147
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,670
(Tomorrow,)

148
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,560
(I'll tell you in person.)

149
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,870
(I also want to surprise you.)

150
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,440
Surprise!

151
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
Gu Yichen?

152
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,750
Gu Yichen?

153
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,100
(Jiang)

154
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Shen Yi! Shen Yi!

155
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,750
- Fang Chi?
- Shen...

156
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,480
Do you know where Gu Yichen is?

157
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,790
Gu Yichen left this morning.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,960
He left the racing team.

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,480
He left?

160
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,240
What's going on?

161
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,870
Last night, we talked happily

162
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,150
on the phone.

163
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,670
He even asked me to move back.

164
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,670
I wanted to

165
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,080
surprise him today.

166
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,720
Calm down.

167
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Our team has contacted...

168
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,600
Sister Li Su,

169
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,630
what happened?

170
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,670
Why did Gu Yichen suddenly leave?

171
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,240
I don't know either.

172
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,030
What could it be?

173
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,600
This guy.

174
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,230
If I see him,
I'll definitely beat him up.

175
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,080
How could he quit when the race is near?

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,510
But don't worry.

177
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
I won't let him leave,

178
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,870
whatever it takes.

179
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,270
Don't think too much.

180
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,270
I'll take care of it,

181
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,230
okay?

182
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,840
This guy.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,030
Why did he take everything away...

184
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,480
except for the sticker

185
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,960
I gave him?

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,390
Is he avoiding me?

187
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,840
Why?

188
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,360
Why didn't he say anything?

189
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,910
Why did he suddenly change?

190
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,360
Why did he do that?

191
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,390
How could he leave

192
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,630
without a word?

193
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,390
Hey, come on.

194
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,360
Don't cry.

195
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,670
I suggest you

196
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,990
