Gu Yichen.

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,240
How did you find out where I live?

4
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,070
Is it hard to find out

5
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,390
where you live?

6
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,040
Your place smells nice.

7
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,230
Alright.

8
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,400
Look, your hair is all wet.

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,160
Wipe it.

10
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,110
Help me.

11
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,390
Fine.

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,520
You're acting like a kid.

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,440
You...

14
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,960
Why are you staring at me?

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,360
You look good.

18
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,830
Fine.

19
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,030
Suit yourself.

20
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,470
I'm not going in.

21
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,590
I'll be waiting outside.

22
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,590
Okay.

23
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
Gu Yichen,

24
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,710
actually...

25
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,680
I'm a girl.

26
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,310
My name is Shen Yi.

27
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,120
I joined the team to compete

28
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,710
on behalf of my brother.

29
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,040
And...

30
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,360
I also want to be a champion.

31
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,870
Will you blame me for hiding this?

32
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,310
Why would I?

33
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,550
You really don't blame me?

34
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,790
I already knew that.

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
You...

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
You knew that?

37
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
(Did he hear me say)

38
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,190
(I was a girl)

39
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,760
(that day?)

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
Then why did you share a room with me?

41
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,240
Why wouldn't I share a room with you?

42
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,190
It's not like that.

43
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,270
So,

44
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,240
you didn't want to share a room with me,

45
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,710
so you moved out, right?

46
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,200
Not exactly.

47
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,030
So, are you

48
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,390
willing to move back now?

49
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,390
I won't tell you.

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,750
Can you stop

51
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,680
pinching my face?

52
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,120
Stop! Stop!

53
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,560
You're like a little girl.

54
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,520
So cute.

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,080
What's wrong?

56
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,390
Hello.

57
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Don't you think

58
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,270
- they're...
- Don't talk nonsense.

59
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm not talking nonsense.

60
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,750
That's so strange.

61
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,510
Are you saying

62
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,070
he knew you were a girl?

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,190
I don't think

64
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,750
he's good at pretending.

65
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,720
I don't know what's going on.

66
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,310
He just said it himself.

67
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,270
Then, how far

68
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,800
have you gone by now?

69
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,080
Sister Li Su,

70
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,790
right now,

71
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
we're just teammates.

72
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
Teammates?

73
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
Stop fooling me.

74
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,150
Come on, what's going on?

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't know

76
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,750
what's on my mind.

77
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,390
I just really want to see him.

78
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,280
I want to spend time with him,

79
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,870
have meals with him,

80
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,840
and joke around together.

81
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,920
When I see him with other girls,

82
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,160
I feel really sad.

83
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
Other girls?

84
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
What happened?

85
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,160
Last time, I saw him

86
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,070
date another girl.

87
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
They were happy

88
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,390
and really close.

89
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,920
That's not good.

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
You need to ask him.

91
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,510
You can't leave things unclear,

92
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,470
okay?

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
But...

94
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,990
Who am I to ask him?

95
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,120
Do you want to move on
to the next stage?

96
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Such as

97
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,270
kissing,

98
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,230
hugging,

99
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
and lifting up.

100
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,750
Sister Li Su,

101
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,720
stop joking!

102
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,190
Okay, okay.

103
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,320
I won't tease you.

104
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,040
But you really need to find a chance

105
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,230
to ask him about it.

106
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,600
If he really has feelings for you,

107
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,310
I think you'll be

108
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,630
in a relationship.

109
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,070
But if he has

110
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,030
another woman,

111
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,720
you'll have to make it clear.

112
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
Understand?

113
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,840
Should I ask him?

114
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
Of course.

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,200
Absolutely.

116
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,680
Okay, let's put that aside.

117
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,760
I'll take you somewhere.

118
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,470
Let's go.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,320
Slow down.

120
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
Have we arrived?

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
Almost there.
