=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,140
(One Year Ago)

3
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,140
(Ninghai City)
Shen Nan?

4
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,340
He's just a brat.

5
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,580
With a foreign award,

6
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,020
he doesn't respect seniors.

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,060
His arrogance will lead to trouble.

8
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,060
If you lose, just

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,340
(Shen Nan, Racing Driver)
retire.

10
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
It's just a race.

11
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,980
Don't be a sore loser.

12
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,700
(Jiang Bo, Racing Driver)
(Okay.)

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,580
(Today, I'll give you a lesson.)

14
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,340
(If I can't join Changgu,)

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,660
(you won't either.)

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,140
(You can't attend the press conference.)

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,420
Yesterday at 2 AM,

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,620
a major traffic accident
occurred in Ninghai City.

19
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,460
(Ninghai Evening)
Two seeded racing drivers got injured in an

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,700
- illegal race.
- Shen Nan!

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,700
Shen Nan!

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,340
- They're in the hospital.
- He just came back,

23
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,460
and he's gone too far.

24
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,020
His career is ruined.

25
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,340
Will he attend the press conference?

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,620
(The press conference for the new)

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,540
(members is coming.)

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,700
(How can he appear on stage)

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,260
(like this?)

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,180
(Shen Yi, Twin Sister)

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,060
(And if the news about the illegal race)

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,100
(keeps spreading,)

33
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,980
(all the endorsements will be ruined,)

34
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,860
(and so will his dream.)

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,820
(I'm also a racing driver,)

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,780
(and I look exactly like him.)

37
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,540
(If I appear at the press conference,)

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,700
(the rumors about him)

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,980
(will naturally collapse.)

40
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,060
(Only I can)

41
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,660
(help him now.)

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,340
(Brother,)

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,100
(from now on,)

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,540
(there's no Shen Yi,)

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,580
(only Shen Nan.)

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,700
=Episode 1=
=No Shen Yi, Only Shen Nan=

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,100
Welcome to Changgu Auto to witness

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,140
the establishment

49
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,460
of Changgu Racing Team.

50
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,020
I'm Li Su, the manager of

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,980
Changgu Racing Team for this season.

52
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,380
(Li Su, Changgu Racing Team Manager)

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,220
(Press Conference)

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,300
Next, let's give
a warm round of applause

55
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,740
to welcome the core members of

56
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,140
Changgu Racing Team.

57
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,860
Versatile racing engineer,

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,700
Fu Chuan.

59
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,260
(Fu Chuan, Changgu Racing Team Engineer)

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,220
Top domestic mechanic,

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
Fang Chi.

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,980
(Fang Chi,
Changgu Racing Team Top Mechanic)

63
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,380
Next,

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,020
let's welcome Changgu Racing Team's

65
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,700
racing driver No. 1,

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,100
the genius driver
who dominates the track,

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,260
Gu Yichen!

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,980
Gu Yichen!

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Gu Yichen! Gu Yichen!

70
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,140
(Gu Yichen,
Changgu Racing Team Genius Driver)

71
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,020
Gu Yichen,

72
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,300
you're my idol.

73
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,260
One day, you'll be mine!

74
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,900
What is she doing?

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,980
My idol.

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,100
I also brought

77
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,980
your favorite banana.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,060
Yichen, I love you, Yichen!

79
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,020
Guard, hurry!

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,460
Don't drag me!

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,300
Stupid guard, get off me!

82
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,060
Yichen, I love you!

83
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,980
It was just an accident.

84
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,940
Let's keep going.

85
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,500
Now, let's welcome

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,860
Changgu Racing Team's
racing driver No. 2,

87
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,300
a young man who just came back

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,220
with an international award,

89
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,580
Shen Nan!

90
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,500
(Shen Nan, the Youngest Member)

91
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,260
My Gu Yichen is such a gentleman,

92
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,300
and Shen Nan is so handsome

93
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,540
and stylish!

94
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,980
Can I imagine their romance?

95
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,940
My god!

96
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
I really like him!

97
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,220
Shen Nan.

98
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,620
If you mess up the press conference,

99
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,580
I'll kick you out of the team.

100
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,740
I announce

101
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,660
Changgu Racing Team
is officially founded.

102
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,740
They'll compete in
the City Championship.

103
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,540
(Gu Residence)

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,540
(Gu Xian, Chairman of Dayuan Group)
Didn't I

105
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
tell you to keep an eye on Gu Yichen?

106
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,860
Didn't you find any signs?

107
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,780
Didn't anyone notice it?

108
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,860
(Shang Yijiang, CEO)
Grandpa, it's my fault.

109
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,780
However, you and Changgu Group

110
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,860
have fought for so many years.

111
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,980
Didn't they

112
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,580
lose every time?

113
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,260
After Yichen returned from abroad,

114
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,620
I told him many times

115
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,060
that we wanted to sign him.

116
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,660
But I didn't expect he'd...

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,180
I sent you to bring Gu Yichen

118
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,380
back from abroad

119
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,620
and train him in the group.

120
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,940
Well, look at you.

121
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,300
You've trained him to be

122
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,780
our opponent's driver.

123
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,740
Yichen has always

124
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,100
dreamed of being a racing driver.

125
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,020
As his brother, I can't stop him.

126
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
Get out.

127
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,140
Ask him to see me tomorrow.

128
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,300
(I've worked so hard for the group,)

129
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,620
(and you still can't see me.)

130
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,420
(You only care about him.)

131
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,540
(Gu Yichen.)

132
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,580
(Do I have to make him disappear)

133
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,060
(so that you can notice me?)

134
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,260
Mr. Shang.

135
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,700
Will you have dinner at home?

136
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,660
No, thank you.

137
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,460
I have work to do, goodbye.

138
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,540
Okay.

139
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,180
(How should I)

140
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,540
(share a room)

141
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,460
(with a man for the next few days?)

142
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,140
The dorms for all members

143
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,100
are ready.

144
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,420
Everyone must move in today.

145
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,180
The intense training will begin
tomorrow morning.

146
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,780
(Isn't this the girls' dorm?)

147
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,900
(Why is there an unclothed man?)

148
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,620
(Isn't this Shen Nan from my team?)

149
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,900
(Oh, no.)

150
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,340
(This is the boys' dorm.)

151
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,140
(Why aren't you)

152
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,820
(dressed properly in broad daylight?)

153
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,820
From now on,

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,180
you're roommates

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,460
who fight side by side.

156
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,740
I thought you'd never

157
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,940
share a room with a stinky man?

158
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,340
Cut it out.

159
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,380
Once there's another room,

160
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,460
I'll move out immediately.

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,260
Hope so.

162
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,940
Won't you take a shower?

163
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,260
What's wrong with you?

164
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,900
So stinky.

165
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,540
(Driving on the Edge)

166
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,820
Are you crazy?

167
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,100
Didn't you see I was reading?

168
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,940
I can't sleep with the light on.

169
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,500
(Gu Yichen),

170
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,300
(one of us must leave this room.)

171
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,620
(360-degree Stunt)

172
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,300
(1st Place)

173
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,700
(Younger Shen Yi)
Brother, one more round?

174
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,940
Sure.

175
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,740
(Younger Shen Nan)
I won't let you win this time.

176
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,220
Did I tell you to let me win?

177
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,820
When I grow up, I'll be a racing driver

178
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,180
and win championships with you.

179
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,220
No problem.

180
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,180
Then we'll be

181
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,300
champion siblings.

182
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,100
(Brother,)

183
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,340
(you must get better soon)

184
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,500
(so that I can move out of here.)

185
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,460
(Oh my God.)

186
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,700
(What did I do last night?)

187
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,100
♪Oh oh, alright♪

188
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,340
