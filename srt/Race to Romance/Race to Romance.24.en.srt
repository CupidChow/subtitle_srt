00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Okay, enough.

3
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,710
Well, Gu Yichen,

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
shouldn't we

5
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,360
settle the score between us?

6
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,640
Zhang Yang,

7
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,710
it was my fault

8
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,310
that your leg was broken.

9
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,590
I apologize.

10
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,550
Apologize?

11
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,200
You said it so easily.

12
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,390
But have you heard this?

13
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,870
If apology works,

14
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,590
why do we need police?

15
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,630
Zhang Yang,

16
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,520
this is only

17
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
between us.

18
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,150
I don't want to get others into this.

19
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,550
Let Shen Yi go.

20
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,470
I'll do anything for you.

21
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,480

22
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,280

23
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Sure.

24
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,110
But...

25
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,150

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Kneel down.

27
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,990
Okay.

28
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,360
I'll give you one more chance.

29
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,150
Will you kneel?

30
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,870

31
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,120

Gu Yichen, the famous

33
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400

34
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,550
However,

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,040
do you think this is the end?

36
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,360
Shut up!

37
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,320
Zhang Yang, you...

38
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,880
Get off me!

39
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,920
Do you want to die?

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,960
Gu Yichen,

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,120
I've told you before.

42
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,710
I, Zhang Yang,

43
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,870

44
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,680
Not just your leg,

45
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,680
none of you

46
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,510

48
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
Don't move!

50
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,040
Don't move!

51
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,790

It's okay. Don't cry.

59
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,580
As we can see,

60
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Shen Yi from Changgu Racing Team

61
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,140
has taken the lead.

62
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,540
She has also set a new record

63
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,700
for single-lap speed.

64
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,140
If she can keep it up,

65
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,420
she'll win the race!

66
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,620
Keep it up, Shen Yi!

67
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,140
We're waiting for a miracle!

68
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,940

on the track,

75
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,900
