00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,140
=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,630
Alright, this is our strategy
for the race.

3
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,470
Shen Nan, Gu Yichen,

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,120
do you have a problem?

5
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,440
- No.
- No.

6
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,270
No problem?

7
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,990
That's great.

8
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,800
No problem.

9
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,040
Mechanic, what about you?

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,350
You neither.

11
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,310
You neither.

12
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,910
But you have a problem.

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,430
Gu Yichen,

14
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,710
we'll meet on the track again.

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,320
Please go easy on me this time.

16
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,880
Don't break my leg

17
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,190
again.

18
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,480
Zhang Yang, once drivers
are on the track,

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,400
they risk their lives.

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,430
If you're scared,

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,760
why don't you quit now?

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,680
You found a handsome boy
to back you up, huh?

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Is that all?

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,270
- Get out!
- What are you doing?

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,880
Shut up, or I'll beat you!

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,280
Zhang Yang,

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,550
you're targeting me

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,880
instead of my teammates.

29
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,430
You're not welcomed here.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,640
Please leave.

31
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,640
Gu Yichen,

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
I'm just trying to help.

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,720
Look,

34
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,910
they're all defending you.

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,680
But think about it.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,360
What if you make a mistake

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
and cause his death on the track...

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,710
Oh, god! The thought makes me terrified!

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Goodbye, guys.

40
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,360
Before every race,

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,400
I'd walk a few laps

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,360
on the track

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,640
to feel the changes

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,920
and ups and downs.

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,800
I'd keep these details

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,990
in my mind.

47
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,150
Gu Yichen,

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,360
are you okay?

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,760
Shen Nan,

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,120
if I told you I'm fine,

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
would you believe it?

52
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,960
Gu Yichen!

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
My idol!

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,120
You'll

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,520
be mine

56
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,110
sooner or later!

57
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,550
Gu Yichen!

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,400
My idol!

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
You'll

60
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,390
be mine

61
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,120
sooner or later!

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,960
I'll be yours sooner or later.

63
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,200
What about now?

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,830
You have to be mine every moment.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,760
By the way...

66
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,110
Take this.

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,830
This is my favorite race car.

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,710
Do you like that?

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,120
No.

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't like it.

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,630
Then why are you staring at it?

72
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,630
Can't I look around?

73
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,080
Enough, let's go back.

74
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,350
(Jiang)
There's a signature.

75
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,040
Gu Yichen likes this race car so much.

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,480
I suppose he also likes this driver.

77
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
And this is...

78
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,920
also my brother's and my dream.

79
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,870
So, this signature...

80
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,950
Where did you get this?

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,950
Well...

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
The signature...

83
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,360
The signature...

84
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,310
Shen Nan,

85
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,880
did you write it yourself?

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,720
Just forget it.

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,800
I prepared this gift

88
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,950
to celebrate our first win.

89
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,270
But now...

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm giving it to you in advance.

91
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,480
I want to tell you

92
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,390
this time,

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm with you.

94
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,240
You're not fighting alone.

95
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,390
Trust me.

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,880
I like it.

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,200
I really like it.

98
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,070
This was my favorite

99
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,160
person when I was a child.

100
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,350
And this person

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,990
was my childhood idol.

102
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,000
I wanted this car so badly

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,310
that I begged my mom for a long time,

104
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,270
and she finally bought it.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,550
Then one day,

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
my dad was furious

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,990
and returned the car.

108
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,310
(Fifteen Years Ago)

109
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,160
Dad.

110
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,800
Let's play the race car.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Dad!

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,190
Dad!

113
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,120
Dad!

114
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,430
Dad!

115
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,920
Dad...

116
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
Why?

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,870
Maybe because
he's lived a conventional life.

118
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
He's never got

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
what he wanted.

120
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,120
So, when I could finally make decisions

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,510
for my life,

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,870
I chose to be a racing driver

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,990
without any hesitation

124
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,800
and won my first

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
championship.

126
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,950
I don't know

127
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,630
why I love racing so much.

128
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,480
Maybe it's thrilling.

129
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,830
Or maybe

130
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,550
I enjoy controlling the car.

131
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,190
So, I didn't think

132
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,280
racing was dangerous...

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Until that accident.

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,190
I made a mistake.

135
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
I watched Zhang Yang

136
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,630
being pulled from the car

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,430
with blood all over his body.

138
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,190
But I couldn't do anything.

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,480
If someone lost their lives

140
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,990
because of my error...

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,560
How could I...

142
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,070
How could I compensate them?

143
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,270
I'll never forget

144
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,510
that moment.

145
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
And I can't forget it.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,630
I must move forward

147
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,720
with this burden.

148
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,350
Shen Nan.

149
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,950
Maybe this is my choice.

150
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
I trust you, Gu Yichen.

151
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
We can make it.

152
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,520
Because...

153
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,030
you're not alone.

Every parameter,

every piece of data,

158
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,630
and even every component

159
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,830
are my work.

160
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,350
Nothing will go wrong.

161
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,510
Shen Nan.

162
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,270
Just do your best in the race.

163
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,910
I'll handle the rest.

164
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,590
You too.

165
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,060
Gu Yichen.

166
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,040
What's wrong?

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,870

172

Dear audience,

173
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,240
the most exciting

174
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,030
qualifying race of City Grand Prix

175
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,200
has begun.

176
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,720
For all the drivers

177
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,120
and teams,

178
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,550
this race is crucial.

179
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,440
As we can see,

180
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440

All

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
the drivers and their teams

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,960
are ready to go.

183
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,120
Now, let's stay tuned.

184
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,320
The qualifying race

185
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,560
will be faster than you can

186
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,720
imagine!

(Gu Yichen)

189
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,870
Zhang Yang is after Yichen.

190
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,150
He must break through.

191
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,870
Shen Nan,

192
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,320
help Gu Yichen get rid of Zhang Yang.

193
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
I can take the middle lane

194
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,200
to stop them from overtaking.

195
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
Shen Nan, it's too dangerous.
