Can you hear me?

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,630
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

8
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,510
Are you ignoring me?

9
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,630
I'll pull up your blanket.

11
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,960
Still pretending, huh?

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,150
You started it.

13
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,920
Shen Nan, are you awake?

14
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,150
Let's have breakfast.

15
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,710
Yes, I...

16
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,800
We're still sleeping.

17
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,110
Well,

18
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,310
I'll wait for you downstairs.

19
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,990
Are you that close?

20
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,400
Have breakfast together?

21
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,310
We're all brothers, you know.

22
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,200
It doesn't matter
whether we're close or not.

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
What's wrong with
having breakfast together?

24
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
No.

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
You can only

26
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,800
have breakfast with me.

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,310
Do you understand?

28
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,080
Un-Understand.

29
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,310
Can you get off me first?

30
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,920
That's more like it.
