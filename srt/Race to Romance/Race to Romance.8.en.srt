=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,240
Who's there?

3
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,920
Fang Chi,

4
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,880
what's wrong?

5
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,300
I made you some seafood congee.

6
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,120
Seafood congee?

7
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,630
You're so kind.

8
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,910
Fang Chi,

9
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,350
where's mine?

10
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,520
I have plenty in my room.

11
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,070
If you want some, brush your teeth

12
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,120
and help yourself.

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,080
No...

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
Come on, I'll open it for you.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
I started simmering this congee at 5 AM.

16
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,550
Hurry up.

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,020
=Episode 8=
=Provocation=

18
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,170
Changgu Racing Team confirmed it.

19
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
The driver is Gu Yichen.

20
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,120
The heavens are blind.

21
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,080
That guy gets all the luck.

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,640
But I'll be straight with you.

23
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,830
I, Zhang Yang,

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,240
don't forgive.

25
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,680
Even if he's your brother,

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
I won't show any mercy.

27
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
Don't worry.

28
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,240
He's no brother of mine.

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,990
As long as you're capable,

30
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,830
you won't be blamed.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,390
Shen Nan,

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,310
I tweaked
the automatic transmission gear ratio.

33
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,630
Is it faster acceleration

34
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,640
on turns now?

35
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,990
Wipe your sweat.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Thanks.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,710
Come on, have some water.

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,870
What's the chat about?

39
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,870
Nothing...

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,750
Nothing important.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,430
Didn't we have a dinner date?

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,390
Let's go.

43
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,100
Ms. Li Su!

44
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,120
Ms. Li Su,

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,080
what's wrong?

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
I have a suggestion.

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,470
Maybe

48
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,470
we could

49
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,520
rotate

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,590
dorm assignments?

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,710
What?

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,310
It's... I mean...

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,400
It's good

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,630
for everyone

55
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,080
to cultivate a relationship.

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
What do you mean?

57
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,550
Who do you want to live with?

58
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,870
Who to live with...?

59
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,080
I...

60
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,400
No... I don't mean that.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,550
But

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,430
if it's Shen Nan,

63
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,550
it's kind of nice.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,280
No...

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,500
Fu Chuan always snores, you know?

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,810
He yells in my ear every night...

67
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,670
Alright, stop it.

68
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,390
Dream on.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,990
(What's going on?)

70
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,750
(So strange.)

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
(Does he know something?)

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,950
(But Fu Chuan doesn't snore.)

What's wrong?

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,080
I'm taking a shower.

99
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,870
It feels terrible to use this thing

100
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,840
every day.

101
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,390
Shen Nan.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,430
Shen Nan, get me a towel.

103
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,840
Get a towel, can you hear me?

104
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,310
Please get me a towel.

105
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,840
Come on, Shen Nan, hurry up.

106
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,680
I...

107
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
I'll leave it at the door.

108
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Take care of yourself.

109
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,200
Luo Fusheng.

110
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
What are you looking at?

111
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,510
No, what are you changing?

112
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,710
Isn't this great?

113
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,510
Yeah, it's pretty good.

114
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,840
Do you often watch romantic dramas?

115
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,080
No, I don't.

116
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,870
It was just on.

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,060
Have you ever been in love?

118
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,270
Have you?

119
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Take a guess.

120
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,120
You must have, right?

121
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,320
You seem like a pro in love.

122
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Why is that?

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Just... I just think so.

124
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,030
You're so remarkable,

125
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,630
so handsome,

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,030
and you drive so well.

127
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,240
Any girl

128
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,790
would like you.

129
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,790
Shen Nan.

130
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,240
You're not interested in me, are you?

131
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,080
Who's interested in you?

132
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,630
I'm not a girl.

133
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,800
That's right.

134
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,510
If you were a girl,

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,990
you'd be crazy about me.

136
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,390
Actually, I figured it out.

137
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,720
You...

138
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,790
What did you figure out?

139
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,870
You like me.

140
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,440
No way!

141
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,230
Are you hungry?

142
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm starving.

143
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,150
(Such a fair skin.)

144
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,030
(How does he keep it?)

145
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,720
(What mask does he use?)

146
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
(And his nose is so straight.)

147
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,150
It can't be natural.

148
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,830
You...

149
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,200
Why are you so close?

150
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,160
I...

151
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm asking if you want to go

152
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,630
have breakfast together.

153
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Maybe later.

154
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,270
I just woke up.

155
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,870
Yeah, right.

156
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,870
I'll bring it back.

157
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,830
You can stay in.

158
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,200
Sleep a little longer.

159
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,710
Good morning!

160
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,830
Good morning.

161
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
Bringing congee again?

162
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm bringing congee for Shen Nan.

163
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,600
Do you want some?

164
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
There's more, help yourself.

165
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,790
He's gone to training.

166
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,960
Is he working that hard?

167
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,440
He's been quite diligent lately.

168
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
He went early in the morning.

169
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,280
Knock if you don't believe me.

170
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,160
Alright.

171
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,960
I...

172
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,920
No,

173
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,270
Gu won't lie to me.

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,280
I need to hurry.

175
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Why are you always following me?

176
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,250
Didn't we agree to improve together?

177
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,440
What a coincidence.

178
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,300
Fang Chi,

179
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,320
you're here to train, too?

180
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,670
Yes, it's for staying fit.

181
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,080
Mr. Shen, give me a hand.

182
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,030
- Alright, quick!
- Let's see who's faster.

183
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,750
Why does this feel like
picking up girls?

184
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,960
