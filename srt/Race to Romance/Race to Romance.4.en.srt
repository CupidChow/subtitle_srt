1
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,140
=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,240
Shen Nan,

3
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,400
did you see the gap?

4
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,190
Okay, back to the team.

5
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,000
Next group.

6
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,120
You have good driving skills

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,310
and reaction speed.

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,830
But why is your body

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,590
so weak?

10
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,590
Shen Nan just said

11
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,590
he wanted to take another

12
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,550
physical test with me.

13
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,710
Really?

14
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,840
I...

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,800
Sure.

16
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,380
Keep it up.

17
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,060
Listen,

18
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,340
a racing driver's helmet weighs

19
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,860
about two kilograms.

20
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,500
Every acceleration,

21
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,820
brake,

22
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,860
and turn,

23
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,740
will create a strong centrifugal force.

24
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,620
Therefore,

25
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,820
you must have

26
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,140
strong neck strength

27
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,460
and stamina

28
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,820
to support you

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,220
and keep your mind clear.

30
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,260
Otherwise,

31
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,500
you and your car

32
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,300
might be broken

33
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,420
into pieces anytime.

34
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,260
Shen,

35
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,100
how many girls
have you been dealing with?

36
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,940
I mean,

37
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,220
how many girlfriends do you have?

38
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,940
I... I don't have a girlfriend.

39
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,380
You don't?

40
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,980
Then why do I feel

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,740
you're so exhausted?

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,940
I...

43
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,140
You what?

44
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,620
Listen,

45
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,420
you've been acting really soft lately.

46
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,380
Haven't you noticed it?

47
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,580
Keep going.

48
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,580
Are you okay, Shen Nan?

49
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,140
You go first.

50
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,620
Hey, can you run faster?

51
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,340
We've almost finished it.

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,300
Faster.

53
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,020
Shen Nan!

54
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
What's wrong?

55
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,500
Come on.

56
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,220
Let me check.

57
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,460
Okay.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Let's deal with the injury.

59
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,180
Don't move.

60
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,740
=Episode 4=
=What Have I Done?=

61
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,380
Look.

62
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,340
What's wrong?

63
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Don't you think

64
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,060
they are a bit strange?

65
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,980
No, they're always...

66
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,740
They're indeed a bit strange.

67
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,420
Well, they do look a bit...

68
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,620
strange.

69
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,860
Who's strange?

70
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,460
You two are strange.

71
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Get back to work.

72
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,260
Susu,

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,820
have some water.

74
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,780
You must be thirsty.

75
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,100
Susu, I heard about

76
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,620
a new instant-boiled mutton restaurant.

77
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,740
Let's try it together.

78
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,980
No.

79
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Instant-boiled mutton is too bland.

80
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,780
Let's eat hotpot.

81
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,940
Hotpot sounds good.

82
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,900
It's great. Let's eat hotpot.

83
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,340
Susu, I really like eating...

84
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,140
Can you stop calling me Susu?

85
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,380
That's so cheesy.

86
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,460
Call me sister.

87
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,860
Then, Sister Susu.

88
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,670
Do you want me to beat you?

89
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,900
Even I want to beat you.

90
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,980
Beat you.

91
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,940
Ouch, ouch!

92
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,020
It's done.

93
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,380
I never expected

94
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,140
the physical training

95
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,980
to be so hard.

96
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,020
I never expected

97
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,220
you'd be like a weak girl.

98
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,340
Hey.

99
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,820
What do you mean?

100
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,380
Are you being sexist?

101
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,820
I'm not being sexist.

102
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,540
Listen,

103
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,340
Shirley Muldowney

104
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,420
is a female champion.

105
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,180
After a car accident,

106
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,220
she couldn't get sponsorship,

107
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,500
but she never gave up.

108
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,940
And there are

109
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,380
Janet Guthrie

110
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,580
and Lyn St. James.

111
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
They are all top female racing drivers

112
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,940
and champions.

113
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,060
You got me wrong.

114
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,820
I'm not biased against
female racing drivers.

115
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,180
It's just that race cars are so fast

116
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,060
that even a minor mistake can be fatal.

117
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,540
That's why we need to accept

118
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,140
all kinds of physical training.

119
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,820
The intense physical training

120
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,780
is more difficult

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,180
for women.

122
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,740
Am I wrong about that?

123
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,020
