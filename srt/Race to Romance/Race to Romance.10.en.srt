=Race to Romance=

2
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,910
It seems

3
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,990
we can't go out today.

4
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,910
It's easy to go out.

5
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,270
Come with me.

6
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,550
Where are we going?

7
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,350
I'm so happy today.

8
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,440
We ate so much

9
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,800
and had ice cream after the meal.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,680
Life is wonderful.

11
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,790
Gu Yichen.

12
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,120
If it hadn't been for you,

13
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,120
I would've been stuck
in the dorm all day.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Well,

15
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,440
am I your good buddy?

16
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,030
Sure.

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,360
Absolutely.

18
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,520
(No way.)

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,030
(How can I get my period at this point?)

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
Well, did you

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,030
get your period after eating ice cream?

22
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,590
You're the one who got your period.

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
I... I want a lollipop.

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,670
I'll buy it. Wait here.

25
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,020
(Life Market)

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,860
(Life Market)

27
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,590
(Where is he?)

28
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,100
=Episode 10=
=Malicious Revenge=

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
Enough.

30
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
Get out of the way.

31
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,240
Go.

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
You can't handle it already?

33
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
It can't hurt more
than breaking your leg, right?

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,310
Racing Driver Gu is angry.

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
Gu Yichen.

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,430
Do you know how important

37
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,800
a leg is to a racing driver?

38
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you know what I've

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
been through these years?

40
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Today,

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
I'm going to make you

42
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,590
pay for this.

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,150
I'll make you feel my pain!

44
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,640
Hold him down!

45
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,240
Break his leg!

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,430
He won't

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,750
be able to drive again!

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Go away, go away!

49
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
Get lost!

50
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Listen,

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,910
I've called the police!

52
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,120
They're coming!

53
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
Shen Nan,

54
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,430
I'm warning you.

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,800
It's none of your business.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
Get lost!

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,240
Otherwise, I'll deal with you too!

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,200
Don't you dare!

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,880
Let's see if I dare.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,280
Shen Nan has nothing to do with this.

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
Just

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,990
come at me.

63
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,600
This isn't over.

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,950
Let's go!

65
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,710
- Let's go.
- Gu Yichen!

66
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
I'm fine.

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,510
Let's go back first.

68
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,470
Okay.

69
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,240
Hey, boy,

70
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
your eggs.

71
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,760
No need, sir.

72
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,830
Just keep them.

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Thank you, sir.

74
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,310
You're welcome.

75
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,230
I'm impressed.

76
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,840
Let's go.

77
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,790
Look at you.

78
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,870
What's the point of

79
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,920
getting all the muscles?

80
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,160
Why didn't you fight back?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,960
Alright, alright.

82
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,280
It might hurt.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,200
Okay, okay.

84
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,710
Shen Nan.

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
Thanks.

86
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,590
Don't be so polite.

87
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,240
We're teammates.

88
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,590
If it were me,

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,430
you'd help me too, right?

90
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,150
Of course.

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll handle it myself.

92
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,510
Why are you embarrassed?

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,560
Okay.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,990
Then wipe it yourself.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,430
I'll make some noodles for you.

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,440
Here.

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
Eat it while it's hot.

98
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,680
I want to eat with you.

99
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,150
Let's eat.

100
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
It's good.

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,240
Will you marry me?

102
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,800
I already knew

103
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,150
you were a girl.

104
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,960
What? You...

105
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,310
When did you find out

106
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,270
I'm a girl?

107
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,800
We've lived together for a while.

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,950
Isn't it easy to find out

109
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,910
you're a girl?

110
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,630
I'm serious.

111
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,360
We often think

112
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,670
how far we have to go

113
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,670
to enter someone's heart.

114
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,600
And we also wonder

115
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,590
how long it takes

116
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,150
for two people to share

117
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,720
everything about themselves

118
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,680
with each other.

119
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,030
We've been searching,

120
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,680
searching for someone

121
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,560
we can share everything with,

122
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,200
someone we can lean on

123
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,990
when we feel tired,

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,750
someone we can

125
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,240
share our happiness

126
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,750
and sorrow

127
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,560
with.

128
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
And marriage

129
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,750
is about finding someone

130
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,710
you can get along with

131
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,560
and never get tired of,

132
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,630
someone who can

133
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
turn love

134
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
into three meals a day

135
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,400
in the plain days

136
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,200
and turn promises

137
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,270
into beautiful poems

138
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,720
and scatter them into the sky.

139
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
Today,

140
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,200
with everyone's blessings,

141
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,990
let's

142
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,270
witness their moment of love.

143
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,240
I do.

144
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,750
(Why would I have such a dream?)

145
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,510
(I dreamed of marrying Shen Nan.)

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,150
(What's wrong with my head?)

147
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,240
