[Izumi Sanada]

2
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:24,660
- Maruya-san.
- Yes?

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,470
Shall we present our marketing plans

4
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,760
to Leichi tomorrow?

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
- Sanada-san.
- Yes?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,230
We're

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,630
not on the clock (at work) right now.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,790
My apologies.

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,490
Hey, then...

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,540
why don't we move on from Maruya-"san" (respect)?

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,540
Hearing that puts me in work-mode.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,550
Then I shall not call you Maruya-san.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,640
Okay, what should we call each other instead?

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm fine with anything.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,590
Then how about...

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,050
Izumi?

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,180
I'd love to move straight to first name basis!

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,090
I do, but...

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,890
Izumi-chan (endearing).

20
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,010
Yes.

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,930
Yes, Izumi-chan.

22
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,110
Understood.

23
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,570
What should I call you?

24
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,140
Let's try several options.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,570
I'll call you "Izumi-chan"

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,590
so try out some names in response.

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,660
- It's like a quiz.
- This is no quiz.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
Understood. Bring it.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,800
- Izumi-chan.
- Maruya-san.

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,960
That's the norm.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,390
- Right.
- Yes.

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
Izumi-chan.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,310
Maruya...

34
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,120
Maruya-kun (peer)?

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,670
Oh, that option?

36
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,970
Izumi-chan.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,630
Maruya...

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,230
san.

39
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,460
Izumi-chan.

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,210
Maru-chan.

41
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,800
- Izumi-chan.
- Maru...

42
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,150
Won't you use my first name?

43
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,960
What?

44
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,720
Is someone...

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,970
shy?

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,330
I-I've never had this sort of experience before.

47
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,500
Maruya-san, you decide.

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,240
Okay.

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,810
The first name on its own is a big hurdle so...

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,470
- Kosuke-san?
- Let's go with that.

51
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,630
All right.

52
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,590
Then Kosuke-san it is.

53
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,090
Let's try it out.

54
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,690
Understood.

55
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,010
Turn around.

56
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,390
Here I go.

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
All right.

58
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,240
Izumi-chan.

59
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Yes.

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,590
Say my name too.

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,510
Say my name.

62
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,050
Come on, say my name.

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,130
Sorry!

64
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,190
What? Sanada-san... I mean, Izumi-chan?

65
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,910
She's so cute!

66
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,570
Oh my gosh, she's way too cute!

67
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,610
I'm totally on cloud nine!

68
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,100
We're in our honeymoon phase,

69
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,480
and busy making nicknames, but...

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,590
Although it's also weird for me to say this,

71
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,130
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,680
For all I know,

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,540
my cuteness could suddenly end tomorrow.

74
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,190
How much time do I have left?

75
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,330
Izu...

76
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,510
My mistake,

77
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,320
I was about to call her "Izumi-chan."

78
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,840
At the office it's "Sanada-san," you hear?

79
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,620
- Sanada-san...
- Izumi!

80
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,530
Who?

81
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,070
Long time no see.

82
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,320
Did you just call her by her first name?

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,120
You did, didn't you?

87
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,370
Who is that man?

88
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,570
- Hey!
- Wh-What the...

90
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,660
- What's the big idea?
- Quiet.

91
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,830
What?

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,030
Maruya-kun, have you heard?

93
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,440
Heard what?

94
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,710
Rumors say that Yayoi Beer...

95
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,270
will be merged into another company.

96
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,650
- Merged!
- Quiet!

97
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,090
We've always known

98
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,900
that business hasn't been doing well.

99
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,620
Even the "Summer Romance" we hoped

100
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,010
would revitalize us has been...

101
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,090
- A total failure.
- Word choice!

102
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,360
- Stop that.
- But I'm right.

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,730
Anyhow, our company will be undergoing reforms.

104
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,600
First up, an HR Consultant will be joining Sales Division.

105

"A consultant"?

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,550
They're not only extremely smart,

107
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,700
but also young and good-looking.

108
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,650
Good day. I am your HR Consultant,

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,310
Yamato Yamashiro.

110
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,710
I will be in your care.

111
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,570
We look forward to working with you.

112
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,880
Now, a question.

113
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,050
What do you think will happen

114
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,770
if you continue working

115
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,050
the same way you have these previous two years?

116
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,970
Any thoughts?

117
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
Let's see...

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,740
- The fruits of our labor will grow.
- Have those very fruits

119
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,480
grown in the past?

120
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,380
If not, then in two years—

121
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,540
They won't either!

122
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,250
- Hey!
- Sorry!

123
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,850
Some things cannot be overcome by effort alone,

124
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,270
which is why you require an HR consultant like me.

125
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,950
What's going on between this man and Sanada-san?

126
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,450
Besides,

127
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,330
a company needs...

128
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,340
No, "wants" talented people

129
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,240
who bring profit to the company.

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,530
It's no good.
[Consultant Profile: Yamato Yamashiro]

131
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,210
I can't concentrate, because I'm unnecessarily worried.

132
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,680
- It's not all about the numbers.
- Is this consultant an acquaintance?

133
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,920
A childhood friend?

134
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,400
No way...

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,600
Is he an ex-boyfriend!?

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,940
The current trend in Japanese markets is "downsizing."

137
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,090
If you do not change now, the reduction of personnel

138
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,680
may be on the horizon.

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,440
Will we be laid off?

140
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,190
First, I'll interview all employees,

141
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,240
and I'll plan the best reform possible.

142
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,860
I ask for your cooperation if you will.

143
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,040
Yes, Sir.

Chief.

146
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,970
You must have been shocked by the sudden news.

147
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Well, of course.

148
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,070
Even so, we must make the best of this opportunity.

149
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,250
The best of it?

150
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,610
Indeed. When something like this occurs,

151
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,380
people must confront their own life, whether they want to or not.

152
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,060
But that isn't

153
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,960
necessarily all bad.

154
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,080
What an optimist.

155
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,920
I'd call it experience.

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,380

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,600
Chief, be honest. How is it?

160

- How is what?
- The layoff.

Am I included? Is Maruya-kun?

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,260
Nothing is set in stone yet.

165
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,600
Really?

166
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,150
Besides, I wouldn't tell you, even if it was.

167
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,520
At least tell us their initials!

168
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,930

169
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,760
these are delicious. Please, take them.

- What's this?
- Financiers (French tea cakes).

You cheater!

172
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,440
This is merely a surprise gift.

173
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,790
On that note, do you think

174
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,920
our consultant likes macaroons?

Getting entangled.

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,500
I hear the Sales Division hired an HR consultant.

184
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,600
Yes, they did.

185
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,300

So are you going to marry him?

188
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,140
M-Marry?

189
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,500
You're dating Kosuke, aren't you?

190
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,550
Indeed, I am.

191
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,810
- However...
- But I guess there's that one problem.

192
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,130
Kosuke only thinks of himself.

193
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,400
He's got a great face, though.

194
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,760
That isn't all true.

195
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,930
What?

196
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,600
He's always considerate of me.

197
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,680
No, he's considerate of everyone.

198
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,160
It's thanks to Kosuke-san that I found a place where I belong.

199
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,240
- A place where you belong?
- Yes.

200
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,910
Wait, you call him Kosuke-san?

201
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,230
Izumi.

202
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,040
Yamato...

203
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,280
- It's strange.
- What?

204
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,350
Yes, it's undoubtedly strange.

205
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,370
What is?

206
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,890
Look at Sanada-san's desk.

207
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,620
That's definitely one of the macaroons I bought.

208
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
I gave them all to the consultant

209
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,070
so why does she have one?

210
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,410
What?

211
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,940
Those macaroons are limited.

212
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,970
I had to line up to get them!

213
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,770
What's the matter?

214
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,560
I bought some yokan (Japanese red bean dessert).

215
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
Kaburagi-san,

216
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,640
our bribes don't matter anymore.

217
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,190
What? Why?

218
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,950
I've connected the dots, thanks to those macaroons.

219
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,630
No, it's too early to conclude

220
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,270
he's her ex-boyfriend from this one item.

221
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,570
Our consultant, Yamashiro-san,

222
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,860
seems to be quite experienced.

223
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,750
- Is that so?
- Yes.

224
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,190
My interview is tomorrow.

225
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,130
What sort of person do you think he is?

226
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,980
Why ask me?

227
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,990
Well, I thought

228
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,390
you two might be acquainted,

229
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,530
since I happened to see you two talking.

230
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,130
Is that a work question?

231
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,870
Or a personal question?

232
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,230
Never mind,

233
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,360
it's not that big of a deal.

234
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,110
By the way, shall we dine together

235
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,850
after work today?

236
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,970
Sorry, I have plans tonight.

237
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,110
However, I'll be free tomorrow.

238
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,550
Okay.

239
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,630
I'll make a reservation for tomorrow then.

240
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,370
Understood.

241
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,380
Yes, things are strange.

242
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,800
Something is surely up.

243
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,030
Acquaintances don't need to be so secretive.

244
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,460
What's the deal

245
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,050
with Sanada-san and that man?

246
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,190
Hey.

247
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,701
Sudo-san?

248
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,820
Can't blame you for being blue

249
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,240
with an HR consultant around.

250
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,070
Soon, they'll be coming to Product Development, too.

251
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,520
Have you and Sanada-san

252
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,810
talked about the future?

253
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,641
Sorry?

254
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,670
You two are going out, right?

255
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,450
So you knew...

256
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,480
She turned me down when I invited her to dinner.

257
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
- So do you also—
- Hold on.

258
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,470
Say anymore,

259
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,850
and I'll look lame.

260
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,160
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

261
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,680
If you do,

262
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,300
I'll look lame.

263
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,250
Don't clam up! If you do...

264
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,980
that's enough of that, okay?

265
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,810
Anyway, back to the topic at hand.

266
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,510
Maruya-kun, are you committed to working in Sales?

267
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,870
No, my future is still a big unknown.

268
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,470
I see.

269
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,770
I wonder what Sanada will do.

270
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,671
Sanada-san?

271
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,950
See, Sales isn't her dream job, right?

272
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,630
I'm sure Sanada wishes to work

273
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,950
in a research job.

274
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,610
[Izumi Sanada]

275
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,800
Izumi!

276
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,970
Thanks for waiting.

277
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,700
Sorry, let me take this.

278
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,170
Hello?

279
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,410
Yes?

280
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,840
Sanada-san...

281
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,560
Is something the matter?

282
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,680
I wondered what you were doing.

283
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,300
I told you I had plans today.

284
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,250
Right, you did.

285
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,530
Sorry, sorry.

286
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,910
Talk to you later.

287
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,360
Let's go, shall we?

288
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,620
Yes.

289
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,650
I feel like

290
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,990
Sanada-san is getting much further away again.

291
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,060
Why was Sanada-san with that man?

292
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,030
Rather,

293
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,740
now that I think about it,

294
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,170
I know nothing about her.

295
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,990
No use being hung up over it.

296
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,020
Maruya-kun,

297
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,130
is it your turn for the consultant interview?

298
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,380
Yes. I'm off.

299
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,440
This isn't the time for an interview.

300
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm the one who wants information!

301
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,340
I want to get to know Sanada-san.

302
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,300
I'm prepared to face any truth.

303
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,040
Engarde (ready)!

304
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,670
Pardon me.

305
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,480
Maruya Kosuke-san, yes?

306
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,280
I look forward to our interview.

307
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,740
Please, have a seat.

308
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,950
What an amazing job history.

309
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,400
You've been employee of the month several times.

310
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,260
Thank you very much.

311
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,540
No need to be so stiff.

312
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,900
First, could you tell me your goals and aspirations?

313
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,510
Before I do...

314
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,590
may I ask one question?

315
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,930
Go ahead.

316
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,590
What is your relationship with Izumi Sanada-san?

317
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,600
What?

318
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,870
Izumi Sanada, one of our sales employees.

319
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,200
You two seem to be prior acquaintances.

320
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,310
That is irrelevant to this.

321
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,820
I understand you came to reform our HR.

322
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,730
I'm also well aware if I make a bad impression,

323
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,160
it could risk my position greatly.

324
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,260
Last evening,

325
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,910
I saw you two together.

326
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,580
What exactly is your relationship to her?

327
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,930
That is...

328
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,160
Well...

329
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,300
She told me to keep it a secret.

330
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,410
I have the right to know.

331
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,620
In other words?

332
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,870
I'm...

333
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,580
dating Izumi Sanada-san.

[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

335
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,280
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

336
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,010
I wonder what they'll ask in the interview.

337
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,180
Don't worry,

338
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,280
you'd be successful anywhere, Kaburagi-san.

339
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,600
Don't encourage me like I'm going to be laid off!

340
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,640
My apologies, Sir!

341
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,970
In that regard, Maruya-san has it nice.

342
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,790
Even if he quits,

343
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,380
he owns a brewery!

344
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,980
True, the Maruya Brewery is a big one.

345
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,610
- It's in Aomori, right?
- Yes.

346
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,230
Sanada-san,

347
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,560
did you know about this?

348
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,391
What?

349
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:51,480
Of course, she does,

350
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,471
don't you?

351
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,870
Yes, Sir.

352
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,400
Perk up, Sir!

353
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,850
Eat some of my yokan.
[I booked at this restaurant, for today at 7 p.m.]

354
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,410
Hey, I bought this!

355
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,230
Oh, right.

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,060
Over here.

357
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,640
Why?

358
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,610
For now, sit down.

359
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,720
I had my interview today, and...

360
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm dating Izumi Sanada-san.

361
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,050
I see.

362
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,640
Thank you for caring for her.

363
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,700
Pardon?

364
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,530
I'm Izumi's older brother,

366
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,310
What!

367
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,600
I was seriously shocked.

368
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,240
Who would expect Yamashiro to be your twin brother?

369
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,620
Our parents got divorced,

370
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,940
hence the different last names.

371
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,260
Oh, I see.

372
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,340
Yes.

373
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,180
Maruya-san thought I was your ex

374
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,700
because you didn't explain anything.

375
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,660
- I truly apologize for that.
- It's no big deal.

376
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,770
I think I'll take my leave.

377
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,020
Why not stay?

378
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,530
All right?

379
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,960
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

380
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,370
You see, HR consultants

381
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,490
can't help but make employees wary.

382
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,460
That's a fair point.

383
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,820
We were wary as well.

384
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,240
- I caught on.
- Sorry.

385
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,470
And if someone in the company is a relative...

386
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,070
Please understand why my sister wished to keep it a secret.

387
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,480
Of course, I don't mind anymore.

388
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,100
Even so, I was surprised.

389
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,740
Izumi studied science all throughout university.

390
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,310
Who would have thought she'd be working in Sales?

391
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,400
She used to be in Product Development,

392
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,690
but changed departments this spring.

393
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,770
Here.

394
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,711
[Georgia Brewery: established in 1860 in the USA, taste is moist, smooth and rich]

395
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,390
The Georgia Brewery over in America

396
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,910
is starting up a new research institute,

397
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,500
and they're hiring new researchers.

398
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,520
America?

399
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,580
Georgia Brewery?

400
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,290
Do you mean "the" Georgia Brewery?

401
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,480
If you're interested, I can introduce you. What do you think?

402
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,240
America...

403
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,440
Even so, we must make the best of this opportunity.

404
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sure Sanada wishes to work

405
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,330
in a research job.

406
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,580
This is undoubtedly a chance for Sanada-san.

407
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,880
But then, we'll no longer...

408
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,310
It's a wonderful opportunity.

409
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,420
- I...
- The salary is not bad.

410
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,990
Plus, you'd be better off pursuing your passion,

411
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,860
than staying at Yayoi Beer, working in a job that doesn't suit you.

412
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,100
When did I ever ask for all this?

413
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,270
What?

414
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,610
You have no idea how I feel.

415
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,900
But you always pretend like you do, Yamato.

416
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,720
- Sanada-san?
- All I wanted...

417
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,490
was to make a place for myself.

418
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:04,420
- Why are you getting all emotional?
- What?

419
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,600
Wh-What's with this atmosphere?

420
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,060
Maruya-san spoke to me

421
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,480
because he was worried about you, Izumi.

422
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,720
- No, I -
- Don't barge into my life anymore.

423
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,510
When will you stop fussing about this?

424
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,660
Grow up already.

425
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,040
What the hell are you doing?

426
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,160
- Sorry.
- I'm totally fine, no worries.

427
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,610
Sanada-san?

428
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,310
Pardon me.

429
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,650
Wait, Sanada-san!

430
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,500
What's the matter?

431
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,730
My apologies.

432
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,420
This isn't like you, Sanada-san.

433
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,440
What happened between you and your brother?

434
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,830
This is our problem.

435
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,680
If you're carrying a burden,

436
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,740
I'd like to overcome it together.

437
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,030
I don't want you to worry alone.

438
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,650
Why...

439
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,730
why am I the only one who has to open up?

440
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,401
What?

441
00:22:34,401 --> 00:22:36,730
You didn't.

442
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,720
You didn't tell me the truth right?

443
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,441
Me?

444
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,470
I saw Maruya Brewery's website.

445
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,950
The President pictured there

446
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,420
is your dad, yes?
[President: Yasuhiro Maruya]

447
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,140
Your father just came back.

448
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,670
Hey.

449
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,600
♫ Hurry, come over here ♫

450
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,980
Then who was the person I met?

451
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,670
Why did you lie?

452
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,930
- B-Because—
- I...

453
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,770
knew nothing about you.

454
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,790
♫ This distance is not bad too ♫

455
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,080
♫ But no, no, actually ♫

456
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,970
Sanada-san!

457
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,450
All right, that's enough.

458
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,350
You've now reached your expiration date.

459
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,580

- Wait a minute.

The future will not change.

You have no right to get in the way of current me, right?

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:46,530
At long last, cuteness will come to an end.
