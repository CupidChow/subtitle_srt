1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,270
I've fallen in love with you.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,960
I...

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,900
I like you, Sanada-san.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,370
This is...

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,300
"This is"?

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,340
Pardon me!

7
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,250
What did that kiss mean?

8
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,300
Was that kiss a response

9
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,790
to my confession with a...

10
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,320
"Yes"?

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,720
Can I take it as a "Yes"?

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,830
Can I!?

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,370
And was Sanada-san trying to tell me...

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,450
"I like you, too"?

15
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,610
Yes, yes, yes!

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,560
I like you, too!

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,650
But...

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,500
Ever since that incident...

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,380
Good morning, Sanada-san.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,020
Good morning.

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,940
She says "good morning"

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,210
as if nothing occurred...

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,750
Good work. See you tomorrow.

24
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,420
And says "good bye" in the same fashion.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,600
If anything, she's being more blunt than before.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,950
Besides, how did things go with Sudo-san?

27
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,170
No, is she stuck between me and Sudo-san?

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,560
Impossible.

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,300
Sanada-san would never...

30
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,220
All the girls I've dated so far have said...

31
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,530
You're so cute!
[Ex-girlfriend, Mio]

32
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,560
You're so cute!
[Ex-girlfriend, Ayumi]

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,050
Kosuke, you're so cute!
[Ex-girlfriend, Riko]

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,010
Exactly. They all loved me for my cuteness.

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,980
Yet...

36
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,680
I am you.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,160
I am you at 59 years old.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,680
This cuteness is about to end soon.

39
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,710
If I'm no longer my current self, Sanada-san will...

40
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,490
I take back my kiss from the other day.

41
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,380
My "cuteness" is about to expire.

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,550
In other words, even if Sanada-san loves me,

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,540
the end to her affection only inches closer.

44
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,890
If I'm doomed regardless,

45
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,340
I should at least make some lasting memories.

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,860
Wait, last?

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,230
Right! If this is my last chance, I must go for it!

48
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,560
There she is!

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
Sanada-san!

50
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,610
If you do like me,

51
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,910
then could you spare your next day off for me?

52
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,071
No good. I'm way too stiff!

53
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,490
What do I get by being stiff toward Queen Stiff herself?

54
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,700
Yoo-hoo (Hello)!

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,780
Sanada-san, how do you spend your days off?

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,720
If you're free—

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,770
No.

58
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,950
Get too out of character, and I'll suffer.

59
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,330
"Yoo-hoo," my butt!

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,640
She's here!

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,820
She's here, she's here!

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,220
Sanada-san! Morning.

63
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,450
Good morning.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,200
Listen, does this weekend look sunny to you?

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,150
I shall check later.

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,210
No good,

67
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,960
I'll just have to be direct!

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,030
Sanada-san.

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,200
So...

70
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,090
If you're free this weekend,

71
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,230
would you like to—

72
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,120
Maruya-san!

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,970
Maruya-san!

74
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,970
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Maruya-san!

75
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,500
Kaburagi-san says he doesn't want to be partners anymore!

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,750
What?

77
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,780
Since Ichinose-kun has a grasp on work,

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,250
I think he can graduate from training.

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,960
Don't say that, Sir.

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,340
But Kaburagi-san, our work operates on a buddy system.

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,190
Yes, I'm well aware.

82
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,270
As such, we'll have Ichinose-kun and Sanada-san pair up.

83
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,750
- What?
- And by proxy,

84
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,830
I'll be paired with Maruya-kun again.

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,260
Yes, Maruya-kun's the perfect fit for me!

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,900
Kaburagi-san...

87
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,460
- Kaburagi-san.
- Yes?

88
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,520
You see, I've been saved plenty during my time with you.

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,830
You exaggerate.

90
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,980
Even if Ichinose is capable,

91
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,590
I believe he still needs your support, like I did.

92
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,500
Isn't that what it means to be partners?

93
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,510
How smooth.

94
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,690
I both soothed Kaburagi-san

95
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,250
and put in a good one-liner.

96
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,940
Kaburagi-san, I look forward to your continued support!

97
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,690
As do I!

98
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,210
Kaburagi-san really throws us for a loop, doesn't he?

99
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,430
- Maruya-san.
- Yes?

100
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,670
This weekend will be sunny with 0% of precipitation.

101
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,840
What?

102
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,440
Oh, right!

103
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,430
I was trying to ask you out on a date.

104
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,530
"A date"?

105
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,630
By date, do you mean that sort of date?

106
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,240
Yes.

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,130
I mean that sort of date.

108
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,810
Will you go on a date with me?

109
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,480
[Ore no Kawaii wa Mousugu Shohikigen!?]

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,020
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

111
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,660
Cute...

112
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,270
Sorry to keep you waiting.

113
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,870
Thank you for inviting me out today.

114
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,450
What's wrong?

115
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,381
Oh, it's just

116
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,250
I've never seen you in casual wear before.

117
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,590
For one, this isn't the office.

118
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,300
I see.

119
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,200
- Should we go?
- Yes.

120
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,400
Where are we headed?

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,310
To tell you the truth, I didn't plan out the day.

122
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,660
As if!

123
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,610
I have today's date all planned out.

124
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,940
First up on our date:

125
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,650
making couple cups

126
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,200
at a pottery painting course.
[Make your own beer cup.]

127
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Pottery painting...

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,960
Yes.

129
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,280
We paint on unglazed pottery,

130
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,830
and create a one-of-a-kind.

131
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,590
Nice idea, right?

132
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,220
We can make a pair of beer cups.

133
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,340
Yes, good.

134
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,310
Try to make it look radiating.

135
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,860
It's a bit difficult.

136
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,840
How's it going, Sanada-san?

137
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,540
You see, art isn't my strong suit.

138
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,920
Pardon?

139
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,970
Wow, how dynamic.

140
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,090
No, sorry, sorry.

141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,840
Can I see that?

142
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,960
You're quite skilled.

143
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,300
She's so close!

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,620
Does this seem doable?

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,350
I'll do my best.

146
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,510
Excuse me for a second.

147
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,040
What's up?

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,190
Maruya-san, sorry to call on your day off.

149
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,660
We must submit next term's proposal to Tokusho Corp. today.

150
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,230
Right, your team is on weekend shift today. Good luck.

151
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,720
But Kaburagi-san says he can't come,

152
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,470
and now I'm all alone!

153
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,440
What should I do?

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,910
Well, don't ask me.

155
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,390
Do you have the proposal?

156
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,180
Yes, I do.

157
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,011
Then turn that in.

158
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,620
B-But... I

159
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,530
- Maruya-san
- I'm a bit busy.

160
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,560
- Sorry, see you.
- Hey, Maruya-san!

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,500
M-Maruya-san!

162
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,640
Have you gotten the hang of it?

163
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,070
I don't think I'll ever.

164
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,750
[Kei Ichinose]

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,900
Yes?

166
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,880
Maruya-san, could I ask you to check my proposal?

167
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,440
Maruya-san, could I ask you to check my paint work?

168
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,990
Look, do these "checks" yourself, all right?

169
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,240
- Oh, well...
- Oh, you were on the phone.

170
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,740
Sanada-san?

171
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,190
M-Maruya-san, aren't you off today?

172
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,460
Actually...

173
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,720
See, we're also on weekend shift.

174
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,200
So good luck, Ichinose.

175
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,270
- Wait!
- Okay, bye.

176
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,070
- See you.
- The proposal!

177
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,600
- Was that Ichinose-san?
- Yes.

178
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,740
He'll be fine, really.

179
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,010
How's your painting -

180
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,090
Good job, everyone.

181
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,650
Thank you.

182
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,520
These will now bake in the kiln,

183
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,400
- and we shall hand you the finished works later.
- These are totally not a pair.

184
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,010
No, our date has just begun.

185
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,370
For now, let's turn off my phone and shift gears.

186
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,170
Up next on our date:

187
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,050
a romantic time together while staring at beautiful scenery!

188
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,730
Honestly, I'd like to sit side-by-side.

189
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,660
But I never expected Sanada-san to buy this pot!

190
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,110
I can't wait to see our beer cups once they've baked.

191
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,630
Hey,

192
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,230
I think you'll eventually see

193
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,350
Mt. Fuji from that window.

194
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,760
I wonder where it could be?

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,290
I think it would be...

196
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,880
Yes, act natural!

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,040
Go ahead.

198
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,420
Have we swapped?

199
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,800
Could you see it?

200
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,600
Oh, let me see...

201
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,480
Where is it?

202
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,010
It should appear soon.

203
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,490
Where could it be?

204
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,950
This is it!

205
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,610
Let's see...

206
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,990
- That's strange.
- I can't tell where it is.

207
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
Is this...

208
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,040
But I turned it off!

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,720
Pardon me, that was my phone.

210
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,090
What's the matter, Ichinose-san?

211
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,410
Ichinose?

212
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,620
Didn't I tell you?

213
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,520
I can't go.

214
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,370
You'll be fine, all right?

215
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,610
Yes, yes.

216
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,300
Thanks for letting me use your phone.

217
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,980
I saw Mt. Fuji along the way.

218
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,130
Really?

219
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,530
I'm glad.

220
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,890
No, no!

221
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,970
I can't let this bring down the mood!

222
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,710
This date's still not over.

223
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,440
My trump card is all that's left.

224
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,030
The grand finale of our date:

225
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,780
enjoy dinner at a high-end restaurant.

226
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,510
It seems the calls stopped.

227
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,270
I wonder if Ichinose is okay.

228
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,780
Well,

229
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,300
we'll need him to be, right?

230
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,320
Are you worried about him?

231
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,160
A bit.

232
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,920
Sorry.

233
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,750
Can I make a call?

234
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,380
Sorry.

235
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,990
Ichinose?

236
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,300
Actually,

237
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,510
this is Hanamori from Tokusho Corp. crew speaking.

238
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,780
Oh, good evening.

239
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,410
Sorry to call you, Maruya-kun.

240
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,700
Ichinose-kun was supposed to come,

241
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,230
- but he still hasn't arrived.
- What?

242
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,500
He's not picking up,

243
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,780
and neither is Kaburagi-san.

244
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
So our last resort was you, Maruya-kun.

245
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.

246
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,590
I'll try to get hold of them immediately.

247
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,490
- Sorry.
- No worries.

248
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,880
Can I...

249
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,350
Can I leave early?

250
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,580
Ichinose is not picking up,

251
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,940
and I can't help but worry.

252
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,330
What about dinner?

253
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,980
I'm really sorry.

254
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,820
Even though you opened up your weekend for this...

255
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,490
Go to him.

256
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,980
I'm equally as worried about Ichinose-san.

257
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,200
Sorry.

258
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,550
It just had to be on our last date.

259
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,910
"Our last"?

260
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,440
- Oh, no. That's -
- So there will be no more after this?

261
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,290
I understand. Go on.

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,790
- I don't want you to misunderstand.
- Thank you

263
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,700
for the fun day today.

264
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,550
Please, go on.

265
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,900
Sorry.

266
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,630
[Shuhei Sudo: Should we eat together?]

267
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,530
[Would you like to grab a meal with me right now?]

268
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,570
Ichinose.

269
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,000
He's not here.

270
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,280
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

271
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,660
Ichinose.

272
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,060
Maruya-san...

273
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,490
Jeez, answer your phone. I was looking for you.

274
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,060
Sorry, Sir.

275
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,080
Don't cry.

276
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,900
Hanamori-san from Tokusho Corp. crew called and was worried, too.

277
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,960
What's the matter?

278
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,330
Is my proposal for next term...

279
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,370
really okay as is?

280
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,920
I have no confidence in it.

281
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,320
Listen.

282
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,530
The director of Tokusho Corp. liked your proposal.

283
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,610
That's why you're in charge now, not me.

284
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,610
To tell you the truth,

285
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,500
I didn't write that.

286
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,290
Sanada-san did!

287
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,900
Oh, that's right.

288
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
I can't make another like it,

289
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,080
and even Kaburagi-san has abandoned me.

290
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,270
I just feel so lost!

291
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:13,330
Maruya-san, could you look over my proposal?

292
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,270
I wouldn't understand.

293
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,770
But you use to spearhead this project!

294
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:34,190
If I make a decision here,

295
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,260
then you'll continue to rely on me for approval, right?

296
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,040
I know you don't want to disappoint others.

297
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,420
But you know what?

298
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,060
That isn't all there is to meeting expectations.

299
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,110
If you ever feel stuck,

300
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,120
don't come to me. Go to a store.

301
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,300
Go look at the customers, then decide.

302
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,670
I assume you suggested parting as partners,

303
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,080
so Ichinose could notice this.

304
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,991
What?

305
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,880
Am I wrong, Kaburagi-san?

306
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Kaburagi-san...

307
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,390
Is that true?

308
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,260
Is that what our whole parting was about?

309
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,940
Ichinose-kun...

310
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,390
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,120
I know I said Maruya-kun suited me better,

312
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,940
but honestly...

313
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,010
I could never

314
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,700
choose between you two!

315
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,660
Kaburagi-san!

316
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,960
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Kaburagi-san!

317
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,440
Kaburagi-san!

318
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,900
Kaburagi-san!

319
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:08,430
In the end, nothing went as planned on my date with Sanada-san.

320
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,560
And to top it all off...

321
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,110
So there will be no more after this?

322
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,920
What a terrible ending,

323
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,600
despite it being our last date...

324
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,320
Sanada-san?

325
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,120
Good work.

326
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,590
Why?

327
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,390
Here.

328
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,060
The beer cups.

329
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,430
We had left them behind as a pair.

330
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,470
[Thank you for inviting me. Due to personal reasons, I cannot meet you alone, Sudo-san. My apologies.]

331
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,470
Shot down, right?

332
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,430
Since we couldn't give a toast when eating croquettes,

333
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,950
will this be our first?

334
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,810
Indeed.

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,830
Then without further ado...

336
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,170
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,130
What?

338
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,450
Is something the matter?

339
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,770
Was "Summer Romance" always this good?

340
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,550
It's our own product.

341
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,790
True...

342
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,030
However, this "Summer Romance" tastes quite good.

343
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,970
Maruya-san.

344
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,700
Yes?

345
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,780
About the day

346
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,290
when I touched your lips.

347
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,310
Yes.

348
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,300
To be frank,

349
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,550
I do not know why I acted in such a manner.

350
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,410
Even so, I was quite embarrassed for pulling such a stunt.

351
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,870
I see.

352
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,400
Yes.

353
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,300
Then the reason you acted nonchalant...

354
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,470
Was to not burden you any further.

355
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:48,960
But today I realized why I acted the way I did.

356
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,230
I always thought of you as my senpai (senior) at work.

357
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,310
However...

358
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,750
I like you, Sanada-san.

359
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,330
Your confession confused me.

360
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
Yet...

361
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,060
at the same time

362
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,390
those words of yours

363
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,450
made me happy somehow.

364
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,910
They spread within me.

365
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,660
When I came to,

366
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,940
I had already done the unbelievable action.

367
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,990
My deepest apologies for that.

368
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,640
No need to apologize.

369
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,760
I was happy, too.

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,280
- Really?
- Yes.

371
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,090
I'm also happy you opened up to me about your feelings.

372
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,630
You're the type who keeps to herself, right?

373
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,120
As you say...

374
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,430
This may be the first time I've rambled about myself.

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,360
Maruya-san, I wanted you to understand me.

376
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,680
Please give me a moment.

377
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,980
Sorry?

378
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,530
Is this what they call "love"?

379
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,490
♫ Hey, in those eyes ♫

380
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,890
I hope so.

381
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,490
♫ Hurry, come over here ♫

382
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,760
♫ I'm sending you this telepathic message from behind ♫

383
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,800
Oh no...

384
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,600
"Oh no"?

385
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,660
♫ This distance is not bad too ♫

386
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,990
You're just too cute,

387
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,390
♫ But no, no, actually ♫

388
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,270
and that's very "oh no."

389
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,380
♫ I wish I could tell you without hiding ♫

390
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,730
♫ There's likely no end to it; I'm in love for the first time ♫

391
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,980
♫ If I could be the one ♫

392
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,070
♫ Who looks good next to you ♫

393
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:18,880
♫ At the ending credits, it won't be a sad song ♫

394
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,540
♫ But a love song that's just for you ♫

395
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,690
♫ But it's your fault that I can't tell you ♫

396
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,860
♫ You don't even give me a single, forced smile ♫
[This drama is a work of fiction]

397
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,110
This is an office romance, right?
[The start of their top secret office romance!]

398
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,640
Who would think our first spending the night together would be at my parents' house?
[First night together at his family's house]

399
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,860
Act as your father?

400

He's a wonderful father.

401
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,190
I see that you're a girlfriend
[Doting Parent Versus Doting Girlfriend]

402
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,550
who only has eyes for your boyfriend.

403
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,640
Wonderful?

404
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,300
Yes, very wonderful.

405
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,530
It's all about to come to an end.
