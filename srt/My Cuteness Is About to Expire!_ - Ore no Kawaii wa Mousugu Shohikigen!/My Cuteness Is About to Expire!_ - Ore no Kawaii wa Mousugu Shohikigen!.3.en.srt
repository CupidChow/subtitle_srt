00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,340
Stop right there, "Me"!

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,280
You're just too cute, "Me"!

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,400
But that cuteness will soon wither away, right?

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,900
Lies!

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,150
Come here!

One!

Even as we relax,

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,060
people age every minute and second.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,440

15

Cashews contain oleic acid.

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,630
"Cashews"?

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,020
I want to be called cute, no matter my age.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,320
Thanks to these Cashewrich,

You've reached "Bravo! The Youth and Beauty Cheer Squad, Cashew Lab."

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,100
May we first get your name and age?

Maruya...

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,810
Yes, could you repeat that, please?

27
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,440
Well...

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,780
This isn't for me;

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,050
it's for a friend.

30
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,750
Then may we hear the name

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,510
- and age of the caller?
- No, well...

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,780
This isn't for me.

33
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,680
Your name and age, please!

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,330
Pardon?

36
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,810
Kosuke Maruya, age 29.

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,770
Sir, you seem to be far from the phone.

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,640
S-Sorry! Goodbye!

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,150
It's been three weeks since "Summer Romance" hit shelves.

44
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,590
Sales pale in comparison to other new beers.

45
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,290
As such, I've called in Sudo-san,

46
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,970
Head of Product Development,

47
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,880
to give us a lecture on consumer appeal.

48
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm Sudo from Product Development.

49
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,390
In a generation straying away from beer,

50
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,310
we aimed to create a light mix beer
[Yayaoi Premium Limited]

51
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,100
- that appeals to the younger generation.
- Summer Romance...

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,550
It's more complicated than expected.

53
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,140
- Indeed.
- Sanada-san,

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,920
you were in Product Development, right?

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,620
Is he someone you know?

56
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,060
He used to be my boss.

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,680
In order to propagate the appeal of this beer to many,

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,880
we'll be accepting ideas for the following project.
[Seeking recipes that pair well with "Summer Romance"]

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,860
Ms. Minami Ohara, whom we themed this beer after,
[Seeking recipes that pair well with "Summer Romance"]

60
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,680
is to appear on "Our Time TV"
[Minami Ohara to appear on Sunset TV's "Our Time TV" introducing recipes that pair well with "Summer Romance."]

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,650

62
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,870
We'd like the Sales Department to think of such recipes.

63
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,260
Us?

64
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,340
We'd like to learn from those who drink the most Summer Romance.

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,470
It'd be troubling if the ones who drink it the most are not the customers.

66
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,700
Fair point.

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm not suggesting to limit how much you drink.

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,570
Drink as much as you'd like!

Sanada.

72
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,590
The suit is a new look for you.

73
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,740
How is it? Did you get used to the Sales Department?

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,340
All I do is exchange business cards.

75
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,100
Maybe I should take one of your business cards, too.

76
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,030
I'm Sanada, of Sales.

77
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,230
Don't be so stiff.

Ma... ru... ya... kun!

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,910
How energetic.

80
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,370
Do you want to think of a recipe together this Sunday?

81
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,231
With me?

82
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,940
Aren't you good at cooking?

83
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,350
Well, I'm good at eating,

84
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,520
but cooking is another story.

85
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,510
He's right. People often say I seem like a good cook.

86
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,260
But that's just another "Cute Bias."

87
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,050
Because of my looks, people are quick to believe

88
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm a gourmet cook with a mere apron and knife.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,680
In truth, my cooking both looks and tastes...

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,540
totally normal.

91
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,680
I won't be of much help.

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,250
I'll have to decline. Sorry.

93
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,780
What a shame.

94
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,130
I'm free Sunday.

95
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,300
So?

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
If you're fine with me, I can help.

97
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Why you?

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
You're unusually assertive.

99
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,600
I can at least help with brainstorming.

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Now that I think about it,

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Sanada-san used to be in Product Development.

102
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,860
She might be more useful than me.

103
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,980
Oh, right!

104
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,770
I'm helping the family plant rice on Sunday!

105
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,300
I totally forgot.

106
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,880
- Is that so?
- Hold on a second!

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
Are we recipe planning?

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,100
Let me join in!

109
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,240
Sorry, sorry.

110
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,090
I'm farming with the family on Sunday.

111
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,310
But Sanada-san seems free.

112
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,370
Then, Sanada-san, let's cook at my place!

113
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,900
- Is that all right?
- Yes!

114
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,830
It's cluttered with moving boxes, though!

115
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,600
Do you want to use my kitchen instead?

116
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,190
Maruya-kun's kitchen?

117
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,010
I have a triple-burner gas stovetop.

118
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,180
That's amazing! Can we really?

119
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,981
No way!

120
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:05,230
Though I'm not a good cook,

121
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,890
I can at least provide a kitchen.

122
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,430
- Thank you!
- No problem.

123
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,660
- Ichinose-kun, actually...
- Yes,

124
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,800
all you need in life is a kind superior!

125
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,750
Well then!

126
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,520
Riko?

127
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,460
I was just thinking, "I really like how you look."

128
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,410
Kosuke, you only like yourself!

129
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,370
Good morning.

130
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,720
Morning.

131
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,930
What?

132
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,750
Sanada-san, we're not on a business excursion today.

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,960
Is creating a recipe not part of the job?

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,400
You're right.

135
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Sorry I'm dressed so casually.

136
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
Where is Ichinose?

137
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm sorry!

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,530
I haven't been able to leave yet!

139
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,300
The floor above seems to be leaking water.

140
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,050
- Cold, cold!
- Okay, okay.

141
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,190
- One moment!
- It's fine, really.

142
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,330
We'll go ahead and grocery shop.

143
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,580
Okay.

144
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,490
Potatoes...

145
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,900
There we go.

146
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,370
Next is...

147
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,660
Butter.

148
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaking of which, Sudo-san from the other day...

149
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,170
He seems friendly and capable, the image of an ideal senior.

150
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,190
I guess not everyone in Product Development is a robot.

151
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,890
"Robot"?

152
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,450
No, no!

153
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,550
I-It's just a general image! You're different, Sanada-san.

154
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,130
Next... Is it over there?

Excuse me.

157
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,720
I can't help but be curious

158
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,680
about the beer everyone buys.

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,450
Oh, it's Teio Beer!

160
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,680
Man, this "Summer Romance" is seriously delicious.

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,750
Since it's so light, they recommend it to ladies, too.

162
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,460
Oh my!

163
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,360
I'm so sorry, I mistook you for my wife.

164
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,830
My wife is over there.

165
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,910
Anyhow, this "Summer Romance" is quite delicious.

166
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,400
Then maybe I'll buy that one today.

167
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,180
- Here you are.
- Thank you!

168
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,470
Do you always pull such stunts?
[Ozeki Supermarket]

169
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,060
Sanada-san, don't you?

170
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,680
I thought it was common practice in beer companies.

171
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,380
Let's go.

172
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,510
Yes.

173
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,810
Come on in.

174
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,440
Thank you.

175
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,370
Sanada-san, you can place your things there.

176
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,960
Understood.

177
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,580
If Ichinose-san is running late, we should at least prep the ingredients.

178
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,020
But if we don't know what we're making...

179
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,420
Potatoes, onions,

180
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,600
ground beef, eggs,

181
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,650
Panko (bread crumbs), etc.

182
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,520
My gosh, these are the ingredients for...

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,100
Croquettes, right?

184
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,460
As suspected!

185
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,100
"Eat too much oily food,"

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,900
"and your glycation (cell aging) will speed up."

187
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,810
"Your skin will tint and lose elasticity,"
[Instantly aging? Two major causes of skin aging.]

188
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,230
"only speeding up the aging process!"
[Two major causes of skin aging]

189
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,140
"Be cautious!"

190
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,111
So it says!

191
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,450
I'll borrow your cutting board and knife.

192
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,190
Go ahead.

193
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,410
Ichinose,

194
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,970
are we making croquettes?

195
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,350
Not just any croquettes,

196
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,620
it's an Ichinose household secret recipe!

197
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,180
Anyway, it seems the cleanup will take a bit longer.

198
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,810
- Ichinose, listen up.
- Yes?

199
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,020
Can we change your secret croquettes

200
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,210
to a secret potato salad?

201
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,000
Why change someone else's secret family recipe?

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,500
- Well...
- The croquettes won't be complete

203
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,380
without the secret ingredient.

204
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,630
I'll make sure to bring it

205
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,020
- so please wait for me.
- Hey, wa—

206
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,300
Oh no!

207
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,050
All I can do now is pray that the leak doesn't get fixed

208
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,650
so we can't finish making these croquettes!

209
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,730
Don't get fixed, don't get fixed,

210
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,550
don't get fixed!

211
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,920
What?

212
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,120
Sanada-san...

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,740
Are you perhaps the clumsy type?

214
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,700
Yes, very much so.

215
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,520
I see!

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,220
S-Sorry, really.

217
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,740
It is just kind of unexpected, you know?

218
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,320
You're a perfectionist with documents,

219
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,560
and Product Development manages the amount of hops and malt,

220
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,190
and also fine tunes the small details.

221
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,240
That's why I presumed you were good at cooking.

222
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,210
I guess that's a "Product Development bias" I had.

223
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,040
- "A bias"?
- Yes.

224
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,550
No, well, that might be too little.

225
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,140
I-I'd like the sugar soon.

226
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,040
Wow, that's quite rough.

227
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,400
I think we need more...

228
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,000
A-A little more sugar?

229
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,780
I'm quick to notice biases toward me,

230
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,250
but I guess not those I hold toward others.

231
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,570
There we have it, the "Ichinose Household's Secret Croquette."

232
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,640
Too bad they look so unfortunate.

233
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,310
Let us dig in before they cool.

234
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Fried foods and beer,

235
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,300
what a sinful combination!

236
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,660
You must not eat it.

237
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,490
You must not eat it, you must not eat it,

238
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,440
you must not eat it, you must not eat it!

239
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,370
Oh.

240
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,520
I think I'll pass.

241
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,330
- I'm not very hungry.
- Is that so?

242
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,980
- Then I shall taste test alone.
- Sure.

243
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,360
How is it?

244
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,020
Is it not that good?

245
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,770
It's...

246
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,940
- super-duper good.
- What?

247
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,530
They pair well.

248
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,600
- For real?
- For real.

249
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,440
Maybe...

250
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,030
I'll have just a bite.

251
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,280
This is seriously super-duper good!

252
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,700
It's delicious!

253
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,490
Wow...

254
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,510
The croquette's misshapen look had no effect on its taste.

255
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,190
The look...

256
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,670
This croquette is the very best.

257
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,150
Really? Is it that good?

258
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,140
In that case, let's have a toast.

259
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,200
Okay, cheers!

260
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,210
Sorry.

261
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,790
Hello?

262
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,650
Ichinose, the croquettes are already done.

263
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
They finally fixed the leak,

264
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,900
- but now my whole room is soaked!
- Could you get that? Sorry.

265
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,070
My landlord is visiting after this

266
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,320
so I can't make it today.

267
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,660
What?

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,720
Then who is ringing?

269
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,430
- It is one of our receptionists.
- What?

270
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,520
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

271
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,030
Riko?
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

272
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,060
Is she your girlfriend?

273
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,170
My ex-girlfriend.

274
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,540
If possible, I'd like to remove the "ex" from ex-girlfriend.

275
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,000
- I see.
- Yes.

276
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,800
Will Riko misunderstand this situation?

277
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,850
No, I was only cooking with a co-worker,

278
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,210
nothing illicit at all.

279
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,920
- If we explain...
- I don't think so.

280
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,270
Right.

281
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,430
Okay, here's the plan.

282
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,350
I'll take her to a diner.

283
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,060
Could you leave after that?

284
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,300
Sure.

285
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,730
- For now, I will hide.
- Yes.

286
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,220
Go to my room.

287
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,500
That's the doorway!

288
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,650
- My shoes.
- Right.

289
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,340
- To the bedroom!
- Okay.

290
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,450
I shall borrow your closet.

291
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm opening the door!

292
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,280
Wait, not the closet!

293
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,590
There's no space.

294
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,590
Then where to?

295
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,880
Under the bed! Wait!

296
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,290
I have unfinished puzzles there!

297
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,710
What to do?

298
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,470
- The bath!
- The bath!

299
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,020
Wait, wait, wait!

300
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,510
Something is stuck!

301
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,360
Allow me to untangle this.

302
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,770
The intercom...

303
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,390
Sorry, come here.

304
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,250
Oh, there!

305
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,120
Sorry, my room is a mess.

306
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,470
The cashews I ordered!

307
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,570
Please do not move.

308
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,730
No, no, this isn't what it looks like.

309
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,570
Let me explain.

310
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,270
Well...

311
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,520
My junior from Sales.

312
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,810
What are you two doing?

313
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,560
Getting entangled.

314
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
Isn't that the worst word choice?

315
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,060
You're the absolute worst!

316
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,140
Darn it... Riko!

317
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,150
Riko, wait!

318
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,230
Listen to me!

319
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,440
Are you dating her?

320
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,260
No, I'm not.

321
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,660
Some of us from Sales were brainstorming a recipe

322
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,150
that pairs with "Summer Romance."

323
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,590
Another junior of mine was supposed to come.

324
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,600
So we weren't being illicit.

325
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,370
All we did was shop, cook, and eat.

326
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,050
That's a date!

327
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,700
- It's not.
- The other party thinks so!

328
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,880
- She doesn't.
- Why defend her?

329
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,150
Besides, you two don't match.

330
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:57,010
She's only using work to sidle (sneak) next to you!

331
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,810
As you say,

332
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,210
Sanada-san can't read the room,

333
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,090
and she's like a robot.

334
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,290
I can't tell what she's thinking, either.

335
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,060
But...

336
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,480
she's not the type of person you think she is.

337
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,270
She is sincere about her work

338
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,120
and her best in Sales, despite being new.

339
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,100
A croquette tastes delicious,

340
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,690
no matter how misshapen it looks.

341
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,120
What are you talking about?

342
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,290
Of course, she'd be gone by now.

343
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,350
Good work today.

344
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,800
I shall now take my leave.

345
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,740
Also, I glanced through the resources you gathered.

346
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,440
It appears cashew nuts are a popular ingredient
[The natural supplements in cashews]

347
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,630
for women and youth in their health and beauty.

348
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,760
Were the scattered cashews intended to be our recipe today?

349
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,410
[Help with anti-aging]

350
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,230
The oleic acid in cashews have antioxidant benefits

351
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,430
and help with anti-aging.

352
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,470
The prejudice or bias against beer

353
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,840
could perhaps be changed with these cashew croquettes.

354
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,460
[The prejudice or bias against beer...]

355
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,310
[Despite their looks, these croquettes have hidden potential.]

356
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:28,840
Really?

357
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,440
Maruya-kun, the recipe your team suggested has been approved.

358
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,350
Thank you very much!

359
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,840
Did you come up with the cashew coating?

360
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,880
No, that was all Sanada-san's idea.

361
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
I see.

362
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,590
Now that's a better expression.

363
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,030
What?

364
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,420
Well, I guess you've always looked good.

365
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,700
Make sure to tell Sanada-san and the others about getting chosen.

366
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,820
Yes, Ma'am.

367
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,820
♫ Hey, in those eyes ♫

368
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,510
This croquette is the very best.

369
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,520
♫ Can you look only at me? ♫

370
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,860
♫ Hurry ♫

371
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,610
There you are.
♫ Come over here ♫

372
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,660
Sanada-san.
♫ I'm sending you this telepathic message from behind ♫

373
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,830
I heard the news from Sudo-san.

374
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,350
Oh, about the croquettes?

375
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,271
Yes.

376
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,310
I came for the same reason.

377
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,880
- Is that so?
- Yes.

378
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,850
This was all you, Sanada-san.

379
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,320
Thank you.

380
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,610
No, thank you.
♫ I wish I could tell you ♫

381
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,130
♫ Without hiding ♫

382
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:08,130
What?
♫ There's likely no end to it; I'm in love for the first time ♫

383
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,940
What?
♫ If I could be the one ♫

384
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,620
What is this feeling?
♫ Who looks good next to you ♫

385
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,680
♫ At the ending credits, it won't be a sad song ♫

386
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,230
♫ But a love song that's just for you ♫

387
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,460
♫ But it's your fault that I can't tell you ♫

388
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,730
I...
♫ You don't even give me a single forced smile ♫

389
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,510
Is this real love?
[The key to protecting "cuteness" was love?]

390
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,860
Are you not feeling well?
[Preview of next episode]

391
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,960
- Let's definitely make it happen and produce good results.
- Yes.
[Cutie Flirt versus Handsome Dandy!]

392
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,190
An information leak?

393
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,900
The rumor is she leaked information on our development.
[Izumi is suspected of leaking information?]

394
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,690
Only I can help her out of this situation.
♫ I just want to be there for you ♫
