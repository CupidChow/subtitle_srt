1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,250
I'm Kosuke Maruya from the sales department.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,370
I am you.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,690
I am the 59-year-old Kosuke Maruya.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,550
I come from 30 years in the future.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,990
After the future me proclaimed that my cuteness would not last long,

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,670
my life began to take a drastic turn for the worse.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,190
You look terrible.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,160
And she appeared before me at this time.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,200
Sanada-san!

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,900
I've fallen in love with you.

11
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,850
This is the first time...

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,390
This is the first time I fell in love and confessed.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,260
However...

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,320
- Sanada-san.
- Izumi!

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,040
Long time no see.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
What is your relationship with Izumi Sanada-san?

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,860
I'm Izumi's older brother, Yamato.

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,771
What!

19
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,690
The HR consultant who stepped in during the company's crisis

20
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,080
was her twin brother.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,670
The Georgia Brewery over in America

22
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,300
is starting up a new research institute,

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,450
and they're hiring new researchers.

24
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,430
You have no idea how I feel.

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,790
But you always pretend like you do, Yamato.

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,120
- Sanada-san?
- All I wanted

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,690
was to make a place for myself.

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,730
Wait, Sanada-san!

29
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,460
If you're carrying a burden,

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,290
I'd like to overcome it together.

31
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,890
Why...

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,050
why am I the only one who has to open up?

33
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,010
- What?
- You didn't tell me the truth, right?

34
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,020
I saw Maruya Brewery's website.

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,000
The President pictured there is your dad, yes?
[President: Yasuhiro Maruya]

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,810
Your father just came back.

37
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,290
Hey.

38
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,290
- Oh.
- Then who was the person I met?

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,980
Why did you lie?

40
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,810
- B-Because—
- I...

41
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,190
knew nothing about you.

42
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,190
Sanada-san!

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,700
All right, that's enough.

44
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,970
You've now reached your expiration date.

45
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,480
- "Expiration date"?
- Yes.

46
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,020
It's your thirtieth birthday in eight days.

47
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,950
That's your expiration date.

48
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,910
If you want me to be even clearer,

49
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,450
that day is the end of your cuteness.

50
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,840
Even if that's true,

51
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
so what?

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,090
It's pointless.

53
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,620
Even if you follow her now,

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,840
I, your future self, am not with Izumi Sanada.

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,550
The future will not change.

56
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,150
My cuteness is about to expire.

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,250
And 30 years later, I'm not with Sanada-san.

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,840
What is this?

59
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,890
Did you come from the future just to tell me this?

60
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,880
Don't interfere with the past, okay?

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,540
The future me has no right to get in the way of the current me!

62
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,970
You're right.

What does she want to talk about?

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,600
It worries me.

67

She's so close, yet I can't ask her about it.

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,280
She noticed it.

Why? What's happening?

Everyone, can I have your attention, please?

73
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,840
Good morning.

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,770
Good morning.

75
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,370
Regarding the current situation of Yayoi Beer,

76
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,410
there are rumors of a merger.

77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,910
However, I personally believe the best strategy

78
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,120
is to explore a self-sustaining restructuring plan.

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,160
However, we must continue to streamline management.

80
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,050
As part of this...

81
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,340
We are considering restructuring and removing the sales department and branch offices.

82
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,880

"Restructuring and removing the sales department"?

84

Restructure and removal?

All right, listen.

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,740
In line with this, we would also like to offer

89
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,650
early retirement packages at the same time.

90
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,150
Isn't it too demanding to streamline the sales department?
[Early Retirement Guidelines]

91

That said, I wouldn't dare to quit just like that.

If it were you, you couldn't keep quiet, either.

- That's true.
- Right?

115
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
So whose resignation letter was that?

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,400
As for that... I was too shocked and didn't see it.

- That was the most important part!
- Sorry.

118
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,400
But since the Director was holding on to it...

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,650
This means someone in our department submitted it, right?

00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,180
The deadline is tomorrow.

543
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,540
Everyone...

544
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,030
I am at the end of my stamina.

545
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,590
I am also running out of energy.

546
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,910
Thank you for your hard work.

547
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,210
Thank you for your hard work, Sanada-san.

548
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,070
Sanada-san?

549
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,640
Aren't you on leave?

550
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,140
I apologize for taking time off while everyone is having a hard time.

551
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,450
Is there anything I can help with?

552
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,230
Of course.

553
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,920
Hooray!

554
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
That's great.

555
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,060
Welcome back!

556
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,360
Look, he's crying.

557
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,710
Let's do it!

558
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,440
Let's do our best!

559
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,190
All right.

560
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,010
Yes.

561
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,940
Do it!

562
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,980
Let's go.

563
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
All right.

564
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,110
- Is the data complete?
- Yes.

565
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,300
Well...

566
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,230
- I'll send the data over now.
- Sorry for the trouble.

567
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,460
Please check the completed sales plan with each respective retailer.

568
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,840
Got it.

569
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,480
One empty can...

570
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,910
Two empty cans...

571
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,990
Kaburagi-san, please wake up!

572
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,260
Look!

573
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,010
Sanada-san?

574
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,300
I'm done.

575
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,250
Now we need to follow the sales plan to secure the product.

576
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,630
Sanada-san, thank you so much!

577
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,060
Hooray!

578
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,940
You're excellent!

579
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,470
Thank you!

580
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,460
That's great!

581
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,980
Sanada-san, thank you so much.

582
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,890
- Sanada-san.
- Yes?

583
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:21,260
Can you please take back your resignation letter?

584
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,370
"Resignation letter"?

585
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,530
Ichinose said he saw the letter,

586
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,090
your resignation letter.

587
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,460
Director dropped it, and I happened to pick it up.

588
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,560
I think you're mistaken.

589
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,290
I didn't submit a resignation letter.

590
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,220
What?

591
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,270
So who submitted it?

592
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,220
That resignation letter is mine.

593
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,770
What?

594
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,840
Actually, a friend and I are thinking of starting a wine import company.

595
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,110
I figured if I just gave up, I'd regret it so I took the chance.

596
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,850
I see.

597
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,270
That means...

598
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,440
Sanada-san is...

599
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,450
I didn't submit a resignation letter.

600
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,750
That's great!

601
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,540
Hey, so it's fine for me to quit then?

602
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,180
No, that's not what I meant.

603
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,100
I'm just joking. I know what you guys mean.

604
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
What's the matter?

605
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,160
I'm so sad that Director is leaving.

606
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:30,200
On top of that, I'm tired, and my emotions are all messed up.

607
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,740
Thank you, Ichinose-kun.

608
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,740
Director!

609
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,960
It's all right.

610
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,951
Calm down.

611
00:35:38,951 --> 00:35:42,030
Kaburagi-san!

612
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,250
It's okay.

613
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,800
Don't cry.

614
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,330
I thought you'd be leaving the company just like that.

615
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,710
I am sorry for taking a leave of absence without giving a reason.

616
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,890
Also,

617
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,520
thank you very much.

618
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,360
Maruya-san, you created a place for me to belong.

619
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,080
Also,

620
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:15,900
you asked me to help protect everyone's place.

621
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,980
I was very happy.

622
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,620
I always believed I didn't belong anywhere.

623
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,980
But from all that happened,

624
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,150
I now have a place where I belong.

625
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,570
The past I wished could be erased,

626
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,450
I think it may be good to have.

627
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,940
The past has changed.

628
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,960
I owe it to you, Maruya-san.

629
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,430
I see.

630
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,870
It wasn't the future that changed, it was the past.

631
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,480
What?

632
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
Oh, nothing.

633
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,970
Also, there's something

634
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,810
I haven't told you.

635
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,880
I'm thinking of going to the United States.

636
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,970
What?

637
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,220
- Are you going to Georgia Brewery after all?
- No,

638
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,740
as a researcher.

639
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,700
I decided to attend a university there

640
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,700
to try and learn again.

641
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,850
I understand.

642
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,160
In this case,

643
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,660
you will still...

644
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,130
Yes.

645
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,780
I will resign.

646
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,910
It's because I learned from you that

647
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:44,110
I can create my own place.

648
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,160
I got it.

649
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,940
What about your future plans?

650
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,110
I am thinking of staying in the company.

651
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,550
I don't know how much I can do,

652
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,690
but I hope to work with everyone to rebuild the company.

653
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,720
That's good.

654
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,030
Yes.

655
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:20,340
🌄 Thank you to our Channel Manager: sunset_vermont

656
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:28,310
✂️ Thanks to our Chief Segmenter: marykarmelina

657
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,810
So...

658
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:38,410
🍁 Chief Editor: worthyromance

659
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,050
Happy Birthday.

660
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,240
What?

661
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,480
Today is your thirtieth birthday, right?

662
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,090
Wow!

663
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,570
Maruya-kun's birthday!

664
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,940
I totally forgot about it!

665
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,260
Kaburagi-san, this isn't the right time for this!

666
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,380
Let's go back! See you two later.

667
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,980
Both of you, please continue.

668
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,060
So without much ado,

669
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,640
I reached my thirtieth birthday.

670
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,700
In other words, my cuteness has reached its expiration date.

671
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,370
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

672
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,460
Hey.

673
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,420
I heard it from Director Yamamuro.

674
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,980
You guys worked on the proposal until this morning, right?

675
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,640
We were at our limits.

676
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,030
Why are you here today?

677
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,860
Kaburagi-kun invited me to your surprise birthday party

678
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,780
that is in conjunction with Sanada's surprise farewell party later.

679
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
You're telling the person who's meant to be surprised?

680
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,760
I have to tell you, or else

681
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,090
you'd be like Sanada, who left without knowing the surprise for her.

682
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,991
What?

683
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:54,250
She's taking a 5 o'clock flight

684
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,950
to America today.

685
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,940
Well, that's the last surprise I have for you.

686
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:12,110
✍️ General Editors: my_happy_place, rachel2003

687
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,870
No matter what the future holds,

688
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,330
it won't change

689
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,210
how I feel now.

690
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,920
Thank you very much.

691
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,200
Oh, sorry.

692
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,170
Maruya-san!

693
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,171
Where are you going?

694
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:35,140
But I bought you cake!

695
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,280
Ichinose-kun.

696
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,750
That was meant to be a surprise.

697
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,170
Oh! I'm sorry!

698
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,980
Kaburagi-san...

699
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,660
I blurted it out. What should we do?

700
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,580
Hey.

701
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,290
I was thinking that I ran down this street on my thirtieth birthday.

702
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,590
Are you going to meet her?

703
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,900
It doesn't matter if we can be together in the future or not

704
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,830
because I want to see her now.

705
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,050
I agree.

706
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,920
So...

707
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,010
is my cuteness really coming to an end?

708
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,570
From here, you will become me.

709
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,330
I see.

710
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,030
Your reaction is rather relaxed.

711
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,380
Well,

712
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,670
I don't know why you came to this time period.

713
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,370
But you didn't try to change the future.

714
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,720
That says it all.

715
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,400
Even when the cuteness is over,

716
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,180
you're still happy with who you are.

717
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,450
There is no expiration date on people.

718
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,050
So I think it would be okay.

719
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,270
Well, I'm in a hurry.

720
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,950
Oh!

721
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,420
Perhaps it's not that the future won't change,

722
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,260
but that you don't want to change the future.

723
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,270
Aren't you in a hurry?

724
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,270
See you then.

725
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,250
Goodbye, me.

726
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,940
Oh!

727
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,220
Sanada-san!

728
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,660
Take care of yourself.

729
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,010
Yes.

730
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,830
I'll be back in good spirits the day after tomorrow.

731
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,711
"The day after tomorrow"?

732
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:23,350
Yes, I'm just going for the entrance interview.

733
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,500
Sudo-san...

734
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,060
What?

735
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,690
Nothing.

736
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,380
I realize it.

737
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,810
I see.

738
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,500
I...

739
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,670
I...

740
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,410
I still like you after all, Sanada-san.

741
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,950
From here on, I don't know what the future holds.

742
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,020
However, I know I will be in love with you...

743
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,150
again and again.

744
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,210
No matter how many times,

745
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,820
I will still fall in love with you, Sanada-san.

746
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,750
♫ Can you look only at me? ♫

747
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,680
Me, too.

748
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,640
I think I would fall in love with you, too.

749
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,110
I hope so.

750
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,150
When you get back,

751
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,770
do you want to go on a date again?

752
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:32,420
This time, we will go by the itinerary.

753
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,720
In that case, I want to drink with you.

754
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,350
Got it.

755
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,880
I will prepare your favorite drink.

756
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,100
Is it beer?

757
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,960
Wine? Or Japanese sake?

758
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,460
It's not the type,

759
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,730
but I think what will be most delicious

760
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,090
is the one I drink with. That's you, Kosuke-san.

761
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,720
♫ There's likely no end to it; I'm in love for the first time ♫

762
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,730
Is that a "no"?

763
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:03,350
Sanada-san, you just called me Kosuke-san.

764
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:06,810
Hold on.

765
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,090
What is it?

766
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,730
♫ But it's your fault that I can't tell you ♫

767
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,210
You're cute.

768
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,000
Kosuke-san, you are cuter.

769
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,360
♫ Today, I still can't say I love you. Tomorrow ♫

770
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:31,600
♫ I just want to be there for you ♫

771
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,630
Good morning.

772
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,700
Good morning.

773
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,620
Good morning.

I guess I have no choice.

Come in.

782

Cheers.

788
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,270
♫ Who is like that ♫

789
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:28,090
♫ At the ending credits, it won't be a sad song ♫

790
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:33,010
♫ But a love song that's just for you ♫

791

♫ Who walks beside you ♫

794
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,650
