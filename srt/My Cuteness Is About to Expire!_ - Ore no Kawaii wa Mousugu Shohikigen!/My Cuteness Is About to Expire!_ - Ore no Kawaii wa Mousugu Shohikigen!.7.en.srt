1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,770
- Thank you for the hard work.
- Thank you for the hard work.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,470
- Sanada-san, please submit the report.
- Got it.

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,070
Kaburagi-san, Kaburagi-san!

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,330
Don't you think Sanada-san changed her makeup?

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,780
Don't you feel like she's gotten cuter?

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,950
Oh.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,340
Perhaps she's in love.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,780
Kaburagi-san, you're too corny.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,150
Ichinose.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,990
Human beings are surprisingly corny.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,340
Well, in my filtered eyes, she is always...

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,760
so...

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,100
cute!

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,140
I couldn't believe it, too.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,870
That day, I decided it was our last date.

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,390
However, we...

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,040
have started dating each other.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,700
And this morning...

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,670
[Good morning.]

20
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,410
[Good morning.]

21
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,840
[I'll be in your care today as well.]

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,760
[Shall we go for dinner after work?]

23
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,970
[I'll be glad to go.]

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,030
[What do you want to eat? Japanese, Western or Chinese food?]

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,510
[Let's go to a restaurant that you recommend.]

26
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,130
[Okay!]

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,470
[I made a reservation here for 7 p.m.]

28
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,070
[Thank you for arranging it.]

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,930
[I am looking forward to it.]

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,180
Oh.

31
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,510
My happiness index is at 100%!

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,310
However, this is an office romance.

33
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,580
Sanada-san is a newcomer, and I'm her mentor.

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,520
We can't bring private relationships into the workplace.

35
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,230
- Maruya-san.
- Yes?

36
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,610
Shall we all go out for a drink after work today?

37
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,770
What?

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,930
What about Sanada-san? Will you drink with us?

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,600
Thank you.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,690
I found a nice place to go.

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,260
Shall I make a reservation for 7 p.m.?

42
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,430
At 7:00?

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,800
At 7:00...

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,390
[Okay! I made a reservation here for 7p.m.]

45
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,320
In this case, it's tricky when we have unsuspecting colleagues,

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,510
who don't know what's going on.

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,060
Ichinose-kun!

48
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,820
Yes.

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,670
We are hosting a dinner for Tokusho's general manager tonight.

50
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,130
- Is it tonight?
- Oh...

51
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,750
Then let's gather next time.

52
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm sorry, even though I was the one who asked you out.

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,940
It's fine with me.

54
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,830
All right.

55
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,120
No.

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,780
The trickiest thing might be

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,070
a very observant colleague.

58
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,610
Sanada-san.

59
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,240
Shall we visit the clients once more?

60
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,010
Yes.

61
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,250
Thank you for your time today.

62
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,790
Thank you very much.

63
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,110
Excuse us.

64
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,570
Again, the important thing in an office romance

65
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,870
is to draw a clear line between public and private life.

66
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,990
Shall we end here for the day?

67
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,770
Sure. Thank you for the hard work today.

68
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,270
Thank you for the hard work.

69
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,170
Well then.

70
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,530
Well then.

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,060
Maruya-san.

72
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,000
There's something I need to apologize for.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
What is it?

74
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,350
I left the pot at your house.

75
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh.

76
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,830
It has already blended into my house, though.

77
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm sorry about it.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
I don't mind at all.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,340
If so, do you want to come by my house to pick it up?

80
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,220
Going to your house?

81
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,480
She froze.

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,240
Was it too early to invite her to my house for a date?

83
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,540
It must be the first time Sanada-san has dated someone.

84
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,680
Such things are...

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,900
How about tomorrow?

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
"Tomorrow"?

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,840
Yes. Is there a problem?

88
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,940
Not at all.

89
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,920
It's not too early at all.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
- You first.
- You first.

91
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,800
Thank you.

92
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,170
Yes, yes.

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,910
Please come in.

94
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,240
Mom?

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,300
Oh, you're Kosuke's girlfriend.

96
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,400
My name is Izumi Sanada.

97
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,700
I am Kosuke's mother, Michiko.

98
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,760
Since you are also working at Yayoi Beer,

99
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,640
this is an office romance, right?

100
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,100
Who confessed first?

101
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,270
- Don't ask such things.
- I'm curious!

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,220
- Maruya-san confessed first.
- You don't have to answer such questions.

103
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,800
Let's sit down.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
Why did you come suddenly? You should have informed me first.

105
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,150
It was sudden for me, too.

106
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,660
Your father was hospitalized.

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,080
Is something wrong with Dad?

108
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,980
He collapsed at work.

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,020
I wanted to tell you about it.

110
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,860
When we met, he seemed in good health.

111
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,190
Izumi-san, did you meet Kousuke's father?

112
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,060
Yes.

113
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,080
Sanada-san, this is...

114
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,310
I am Kosuke Maruya's father.

115
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,291
Maruya-san's father.

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,200
Sanada-san thought the future me was my father.

117
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,530
That was pure coincidence.

118
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,810
It was before we started dating.

119
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,320
Then you should go and meet him again.

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,630
He will be so happy that his illness will disappear.

121
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,860
"His illness will disappear"?

122
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,820
Yes, like "poof!"

123
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,360
"Poof."

124
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,700
If so, I would like to visit him.

125
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,520
Can I visit your house?

126
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,840
What?

127
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,860
Of course.

128
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,590
Both of you should come over.

129
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,780
Why didn't you ask about my opinion?

130
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,960
Going to my parents' house? This is going too fast!

131
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,750
[Ore no Kawaii wa Mousugu Shohikigen!?]

132
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,980
[My Cuteness Is About to Expire!?]

133
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,220
Please.

134
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,770
Act as your father?

135
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,600
Just go meet her and tell her you've fully recovered,

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
and she doesn't need to visit you.

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,650
You just have to do this.

138
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,330
Handle it yourself.

139
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,530
What? Hold on.

140
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,210
We just started dating. This is the most important time for us.

141
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,550
As I've explained, please help me.

142
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,730
I'm not here to help you.

143
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,370
Also, no matter what I do, the future won't change.

144
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,410
I told you before, right?

145
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm not trying to change the future.

146
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,030
I...

147
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,220
I just want to get through this phase.

148
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,010
What should I say?

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,380
I will bring her here.

150
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,850
Then...

151
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,260
"Hello."

152
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,130
"I've sorry to have worried you."

153
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,750
"Father, how is your health?"

154
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,080
"As you can see, I'm fine now."

155
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,140
"Izumi-san, please take care of Kosuke."

156
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,880
"It's kind of weird for me to say this,"

157
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
"but he is a good man."

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,960
"Dad, don't say such things."

159
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,550
"It's embarrassing."

160
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,910
W-Wait a minute.

161
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,240
- I don't care.
- Don't you care?

162
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,250
What was that?

163
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,740
So this is your parents' house.

164
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,810
It's very grand.

165
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,440
It's just an old house.

166
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,380
I'm sorry you had to travel such a long way.

167
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,860
It's okay.

168
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,580
In the end, I couldn't tell her the truth

169
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,790
and brought her to my parents' house.

170
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,480
I'm back.

171
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,900
Oh!

172
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,290
Isn't this Kosuke?

173
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,780
- It's been a long time.
- Oh my!

174
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,500
- Is this your girlfriend?
- Yes.

175
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,080
This is Okubo-san. She has worked for us for a long time.

176
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,720
How is my dad?

177
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Oh, Boss.

178
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,870
They say he's been anemic.

179
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,500
We were so shocked.

180
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,740
"Anemic"?

181
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,730
He will be discharged today.

182
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,260
What?

183
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,860
I got tricked.

184
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,020
Mom said that to make me come back.

185
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,430
I'm so sorry, Sanada-san.

186
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,390
It's all right. I'm glad your father's condition is not serious.

187
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,150
Sanada-san is too nice.

188
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,370
No.

189
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,500
That's all the more reason not to let her see Dad.

190
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,840
Okubo-san, can we talk?

191
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,290
This is a souvenir from Tokyo.

192
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,700
From Tokyo?

193
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,300
There's something I want to ask about Dad.

194
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,760
Dad?

195
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,530
Do you know a place called "Chu Girl"?

196
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,830
Oh.

197
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,620
Are you a regular customer there?

198
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,580
Actually, my girlfriend knows someone who works there.

199
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,600
If Mom knows about it...

200
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,760
What?

201
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,890
You're not coming home today?

202
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,490
Oh, darn.

203
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,400
That's a pity.

204
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,030
Okay. Next time then.

205
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,890
Maruya-san.

206
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,490
Your father just came back.

207
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,200
Dad?

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,890
Hey.

209
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,090
I just got discharged from the hospital.

210
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,580
He seems to be feeling better now.

211
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,900
Hold on.

212
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,810
Why did you reject me, but came here?

213
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,950
Even though I knew it was my old self asking for my help,

214
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,560
I was still swayed by such a cute face!

215
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,650
Oh, you guys are here.

216
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,300
It's been a long journey. You must be tired.

217
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,940
Thank you for allowing me to visit. We were just talking to Kosuke's father.

218
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,010
What?

219
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,320
He was here just now.

220
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,350
Kosuke's father?

221
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,780
He said he had to stay in the hospital for another day.

222
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,930
He just told me over the phone.

223
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,950
He really wanted to see Sanada-san.

224
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,730
So he came over and just returned to the hospital.

225
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,410
What?

226
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,120
Where?

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,650
He's gone already.

228
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,990
Oh, you missed him.

229
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,490
- Sanada-san, let's go put our luggage down.
- Okay.

230
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,080
All right.
[Maruya Sake Brewery Co.]

231
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,960
Please enjoy the food.

232
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,990
It looks delicious.

233
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,390
They don't just look delicious.

234
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,930
They are in fact delectable.

235
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,040
But our top recommendation is this one.

236
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,690
- Please have some.
- Thank you.
[Riku Ten Rou]

237
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

238
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,420
- You, too.
- Thank you.

239
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,160
Since Kosuke's father isn't in good condition,

240
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,350
we cannot toast happily.

241
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,580
He's just anemic.

242
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,260
Please try it.

243
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,050
This tastes good.

244
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,490
It's smooth on the palate with a slight sweetness.

245
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,000
With its umami (savory), aroma, and sharpness, it's a wonderful sake.

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,940
As expected of a beer company employee.

247
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,800
She used to work in research and development.

248
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,100
Oh my.

249
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,640
Will we someday have the chance

250
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,700
to ask you to envision a new sake for us?

251
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,240
Mom, you shouldn't say such things.

252
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,770
Why not? I don't know how much longer your father and I can keep going.

253
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,740
In the end, it's still about taking over the family business.

254
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,520
Wait.

255
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,890
Honestly, if it's with Sanada-san,

256
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,330
I could see it happening.

257
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,150
How is it over there?

258
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,720
The balance is great.

259
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,110
It's not bad.

260
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,780
Yes, it's not bad.

261
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,670
- But...
- Your cute life is as far as this goes.

262
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,900
This cuteness is about to end soon.

263
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,620
The time left for me is...

264
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,690
Oh, yes.

265
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,460
Do you want to see Kosuke's photo album?

266
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,590
He's been so cute since he was a baby.

267
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,940
You'd be surprised by the perfectly cute face he was born with.

268
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, I would like to see it.

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,350
No, we don't have to see it.

270
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,330
- Mom!
- It should be here.

271
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,290
Oh no! Dad's photo is inside the album.

272
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,890
- Which one is it?
- Mom, don't take it out!

273
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,440
Stop it!

274
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,240
Stop it!

275
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,880
Excuse me.

276
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,840
I'm sorry for interrupting your meal.

277
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,630
Oh, what happened?

278
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:51,000
What's the matter?

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,260
Kosuke-chan, I can't accept such an expensive gift after all.

280
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,360
It's fine.

281
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,480
What's wrong?

282
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,720
Excuse me.

283
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,740
Mom, there's a customer.

284
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,550
Yes, coming!

285
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,600
What's the matter?

286
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
When I shared the souvenir you gave me with Saito-san,

287
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,810
he searched the Internet

288
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,040
and said they were some very expensive sweets.

289
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,590
It's nothing like that.

290
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,120
I blabbed to you about Boss,

291
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,360
and if Boss knows about it...

292
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,430
What did she say?

293
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,600
She said the sweets from Tokyo are impressively tasty.

294
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,501
I see.

295
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,000
Saito-san said we are in the Internet era now.

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Everything spreads very fast.

297
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,460
It'll be fine. Don't worry about it.

298
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,650
Don't worry.

299
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,300
Mom, I'll send Okubo-san home.

300
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,180
Are you here for sightseeing?

301
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,340
Yes, I found out about this brewery from the Internet.

302
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,370
I see.

303
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,760
What are you doing?

304
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
I have to return these, right?
[Maruya Sake Brewery Co.]

305
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,590
Excuse me.

306
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,120
This is your change of 300 yen ($2).

307
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,170
Thank you very much.

308
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,990
"The Internet"?

309
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,430
Give me a break!

310
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,080
Okubo-san?

311
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,850
Excuse me...

312
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,520
Yes?

313
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,770
You need to find the bus stop, right?

314
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,920
I'll show you the way.

315
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,820
Well...

316
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,330
You look young.

317
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,970
What?

318
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,690
Thank you very much.

319
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,410
This boy was called the "Miracle of Aomori."

320
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,500
Actually, only I called him that.

321
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,080
I'm a mother who has eyes for only her child, right?

322
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,340
No.

323
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,010
Looking at it objectively,

324
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,630
Maruya-san was born with great looks.

325
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,360
And to be subjective,

326
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,350
he is a wonderful person.

327
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,730
I see that you're a girlfriend, who has eyes for only your boyfriend.

328
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,770
No, I'm not.

329
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,430
Izumi-san,

330
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,580
what do you plan to do in the future?

331
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,010
My plan?

332
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,630
Will you continue to work at your current company?

333
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know.

334
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,070
I'm so occupied by things happening right now.

335
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,830
I haven't thought that far ahead.

336
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,160
I thought of going back to work on research.

337
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,680
But I'm not sure about it.

338
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,870
Why?

339
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,390
It's embarrassing to say this,

340
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,720
but I chose a research career because I wanted a job

341
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,020
with minimal contact to people.

342
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,440
But in the end,

343
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,890
I couldn't get along with co-workers well.

344
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,970
I see.

345
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,010
Actually, I was born in Tokyo.

346
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,010
What?

347
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,230
I couldn't tell.

348
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,370
When I came to live here,

349
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,290
I didn't know anyone. But the most challenging thing was the dialect.

350
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,180
Sometimes I didn't understand what people were saying at all.

351
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,160
I felt even more lonely.

352
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,410
But then,

353
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,650
I gave birth to Kosuke.

354
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,450
He's so cute, right?

355
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,770
So people started to gather around him.

356
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,910
Then I... somehow got used to this place.

357
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,700
He's the one who created a place for me to settle in.

358
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,000
What happened?

359
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,230
It was the same for me.

360
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,960
He has also created a place for me to settle in.

361
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,870
I see.

362
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,830
Let's toast.

363
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,910
Let's toast.

364
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,600
Cheers!

365
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,760
Drink more! Cheers!

366
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,620

Just how far did you go?

371
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,370
Izumi-san fell asleep.

372
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,350
Who knew our first night spent together would be at my parents' house?

373
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,710
But she's so cute.

374
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:48,110
Oh, how I wish I could stay like this longer without moving my arm.

This...

What should I do?

We're dating anyway.

379

No.

380
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,380
Doing this when someone is drunk and asleep is a bit...

381
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,040
Good night.

Are you sure I shouldn't go with you to the station?

384
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,740
Yes. Up to here is fine.

385
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,040
I was wondering what kind of girl she'd be.

386
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,160
Turns out, she's such a nice girl.

387

You gave me such a nice gift yesterday. Please take these.

388

Oh, what did you two talk about while I was out yesterday?

389
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,860
Nothing much.

390
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,890
I only told her about all your past girlfriends.

391
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,010
What? Why do something so unnecessary?

392
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,550
You've always been so popular

393
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,120
since you're good-looking.

394
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,190
I don't know about that.

Yes. Thank you for having me at your place.

401
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,800
I didn't do anything much, though.

402
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,800
Sanada-san, let's go.

403
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,190
All right.

is it the customer from yesterday?

411
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,900
Isn't your father supposed to be in the hospital?

412
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,870
Sanada-san, we must catch the train. We should leave.

413
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,370
