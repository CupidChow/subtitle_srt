1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,110
I am you.

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,730
I am the 59-year-old Kosuke Maruya.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,640
This cuteness is about to end soon.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,680
Maruya-kun, the recipe your team suggested has been approved.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,210
This was all you, Sanada-san. Thank you.

6
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,990
This chest tightening sensation...

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,950
Is this real love?

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,030
The rumor is Sanada-san leaked our development data

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,760
to Teio Beer.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,850
In the end, I couldn't do anything for her.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,670
I have no role to play in this.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,430
Cashew nut croquettes coming through!

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
Well, then we're going live in 15 minutes.
[Our Time TV]

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,510
- We look forward to your support.
- Okay!

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,840
Is this the first time for the two of you?

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,700
It's my first time for a TV program.

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,420
So I'm a little...

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,970
Ohara-san.

20
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,600
Are you Yayoi Beer employees?

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,000
We've been in your care.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,370
Same here, thank you for the hard work.

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,250
- Thank you for the hard work!
- Thank you for the hard work.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,640
Please excuse me.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,050
Thank you!

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,510
Thank you.

27
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,940
Next up!

28
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,490
I'll fix that.

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,700
Go ahead.

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,280
What, Maruya-kun?

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,700
Is it someone you know?

32
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,490
Well, Sudo-san...

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,930
What is it?

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,310
Well...

35
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,670
Oh dear!

36
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,290
What bad timing!

37
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,560
But... I'm curious!

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm sorry about the other day.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,651
Oh...

40
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:43,110
I let an embarrassing moment slip and caused you trouble.

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
I've never felt that you've caused me trouble.

42
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,050
But at that time, it may have been more appropriate

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,580
if I'd invited you for some good food.

44
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,190
I certainly...

45
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,040
did feel like eating some good food.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,730
Then shall we go get some this weekend?

47
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,940
I have a Sales collaboration event this Saturday,

48
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,520
but if it's Friday...

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

50
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,510
Kaburagi-san! Kaburagi-san!

51
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,720
Kaburagi-san, have you heard?

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,810
Orders for the One Blade-Summer Romance cans have reached 300,000 cases!

53
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,440
Ichinose-kun, it's the most exciting manga now!
[Limited edition]

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,100
It's number one in popularity!

55
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,640
So 300,000 cases are not surprising.

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,760
Is that so?

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,000
What's amazing is that just when the anime is premiering,

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,760
we had the foresight to link it

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,110
with Summer Romance that hasn't been performing.

60
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,900
I don't know whose idea it was,

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,360
- but it was a really great one.
- You're casually belittling our product.

62
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,310
Maruya-kun, it's interesting, isn't it?

63
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,020
What volume are you on? Has Shepazo died?

64
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,180
Please don't talk to me.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,750
I'm sorry. You want to focus, right?

66
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,070
Is Shepazo going to die?

67
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,900
Manga is certainly interesting.

68
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,940
However, I have another reason for immersing in it.

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,500
If I don't stay busy, I'll keep thinking about unnecessary stuff.

70
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,720
Oh, that part...

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,110
It can make one cry buckets!

72
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,590
I'm also reading it!

73
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,070
Sanada-san, do you like "One Blade"?

74
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,770
"Sanada-san"?

75
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,210
Yes, I love it.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,540
I love it.

77
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,680
So is that really the case?

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,250
It makes you cry, right?

79
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,360
It's too painful!

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
That's good to hear.

Oh, Pomella-chan!

She's the best!

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,060
So cute!

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,470
I look forward to the launch event tomorrow.

90
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,900
We're looking forward to it, too.

91
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,370
We will work hard to achieve record sales.

92
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,500
May I know where our products are?

93
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,340
- They're in the back warehouse.
- Please lead the way.

94
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,890
What is it?

95
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,170
No, nothing.

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,390
I didn't know that you also like "One Blade."

97
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,460
Yes, I gave the can-collaboration proposal to the Product Development team.

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,920
I see...

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,660
What?

100
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,940
What?

101
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,760
- Sanada-san, was it your idea?
- Yes.

102
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,230
- Was it your idea?
- Yes.

103
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,250
- Wow, I asked you twice!
- Yes.

104
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,320
Then why didn't you say anything?

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,660
I didn't think it was worth saying.

106
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,280
Wow, the bar for "worth saying" is high.

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,840
I think it's something worth saying, though.

108
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,770
But since it's your proposal,

109
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,250
we must make tomorrow's event a success

110
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,620
and achieve the top sales record, right?

111
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,270
That's right.

112
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,170
The difference in excitement level...

113
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,550
More importantly, I see only regular cans here.

114
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,390
They haven't brought in the collaboration cans yet.

115
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,880
You're right.

116
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,240
Are they caught in a traffic jam?

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,740
Then shall we go get some this weekend?

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,590
But if it's Friday...

119
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,050
That's right...

120
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,900
Today is Friday.

121
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,800
After this,

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,620
Sanada-san will go on a date with Sudo-san.

123
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,830
If we two keep waiting for the products to arrive,
[Kosuke's Truck Analysis]

124
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,120
I can stop the date.
[Kosuke's Truck Analysis]

125
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,920
But that will make me a super bad guy.

126
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,030
But I don't want to see her happy with Sudo-san, either.

127
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,390
Either way, my position is too pathetic!

128
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,440
Is something the matter?

129
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,550
Nothing.

130
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,140
You can finish up for the day, Sanada-san.

131
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,400
There's no point for both of us to wait here.

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,770
But...

133
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,180
Actually, tomorrow...

134
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,790
there's something I must do, no matter what.

135
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,440
I'll stay back for today. In exchange,

136
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,150
would it be all right if I finish earlier tomorrow?

137
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,580
Is there something you need to do?

138
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,950
A promise?

139
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,900
Or rather, how should I put it?

140
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,620
A date?

141
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,421
"A date"?

142
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,750
Is it with that receptionist?

143
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh...

144
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,910
Yes, that's right.

145
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,620
Yes, it is.

146
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,330
Congratulations.

147
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,480
In that case, I understand.

148
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,820
Thanks.

149
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,640
Okay, I'll take my leave then.

150
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,840
- Thank you for the hard work.
- Sure, thanks for the hard work.

151
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,600
What? A mistake in the collaboration-can order?

152
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,060
Yes. When I checked the invoice,

153
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,990
it seems there was an error in the product code.

154
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,980
This is definitely the code for regular cans.

155
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,670
We still can...

156
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,810
get the collaboration cans in time, right?

157
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,580
What should we do?

158
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,360
Publicity for the event is already out too.

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,400
Gosh...

160
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,800
I gave the can-collaboration proposal to the Product Development team.

161
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,570
Manager...

162
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,880
I'll settle it somehow.

163
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,590
There was a mistake on our end so we need 200 cases of collaboration cans.

164
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,010
Do you perhaps have any in your current stock that we could take?

165
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,740
No, well...

166
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,190
- Even just ten cases would be fine.
- Maruya-kun!

167
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,950
- Sorry to have disturbed you during your busy schedule.
- Maruya-kun,

168
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,140
I heard there was a purchase order mistake.

169
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,170
I inquired with the factory too,

170
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,330
but they said it's impossible right now.

171
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,820
The stock at the shop we're in charge of...

172
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,590
Could we give some to Maruya-san?

173
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,450
We can't do that between rival supermarkets.

174
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,530
Anyway, we can't afford to suffer any losses at tomorrow's event.

175
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,130
I will go to every store

176
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,830
and gather the cases one by one.

177
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,240
Please let me help, too.

178
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,090
That's right. Let's split up the work.

179
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,610
Thank you.

180
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,710
Congratulations on the collaboration cans launch.

181
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,940
Thank you very much.

00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,590
The Summer Romance that I developed as Product Chief,

183
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,910
and your proposal package...

184
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,460
So many things were going on.

185
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,580
It makes me feel deeply emotional.

186
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,110
Well, in terms of popularity, your proposal wins for sure.

187
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,750
I like it...

188
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,400
the Summer Romance that Sudo-san developed.

189
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,050
Me, too.

190
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,100
I like it.

191
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,200
Summer Romance, I mean.

192
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,050
The food here is good.

193
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,840
Eat whatever you want.

194
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,410
Got it.

195
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,060
Please!

196
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,790
I'll follow up with the next batch of orders.

197
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,000
Any number of cases is fine.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,860
What are you talking about?

199
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,080
It's impossible.

200
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,051
If you can somehow...

201
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:59,720
Could you make adjustments to the shops under your charge, Hori-san?

202
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,240
It'll be hard...

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm sorry!

204
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,750
It's okay.

205
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,440
Thank you very much.

206
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,170
All right.

[Director Yamamuro]

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
When will you stop gathering the collaboration cans?

209
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,650
When we have enough to sell for the event.

210
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,300
As a salesman, it's right to go all out for your customers.

211
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,100
But if you don't know when to shift focus, you'll cause trouble for them.

212
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,890
Let's think of another strategy.

213
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,560
- But...
- What's wrong?

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,600
This is not like you, Maruya-kun.

215
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,620
These collaboration cans...

216
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,210
I heard they were Sanada-san's idea.

217
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,820
That's why

218
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,500
if we can make this event a success,

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,180
everyone's impression of her would change, I thought.

220
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,130
Their impression of Sanada-san?

221
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,340
About the rumor of the information leak.

222
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,820
I think there are still people who misunderstand her.

223
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,540
Therefore,

224
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,490
please let me go all out for a bit longer.

225
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,090
Please.

226
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,200
Maruya-san?

227
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,190
Maruya-san!

228
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
Maruya-san?

229
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,580
Maruya-san?

230
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,030
I have sushi here.

231
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,720
Gosh...

232
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,840
There's no way I'd always be at the park, right?

233
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,900
You're really here.

234
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,670
Do you remember the missed order for the collaboration cans?

235
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,840
Tomorrow is the launch date, and we have an event.

236
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,910
What happens in the end?

237
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,310
What should I do to prepare for it?

238
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,610
I mean, can you go back in time

239
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,400
and do something to reverse the missed order?

240
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,690
- How would I know?
- "How would you know"?

241
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,750
Look, I didn't come from the future

242
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,450
to save the me in the past.

243
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,150
I don't do such things.

244
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,390
I...

245
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,970
am you, you know?

246
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,060
Listen. Even if I help you out now,

247
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,020
the future won't change.

248
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,520
Those who cause problems will still cause it one day,

249
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
even if we prevent it at first.

250
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,470
Those who work hard will reach their goals one day,

251
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,790
even if they are hindered now.

252
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,190
As long as that person is who he is,

253
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,650
this thing called fate will get attracted to him.

254
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,380
I'm not the one who can change your future.

255
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,390
You, yourself, must do it.

256
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,860
Then there's no point in coming here from the future, right?

257
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,700
No point indeed.

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,260
See you.

259
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,220
It's checkmate.

260
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,420
Sanada-san...

261
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,450
Everyone on the sales team was worried so they called me.

262
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
The collaboration cans matter...

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,110
Why didn't you, Maruya-san, contact me about it?

264
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,720
Sanada-san,

265
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,640
because you had an appointment today.

266
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,760
If it poses any risk to our work tomorrow,

267
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,600
it'll be harder to solve by not contacting me.

268
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Are you angry?

269
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm also in charge of this.

270
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,290
Do you have no trust in me?

271
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,370
That's not true.

272
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,500
I should have called you.

273
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,550
I'm sorry.

274
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,650
Let's go to the shop and apologize.

275
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,200
Okay.

276
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,360
Were you dealing with the collaboration cans all this time?

277
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,160
Yes.

278
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,540
I want the event to be a success, no matter what,

279
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,720
to achieve the top sales record.

280
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,520
Why would you go to that extent?

281
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,800
I wanted to return the favor.

282
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,180
Sanada-san,

283
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,850
it's because you were the one who broke my curse.

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
"Curse"?

285
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,690
Yes.

286
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,970
The "Bias" curse.

287
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,320
I don't have any recollection of breaking such a curse.

288
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,130
Right.

289
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,380
That's just what I personally think.

290
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,120
We are terribly sorry.

291
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,910
P-Please raise your heads.

292
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,090
The one who missed the order... was me anyway.

293
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,860
Sorry.

294
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,510
Maruya-san.

295
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,340
There's somewhere I'd like to stop by.

296
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,420
Please excuse me from here on.

297
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,330
Thanks for the hard work.

298
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,300
Somewhere she'd like to stop by?

299
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,660
I guess she's going to Sudo-san.

300
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,730
- Okay?
- All right.

301
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,840
Ready, and...

302
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,330
Okay.

303
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,850
We did it, right?

304
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,840
Oh, thanks for the hard work!

305
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh, Maruya-kun. You've worked hard.

306
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,350
Both of you are still here?

307
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,960
Yes. You must be hungry, right?

308
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,500
I bought onigiri (rice ball) and pork miso soup. Let's eat together.

309
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,440
Kaburagi-san said your onigiri filling is just salmon and kelp.

310
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,060
- Those were the last ones.
- Don't tell him that!

311
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,920
Sorry!

312
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,090
Thank you very much.

313
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,620
I'll go heat up the soup. Okay?

314
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,170
Maruya-kun likes it piping hot.

315
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,200
Really?

316
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,780
I'll be right back!

317
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,120
Sanada-san?

318
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,150
Let's use these for the event tomorrow.

319
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,690
These are cosplay costumes of "One Blade."

320
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,670
"Cosplay"?

321
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,330
We're out of time for the collaboration cans,

322
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:39,400
but at least, for the customers who attend the event tomorrow,

323
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,300
I was thinking we could attend to them in "One Blade" costumes.

324
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,600
But... we're just mere employees of a beer company.

325
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,360
- As long as Maruya-san is here, it'll be fine.
- What?

326
00:16:49,391 --> 00:16:52,250
Your photo appeared in the online news about the product launch

327
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,250
and got netizens all excited.

- Excuse me?

329
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,100
It certainly might work if it's Maruya-san.

330

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,930
to see Maruya-kun cosplay as Shibamaru.

339
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,670
We advertised and planned to sell the collaboration cans between "Summer Romance" and "One Blade."

340
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,180
But due to glitches in preparation, the cans are unavailable today.

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,440
- A photo of Maruya-kun.
- What?

362
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,810
- Hey!
- Oh!

363
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,280
[Cute! I definitely approve this live-action adaptation.]

364
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,880
Does this mean the author himself approves of this?

365
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,000
The god approves of Maruya-kun?

366
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,040
This is great! Wow!

367
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,810
It's amazing!

368
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,510
Excuse me, Ichinose-san.

369
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,830
We need backup at the sampling session.

370
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,150
There's a sudden increase in customers.

371
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,350
Sanada-san, look at this!

372
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,870
[Cute! I definitely approve this live-action adaptation.]

373
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,000
Please take one.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,670
Here you go. Give it a try.

375
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,960
Yes, here you go.

376
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,380
It's really good. I'll have another.

377
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,910
Thank you very much!

378
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,120
Here you go.

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,310
Please have one.

380
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,260
- I'd like one.
- With pleasure.

381
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,670
Here.

382
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,030
- Maruya-san.
- Yes.

383
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,480
All that's left is cleaning up.

384
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
You can wrap up for today.

385
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,670
Okay. I'll be off then.

386
00:19:46,711 --> 00:19:49,440
- Thanks for the hard work.
- Good work.

387
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,770
I want the event to be a success, no matter what,

388
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,200
to achieve the top sales record.

389
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,580
I wanted to return the favor.

390
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,130
Maruya-san!

391
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,400
What is it?

392
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,170
I forgot to tell you something.

393
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,390
Okay.

394
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,190
Truly,

395
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,730
thank you very much.

396
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,800
What?

397
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:08,150
You tried hard to gather the collaboration cans yesterday.

398
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,250
If it were me,

399
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,570
I wouldn't have thought of gathering them.

400
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,400
If you hadn't been there,

401
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,990
the event wouldn't have ended this smoothly.

402
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,770
This may be an exaggeration,

403
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,690
but it's thanks to you, Maruya-san,

404
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,540
that we could change the future.

405
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,280
That's how I feel.

406
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,350
Please excuse me.

407
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,450
The future...

408
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,900
I'm not the one who can change your future.

409
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,940
You, yourself, must do it.

410
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,170
Sanada-san!

411
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,490
♫ Can you look only at me? ♫

412
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,680
Well...

413
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,090
Actually...

414
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,540
It was a lie.

415
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,650
"A lie"?

416
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,150
The truth is

417
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,370
I don't have any plans at all.

418
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,990
So...

419
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,380
♫ I gaze long and hard ♫

420
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,010
If you don't mind,

421
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,410
shall we have dinner together?

422
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,750
"Dinner"?

423
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,760
Yes.

424
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,620
With me?

425
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,420
You, Sanada-san,

426
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
and me.

427
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,490
♫ There's likely no end to it ♫

428
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,060
I've fallen...

429
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,340
♫ If I could be the one ♫

430
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,390
in love with you.

431
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,760
♫ At the ending credits, it won't be a sad song ♫

432
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,270
I...
♫ But a love song ♫

433
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,660
♫ That's just for you ♫

434
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,490
I like you, Sanada-san.

435
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,860
♫ That I can't tell you ♫

436
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh... but...

437
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,960
I know... I understand.

438
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,800
You already have...

439
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,710
♫ Today, I still can't say I love you. Tomorrow ♫

440
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:21,200
♫ I just want to ♫

441
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,200
♫ Be there for you ♫

442
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,250
What did that kiss mean?
[Preview: What's the meaning of that sudden kiss?]

443
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,580
I wanted you to understand me.

444
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,260
I have today's date all planned out.
[The Ultimate Dating Strategy!]

445
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,760
So there will be no more after this?

446
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,270
I take back my kiss from the other day.
[Their first date is the last...]

447
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,030
My "cuteness" is about to expire.

448
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,530
It just had to be on our last date.
