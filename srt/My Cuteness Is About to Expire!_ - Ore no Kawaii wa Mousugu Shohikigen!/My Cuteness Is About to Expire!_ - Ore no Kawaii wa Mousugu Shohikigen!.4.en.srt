00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,230
The readings are normal,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,400
and there are no heart palpitations.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,120
Can I check it again?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,480
Sure.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,150
Sensei...

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,590
You said you have no appetite

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,010
and your chest feels tight, right?

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,060
Yes.

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,540
I think...

10
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,600
You are probably...

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,150
Please tell me.

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,510
in love.

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm in love?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Your symptoms suggest you've fallen in love.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,990
Excuse me?

16
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,040
In this case,

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,450
why do my feet get bloated in the evening?

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,351
Since you're growing old.

19
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,930
Oh, I'm getting old.

20
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,040
Are these love symptoms?

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,740
The doctor said there is no medication for it.

22
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,420
Could this mean...

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,590
that I'm interested in Sanada-san?

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,400
No way!

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,760
Not that I'm bragging, but I've had experience with romance.

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,920
And although I was dumped, I still have feelings for Riko.

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,860
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- But you're so cute.

28

Please don't say that.

However,

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,690
I lost my appetite, sighed frequently,

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,080
and my chest felt like it was tightly gripped with a dull pain.

32
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,250
I have never had such symptoms before.

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,800
Could it be that

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,700
the past relationships I've had weren't love?

35
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,630
Good morning.

Good morning, Sanada-san.

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,070
Your tie is out of place.

Wait!

I can fix it myself.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,420
This chest tightening sensation...

41
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,950
Is this...

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,170
Is this real love?

Okay.

You seemed to be sighing the whole time too.

Really?

61
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,680
It is not uncommon for a patient

62
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,400
to have symptoms in the body that they're unaware of.

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,110
How about getting it examined at the company's clinic later?

64
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,880
It's not that big of a deal.

65

I went to the doctor already.

66
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,880
Then you should have some rest.

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,020

Excuse me.

Why are you speaking in dialect?

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,490
What nonsense are you saying?

115
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,250
What's the point of lying to yourself?

116
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,370
Bye then, I'm leaving.

117
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,210
Falling in love,

118
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,020
it's been a while since I've been in love.

119
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,800
Is that what I'll become in the future?

120
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,660
An old man who wasn't in love for a while?

121
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,470
Speaking of which,

122
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,270
I've seen it on TV before...

123
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,580
But then, at the end of the day,

124
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,730
if you want to fight aging, most effective is a relationship.

125
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,370
Ultimately, the secret to staying young

126
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,220
is to fall in love.

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,600
This is my opinion.

128
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,830
Assuming that consequences of not falling in love

129
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,730
are to become like that old man...

130
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,580
So if I get into a relationship,

131
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,690
can I change the future?

132
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,290
I didn't expect to meet my father.

133
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,980
I was surprised.

134
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,640
What about your health condition?

135
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm fine.

136
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,420
Thank you for being worried about me.

137
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,050
I see.

138
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,560
If I go into a relationship, my future will...

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,100
Sanada.

140
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,940
Thanks for your hard work.

141
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,260
Thank you.

142
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,520
From the product development department, who will attend the meeting later?

143
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,900
I will be attending.

144
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,670
I see.

145
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,490
- Are you Maruya-kun?
- Yes.

146
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,710
I heard you proposed the cashew nut croquette.

147
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,820
The concept is good, and the recipe is easy to understand.

148
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,080
Thank you very much.

149
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
The idea came from Sanada-san.

150
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,220
So you both worked on it together.

151
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,500
Let's definitely make it happen and produce good results.

152
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,710
Yes.

153
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,390
We want to launch a new campaign for

154
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,730
the Summer Romance beer before summer officially arrives.

155
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,090
This is the end of the PR department's presentation.

156
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,570
I'm Sudo from the product development department.

157
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,590
I'd like to thank everyone from Yuuhi TV.

158
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,560
The product development department will also assist in any way possible.

159
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,340
We look forward to working with all of you.

160
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,530
Without further ado,

161
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,710
- we have distributed the information...
- She watched him the whole time.

162
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,020
Don't be so stiff.

163
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,600
Is it what I'm thinking of?

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,850
Sanada-san's type is someone like Sudo-san.

165
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,360
And it will be introduced in the program.

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,610
During then...

167
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,380
Sudo-san is more of a mature, dependable type of man.

168
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,010
I, on the other hand,

169
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,110
am often seen as younger than my actual age.

170
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,890
I am the cute type.

171
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,300
Moreover, Sudo-san appears calm and collected.

172
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,500
I have a youthful image.

173
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,210
We are the exact opposite!

174
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,570
If Sanada-san's type is Sudo-san,

175
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,710
then my chances are...

176
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,960
Maruya-san?

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,910
- Maruya-san?
- What?

178
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
What?

179
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,190
The presentation about the recipe.

180
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,310
Oh!

181
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,140
Well...

182
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,900
This is not good.

183
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm not focused on my work.

184
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,910
I must pay attention.

185
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,780
And...

186
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,060
Sudo-san.

187
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,550
Can I have a moment, please?

188
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,480
Please excuse me for a moment.

189
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,400
Please pardon me for interrupting the presentation.

190
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,040
There is an issue I must handle;

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,190
therefore, I need to leave this meeting.

192
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,680
My subordinate, Narushima, will attend the meeting on my behalf.

193
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,390
Hello, I am Narushima.

194
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,990
Nice to meet all of you.

195
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,590
Looking forward to our new campaign

196
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,630
for the Summer Romance beer. Cheers!

197
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,430
Cheers!

198
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,190
I guess those working for beer companies really love to drink.

199
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,970
Good evening, thanks for all the hard work.

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,410
Kaburagi-san!

201
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,950
Good evening, thanks for the hard work.

202
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,490
What?

203
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,130
Where's Sanada-san?

204
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,400
She went back alone.

205
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,860
She's still the same.

206
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,250
Isn't she?

207
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,770
Why are you sighing?

208
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,970
Are you having trouble with your love relationship?

209
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,420
What?

210
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,340
One must fall in love, right?

211
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,930
Sorry to keep you waiting.

212
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,890
What's happening? Tell me.

213
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,530
Well, don't ask him any further.

214
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,020
- Let's drink.
- Can I ask you guys something?

215
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,300
Yes.

216
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,300
Assuming that two of you have a crush on the same one,

217
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,310
what would you do if her ideal type

218
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,400
is the complete opposite of you?

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,030
Maruya-kun.

220
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,790
Is there someone you like?

221
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,190
- Who is it?
- Maruya-kun, perhaps

222
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,720
are you a passive person in love?

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,750
What?

224
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,370
Popular people tend to be more passive than you'd think,

225
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,060
since women come to them proactively.

226
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,870
No, I'm not.

227
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,610
Yes, I am the passive type.

228
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,670
I'm extremely passive.

229
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,740
I never confessed my feelings to a woman, especially since adolescence.

230
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,650
You can't stay this way.

231
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,990
You should take the initiative to approach the one you like.

232
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,110
You have to make the effort to get her to like you.

233
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,130
"Take the initiative and make the effort"?

234
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,190
Otherwise, decades from now, you might regret it.

235
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,640
Falling in love,

236
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
it's been a while since I've been in love.

237
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,030
Your cute life is as far as this goes.

238
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,560
This cuteness is about to end soon.

239
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,110
Did the future me want to fix all that regret?

240
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,700
So he came to see me?

241
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,420
Why are you acting so smug, Ichinose-kun?

242
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,490
Oh, yes, toward Maruya-san.

243
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,770
I'm very sorry.

244
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,590
What?

245
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,910
We're making a move first.

246
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,780
Thank you for today.

247
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,360
Maruya-kun.

248
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,170
Please tell me.

249
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,820
No way.

250
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,700
Look at you.

251
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,560
You have to hold yourself back.

252
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,350
- Do you know something about it?
- No.

253
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,420
I don't know.

254
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,920
Hi, thank you for the hard work.

255
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,840
I'm Maruya from the sales department.

256
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm Narushima from product development.

257
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
- May I?
- Of course.

258
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,780
Since you're from the product development department,

259
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,240
you must have worked with Sanada-san who is in our department now.

260
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, Sanada-san.

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,380
By the way,

262
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,210
how was she like in product development?

263
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,091
What do you mean?

264
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:25,980
Since we are working together, I was hoping to get to know her better.

265
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,240
Did the information get leaked?

266
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,390
An information leak?

267
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,100
Oh, gosh.

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,270
Did Sanada-san do that?

269
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,140
I don't know anything about it.

270
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,990
Ichinose-kun.

271
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,160
Sorry, I'm counting on you.

272
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,930
Goodbye.

273
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,881
Wait, don't go.

274
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,240
Ichinose.

275
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,151
Can you hail a cab?

276
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,260
Got it. I'll pass him to you.

277
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,820
Okay.

278
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,420
Hey, Maruya-kun.

279
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,430
Tell me the person you like.

280
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,301
Tell me!

281
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,270
You're too drunk. Let's all go home.

282
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,320
Is the gathering party over already?

283
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,480
Sudo-san!

284
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,710
Shall we go for a drink?

285
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,320
Kaburagi, what are you doing?

286
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,380
Hi, thank you for your hard work today.

287
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,720
That's too bad.

288
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,550
I guess it can't be helped.

289
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,740
Thank you for the hard work today.

290
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,710
No, that's not it.

291
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,090
Sudo-san.

292
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,310
Yes?

293
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,350
What do you want to discuss?

294
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,700
Well...

295
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,610
How's it going with being Sanada's mentor?

296
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm not sure if I'm mentoring her.

297
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,280
When she entered the product development department,

298
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,290
she had a mentor too.

299
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,810
He's quite good at his job.

300
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,810
Nice to meet you. I look forward to working with you.

301
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,470
And she got into some trouble with that guy.

302
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,120
They didn't get along well due to their personalities?

303
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,390
Sanada had seen that mentor being approached

304
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,640
by a competing beer company about a job offer.

305
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,500
I can't believe you rated me this highly.

306
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,000
I look forward to working with you.

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,120
Thank you very much.

308
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,550
I guess she could have just pretended she didn't see it,

309
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,500
but all research in our department would have been for naught.

310
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,140
Are you going to work for Teio Beer?

311
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,790
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,560
I saw you talking with someone from Teio Beer the other day.

313
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,080
Oh, you've misunderstood.

314
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,220
We were just having a casual talk.

315
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,840
If so, what will you do?

316
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,090
Will you report to the company management?

317
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
Do you have any proof?

318
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,790
- That's...
- Are you serious?

319
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,700
What happened?

320
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,990
What happened?

321
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,720
Well...

322
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Sanada-san was making weird accusations.

323
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,750
Then about leaking information...

324
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,570
In the end, for some reason, it sounded like Sanada-san leaked information.

325
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,620
When I asked her what was going on, she insisted it was nothing.

326
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,500
She was singled out by others in the product development department.

327
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,050
Sanada

328
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,530
submitted a resignation letter.

329
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,000
I talked to Director Yamamuro about it,

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,360
and she said she'd like to have Sanada in her team.

331
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,340
I see.

332
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,940
I don't know you well yet, Maruya-kun.

333
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,720
However, as her former boss,

334
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,370
I can see Sanada trusts you.

335
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,320
Maruya-kun.

336
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,830
What?

337
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,190
Please take care of Sanada for me.

338
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,870
Yes, I will.

339
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,430
Are you still working on the proposal?

340
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,870
Director.

341
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,800
Is it something urgent?

342
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,790
It's not.

343
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,110
But if I don't do any work,

344
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,830
I'll think about unnecessary things.

345
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,070
If you hide behind work,

346
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,730
when you really get stuck at work,

347
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,060
you will have no real place to escape to.

348
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,080
You must learn to take a break.

349
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,410
Hey, how about going bouldering (rock climbing) with me sometime?

350
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,160
"Bouldering"?

351
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,350
I haven't tried it before, either.

352
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,260
Good morning.

353
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,580
You're kidding me.

354
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,280
That's just a rumor.

355
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,550
What if it's true?

356
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,830
What happened?

357
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,520
I don't know.

358
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,760
There is a rumor that Sanada-san has leaked information

359
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,570
on our development data to Teio Beer.

360
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,680
- What?
- Shut up!

361
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,640
It shouldn't be her.

362
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,650
I don't believe it, but...

363
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,250
Who spread this rumor?

364
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,490
I don't know.

365
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,750
But I don't believe this rumor.

366
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,600
The rumor says this is why she was transferred

367
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,100
from product development to sales.

[Yayoi: Barista's Blend

370
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,530
Oh.

371
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,370
It's been a while.

372
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,650
Yes.

373
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,700
So you are also involved in this project.

374
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,510
It is tough working together, right?

375
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,810
I'll tell my boss to remove me from this project.

376
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,090
Why?

377
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,500
Don't you think you're being pretentious?

378
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,060
That kind of thing, on the contrary, pisses me off.

379
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,880
- I'm sorry.
- Like I said!

380
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,180
If you apologize...

381
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,530
This is annoying.

382
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,470
Right now, I'm the only one who knows the truth

383
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,350
besides the two of them.

384
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,740
Only I can help her out of this situation.

385
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,840
Hey, Narushima-san.

386
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,990
Yes?

387
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,740
Can I have a moment with you?

388
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,950
What's the matter?

389
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,380
Only I...

390
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,200
Maruya-san...

There's only me.

392
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,790
Well...

393
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,080
What is it?

394
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,820
If you don't mind...

395
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,580
Take this.

396
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,130
Why did I give him a can of café au lait?

397
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,890
What should I do?

398
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,770
What should I do?

399
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,150
I have some preparation work to do.

400
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,970
I will head to the meeting room first.

401
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,670
Has the meeting started yet?

402
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,130
Am I in time for it?

403
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,190
What happened?

404
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,440
Did Sanada leak some information again?

405
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,770
What? Are you saying it?

406
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,670
So that rumor...

407
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,160
It seems everyone heard it.

408
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,490
Sanada, it's all right for me to say it, right?

409
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,620
She was in the product development department

410
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,840
before she was assigned to sales.

411
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,560
At that time, there was a leak of information.

412
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,460
She told everyone about

413
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,720
my liver function test result.

414
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,800
What?

415
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,370
Well, I went way over the standard values in my physical exam.

416
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,700
They said I drank too much beer.

417
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,510
Is that what you mean by information leakage?

418
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,860
Yes, that's right.

419
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,960
I thought that was what you meant!

420
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,450
Sanada, whose health checkup figures did you leak this time?

421
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,770
After this, we're all going to taste the croquettes, right?

422
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,391
Yes!

423
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:05,510
I'll forget the health checkup figures today.

424
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,880
It's time for the meeting. Let's go.

425
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,460
- Yes.
- Narushima, let's go.

426
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes.

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,390
Thank you for your hard work.

In the end,

429
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,530
I couldn't do anything for her.
