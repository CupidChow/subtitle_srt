(You're Married?)

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,670
Major General,

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,840
I'll send for the medicine.

14
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,000
What happened to your body?

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,480
It's none of your business.

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,870
What do you mean?

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm your...

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,760
You're my what?

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
What happened to your body?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,680
Don't touch me.

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,070
Didn't you want to see?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,710
Satisfied?

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
What happened?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
What happened?

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,590
When you

26
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,280
chased me out like a stray dog years ago,

27
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,829
you never expected me
to come back alive, did you?

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,640
Who I am today

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
is all thanks to you.

30
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,510
I...

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,400
Lin Wenyu,

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
put that expression away.

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,680
Since I came back alive,

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,360
then I will make you pay for everything

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,470
you've done.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,430
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,240
Everything that I suffered

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
was thanks to you.

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,800
What good does an apology do?

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,960
What can I do to make it up to you?

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,680
Make it up to me?

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,430
You finally admit it.

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,710
Your life isn't enough to pay

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,560
for what you owe my family.

45
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,190
But

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
you can be like a dog

47
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,520
I can trample on.

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,750
Come here.

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Wipe my body.

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,430
Come here.

51
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,910
On your knees.

52
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,710
This is impossible.

53
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,680
You're lying.

54
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,710
Say that again.

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,120
My father and I did it.

56
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,430
Do you understand?

57
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,470
Get out.

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
Keep going.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Enough.

60
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,600
Look at you now.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160
From today onward,

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,360
you will stay by my side like a doll.

63
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,190
I will make your life a living hell

64
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,630
to pay for what you did
to my entire family.

65
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,120
Tomorrow, you will attend
Song Zhenyuan's welcoming banquet with me.

66
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,310
Xunchu,

67
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,830
I heard you vomited blood.

68
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,630
How are you feeling?

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,310
You two...

70
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,270
What are you two doing?

71
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,190
Put it on.

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
Xunchu.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,680
She is just a servant.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,950
How are you feeling? Is it serious?

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
I'm fine.

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,720
What are you still doing there?

77
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,160
Get out now.

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,600
Xunchu,

79
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,430
shall we watch a movie

80
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,160
after the welcoming banquet tomorrow?

81
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,430
Major General,

82
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,600
the servants prepared the medicine.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,040
Drink it while it's hot.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,430
Major General,

85
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,070
are you really attending

86
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,920
Song Zhenyuan's banquet tomorrow?

87
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,070
I'm afraid

88
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,040
it's a trap.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,830
Of course I'll go.

90
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,190
Tomorrow,
all citizens of Feng City will know

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,720
that I've come back safe and sound

92
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,750
to avenge the murder of my family.

93
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
I want to know

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,070
if those people behind the scenes
can remain calm.

95
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,272
Someone is outside.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,040
(They have eyes on me
as soon as I got back.)

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,380
(Yaren Medical Hall)

98
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,420
(Save The World)

99
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,160
You took your time.

100
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,070
Did you want me to pick you up upstairs?

101
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,720
I don't need to teach you

102
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,870
what to say there, do I?

103
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,870
I know.

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,240
General Song,

105
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,870
you've worked hard to defend Feng City.

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me offer you a toast.

107
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,270
You're too polite.

108
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,560
Mr. Chu, I am still counting on you

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
and all the businessmen here.

110
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,630
Everyone,

111
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
I wish you a pleasant evening.

112
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,750
Thank you for coming

113
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,480
and making this place merrier.

114
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,190
Here is a toast to all of you.

115
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,070
Have a wonderful evening, everyone.

116
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,240
Do you know what you are here as?

117
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,270
I know.

118
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,360
Which family is he from?

119
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,390
I haven't seen him around.

120
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,270
You don't know?

121
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,440
He is the star
of tonight's welcoming banquet,

122
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,360
the Iron Blood Major General,
Duan Xunchu.

123
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,270
The woman beside him is...

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
Xunchu,

125
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,870
look at how much you've grown
over the years.

126
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,870
I almost couldn't recognize you.

127
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,840
Uncle Song,

128
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,000
how have you been?

129
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,120
If you hadn't taken over command
of my father's army,

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,870
I'm afraid this army
would have been dismissed.

131
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,630
This is all Commander Duan's efforts.

132
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,790
When you went missing,

133
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,150
I had Yang took charge temporarily.

134
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,720
Now, you're finally back.

135
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
Xunchu is back.

136
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,790
Huaining.

137
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,360
Huaining.

138
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,150
Father.

139
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,320
As fate would have it,

140
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,550
I have no heirs

141
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
and happened to meet

142
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,550
the orphaned Huaining a few years ago.

143
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,600
He is smart and quick-witted,

144
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,480
so I took him into the Song family.

145
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
Uncle Song,

146
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,480
if you hadn't adopted Huaining,

147
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,360
I wouldn't have

148
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,960
a brother who would fight with me

149
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,000
in the battlefield
and score great achievement.

150
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,550
Xunchu.

151
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,480
Xunchu,

152
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,790
are you feeling better?

153
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm fine.

154
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,030
Why is she here?

155
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,750
Isn't she a servant?

156
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,870
I happened to need a partner.

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm late.

158
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,870
Everyone,

159
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,030
no offense.

160
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:20,840
Yang.

161
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,320
You're such a busy man.

162
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,670
You kept us waiting.

163
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,750
Isn't this my eldest nephew
who had gone missing for years?

164
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,390
After all these years,

165
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,240
I thought you were long dead.

166
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm afraid I've disappointed you,
Uncle Yang.

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,150
Yang.

168
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,840
He was joking with you.

169
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
Xunchu,

170
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,840
I heard word you stirred trouble

171
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,080
on my street as soon as you came back.

172
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Uncle Yang,

173
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,550
I remember

174
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,390
that street is under
the Duan family's jurisdiction.

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
You've been managing it
for the Duan family over the years,

176
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,550
it must have been tough on you.

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,120
Huaining, Huaining.

178
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,360
Huaining.

179
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,750
It's another attack. I thought he's cured.

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,960
Get the physician.

181
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,550
I'm the physician.

182
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,390
Mr. Song, is something wrong in your head?

183
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,750
I...

184
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,030
It's just a chronic illness
from years ago.

185
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,510
I haven't had an attack in a long time.
I don't know why it's happening today.

186
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,510
Huaining.

187
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,960
Take him to the side and let him rest.

188
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
Come, over here.

189
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm...

190
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm fine now.

191
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,630
Do you feel better?

192
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,360
Thank you.

193
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,870
I've spoiled your night, everyone.

194
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,750
Father,

195
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,320
excuse me.

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,600
Go and rest.

197
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,600
I was wondering why you look familiar.

198
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,080
Aren't you Miss Lin
from Yaren Medical Hall?

199
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,480
Advisor Yang.

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,150
Miss Lin, you're truly an iron lady.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
As a wedded woman, you don't stay home
to care for your husband and children,

202
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,600
but prance around
in the business world instead.

203
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't you even need hide

204
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,360
that you're here with another man?

205
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,030
You're married?

206
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,240
Yes.

207
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,030
I'm married.
