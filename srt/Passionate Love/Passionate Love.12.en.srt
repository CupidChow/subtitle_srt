(Can't You Stay Away From Other Men?)

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,790
Adjutant Sun,

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,960
what are you doing here?

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,350
Young Master Huaining, the poison
in the Major General flared up again.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,880
He asked me to get Miss Lin.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,840
Miss Lin,

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,200
please come with me.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,750
The poison flared up again?

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,240
Yes.

20
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,110
Huaining, I'm going now.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,110
Alright.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,400
Young Master.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,510
Go spy on them.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,120
Yes.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,710
Adjutant Sun,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,200
why did you take me here?

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,150
Where is Xunchu?

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Xunchu?

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,920
Get in the car.

30
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,840
Duan Xunchu, let me go.

31
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,150
You're hurting me.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Don't you know

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,430
how much you disgust me
every time you do this?

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm telling you.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Other than Song Huaining,

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm having affairs with many other men

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,200
that you don't know.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,710
Lin Wenyu,

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
why do you turn a deaf ear
to everything I said?

40
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,150
Why won't you listen?

41
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,510
Even if I marry another man,

42
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,200
it has nothing to do with you.

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Then, I'll kill that man first

44
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,760
and then you.

45
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,790
Let me go.

46
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,230
Lin Wenyu,

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
can't you stay away from other men?

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,790
Don't you realize

49
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,230
that you're as fickle as a chameleon?

50
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,560
There was never a moment

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,910
when you truly trusted me.

52
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,960
Let me go.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Let me...

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Are you crazy, Duan Xunchu?

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,960
Have you forgotten our relationship?

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
I'm your sister-in-law.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
What are you doing, Duan Xunchu?

58
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,150
Just what are you doing?

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,030
You will kneel

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,470
in front of my family's memorial tablets

61
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,840
and repent.

62
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
Duan Xunchu.

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,470
Major General.

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
You will kneel here

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,870
and repent.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,080
Major General,

67
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,630
I just received an update

68
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,960
that Adjutant Su's travel records

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,870
have been found.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,360
He was indeed away
to purchase military supplies that year.

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,596
He was cleared of any suspicion.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,680
I know.

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
Miss Lin, she...

74
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,150
Go now.

75
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,470
Yes, sir.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,870
They found the travel records.

77
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Your father

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
was innocent.

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,600
You heard it, right?

80
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
You heard it, right?

81
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,630
My father was innocent.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My father was innocent.

83
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,000
Father.

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,070
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,120
What are you doing?

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,160
Don't move.

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,630
Let me go.

88
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,000
Your wound reopened.

89
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,870
I'll change your dressing.

90
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,830
Put me down, Duan Xunchu.

91
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,560
Allow me.

92
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,270
Go out, I'll do it myself.

93
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,600
I'll apply medicine on you first, alright?

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,630
Bitao can apply for me.

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,390
I'll go out after I'm done,

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,870
alright?

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,040
Tell me if it hurts.

98
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,870
I'm fine.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,190
Whenever I got hurt as a kid,

100
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,785
this was how my mother
applied medicine on me.

101
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,480
She said if it hurts,

102
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,120
then just blow on it.

the poison flared up again.

117
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,800

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,360
Young Master,

121
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,390
I found it.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,390
How did it go?

123
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,430
I found out

124
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,190
that Lin Wenyu and Duan Xunchu

125
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,560
are siblings-in law.

126
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:32,920
What?

127
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,360
What did you say?

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,909
(Su Wenyue; Female)
Duan Xunchu and Lin Wenyu

129
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,310
are siblings-in-law.

130
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,480
She is Su Mu's daughter

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,480
and Duan Xunrui's fiancée.

132
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,000
She isn't Lin Wenyu

133
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,560
but Su Wenyue.

134
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,920
In that case,

135
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,510
it is possible that she was willing

136
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,905
to become my family doctor
to get close to me.

137
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,720
What else do you think?

138
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,630
I'm sorry, Father.

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,920
I never thought

140
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
she had been using me.

141
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,160
It's fine.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,310
They already had plans.

143
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,480
If it isn't Lin Wenyu,

144
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,510
it would be someone else.

145
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,000
This family killed your family

146
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
and now we're their targets.

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
Now that they've gotten suspicious,

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,630
it won't be easy to use them

149
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,030
to find the vault.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Huaining,

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,630
this jade pendant is an inheritance
passed down in the Duan family.

152
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,670
Duan Xunchu saw his brother got killed

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,670
but his body was never found.

154
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
Take this.

155
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,520
Impersonate as Duan Xunrui
and go back to the Duan mansion.

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,550
This is the only way
to dispel the suspicion they have on me.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Only then can we find
the vault's location.

158
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,630
Father, does Duan Xunchu have one too?

159
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,150
Yes.

160
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,150
The brothers have one each.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,080
Exactly the same.

162
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:03,670
Father,

163
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
will they believe this?

164
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,320
They were young then,

165
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,870
and it's been so long.

166
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,960
Don't worry.

167
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
As long as you have this jade pendant,

168
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,150
he will trust you.

169
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,030
Father,

170
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,150
why does this jade pendant
look familiar to me?

171
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,150
It's just a jade pendant.

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,440
They all look similar.

173
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,030
What's wrong?

174
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,200
Does your head hurt?

175
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,750
