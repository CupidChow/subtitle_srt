(I Will Pull You Into The Abyss With Me)

12
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,280
You're really anxious.

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,790
What did I do now?

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,920
Are you that eager

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
to become Song Huaining's family doctor?

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,120
I told you

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
I only get close

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,070
to the Song family to investigate.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,200
Investigate?

20
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,265
How do you investigate?

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:24,840
Like this?

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,680
Or like this?

23
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,070
What do you want to do again?

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,710
What's this?

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
You're unwilling if it's me?

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,000
You didn't check on the medicine, did you?

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,430
You came investigate, didn't you?

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,790
If you have begun
to suspect the Song family,

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,150
that clearly means

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,950
you already think my father is innocent.

31
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,120
I did search for clues.

32
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,760
What did you find?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
None.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,590
Your father remains the biggest suspect.

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,480
I am Song Huaining's family doctor now.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,350
I have more chances
to investigate up-close.

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Your status restricts you, so I'll go.

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,710
This is the Duan family's old mansion.

39
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,225
The renovation has just completed.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,430
Wenyue, take Xunchu and run.

41
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,150
Xunrui.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,710
I'll distract them, run.

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,310
Blow up the house.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,150
Leave none alive.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,590
Xunrui.

47
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,470
Come back.

Come on.

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,190
Did you make breakfast?

53
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,870
Yes, I did.

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,310
Just eat, I didn't poison them.

55
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,030

Try it.

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,430
Is it yummy?

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,000
(Very yummy.)

63
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,070
You had better focus your attention

64
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,240
onto your father's case.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm only doing this

66
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,120

67
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,680

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:30,830

you're back.

84
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,800
How did it go?

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,270
Did Duan Xunchu give you a hard time?

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm fine. Get back to work.

87
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,510
Everyone say Yaren Medical Hall

88
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,510
is the best apothecary in Feng City.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,830
I'd like to see

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
how effective are the medicine here.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
Miss Song, what a surprise.

92
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,360
Do you feel unwell?

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm here to pick up medicine.

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,270
I wonder

95
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,870
if this Yaren Medical Hall
that wants to "save the world"

96
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,950
can cure my brother's illness.

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Please have a seat, Miss Song.

98
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,040
Bitao.

99
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,160
Bring Mr. Song's medicine here.

100
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,870
Right away.

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Here, Miss Song.

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
What kind of medicine is this?

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
To nurse Mr. Song's body,

104
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,480
we prepared a prescription
with Chinese medicine.

105
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,190
Chinese medicine?

106
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,070
Yaren Medical Hall is famous
for your western medicine.

107
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,680
Why did you prescribe Chinese medicine
for my young master?

108
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,560
Miss Song,

109
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,687
you aren't here to get treatment, are you?

110
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,190
What are you doing here?

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,920
I now suspect

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,270
something is fishy with your medicine.

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,040
Wanzhen.

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920
You...

115
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,390
What are you doing?

116
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,630
Miss Song came
to pick up medicine for you.

117
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
Why did you scold her?

118
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,720
Two western pills could have cured you

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,430
but she gave you Chinese medicine.

120
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
She doesn't want to cure you.

121
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,480
What do you think she is up to?

122
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,360
Wanzhen,

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,310
don't slander Miss Lin's innocence.

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
Please apologize to her now.

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,040
You...

126
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,190
Are you two

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,270
already together?

128
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,870
Wanzhen.

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,270
Do not be rude.

130
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,510
Song Huaining.

131
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,160
You're just a lowly kid

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
my father adopted from the streets.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,430
What's this?

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,750
Did you really think
I see you as my brother?

135
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,120
What's this?

136
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,830
Do you

137
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,630
want to hit me?

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,000
Aren't you afraid I'd tell Daddy?

139
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,750
Wanzhen,

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,390
stop making trouble.

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,120
Shut up.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You had better

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,830
get out my home as soon as possible.

144
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,390
Enough.

145
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,750
Song Wanzhen,

146
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,510
you're not welcomed here.

147
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,160
Ding Mian, Bitao.

148
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,430
See them out.

149
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
This way.

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Go away.

151
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,190
Miss Lin, you're here.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,950
Miss Lin, you're here.

153
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,160
Two bowls of wontons.

154
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Sure.

155
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,310
Yes.

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,190
Don't forget the chili oil.

157
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,800
Of course.

158
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,190
Mr. Song,

159
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,190
has your relationship with her
always been like this?

160
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,545
She has always been willful.

161
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,390
She never really liked me.

162
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,750
I cannot act

163
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,560
as I wish in the Song family like she can.

164
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,800
My father said my family
were killed by bad people.

165
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Although I was lucky
to have escaped the explosion,

166
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,120
I've forgotten some events.

167
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,510
This side effect was also from that time.

168
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,870
I'd often get headaches.

169
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,670
Miss Lin,

170
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,560
here are your wontons.

171
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,270
Thank you.

172
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,870
Madam, give me a bowl of wontons.

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,630
Sure.

174
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,200
Mr. Song?

175
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,910
What's wrong?

176
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm fine.

177
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,360
Try these.

178
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,320
I've had these wontons for years.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,480
Right,

180
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
may I call you Wenyu?

181
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,080
Of course.

182
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,120
Let's eat.

183
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,630
Yes.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,630
Miss Wenyu,
your medical skill is admirable.

185
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,480
I was really helpless before this.

186
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,400
This is delicious.

187
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
If you like, we can come here often.

188
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,360
Sure.

189
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,440
You really don't understand

190
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,670
what it means to know your place.

191
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,030
Xunchu, what are you doing?

192
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
I'm warning you.

193
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,720
Stay away from this woman.

194
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,870
She is bad news.

195
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,790
Dun Xunchu, are you crazy?

196
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Let me go.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
Let go.

198
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,510
Let go.

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,150
Didn't I warn you

200
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,390
to stay away from Song Huaining?

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,630
Who are you to limit my freedom?

202
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,630
Freedom?

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,870
You're mine, dead or alive.

204
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,840
You owe me this.

205
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,510
You're hurting me. What are you doing?

206
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,440
You really like

207
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,790
to have affairs with other men.

208
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,550
What do you see in Song Huaining?

209
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,270
Shut up.

210
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,200
I can give you what he can.

211
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,390
Or does any man will do?

212
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,670
Duan Xunchu, you're crazy.

213
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,750
Look at you now.

214
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,360
Ruthless, bloodthirsty.

215
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,390
That's right.

216
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,080
If I am full of sins,

217
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,030
I will drag you down with me.

218
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,790
I won't let you go

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,720
and you will never get away from me.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,120
You feel like another person
that you scare me.

221
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,840
Are you still the Duan Xunchu I knew?

222
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,150
The Duan Xunchu you knew

223
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,510
died on the afternoon you cut me off.

224
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,960
I came to your family

225
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
for the wealth and fame

226
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
but look at the life

227
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,790
I lead right now.

228
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,840
I barely get to eat and live in hiding.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,750
I even had to change my name
because of you.

230
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,960
I've had enough.

231
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,000
Can you just go?

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,870
Please.

233
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,240
If you dare flirt with another man

234
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,550
without my permission,
you'll get what's coming.
