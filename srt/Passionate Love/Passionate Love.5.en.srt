You're married?

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,070
Yes.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,790
I'm married.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,070
What's wrong, Xunchu?

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,280
Don't you know details

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,960
about your own partner?

18
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,430
I'll go change into a clean dress.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Excuse me.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,480
Excuse me as well.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,150
Married?

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,480
It has only been a few years
and you found someone new.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,920
Didn't you say you're my sister-in-law?

24
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,310
Who allowed you to remarry?

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,840
So what if I remarry?

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,040
Do you have a say in that?

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,680
I hate that you're a disgraceful,

28
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,480
brazen, and depraved woman.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,510
I thought you don't see me
as your sister-in-law.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,710
Why am I an embarrassment

31
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,920
to the Duan family now?

32
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,760
Please behave yourself, Major General.

33
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,120
You are truly a selfish and cheap woman.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,070
You don't deserve a shred of sympathy.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,876
It must have been tough
acting for those few years.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,310
Will you be really happy doing this?

37
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,000
The more pain you feel,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,240
the better I feel.

39
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,000
Major General,

40
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,080
you were in there too long with her.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,870
A reminder, sir.

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,710
Don't forget our goals this time.

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
Mind your own business.

44
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,030
I know what I'm doing.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,520
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,080
Who is there?

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,560
Where is my gun?

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,750
Kneel.

49
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,360
Who are you?

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,080
Duan Xunchu.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
You brat, are you revolting?

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,080
I'll ask.

53
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,280
You'll answer.

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,310
Ten years ago, were you involved

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,360
in the incident with my family?

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,080
Absurd!

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,960
Are you crazy?

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,120
How dare you slander me?

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,840
I'll give you one last chance
to tell the truth.

60
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,310
My men will be here soon.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,030
Go to hell.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,150
Major General.

63
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,030
Major General, spare us.

64
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,710
It was him.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,280
It was Advisor Yang's idea.
He told us to kill the Duan family.

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,910
Shut up.

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,360
How dare you slander me?

68
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,080
Talk.

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,910
Who ordered you?

70
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,520
Was it Su Mu?

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,360
Su Mu?

72
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,280
Brat,

73
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,750
kill me if you dare.

74
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,040
Don't shoot.

75
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,310
- I'll talk.
- Talk.

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,310
I'll talk.

Protect the Major General.

79
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,800
Stop. Don't run.

80
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,830
Major General, the assassin got away.

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,390
They silenced him.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
They got anxious over a mere Advisor Yang.

(Yang Biao Assassinated At Night)

84
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,160
Did you kill Advisor Yang?

85
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Is there a problem?

86
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,360
After the incident with the Duan family,

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
Song Zhenyuan recruited
Commander Duan's army

88
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,430
and handed them to Advisor Yang.

89
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,720
What do you want to say?

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,830
Don't you think this is strange?

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,270
Keep going.

92
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,360
Maybe he has some other plans.

93
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,000
I have plans

94
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,870
for Song Zhenyuan.

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
Mind your own business.

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
What you should be doing

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,070
is to beg for forgiveness for yourself
and on your father's behalf.

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,040
I will find the evidence
to prove my innocence.

Advisor Yang was assassinated last night.

101
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,120
Who did it?

102
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,430
Could it be Duan Xunchu?

103

104
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,390

have nothing to do with him?

107
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,236
He has begun investigating
that incident from that year.

there is a female physician outside.

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,240
Female physician?

116
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,950
Yes.

117
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,160
Let her in.

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Yes.

119
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,040
This way.

120

122
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,070
what brings you here?

123
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,098
I forgot to write you
a prescription yesterday.

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
I'm worried your headache might recur,

125
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
so I brought you the prescription today.

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,830
You're too kind, Miss Lin.

127
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
I've made you come a long way.

128
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,630
Go.

129
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,950
Make the medicine according to

130
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,750
her prescription.

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,360

Does your head hurt again?

134
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,630
What timing.

135
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,870
I'll massage it for you.

136
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,830
Thank you, Miss Lin.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
Mr. Song,

138
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
do you chronically

139
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,430
have headaches?

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,190
I suffered a serious injury to my brain.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,560
I barely made it back alive

142
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,510
but I'm left with this.

143
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,716
I get headaches
when the weather gets cold.

144
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,600
It hasn't happened in years.

145
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,510
I don't know why it's happening recently.

146
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,720
I heard that you are
General Song's adopted son.

147
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,190
Did he save you?

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,830
He is a good man.

149
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
Not only did he save me,

150
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,630
he even adopted me

151
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,680
and sent me to the military academy.

152
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,560
Miss Lin,

153
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,720
something has been bothering me.

154
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,830
At the Major General's mansion,

155
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,160
you and Xunchu looked like enemies

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,390
but you went to the banquet

157
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,750
as his partner last night.

158
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,630
What is going on between you two?

159
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Why are you coughing so badly?

160
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,190
Is it serious?

161
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,160
What are you two doing?

162
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,430
Xunchu, why are you here?

163
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,270
Don't you have a headache?

164
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,510
I'm here to visit you.

165
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,190
But you.

166
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,040
What are you doing here?

167
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
Unhand me, Major General Duan.

168
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,510
I'm here to treat Mr. Song.

169
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Treat him?

170
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,040
Xunchu,

171
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,150
she sent me a prescription
out of kindness.

172
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,960
If you two have any misunderstandings,

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,870
just talk it out.

174
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't hurt her.

175
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Mr. Song,

176
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,510
I'll go check on your medicine
in the kitchen.

177
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Thank you, Miss Lin.

178
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,600
You were attentive towards Song Huaining.

179
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Are you interested in him

180
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,630
and trying to throw yourself at him?

181
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,910
Miss Lin.

182
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,960
I...

183
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,000
If you don't want others
to misunderstand you

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,120
for having an affair here,

185
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,390
then keep that mouth shut.

186
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,960
Miss Lin.

187
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,120
Miss Lin.

188
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,720
Miss...

189
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,480
Miss Lin.

190
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Why is the door locked?

191
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Miss Lin.

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Please behave yourself.

193
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,870
Didn't you like to be involved with men?

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,720
What's this?

195
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
Can't I be your man?

196
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
Tell me.

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,910
Which blind fool did you marry?

198
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,840
My husband is Duan Xunrui.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Are you satisfied?

200
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,360
I came here to find the truth.

201
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,440
Find the truth?

202
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,030
Do you have to be touchy-feely
with Song Huaining to find the truth?

203
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
What touchy-feely?

204
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm a physician.

205
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
I was massaging his head.

206
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,270
What about your own actions?

207
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,600
I'm warning you.

208
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,030
You had better behave

209
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,270
and know your place.

210
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,870
Don't come near the Song family.

211
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,030
How do I get you evidence

212
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,510
if I don't get close to the Song family?

213
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,240
Get evidence?

214
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,670
You even learn how to fake a faint

215
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,360
and throw yourself into my arms.

216
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,360
Lin Wenyu?

217
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,200
(She has a high fever.)

218
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,120
Miss, your necklace is beautiful.

219
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,790
Is it new?

220
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,600
Pretty, right?

221
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
Daddy bought it for me from overseas.

222
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,840
Doesn't it match my outfit?

223
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,630
I'll ask Daddy to buy you one next time.

224
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,840
Miss...

225
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,240
Why is that woman in his arms?

226
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,150
That's right.

227
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,670
You are awake.

228
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,270
Did you change my clothes?

229
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,600
What do you think?

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
You're so dirty.

231
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,670
You don't deserve that service from me.

232
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,910
Why did you dodge?

233
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,320
I won't eat you.

234
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,390
You're a doctor.

235
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,670
Don't you know you're having a fever?

236
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,000
Headaches and fevers

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
have never been a big deal to me.

238
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,910
Isn't your own body a big deal?

239
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,240
I've survived the days where I could die

240
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
at any time,

241
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,200
what else is a big deal?

242
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,552
It must have been tough
acting for those few years.

243
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,200
If you knew you'd end up here today,

244
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,440
will you regret it?

245
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,200
(So what if you regret it?)

246
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,790
(My entire family was murdered.)

247
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,030
(I will never let this go.)

248
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
(How can I ever forgive you?)

249
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,750
I will never forgive you.

250
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Someday,

251
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,320
I will make you pay for this.

252
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,630
(I'm sorry, Xunchu.)

253
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,910
(I'm sorry.)

254
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,870
(No matter how deeply you hate me,)

255
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,000
(I will protect you for the Duan family)

256
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,510
(and keep you alive.)

257
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,510
Miss Lin, you are awake.

258
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,752
Where is the Major General?

259
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,000
The Major General
locked himself in the room

260
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,150
and drank all night.

261
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,630
Where is Xunchu?

262
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,480
Go and tell him

263
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
that I've come to visit.

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,750
Please wait, Miss Song.

265
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,150
The Major General is working in his room.

266
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,910
He said he will not see any guests today.

267
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,910
I wanted to go horse-riding with him.

268
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,120
Miss Lin?

269
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,440
What are you doing here?

270
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,200
Wait a minute.

271
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,360
You're wearing Xunchu's clothes,
aren't you?

272
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,120
If I remember correctly,

273
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,960
you are married, right?

274
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
What are you doing

275
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
in a man's house
so early in the morning?

276
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,790
Pingchun,

277
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,790
take Xunchu's clothes off her.

278
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,360
Miss Song,

279
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,870
wherever I go

280
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,360
is none of your business.

281
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,200
And,

282
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,600
aren't you also at a man's house

283
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
so early in the morning?

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,360
What did you mean, Lin Wenyu?

285
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,840
How dare you be rude to me.

286
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,720
I meant whatever Miss Song meant.

287
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,480
