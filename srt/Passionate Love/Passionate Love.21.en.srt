(Boundaries Crossed, Chains Undone)

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,710
Let part of the army into the city

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,030
to guard the general's mansion

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,600
and have another battalion on standby.

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,560
You mean to...

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,150
It is plain as day now.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,840
With Duan Xunrui's death,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,790
Duan Xunchu will certainly take revenge.

19
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,680
But he fears our strength,

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,120
so he will not act blindly for now.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,070
Other than taking precautions,

22
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,280
it looks like we need to strike first.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,430
Understood.

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:25,870
Who is it?

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,280
It's me.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,510
Come in.

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,870
Excuse me, Miss.

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,350
My dear girl,

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,680
do you have something to tell me?

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,150
Dad,

31
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,400
he might be your adopted son

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,790
but he didn't commit any heinous crime.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,430
How could you do this?

34
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,350
What does a girl like you understand?

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Duan Xunrui was led astray

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,760
and now wants my life.

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,950
I am only protecting myself.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,280
Dad,

39
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,350
be honest with me.

40
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,400
Duan Xunrui said

41
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,960
you killed his family.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Is that true?

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,470
Wanzhen.

44
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,280
Don't you trust me?

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,310
How could I possibly do such a thing?

46
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,000
With Duan Xunrui dead,

47
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,120
Duan Xunchu will surely cause trouble.

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,280
I'm sending you
to stay in Yun City for a while.

49
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,840
After I've settled this issue,

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll come pick you up.

51
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,120
Alright?

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,840
Daddy,

53
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,000
I beg you.

54
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,960
Stop this,

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,910
alright?

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,680
There must be

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,870
another way to solve this.

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,470
Shut up.

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,240
You will not

60
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,630
get involved in this.

61
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,000
Go to your room and pack.

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,430
Now.

63
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,150
This is my home.

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,710
I'm not going anywhere.

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,080
Wanzhen.

66
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,750
Go back to your home

67
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,240
before I pull out my gun.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,470
Xunchu,

69
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,520
I know

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,560
you hate my father.

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,520
I hate him too.

72
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,280
I don't get it.

73
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,910
I don't get how he turned into

74
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,560
someone else overnight.

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,870
Xunchu,

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
if there is anything I can do

77
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
to make you feel better, I...

78
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,560
He killed my brother.

79
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,960
What can you do?

80
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Tell your father,

81
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,400
his time is up.

82
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,630
Xunchu,

83
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,920
don't treat her like that.

84
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,310
She has nothing to do with this.

85
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,840
She is just a spoiled child.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
Get out of Feng City.

87
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,910
Don't let me see you again.

88
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,680
Dad,

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,630
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,680
My father is deploying his army
toward Xi City.

91
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,430
Soldiers are stationed all over my house.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
They also said...

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,870
What did they say?

94
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,310
They said they will strike first.

95
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,160
Why are you telling me this?

96
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,310
Is there another way

97
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,000
to solve this issue between you?

98
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,070
No.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,430
Don't get involved in this.

100
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,160
Otherwise,

101
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,750
I will not spare you too.

102
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,870
If Song Zhenyuan wants to strike first,

103
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,630
then we don't have much time left.

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,352
We are currently mobilizing the troops.

105
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,720
If Song Zhenyuan wants to face us head-on,

106
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,000
we're prepared.

107
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,870
If Song Zhenyuan truly wants

108
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,920
to face you head-on,

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,750
he needs the support from the merchants
and the troops.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The evidence we collected from his house

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,680
proved his collusion
with the Japanese.

112
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,750
On top of that, we have evidence
provided by Director Wang.

113
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,680
So, you're saying

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,870
if we tell the public

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,160
that he opened up the port to the Japanese
for smuggling purposes...

116
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,070
He will be condemed by the public.

117
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,310
I will go meet with Mr. Chu.

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,680
Adjutant Sun,

119
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,510
go meet with He Sheng'an.

120
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,310
Yes, sir.

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,720
Mr. Watanabe,

122
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,560
that's a deal then.

123
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,480
Mr. Watanabe,

124
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,360
don't worry.

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,480
I'll be sure

126
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
to keep your words in mind.

127
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,510
Good.

128
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,800
Send Mr. Watanabe out.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,560
Yes, sir.

130
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,430
This way.

131
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Goodbye.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Take care.

133
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,120
Goodbye.

134
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,040
Wanzhen,

135
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,950
where did you go?

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Have you packed your luggage?

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Pingchun is packing.

138
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,390
I went out for a walk

139
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,830
to clear my mind.

140
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,480
Who were those people?

141
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,560
They were my Japanese friends.

142
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,560
I have work to do.

143
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,720
Go pack your luggage.

144
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,560
Quickly.

145
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,750
General,

146
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,270
there is news from that side.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,160
Adjutant Sun will escort Lin Wenyu
out of the city tomorrow.

148
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,870
Excellent.

149
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,600
Why not seize this chance
that come our way?

150
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,750
Do it well.

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,000
My target isn't Lin Wenyu

152
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,270
but the things inside the vault

153
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
and Duan Xunchu's life.

154
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,040
Understood.

155
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,830
Hello.

156
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,750
Hello?

157
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,000
Dad.

158
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,870
During this sensitive period,

159
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,680
do not make or accept

160
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,070
any calls.

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,000
Stay in your room.

162
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,070
Dad.

163
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,390
Dad.

164
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,190
Dad.

165
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,870
Dad.

166
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,310
Let me out.

167
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,040
Dad.

168
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,190
Dad, let me out.

169
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,750
Dad.

170
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,480
Dad.

171
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,390
If I remember correctly,

172
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,950
you haven't eaten all day.

173
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,720
Here.

174
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Xunchu,

175
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
the final battle is soon upon us.

176
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,440
I can go with you

177
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,000
to meet Mr. Chu.

178
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,480
As for He Sheng'an,

179
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,630
I can go with him

180
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,600
to look for his former subordinates.

181
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,960
I believe I can quickly...

182
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,156
There is something I want to tell you.

183
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,910
Can you temporarily leave Feng City?

184
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,750
Don't even think about it.

185
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,270
This revenge is shared between us.

186
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,474
You aren't the only one who wants him

187
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:33,832
to kneel in front of
our parents' memorial tablets

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,440
and beg for forgiveness.

189
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,390
Don't worry.

190
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm Duan Xunchu.

191
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,360
I took down the army in the south.

192
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,630
What's a mere Song Zhenyuan?

193
