(Come Closer To Me)

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,750
Alright, Huaining.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
That's it for today.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
You just had acupuncture,
so don't get in the wind.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,560
Remember that.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,600
Of course.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,520
Then, I won't send you home.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,920
Be careful on your way.

19
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,590
Wang didn't clean thoroughly
the last time.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
We have to do it this time.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,710
Yes.

22
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,680
There's no end to work all day.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,870
You'll take the kitchen.

24
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:47,723
I'll take the living room.

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,310
Got it.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,590
Be thorough.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,750
These merchants are too bold.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,430
How dare they raise the price on me?

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,080
You know what to do, right?

30
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,280
Of course, Master.

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,470
You'll take the second floor,
I'll take the first floor.

32
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,120
Sure.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Isn't it done yet?

34
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,400
You're taking too long.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,870
Yes, yes.

36
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,190
Is this your level of efficiency?

37
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,590
If the mansion isn't cleaned

38
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,630
before the General comes back,

39
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,590
you'll all be punished.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes, yes.

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Why isn't the door closed?

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,750
Have you all been this careless
all the time?

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
I remember it was closed.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,030
Hurry, hurry up.

45
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,750
Lock it up.

46
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes.

47
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,150
Let's go.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,800
Major General.

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,840
Go.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,630
Yes, sir.

51
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,430
- Adjutant Sun.
- Major General.

52
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,080
Where is Lin Wenyu?

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
I asked Yaren Medical Hall over the phone.

54
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,360
They said she might have gone
to the Song mansion.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Song mansion?

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,560
And she still hasn't come back.

57
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,680
Something must have happened.
Get me the best red wine from the cellar.

58
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:05,870
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,240
Father, you're home.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
Just teach them a lesson this time.

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
Don't make it big.

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,310
I want them to know

63
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,750
who is in charge of Feng City.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,800
Understood.

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,720
Isn't this Miss Lin's brooch?

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,240
Father, Xunchu is here.

67
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Xunchu, you're here.

68
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
Look how considerate he is.

69
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,560
Uncle Song,

70
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,070
I know you like red wine.

71
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,360
I got someone

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,870
to find a bottle of excellent red wine.

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,270
Good, good.

74
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,270
Xunchu, you're kind.

75
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
Let me take look.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,920
Uncle Song, look...

77
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,190
Are you hurt?

78
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm fine, Uncle Song.

79
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
But I've wasted this bottle of red wine.

80
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,720
It doesn't matter.

81
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
It's the thought that counts.

82
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,310
You there.

83
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,360
Take Xunchu to a guest room and change.

84
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,390
Major General, please follow me.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,560
Uncle Song,

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,480
I'll go get changed.

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,270
Go, go.

88
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,630
Major General, will this room do?

89
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,000
This is fine.

90
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,750
Go out.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,360
Come out.

92
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
What are you doing?

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,830
I'm here to save you, of course.

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
How did you know I'm in this room?

95
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,310
What do we do now?

96
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,310
How do we get out?

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,310
Come here.

98
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,560
I'll tell you.

99
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,600
Just say it from over there.

100
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,680
This far? Are you sure?

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,560
- What if my voice...
- Alright, alright.

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,480
Who is it?

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,120
I brought you clothes.

104
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,070
What is it?

105
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,120
You don't need it?

106
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,950
I thought you want to see me change.

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
What haven't I seen?

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Leave it there.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,310
I have a feeling

110
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,480
that you're acting strange.

111
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,750
Strange?

112
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,390
Have you been

113
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,240
working out behind my back?

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,790
You bulked up.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,550
I didn't.

116
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,360
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

117
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,390
Just get changed.

118
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,440
I'm going out now.

119
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,270
You investigated for an entire day.

120
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,390
What did you find?

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
I got into his study.

122
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,600
But I didn't find anything.

123
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,360
All day and you got nothing.

124
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,360
I even had to rescue you.

125
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,000
Is this how you look for clues?

126
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,670
Button up for me.

127
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,510
Don't you have hands?

128
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,200
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

129
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,750
Why are you nervous?

130
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,510
Done.

131
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,270
