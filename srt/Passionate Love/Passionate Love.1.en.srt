Search every corner

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,150
and find Lin Wenyu.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,320
Go search.

You, over there.

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,710
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,200
Move quickly.

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
Su Wenyue,

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
where else will you run?

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,920

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,190
Miss Lin,

34
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
let's get straight to the point.

35
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,400
I don't mean to default on the arrears,

36
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,840
but there is a major issue
with your western medicine.

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Someone died after taking them.

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
The family of the deceased
screamed about reporting you.

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
Is that true?

40
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,360
Logically speaking,

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,030
I should file a claim against you.

42
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,840
But it's not easy for a woman like you

43
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,150
to stay in business,

44
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,000
so I've kept it under wraps for you.

45
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,310
Mr. Li,

46
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,840
what you took from me

47
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,080
wasn't some western medicine

48
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,360
but fairly priced
genuine Chinese medicine.

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,870
I have the shipping record here.

50
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,950
Would you like to take a look yourself?

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,630
No need.

52
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,830
Look how careless of me.

53
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720
I've wrongly accused you.

54
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,560
Miss Lin,

55
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,630
no offense.

56
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,480
I've always admired

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
iron ladies like you, Miss Lin.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,000
For our continued cooperation,

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,510
this toast

60
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,270
marks the immediate settlement
of my arrears.

61
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:41,750
Good.

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,190
However, I don't have
that many silver notes on me.

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,270
Look,

64
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,560
why don't you come with me to the bank?

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,480
Not a problem.

66
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
Miss Lin, what's wrong?

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,750
I feel dizzy.

68
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
You must be drunk.

69
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,190
Let me take you to a room and rest.

70
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,600
Come.

71
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,040
Watch the door.

72
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't let anyone bother us.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,750
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,360
Weren't...

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,870
Weren't you dizzy?

76
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,160
Isn't it better to do business properly?

77
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
Why resort to drugging me?

78
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,750
Feng City is not big.

79
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,870
Is it worth ruining your reputation
for so little money?

80
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,070
Miss Lin,

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,070
you're right.

82
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,720
I was blinded.

83
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,190
Please have mercy on me.

84
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,240
Look,

85
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
I've settled the arrears.

86
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,630
Your gun...

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,480
Who are you? What are you doing here?

88
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,120
Go away.

89
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,630
Who are you? What do you want?

90
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,310
Long time no see,

91
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,870
my sister-in-law.

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,070
Xunchu?

93
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,920
What's this?

94
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you surprised to see me?

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
You're back.

96
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,800
How have you been over the years?

97
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,240
Don't act fake in front of me,

98
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,070
Su Wenyue.

99
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,870
No.

100
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,510
I should call you Lin Wenyu now.

101
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,390
Did you think I'd be as dumb as before

102
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,040
and fall for your fake acts?

103
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,480
You look really pitiful.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Who are you acting for?

105
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,750
I can't believe how cheap you've become

106
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,720
after a few years apart.

107
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,870
I know you hate me

108
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,000
but there is no need

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,430
to word it that inappropriately.

110
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,270
What are you doing, Duan Xunchu?

111
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm your sister-in-law.

112
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,160
What "sister-in-law"?

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,120
You are just a cheap and wicked woman.

114
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,120
Let me go.

115
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,270
I've always treated you
as my younger brother.

116
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,510
Brother?

117
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,000
Let me show you

118
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,510
if I am still the brother

119
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,630
you fooled years ago.

120
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,270
Let go.

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
Let me go.

122
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,360
Did you think I was going
to do something to you?

123
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,550
Then I've disappointed you.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,510
Not killing you
is the greatest mercy I can show you

125
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,720
because I will never forget everything

126
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,360
you and your father did.

127
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,200
Don't ever mention
that you're my sister-in-law.

128
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,910
It disgusts me.

129
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,510
Lin Wenyu,

130
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,550
we will meet again.

131
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,120
Miss.

132
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,720
Miss, where are you?

133
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,200
Miss.

134
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Miss.

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,480
Miss, I finally found you.

136
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,150
Are...

137
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,670
Are you alright?

138
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
Did Mr. Li

139
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,030
do something to you?

140
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,750
I'm fine.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
Then, that's good.

142
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Who was that man just now?

143
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,240
Major General,

144
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,510
why didn't you kill her?

145
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
An easy death for her

146
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,630
will not satisfy my family's revenge.

147
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:55,790
Go.

148
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,390
To the old mansion.

149
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,000
Now this is my home.

150
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Get the subordinates to repair it.

151
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,960
I want to move back here.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,510
Yes, sir.

153
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,080
Dear.

154
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,840
Burn it all down.

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,910
Hurry, hurry.

156
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,630
Burn their bodies.
Don't leave evidence behind.

157
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,150
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,510
Over here. Move it here.

159
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,270
(Father.)

160
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,550
