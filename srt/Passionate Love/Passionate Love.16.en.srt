(You're The One I Like)

12

In this case,

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,670
wonderful.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,320
I'll start preparing for the wedding.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,430
Xunchu, do you have time this afternoon?

16
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,430
Why don't you accompany us
to pick the wedding dress?

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm full. I'll go check the account book.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,920
Enjoy your meal.

19
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,070
She got shy.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
Miss Lin, you are really lucky.

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,070
These designs are currently popular
in the West.

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,350
Mr. Song ordered these.

23
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,400
My bride

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,480
will have the most unique wedding dress.

25
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,927
How could I let her
wear the same dress as others?

26
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,040
Miss Lin,

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,310
why don't you try this on?

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,310
Of course.

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,280
Put these away.

30
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,400
Xunchu, where are you going?

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,230
Washroom.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,430
Why are you in here?

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,910
Do you want to marry him?

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,590
- I...
- Answer me.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
Xunrui is your brother.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,470
I am his fiancee.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,520
It's only right that I marry him.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,910
Xunchu,

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
he was almost burned to death

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,750
to save us.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,470
We don't know how much he suffered

42
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,967
in the hands of Song Zhenyuan
over the years.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,310
Neither of us

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,430
should owe him anything again.

45
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,800
Do you love him?

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,520
Does it even matter?

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
My father betrothed me

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,590
to him when I was a child.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,080
This is also my father
and the Commander's final wish.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,630
No matter what it is,

51
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,080
I must marry him

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,960
now that he is still alive.

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,120
Wenyu.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,280
Are you done?

55
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,680
Get out.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,470
You haven't answered me.

57
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,360
Do you really want to marry him?

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Tell me if you don't.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,030
I'll talk to him.

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,750
Wenyu.

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,240
Have you changed into the dress?

62
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,560
Go, get out.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,400
Wenyu.

64
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,800
Wenyu, are you alright?

65
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,310
- What's going on?
- I'm fine, Xunrui.

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,520
This dress doesn't seem to fit.

67
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,800
Can you ask the owner

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
if he has any other sizes?

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,400
Alright.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,590
I'll go now.

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Be careful in there.

72
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,080

Bitao,

116
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,720
go to the best matchmaker in Feng City.

117
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:06,630
Ask her to find a lady
from every noble family

118
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,310
around the Major General's age.

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,800
Remember,

120
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,360
she must pick the best one.

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,510
I plan on finding
a good marriage for Xunchu

124
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,000
and help him start a family.

125
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,360
It will appease the Commander's spirit.

126
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,310
- Yes, Miss.
- Go on.

127
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,510
Who allowed you to come in?

128
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,630
Get out.

129
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,240
Did you ask Bitao to find me a matchmaker?

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes.

131
00:08:05,658 --> 00:08:07,360
I told her to look out
for young women of the right age.

132
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,750

133

I am not meddling.

Lin Wenyu,

137
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
have you ever asked me

138
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,390
what type of woman I like?

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,040

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,870
Get out of my room.

141
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,870
Ask me.

142
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
What type do you like?

143
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,790

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,750
that you're the type I like,

145

Sister-in-law?

149
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,120
You and my brother's betrothal is only
a verbal arrangement by the parents.

150
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,790
You aren't even properly engaged.

151
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,360
You aren't my sister-in-law.

If I knew what propriety is,

159
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,870
