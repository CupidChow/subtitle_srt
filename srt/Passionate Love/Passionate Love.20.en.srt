(Life Worth Living)

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,790
Well said.

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,200
Son,

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,750
get up.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,790
Major General.

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:05,870
Any news?

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,738
After Song Huaining went back
to the Song family,

18
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:09,963
he is back to being
the young master of the family again.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,680
He has been accompanying Song Zhenyuan
in his travels with the Japanese.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,870
By the looks of it,

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,310
he seems content to be back

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,840
and completely at ease.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,040
I don't think Huaining
is this type of person.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,230
Could he have an ulterior motive?

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,680
He can't possibly mistaken
the enemy for a father.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,350
He is unrepentant

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,790
and is committing treason
with Song Zhenyuan.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,280
No.

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't believe this.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,120
I want him to tell me himself.

31
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,310
I'll go look for him now.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,710
- Calm down.
- Major General.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,040
Oh, yes.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,480
I have a note.

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,640
It was found at the entrance this morning.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,200
It says

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,590
the Song father-and-son will secretly
meet with the Japanese tonight

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,040
to discuss the opening of the port

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,070
and ways to seize control of your army.

40
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,760
Who wrote this?

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,120
We have no leads yet.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,040
I suspect this to be a trap.

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,070
Xunchu.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,950
Major General.

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,260
(Songhe Restaurant)

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,590
Mr. Ito,

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
please try the best wine
in Songhe Restaurant.

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,470
Good.

49
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:19,750
Come.

50
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,190
Come.

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,310
I raise this toast to you.

52
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,240
General Song,

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
you have an exceptional son.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,150
He has much to learn from you, Mr. Ito.

55
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,240
About that matter we discussed...

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Mr. Ito, don't worry.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,520
I will definitely cooperate.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Excellent.

59
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,190
Come, I raise this toast to you.

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,710
Cheers to a great partnership.

61
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,430
Enjoy the meal.

62
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,360
Enjoy the meal.

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,190
You fool.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,960
What were you looking at?

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,840
It's you.

66
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,030
How dare you ruin my plan?

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,030
Don't you know how incapable you are?

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
I have my men outside.

69
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,430
You'll see

70
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,560
how capable I am today.

71
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,750
If you don't want your woman to die,

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
then put down your guns.

73
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,750
Put down your guns.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,520
Duan Xunrui,

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,520
our enemy is Song Zhenyuan.

76
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,840
Stop going down the wrong path.

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,430
Duan Xunchu,

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,150
so what if he is

79
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,150
the real Duan Xunrui?

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
Only I

81
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,430
can give him wealth and fame.

82
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,360
Only I can give him everything he wants.

83
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,480
What is deep seated resentment

84
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,040
compared to unlimited wealth?

85
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,360
The Song Huaining I know

86
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,160
is idealistic and ambitious.

87
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,310
Even if he is deceived by the enemy,

88
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,630
he would never flatter others to survive.

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
The Song Huaining you know is a fake.

90
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,720
He doesn't deserve your respect.

91
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,390
Come here.

92
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,120
Son,

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
I will hold onto this woman.

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Take Mr. Ito out of here.

95
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,510
Alright.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,480
Mr. Ito, this way.

97
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,920
Out of our way.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,720
I killed him.

99
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,629
Was that quick enough?

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,870
Song Huaining.

101
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,950
Have you gone crazy?

102
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm not Song Huaining.

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
I'm Duan Xunrui.

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,360
Song Zhenyuan,

105
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,360
just surrender.

106
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,360
You cannot escape.

107
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,750
Nobody move.

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,070
Let us see

109
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,560
who is quicker with the gun,

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,560
you or me?

111
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,240
Put the gun down.

112
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,270
Put the gun down.

113
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,600
Put it down.

114
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,360
Wenyu, are you hurt?

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm fine.

116
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,950
Stop.

117
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,600
Xunrui.

118
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,630
I let you down.

119
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,630
I don't deserve to be your brother.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Xunrui,

121
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,600
stop talking.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,974
I'm taking you to the hospital.

123
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm taking you to the hospital.

124
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,800
All those years,

125
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,360
I mistook the enemy for a father.

126
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,310
I almost got you killed.

127
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,920
I let our parents down.

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,310
I let our entire family down.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,510
Xunrui,

130
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,630
it's not your fault.

131
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,830
It's all on Song Zhenyuan.

132
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,480
You have nothing to do with this.

133
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,510
The only regret I have

134
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,120
is that I couldn't spend
more days as your brother.

135
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,070
Xunrui.

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,430
Xunchu.

137
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,600
Father.

138
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,240
Mother.

139
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,720
I miss all of you.

140
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,510
Xunrui.

141
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,000
Xunrui.

142
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,630
Xunrui.

143
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,630
(Xunchu,)

144
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,870
(by the time you read this letter,)

145
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,389
(Memorial Tablet of Duan Xunrui)
(I might already be dead.)

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,723
(Ever since I woke up
after the incident at the temple,)

147
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,000
(I've recovered my memories)

148
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,190
(and realized that I've mistaken)

149
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,750
(the enemy for a father all these years.)

150
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
(I grew up under the enemy's wing.)

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
(I honored and respected him.)

152
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,070
(I even committed)

153
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,360
(terrible crimes for him,)

154
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,160
(not knowing this was all a lie.)

155
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,750
(But it's all too late now.)

156
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,120
(I am filled with deep regrets.)

157
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,950
(Xunchu,)

158
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,630
(I'm not a good brother.)

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,240
(In the years I've been with you,)

160
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
(I couldn't recognize you.)

161
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,630
(I even helped Song Zhenyuan
to plan your death.)

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
(Every time I think about this,)

163
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
(I feel so ashamed.)

164
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,270
(I am glad)

165
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,320
(there were moments)

166
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,670
(where I treated you as my brother.)

167
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,670
(I am glad that we really are brothers.)

168
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,320
(During these years,)

169
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,390
(you have been busy
because of our parents' deaths.)

170
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,480
(It's my turn)

171
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,000
(to do my part as the older brother.)

172
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,270
(Lately, I have been)

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,790
(collecting evidence of Song Zhenyuan
collaborating with the enemy.)

174
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,600
(I hope you can make use of it.)

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
(If something happens to me,)

176
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,630
(don't be sad.)

177
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,670
(This is the price I should pay.)

178
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,600
(Wenyu,)

179
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,790
(I can see)

180
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,720
(that you're already in love with Xunchu.)

181
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,790
(It must not have been easy
going through so much)

182
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,270
(in this life.)

183
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,440
(Let everything go)

184
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,600
(and appreciate the one in front of you.)

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,390
(In this new life,)

186
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,240
(don't get tied up with our betrothal)

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
(and go after your own happiness.)

188
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,080
(Xunchu,)

189
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,870
