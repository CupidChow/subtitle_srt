(Wherever You Go, I'll Go)

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,640
Adjutant Sun.

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,110
I'm leaving her in your care.

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,320
You must keep her safe.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,670
Don't worry.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,750
Why have we stopped?

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,510
Where is this?

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,760
Officer Sun,

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,200
I need to relieve myself.

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,680
Hurry up.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,760
Right away.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,760
Mr. Chen,

23
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,640
I brought them here

24
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,680
as you ordered.

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,200
What about my money?

26
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,560
Why isn't Adjutant Sun back yet?

27
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,960
Major General, he hasn't returned.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,710
Major General,
a man delivered this letter.

29
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,340
(Wharf Warehouse. Come alone
if you want Lin Wenyu to live)

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Get in position.

31
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,470
Hurry.

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,840
The General commanded.

33
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,430
To the wharf warehouse immediately.

34
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,240
Move out.

35
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,360
It's you.

36
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,190
Miss Song,

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,470
I know you're a kind person.

38
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,710
That's why, I decided to come here today.

39
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,150
Aren't you afraid you would get caught?

40
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,960
That's why,

41
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,870
this is a gamble I must take.

42
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
What do you want from me?

43
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,600
Song Zhenyuan colluded with the Japanese

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,630
to sell opium to the people in Feng City.

45
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,870
Soon, Feng City will be
taken over by the Japanese.

46
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,120
The people will suffer terribly.

47
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,070
Miss Song,

48
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,070
if you're a righteous person,

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,510
please come with me

50
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,600
to save the Major General.

51
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,070
Will you

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,720
kill my father?

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,740
(No Smoking)

54
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,600
Wenyu.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,630
Don't move.

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,430
General,

57
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,480
the guards outside confirmed
that he came alone.

58
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,310
Enough.

59
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,270
Song Zhenyuan,

60
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,830
your fight is with me.

61
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't pull dirty tricks like this.

62
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,240
Xunchu,

63
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,040
are you in any position

64
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,430
to be stubborn?

65
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,000
What's the point
in kidnapping a woman?

66
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
To be honest,

67
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,830
I'm quite impressed.

68
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,750
You really came alone.

69
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,070
I'm sure you are desperate to know

70
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,360
what happened ten years ago.

71
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,870
In this era of decentralization,

72
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
it is only by strengthening your own power

73
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,870
can you survive in this cruel world.

74
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
Such is the law of the jungle.

75
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,800
That's why you killed my entire family.

76
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,510
Aren't you afraid of the retribution

77
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,070
for taking that many lives?

78
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,270
You are

79
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,040
still too young.

80
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,630
Back then,

81
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,630
your father refused to cooperate
with the Japanese.

82
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,680
I persuaded him

83
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,560
but he kept telling me
about doing right by the country.

84
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,750
What a joke.

85
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,630
You and him are the same.

86
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,600
You prefer death.

87
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,120
Song Zhenyuan.

88
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,920
And your father.

89
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,120
I gave him a chance too

90
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,040
but he didn't take it

91
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,480
and ratted me out to Commander Duan.

92
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,800
I had no choice

93
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,030
but to send them both to hell.

94
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
Song Zhenyuan,

95
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,840
God is watching

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
every wicked thing you do.

97
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,630
You will be punished.

98
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Even if we all die here today,

99
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,670
it won't end well for you.

100
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,320
When tomorrow comes,

101
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,000
everything you've done
will be made public.

102
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,670
All the merchants who supported you
will turn against you.

103
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,600
Everyone in Feng City will know the truth

104
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,840
and will hate you to the bone.

105
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,550
The city's press are all my people.

106
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,840
Did you really think

107
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,150
I got to where I am today

108
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,030
by counting on those merchant?

109
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm telling you.

110
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,390
My true backers

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,870
are the Japanese.

112
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,510
I give them a trading route,

113
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,670
and they give me support.

114
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,960
It's a great deal.

115
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,750
The people in Feng City
still live and work in peace.

116
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,750
Why do youngsters like you

117
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,510
fail to be farsighted?

118
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,720
You secretly allowed opium
to flow into Feng City,

119
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,720
so the Japanese can suck our blood.

120
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,360
You're just a traitor.

121
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
A disgrace.

122
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,870
You are just like your father.

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,510
Stubborn and headstrong.

124
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,910
To be honest,

125
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,630
I never planned

126
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,150
on letting you two go today.

127
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,960
As they say, nip it in the bud.

128
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,360
However,

129
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,150
I don't want
to be the villain all my life.

130
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,510
Consider this as karma points
for my later life.

131
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,550
If you can agree to my requests,

132
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,080
perhaps I can let Lin Wenyu live.

133
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,670
But

134
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,750
that depends on how important

135
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,600
she is to you.

136
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,670
Let her go.

137
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,510
You can have my life.

138
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,120
Duan Xunchu,
you cannot agree to his requests.

139
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,480
If you don't get rid of him now,

140
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,840
everyone in Feng City

141
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,510
will suffer endlessly.

142
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,320
Shut up.

143
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,510
Don't tell me what to do.

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
What a pair of doomed lovers.

145
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
How touching.

146
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,120
State your requests.

147
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,200
One,

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
give me the Duan family vault.

149
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,320
Two,

150
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,870
disband your army

151
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,000
and never return to Feng City again.

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,600
Xunchu, no.

153
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,120
You must never agree.

154
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,030
I have patience,

155
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,550
but a knife doesn't.

156
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,910
I'll count to three.

157
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,910
Even if you tell him,

158
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,720
One.

159
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,080
he will kill us all.

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,630
Two.

161
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,240
I'll tell you.

162
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,494
It's in the underground warehouse
in the west villa.

163
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,030
If you are telling the truth,

164
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,480
then I will keep my word.

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
I will let Lin Wenyu live.

166
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,670
Nobody move.

167
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,200
Wanzhen.

168
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,120
Dad.

169
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,150
Dad.

170
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,080
Dad, save me.

171
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,200
Save me.

172
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,510
Don't be scared, I'm here.

173
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,150
Get back, all of you.

174
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,240
Get back, get back.

175
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,750
Put down your guns.

176
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,790
Put down the guns.

177
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,600
Put them down.

178
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,630
Put down the guns.

179
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,750
You let Wanzhen go,

180
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,750
and I'll let Lin Wenyu go.

181
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,910
We'll make an exchange.

182
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,630
Agreed?

183
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,080
- We'll do it at the same time.
- Deal.

184
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,720
Wanzhen.

185
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,480
Don't be scared.

186
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,910
Get over there.

187
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,120
Adjutant Sun.

188
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,440
Xunchu.

189
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,320
No.

190
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,550
No.

191
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,440
