(Three Persons)

12

Stop it.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,640
- What are you doing?
- Why are you defending this woman?

14
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,000
Why do you have this jade pendant?

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,350
Ten years ago,

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,230
soon after the incident
at the Duan mansion,

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,400
I found Huaining

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,350
injured and unconscious nearby.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,950
This jade pendant

20
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,760
was on him then.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,710
But I never imagined

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,870
that he is Duan's son.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,070
General,

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,400
if Huaining really is Xunrui,

25
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,350
why couldn't you recognize him
at that time?

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,710
When I found him,
he had injuries all over his body.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,950
His face

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,070
was burned beyond recognition.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,640
I hired doctors from overseas

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,230
to save his life.

31
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,400
When he woke up,

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,760
he couldn't remember who he is.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
Xunrui.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,310
Xunrui.

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,560
But you found him

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,680
near the Duan mansion.

37
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,680
The fire from that year spread far.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,120
How could I know whose child he was?

39
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
At that time,

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,560
I was utterly devastated by what happened

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,710
to Duan and his family.

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,640
If I had known that he is Xunrui,

43
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,350
why wouldn't I reunite him with Xunchu?

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,200
That...

45
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,630
That jade pendant...

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,590
Ten years ago,

47
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,630
my parents gave this to me and my brother.

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,310
It is a pair.

49
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,750
Impossible. I can't be Xunchu's brother.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,590
When the incident happened,

51
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
I didn't save Duan in time.

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,590
Now that you two brothers

53
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,150
are alive and reunited,

54
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,710
I suppose I didn't let Duan down.

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,470
Xunchu.

56
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,710
Huaining.

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
On my brother's back

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,630
is a crescent-shaped birthmark.

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,150
Father.

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,400
Mother.

61
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,750
I found Xunrui.

62
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,430
He has been by my side

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,310
all these years.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,120
(Is it a coincidence)

65
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:10,618
(that his brother also
have a crescent-shaped birthmark?)

66
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,620
(Memorial Tablet of Duan Yuan
and Wife, Du Wenxiu)

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,040
What's wrong? Does your head hurt again?

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,360
I'm fine.

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,190
Father.

70
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,750
Mother.

71
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,270
I'm home.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,750
I haven't been

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
doing my part all these years.

74
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,160
From now on,

75
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,920
I will find the person who killed you

76
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
and avenge you.

77
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,120
(Of all people, why was Song Zhenyuan
the one who adopted him?)

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
