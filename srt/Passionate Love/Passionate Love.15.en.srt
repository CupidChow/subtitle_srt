(Can't Have You, Can't Forget You)

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,150
Wenyu, you're awake.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,470
I've prepared breakfast.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,240
Come try it.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,790
Sure.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,230
I'll do it myself.

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,950
Major General,
Miss Wanzhen is here to visit you.

18
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,150
Wanzhen?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,230
Come, sit down for breakfast.

20
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,560
Miss Lin,

21
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,350
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,040
Everything I did was due to my ignorance.

23
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,120
Will you forgive me?

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,530
Wenyu, she is young and ignorant.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,430
Will you

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,710
forgive her this time?

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,710
Come and have breakfast.

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,680
Wenyu,

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,560
try this scallop congee.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,070
I had the servants buy this
from Jinyin Restaurant

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,920
this morning.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,590
Xunrui, you don't need to do this.

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,070
We can be like we've always been.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,070
Thank you.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Don't you like this?

36
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,040
I thought

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,760
I should make up

38
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,840
for the time

39
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,200
we've lost.

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,000
Xunchu,

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,030
Wenyu isn't angry anymore.

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
Can you not be angry?

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,710
Look at you two.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,240
Will you go shopping with me today?

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,910
Sure.

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Enjoy your meal.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,000
We're leaving.

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,240
Bye-bye.

49
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,400
Let's go.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,240
Wenyu,

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,590
do you like flowers?

52
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,360
Major General.

53
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,800
The Young Master

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
went out to buy flowers for Miss Lin

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
and said

56
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,960
he wants to bring Miss Lin
to a candlelight dinner.

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,910
Adjutant Sun,

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,870
don't worry about unnecessary matters.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,910
Get out.

60
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes, sir.

61
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,240
Young Master is here.

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,630
- Wenyu.
- Huaining.

63
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,630
These flowers are for you.

64
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,470
I wanted to give you red roses

65
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,360
but I couldn't find them
all over the city.

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,630
I can only get you wild roses for today.

67
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,098
What happened to your hands?

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,898
I picked these from the outskirts
of the city.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Maybe I got cut then, I'll be fine.

70
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,710
Bitao,

71
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,120
bring me the wound cream.

72
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,360
Yes, Miss.

73
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,430
Wenyu,

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,190
you haven't told me
if you liked the flowers.

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,000
Thank you.

76
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,680
Wenyu,

77
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,360
I'm doing this

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,030
to make up for my absence

79
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,120
during the last few years.

80
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,160
Xunchu and I were best friends,

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,830
but now we're real brothers.

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,720
I don't know how to
face each other instead.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
This thing happened too suddenly.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,270
Let's give each other some time.

85
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,950
Of course.

86
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,120
Wenyu,

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
do you know
what is keeping Xunchu busy lately?

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,360
I noticed that he is often
out all day with Adjutant Sun.

89
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,040
If he needs me,

90
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,870
I can help to shoulder the burden.

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,120
I never asked him

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
about his work.

93
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,310
If you want to help him,

94
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,750
you can ask him yourself.

95
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,630
All done.

96
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,070
I'll go back to work. You can rest here.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,190
Why are you back so late?

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,830
Xunchu, we already had dinner.

99
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,510
What is that in your hand?

100
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,750
I gave Wenyu a bouquet of flowers.

101
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,160
For these flowers,

102
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600
I even got injured.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,750
Luckily, Wenyu had already treated me.

104
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,000
Is it serious?

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,310
I'm fine, just a scratch.

106
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,360
Be careful next time.

107
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,070
Since you have already eaten,

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,560
I'll go to bed.

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,270
Xunchu,

110
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,160
is something wrong?

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm fine.

112
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,270
Just tired.

113
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,190
Huaining, I'll go take a look at him.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Good morning,

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,800
Wenyu, Xunchu.

116
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,190
Good morning, Huaining.

117
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,950
Xunrui.

118
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,190
I'm really not used to

119
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,680
you calling me that.

120
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,720
Why are we standing here?

121
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,040
I bought something delicious.
Come, let's try it.

122
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,270
Miss,

123
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,190
Young Master bought this scallop congee.

124
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,160
I'll do it.

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,000
- Here, Wenyu.
- Thank you.

126
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll get it myself.

127
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,040
I have something

128
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,600
to discuss with you two today.

129
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
I know this may seem bold

130
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,950
but I'll be straightforward.

131
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,600
Ever since the first time I saw Wenyu,

132
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,950
I had this strange feeling of familiarity.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,510
After staying together during these days,
I felt my heart moved for the first time.

134
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,720
I want to marry Wenyu as soon as possible.

135
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
This is our father

136
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
and Adjutant Su's wish.

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,070
Huaining, I...

138
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,750
Wenyu, I know this seems bold

139
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,800
but this matter

140
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,800
has kept me awake at night.

141
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,790
Or

142
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,910
have you found another person

143
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,150
that you love while I was away?

144
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,320
And I also heard

145
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,120
that you stayed a widow for me.

146
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,550
You have me in your heart, right?

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,030
Huai...

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,790
Xunrui,

149
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,440
our parents
did arrange a betrothal between us.

150
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,080
Eventually, I'll have to marry you.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,790
In this case,

152
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,120
wonderful.

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,870
I'll start preparing for the wedding.
