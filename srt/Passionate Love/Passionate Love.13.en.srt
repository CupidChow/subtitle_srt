Miss.

00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,560
Miss, the Major General said

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,840
not to get out of bed

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,280

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,560
come to my study.

66
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, Major General.

67
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
How is her wound?

68
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,600
Major General,

69
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,160
it has almost fully recovered.

70
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,830
What does

71
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,720
Wenyue usually like to wear?

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
She likes to wear qipao.

73
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,560
Qipao?

74
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,950
Go back.

75
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,270
Yes, sir.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,120
Qipao.

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,800
Miss,

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,630
these qipaos are beautiful.

79
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,000
Miss Lin,

80
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,680
these are all new designs of the season.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,830
The Major General said

82
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,120
to have you try them all.

83
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,160
If you like them, you can keep them all.

84
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,510
Miss, the Major General
treats you really well.

85
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,310
I don't like these qipaos.

86
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,480
Take them back.

87
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,240
Miss Lin,

88
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,800
you want me to take them back
without even trying them on.

89
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,800
But I dare not disobey
the Major General's order.

90
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes, Miss.

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,510
Didn't you used to love qipao?

92
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,870
Look at this one.

93
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,750
This looks pretty.

94
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,270
Miss Lin,

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,950
please try it on.

96
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,630
If you really dislike it,

97
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,160
at least I can explain myself
to the Major General.

98
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,000
Alright.

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,680
When did you come?

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,830
I just got here.

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,830
Do you like it?

102
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,310
I'll go change.

103
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,360
What are you doing?

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
No need, I can do it myself.

105
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,270
I'll go get changed.

106
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,190
Are you avoiding me?

107
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,240
No.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,120
No?

109
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,480
I know it's too late to say this.

110
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,800
I hated you all these years
because of a misunderstanding.

111
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,830
I did a lot of things to hurt you too.

112
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,720
I know apologizing won't do any good.

113
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,070
So now,

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,992
I will do everything in my power
to make it up to you.

115
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
That year, everyone believed

117
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,360
that my father killed the Commander.

118
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,390
They had witnesses

119
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,510
and the police closed the case.

120
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,430
It's normal that you didn't believe him.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,750
At least, I finally proved his innocence.

122
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
I don't want to bring up the past again.

123
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Your parents treated me
like their own child.

124
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Now, I only want to find the real murderer

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,870
and avenge them.

126
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,910
Miss.

127
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,510
How did it go? Did you see Xunchu?

128
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,510
The Major General wouldn't see me.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,670
He even refused to accept

130
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,720
the cake you made.

131
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,750
What is going on?

132
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,270
Master.

133
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,240
Get back to work.

134
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,720
What's wrong, my girl?

135
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
Who made you angry?

136
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,440
He won't see me, or accept my gift.

137
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,720
What else must I do

138
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,550
before he forgives me?

139
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,270
You can't blame Xunchu.

140
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,670
You almost got his sister-in-law killed.

141
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,440
What did you say?

142
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,870
What sister-in-law?

143
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,360
I just heard about it.

144
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,670
Miss Lin

145
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,240
is his older brother's fiancee

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,910
and his sister-in-law.

147
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,550
Sister-in-law?

148
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,150
Miss Lin.

149
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,270
Bitao.
Where is the Major General?

150
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,600
He is attending to his duties.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going out for a while.

152
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,270
Where are you going, Miss?

153
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
It's his birthday today.

154
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,840
Extra, extra.

155
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,270
Major General Duan Xunchu

156
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,200
has an affair with his sister-in-law.

157
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,080
Wait.

158
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,440
Would you like one?

159
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,140
(Shocking Incestuous Scandal)

160
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,600
Lin Wenyu.

161
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,840
I should be calling you Mrs. Duan now.

162
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
I never thought

163
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,120
you are Xunchu's sister-in-law.

164
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,120
I...

165
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,550
Miss,

166
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,360
how could a married woman

167
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,630
seduce her own brother-in-law?

168
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,960
I must say,

169
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,870
you should stay away from this kind of

170
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,600
shameless woman.

171
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,390
- How unlucky.
- Stop saying nonsense.

172
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,145
Xunchu and I aren't
in that kind of relationship.

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Nonsense?

174
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,120
Isn't this scandal

175
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,030
already all over Feng City?

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,790
That's right.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,960
Look, everyone.

178
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,550
This is the woman
who seduced her brother-in-law.

179
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,510
The owner of Yaren Medical Hall, Miss Lin.

180
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,200
So, it's her.

181
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,000
On the surface, she saves people

182
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,510
but secretly engages
in this sort of thing.

183
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,030
That's right.

184
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,960
Apparently, she lives
with the Major General.

185
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,390
There are only two of them
in the entire Duan mansion.

186
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,440
How indecent.

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,080
- Are you running away?
- Let go.

188
