(Isn't Everything Thanks To You?)

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,240
You told Adjutant Su

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,750
about the Commander's return on the phone.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,670
The Duan family got massacred
on the same night.

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,320
And I saw you

16
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,200
opened the door to the enemies.

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,390
Hello.

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:02,960
Father.

19
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,710
Today is the New Year's Eve.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,070
When are you coming home?

21
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,150
Even Commander Duan has come home.

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,680
Xunchu,

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,120
I did open the door

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,560
but I didn't know who it was.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,950
I only heard footsteps

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,310
and then I got knocked unconscious.

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,430
I really didn't know anything.

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,640
Xunchu,

29
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,640
you must believe me.

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,230
Xunchu.

31
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,480
Throw her out.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,350
Miss,

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,280
you're back.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,590
Miss,

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,710
what's wrong?

36
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,240
Did Duan Xunchu bully you?

37
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm fine.

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,520
Miss,

39
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,960
I had a hard time

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
searching for you years ago.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,910
We hid our identities and came back

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,280
to Feng City and find the truth

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,240
to prove Master's innocence.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Duan Xunchu gives you trouble
as soon as he came back.

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,910
No.

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,710
I will go and explain it to him.

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,590
He hates me deeply now.

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,120
He won't believe me.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
It's only after I've found the evidence
and know the truth,

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,240
can I clear my father's name.

51
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,220
(Yaren Medical Hall)

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,400
By the order of the Major General,
Yaren Medical Hall is to be sealed.

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,030
Everyone, get out.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,310
Get out, get out.

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,190
Wait.

56
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,470
Why?

57
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,470
It's the Major General's order.

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,630
- Move out of the way.
- You cannot do this.

59
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,680
- Miss.
- What are you doing?

60
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,780
(Feng City Military Office Sealed)

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,980
(Feng City Military Office Sealed)

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,690
Without the Major General's permission,

63
00:03:19,694 --> 00:03:21,229
Yaren Medical Hall is not allowed
to open for business.

64
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,680
Make anymore trouble

65
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,910
and you'll all be arrested.

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,150
You...

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,310
Miss,

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,150
this is too much.

69
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't know either.

70
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,430
I'm still waiting for my salary.

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,150
Yes.

72
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,360
Stop the car.

73
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,240
Why did we stop?

74
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,190
Xunchu,

75
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,910
didn't you promise
to stroll around with me?

76
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,710
If I kneel and beg for forgiveness
from the Duan family,

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,710
will you spare Yaren Medical Hall

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,470
and my employees?

79
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,710
Xunchu,

80
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,960
who is she? What a downer.

81
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Just a schemer.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190
Take a look in a mirror, will you?

83
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,992
The Major General has just returned
and you want to flirt with him?

84
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,310
In that case,

85
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,600
I will play a game with you.

86
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,070
If you made me happy,

87
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,310
I'll put in a good word for you.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,830
Xunchu,

89
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,430
we haven't seen each other for years.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,390
You promised to stroll around
with me today.

91
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,825
You won't go back on your words, right?

92
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,430
Adjutant Sun,

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
find me a rope.

94
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,560
I want to test this lady's legs.

95
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,000
Tie her to the back.

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,870
Since you foolishly

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,240
ruined my plan,

98
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,070
I'll have you taste the consequences.

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Are you sure?

100
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,750
As long as
you'll spare Yaren Medical Hall.

101
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,270

103

If you don't get out now,

104
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,680
you'll die.

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720

106
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,120
What do you mean?

107
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,000
