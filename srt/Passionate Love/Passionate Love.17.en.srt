I will be right back.

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
Stay hidden in here.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,560
Keep this with you.

Don't be afraid.

You're a big boy.

50
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,150
You must protect yourself.

51
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,310
I believe you can do this.

52
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,680
A map?

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Could this be the map
to the Duan family vault?

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,910
Adjutant Sun.

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,910
Major General.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,430
Send the men to scout
this place on the map.

57
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,960
Check what sort of place it is.

58
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,400
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,750
Who is it?

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,630
Wenyu, it's me, Huaining.

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,390
Are you asleep?

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,950
Not yet.

63
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
May I come in?

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,830
Come on in.

65
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Wenyu,

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,190
look at these invitation designs.

67
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,310
They all look good.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,390
You can decide.

69
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,270
Let's decide on this. What do you think?

70
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,270
It's just like you,

71
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,830
simple and nice.

72
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,190
Sure.

73
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,240
Oh, right.

74
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,480
I saw Adjutant Sun
took a group of soldiers

75
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,430
and left in a hurry.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,630
Where are they going this late?

77
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,950
Wenyu,

78
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,600
do you know
what is keeping Xunchu busy lately?

79
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,390
I noticed that he is often
out all day with Adjutant Sun.

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,070
If he needs me,

81
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,870
I can help to shoulder the burden.

82
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,510
I'm not too sure.

83
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,000
Maybe he has a mission.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,310
Alright.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,390
We'll decide on this design
for our wedding invitation.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,430
- Sure.
- Alright.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I'll instruct the servants to get to it.

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,830
Go to bed early.

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,630
Young Master.

90
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,600
(What is Huaining planning?)

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,680
Huaining.

92
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,480
Wenyu.

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Where are you going?

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,600
The General's mansion.

95
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,480
I want to send Father and Wanzhen
an invitation to our wedding.

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll come with you.

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
Something this important

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
should be done together.

99
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,190
Sure, let's go together.

100
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,070
How has Miss Song
been treating you lately?

101
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,120
Ever since she found out
that I am Duan Xunrui,

102
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,240
she has been nicer to me.

103
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,040
You must have suffered
in the Song family over the years.

104
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,430
But I know you're kind

105
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,390
and feel indebted to General Song.

106
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,830
It's alright, Wenyu.

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
Don't worry.

108
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
From now onward,

109
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,630
you are officially my wife.

110
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,120
I will allow anyone

111
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,430
to bully you without any reason.

112
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry, Xunrui.

113
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,870
I'm still not quite used to this.

114
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,070
It's fine.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm willing to wait.

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
Thank you, Xunrui.

117
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,360
Does your head hurt again?

118
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,270
Let me take you to your room.

119
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,480
Huaining,

120
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,190
should I ask General Song to visit you?

121
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,510
No need.

122
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,040
Mr. Chu of the Feng City's
chamber of commerce

123
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:42,430
is hosting him at Songhe Restaurant.

124
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,630
He brought Wanzhen along.

125
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,240
Wenyu,

126
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
thank you for your care.

127
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,950
I'll take a rest.

128
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,920
Alright, you rest here.

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,070
Major General,

130
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
I discovered something peculiar.

131
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,630
Say it.

132
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Song Zhenyuan

133
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,720
has been short on money for a long time.

134
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,120
He is short on money?

135
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,240
Over the last few years,

136
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,320
he has been supporting his troops

137
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,150
by charging the local wealthy merchants
for protection.

138
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,120
Hello.

139
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,510
Xunchu, the president of Feng City's
chamber of commerce

140
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,600
is hosting Song Zhenyuan for dinner
at Songhe Restaurant.

141
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,910
You have to delay him for me.

142
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,270
Lin Wenyu,

143
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,720
don't you realize how dangerous this is?

144
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,440
Didn't I tell you not to meddle
in my business?

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,840
I think something is up with Huaining,
so I came to the Song mansion with him.

146
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,510
Since Song Zhenyuan isn't here,
this is the perfect chance.

147
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,510
You have to delay him.

148
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,320
Do you hear me?

149
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,510
Lin Wenyu, I'm warn...

150
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,150
Major General,
where are you going this late?

151
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,270
Get the car. I'm delaying Song Zhenyuan
at Songhe Restaurant.

152
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:09,960
