(Yaren Medical Hall)

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,790
Stop smashing.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,640
Over there.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Please stop smashing.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,920
Search thoroughly.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,960
Stop this.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,350
Search every nook and cranny.

19
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,510
Miss, what do we do?

20
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,430
All our medicine are ruined.

21
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,510
What has Yaren Medical Hall done

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,760
to offend you officials?

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,590
It's you?

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,870
Miss Lin Wenyue.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,020
(Search Warrant)

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,070
Our medicine came from legal sources.

27
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,400
Besides, we've informed Advisor Yang

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,590
and permitted to operate.

29
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,040
Advisor Yang.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,870
Who is this Advisor Yang?

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,310
Miss Lin,

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,400
let me remind you.

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,040
The Major General
has taken control over this street.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
He makes the rules on this street.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,230
Is this major general you mentioned

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,760
Duan Xunchu?

37
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,680
Withdraw.

38
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,200
Withdraw.

39
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,430
Step aside.

40
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,350
Miss,

41
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,590
is Duan Xunchu back?

42
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
I can't believe

43
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,280
he came back.

44
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,790
But you were

45
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,520
almost his sister-in-law.

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,360
His target is me.

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,310
I must go to the Major General's mansion.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,960
We'll go over there.

49
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,240
Why is the Major General alone?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,960
How about a toast?

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,240
Touch me again

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,080
and I'll consider feeding you to the dogs.

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,630
Alright, alright.

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
There were no women
in the military academy

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,750
but you're still acting the same
here in Feng City.

56
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,630
Are you hiding some disease?

57
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,280
Let go.

58
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,430
You looked up to me
at the military academy.

59
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,190
We're also sworn brothers,

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,710
are you going to hit me?

61
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,710
Cheers, then.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,870
Right.

63
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,280
My father said

64
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,150
he happened to have business in Yun City.

65
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,310
When he comes back,

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,630
he will give us a warm welcome.

67
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,870
Thank your father for me

68
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,400
for getting me this prime real estate.

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,240
My apologies, Miss Lin.

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,030
Major General
is hosting a banquet tonight.

71
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,120
He isn't available.

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,470
Could you please inform him again

73
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,470
that I won't take much of his time?

74
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,910
Of course.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,710
Cheers.

76
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Major General,
Miss Lin insists to see you.

77
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,960
Let her wait.

78
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, sir.

79
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,310
Miss Lin.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,720
You cannot enter, Miss Lin.

81
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,750
Miss Lin.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,070
Miss Lin.

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,830
Duan Xunchu.

84
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,920
Major General,

85
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,680
can you spare me a few minutes?

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,720
My apologies.

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,750
I'll take her away immediately.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,600
Let her go.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,070
Who let you in?

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,560
Get out.

91
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,680
Who are you?

92
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,360
How dare you barge into here?

93
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Who told you to touch her?

94
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,830
Get out.

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
Major General,

96
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,920
may I have two minutes of your time?

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,950
How could anyone bully a girl like this?

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,270
Look at you now.

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,750
What do you want?

100
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,036
Why did you send men
to wreck Yaren Medical Hall?

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Are you sure you don't know why?

102
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,120
Did you think everything is over?

103
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,120
Everything

104
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,160
has only just begun.

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,680
Xunchu,

106
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,800
you weren't like this in the past.

107
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,500
(Seven years ago)

108
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
Second Young Master, it's me.

109
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Adjutant Sun.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,480
Adjutant Sun?

111
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,390
Where have you been all these years?

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,950
After the incident with the Duan family,
there hasn't been any news from anyone.

113
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,830
But I got a hold of information

114
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,190
on the steward in Feng City recently.

115
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,600
It was from him

116
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,120
that I found out who almost murdered
the entire Duan family.

117
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,270
Who is it?

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,360
Who is it?

119
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,120
It was your sister-in-law and her father.

120
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,600
They leaked Commander Duan's whereabouts.

121
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,390
Second Young Master,
I know you find it hard to believe.

122
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,240
Take a look at this.

123
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,730
The police has closed the case.

124
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,680
Now the word is

125
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
you and your father

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
killed my entire family.

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I've been wondering who the mastermind is.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,870
(Real Culprits Of Duan Family Massacre Were
Adjutant Su Mu And Daughter Su Wenyue)

129
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,950
Why is he in such a hurry

130
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,270
to pin all the blame on you?

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
And how did my father's whereabouts

132
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,920
get leaked?

133
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,070
Xunchu,

134
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,090
have you thought about leaving
everything behind and get out of Feng City

135
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,800
to live a peaceful life?

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm the only one left of my family.

137
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,680
How could I leave?

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,510
If you don't get out now, you'll die.

139
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,390
Do you understand?

140
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,040
What do you mean?

141
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,870
I leaked the Commander's whereabouts.

142
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,510
Su Wenyue,

143
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,750
do you know what you're saying?

144
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,200
I never suspected you.

145
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,200
Did you know

146
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,727
that my entire family is dead
because their whereabouts were leaked?

147
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
Look out.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
Second Young Master, hurry.

149
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
The others are coming soon.

150
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,480
Why?

151
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,150
Didn't you say

152
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,240
you and your father did it?

153
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,550
Why did you save me?

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,150
Don't get ahead of yourself.

155
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,320
I just felt like I owed the Duan family.

156
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,440
I came to your family

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,630
for the wealth and fame

158
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,000
but look at the life I lead right now.

159
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,320
I barely get to eat and live in hiding.

160
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
I even had to change my name
because of you.

161
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,510
I've had enough.

162
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,240
Can you just go? Please.

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,320
Su Wenyue,

164
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,550
this is impossible.

165
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,240
You're lying.

166
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,510
Say that again.

167
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,630
How many times
do you want me to repeat it?

168
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,750
My father and I did it.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,120
Do you understand?

170
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,870
Get out.

171
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,030
I will never forgive you.

172
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,720
Someday,

173
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,840
I will make you pay for this.

174
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,870
You have no right
to talk about the past with me.

175
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
Why have you changed so much?

176
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,270
Isn't this

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,480
all thanks to you

178
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,080
and your father,

179
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,200
my dear sister-in-law?

180
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,510
I'll send someone to bring you clothes.

181
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,200
Change

182
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,270
and then get out.

183
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,440
Don't appear in front of me again.

184
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,270
Miss Lin,

185
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,910
if you want to live,

186
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,480
then it's better to go now.

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,614
What are you looking at?

188
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,670
Who was that woman?

189
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,030
You got really angry.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,030
She's a scheming and wicked woman.

191
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,390
I let her live

192
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,000
because the show
will only get interesting.

193
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,630
But you

194
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,790
seem to care about her.

195
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,870
Major General,

196
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,270
Miss Lin is still outside.

197
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,390
She hasn't left?

198
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,360
She said she will wait until you see her.

199
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,960
She is asking for this.

200
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,883
Are you taking revenge on me?

201
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,120
That's right.

202
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,270
What must I do so you will spare me?

203
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,720
Kneel

204
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,510
and beg for forgiveness
from my entire family.

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,870
Did you really believe

206
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,390
my father and I
will betray the Duan family?

207
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,150
Have you forgotten

208
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,720
what you told me years ago?

209
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,670
I chased you away

210
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,790
because it was dangerous for you to stay.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,750
I was promised
to your older brother as a child.

212
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,790
Your parents treated me
like their daughter.

213
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,630
How could I betray the Duan family?

214
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,200
You are still making excuses for yourself.

215
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I will say this even if you kill me.

216
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,360
My father and I
never betrayed the Commander.

217
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,670
You don't know fear until you see it.

218
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,550
I'll have you meet someone.

219
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,000
The steward, Mr. Lu?

220
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,790
Miss Su.

221
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Mr. Lu,

222
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,510
tell her everything

223
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,320
about that incident

224
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,910
from that year.

225
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,320
Miss Su,

226
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,120
you told Adjutant Su

227
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,630
about the Commander's return on the phone.

228
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,790
The Duan family got massacred
on the same night.

229
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,440
And I saw you

230
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,440
opened the door to the enemies.
