(I Don't Want Anything To Happen To You)

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,930
Please enjoy the meal, everyone.

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,105
These are Songhe Restaurant's
signature dishes.

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,350
- Enjoy, enjoy.
- Come, enjoy this.

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,870
This way.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,840
Xunchu,

17
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,040
why are you here?

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,430
Xunchu.

19
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,894
Major General Duan, you're here.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,740
I heard Mr. Chu is hosting Mr. Song

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,020
here today.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,523
As it happens, I got my hands
on a bottle of excellent red wine today.

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,350
So, I brought this here
for everyone to try.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,760
Xunchu,

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
you are too considerate.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,280
Come.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,790
Mr. Song, Mr. Chu, everyone,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,920
this toast is for you.

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,070
Good, good.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,590
- Cheers, Major General.
- Cheers.

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,350
This is good wine.

32
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,790
(Songhe Restaurant)

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,870
Thank you for the dinner, Mr. Chu.

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,480
And also for your wine, Xunchu.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Thanks to your protection over the years,

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,790
the chamber of commerce's new business

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,590
will depend on you.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,590
Oh, yes.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
This is a gift

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,960
from me for Miss Song.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
It's a necklace of the latest design.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,030
I hope Miss Song will like it.

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Good, good.

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
Mr. Chu, you're too kind.

45
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,710
Xunchu,

46
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,630
shall we go for an outing tomorrow?

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,910
We can invite Song...

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,150
No, I meant Xunrui.

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,560
Wanzhen.

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
This child is a handful.

51
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,470
Chu,

52
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,520
since you follow me,

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,240
that means you're under me now.

54
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,630
Don't disappoint me.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,630
Of course.

56
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,630
Uncle Song, it's getting late.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,190
Wanzhen, you should go home
with Uncle Song.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Wanzhen, be good.

59
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,960
Come home with me.

60
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
Fine.

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,190
Mr. Chu,

62
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,590
I shall treat you next time.

63
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,400
Sure.

64
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
- Goodbye.
- See you.

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,280
Watch your step.

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,310
What's going on?

67
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,590
Sir, the road is closed for repairs.
Please take another route.

68
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,430
Get down.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Lin Wenyu,
are you trying to get yourself killed?

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,120
Why are you here?

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,510
Should I sit by
while you bring me trouble?

72
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,240
Come out.

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
- I found...
- Useless fools.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,800
Daddy.

75
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,000
Investigate this now.

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Yes, Master.

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,800
What do we do?

78
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,360
Weren't you quite gutsy just now?

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,630
Why are you afraid now?

80
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,270
This is too high.

81
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,120
Stop talking.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
Jump down, I'll catch you.

83
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,160
What's wrong, Xunchu?

84
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,430
Had enough?

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll deal with you when we get back.

86
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,120
- Do you know how dangerous that was?
- Just take a look at these.

87
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,950
Song Zhenyuan had the police
watched you all these years.

88
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,240
Ten years ago,

89
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,750
they closed the case
by saying my father killed the Commander.

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,390
Looks like they've been
colluding all along.

91
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't want anything to happen to you.

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,000
If they had found you tonight,

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
you wouldn't make it back alive.

94
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm sorry

95
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,070
for acting on my own without telling you.

96
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,800
Song Zhenyuan must have

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,120
kept me alive all these years

98
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,510
to get hold of the Duan family vault's

99
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,310
location from me.

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
Song Huaining

101
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,560
must also be a spy he planted by my side.

102
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,510
Oh, look.

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
What are you doing?

104
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
You'll pay for this.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
Let me go. Let me go.

106
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
Director Wang.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,830
How does it feel

108
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,680
to be the chief of police

109
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,040
all these years?

110
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,480
Duan Xunchu,

111
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,240
how dare you kidnap me?

112
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,310
Let me go.

113
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,920
Let me go right now.

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,920
Ten years ago, you were in charge of
investigating the Duan family's murder.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,040
Tell me.

116
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,310
Was it really Su Mu

117
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,480
who leaked my father's whereabouts?

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,310
Director Wang,

119
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,870
I heard your son just came of age.

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,950
I'll tell you everything.
Please don't hurt my family.

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Su Mu didn't leak
Commander Duan's whereabouts.

122
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,390
It was Song Zhenyuan.

123
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,270
Song Zhenyuan?

124
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,510
Song Zhenyuan wanted to get
the Duan family's wealth and power.

125
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,240
When Commander Duan was in the army,

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,950
he had many guards to protect him.

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
Song Zhenyuan never
had a chance to kill him.

128
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,270
So he had been spying on Commander Duan.

129
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
On New Year's Eve,

130
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,120
Commander Duan came home

131
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,160
with just a few guards.

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,510
When Song Zhenyuan got the tip-off,

133
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,560
he immediately led his men
to murder the Duan family.

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,020
- He didn't think you would escape.
- Keep going.

135
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,720
When Song Zhenyuan knew you escaped,

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
he searched for you.

137
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,140
He wanted to know the location

138
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,700
of the Duan family vault from you.

139
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,630
Later, he found out
you joined the military academy,

140
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,240
so he sent his adopted son

141
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,950
to your side.

142
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,480
He never expected to fail

143
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,240
to locate the vault after so many years.

144
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,510
Su Mu found out

145
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,334
that Song Zhenyuan wanted
to kill Commander Duan.

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,320
He died protecting Commander Duan.

147
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,840
After the murder,

148
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,080
Song Zhenyuan wanted
to take over the Duan family's army,

149
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,870
so he bribed the police department
to close the case

150
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,320
and pin it all on Su Mu.

151
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,960
Duan Xunchu.

152
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,200
Major General Duan.

153
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,600
I told you everything.

154
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,840
Please spare me.

155
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,200
Spare me.

156
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Keep interrogating.

157
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,360
Make him spill every single detail.

158
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
Major General Duan.

159
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,360
Spare my son.

160
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,910
- Major General.
- Adjutant Sun.

161
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,552
What is the recent status
of Song Zhenyuan's military strength?

162
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,236
He has been guarding Feng City
with his troops for years.

163
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,270
He is famous.

164
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,980
Moreover, the troops under Commander Duan
are now mostly under his command.

165
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,540
Major General,
I'm afraid it is difficult

166
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,260
to gain their trust if you step up now.

167
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,910
And...

168
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,390
And, what?

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,020
And he has been colluding with the police.

170
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,060
We cannot act without proper planning.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,740
- What is the progress with Wang?
- We're still interrogating him.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,980
Keep torturing him

173
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,500
until he tells everything

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,460
about his collusion with Song Zhenyuan.

175
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,180
Yes, Major General.

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,360
I have something to tell you.

177
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,860
Huaining seems suspicious.

178
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,630
What did you find?

179
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,440
A few days ago,
he asked me about Adjutant Sun.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,720
I believe he is still

181
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,270
under Song Zhenyuan's influence.

182
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,960
That's the reason I found an excuse

183
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,550
to go to the Song mansion with him.

184
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,080
Young Master,

185
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,220
we tracked the Major General's men
to an abandoned temple.

186
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,580
