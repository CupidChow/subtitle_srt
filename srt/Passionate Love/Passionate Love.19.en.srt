(Who "Killed" The Real Memory?)

12
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,840
Open up the chests.

13
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,920
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,310
Young Master, it's all empty.

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,310
Empty?

16
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,040
Retreat.

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,510
Don't move.

18
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,680
Xunchu, Wenyu.

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,920
What is the meaning of this?

20
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,470
Xunrui,

21
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,190
are you looking for the Duan family vault?

22
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,590
What are you talking about?

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,800
I'm investigating something.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,870
Stop lying.

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,430
We know everything.

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,560
We found the truth

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
behind the Duan family's murder.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,680
This was all Song Zhenyuan's plan.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,870
Huaining,

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,400
it's not too late to turn back now.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,190
So, you've been setting me up all along

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,190
to fall for this trap.

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,470
I've moved

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,910
everything in the vault away.

35
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,280
I don't know

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
what Song Zhenyuan told you
to make you trust him this much.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,000
Xunrui,

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,280
we are real brothers.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
He lied to you.

40
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,360
What proof do you have

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
that my godfather is using me?

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,840
Tell me.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,680
Xunrui, calm down.

44
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll explain everything to you.

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,280
Fine.

46
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,960
Fine.

47
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,520
Huaining.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,080
Huaining, what's wrong?

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,870
Are you alright?

50
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,910
Let her go.

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,750
If you don't want her dead,

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
put down your gun.

53
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,080
Put it down.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
All of you, put your guns down.

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,150
All of you, get out.

56
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,560
Out.

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,030
Huaining,

58
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,310
don't listen to Song Zhenyuan.

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,800
He is your enemy.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,590
Shut up.

61
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Huaining,

62
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,150
are your headaches recurring?

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,280
Xunrui,

64
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,120
you won't hurt Wenyu.

65
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,120
Do you know?

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,750
The Duan family

67
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,750
is my real enemy.

68
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,000
I was never Duan Xunrui.

69
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,830
Song Zhenyuan planned everything all along

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,190
so I can get close to you.

71
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,680
During these years,

72
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,630
I had countless chance to kill you.

73
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,240
If he didn't want me to find the vault,

74
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,560
I would've already killed you.

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,830
Xunrui, he lied to you.

76
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,000
I have proof.

77
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,720
I have proof.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,000
What proof do you have?

79
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,830
Adjutant Sun.

80
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,160
Director Wang?

81
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,600
It's true, Young Master.

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
They were telling the truth.

83
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,390
You really are Duan Xunrui.

84
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,360
After the explosion at the Duan mansion,

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
you lost your memories.

86
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,190
Song Zhenyuan thought you
know secrets about the vault,

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,430
so he adopted you.

88
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,920
When you kept investigating it,

89
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
you came up with nothing.

90
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,160
So, he had to make you
get close to Duan Xunchu.

91
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,190
In order to make you do it willingly,

92
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,750
he made up a story

93
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,160
to make you believe

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,680
that your parents were killed
by the Duan family.

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,000
Impossible.

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Impossible.

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
You're lying.

98
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,630
He's lying, right?

99
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,190
No.

100
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,390
Impossible.

101
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,270
Impossible.

102
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,190
Impossible.

103
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,510
Impossible.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
Thank you, Mother.

105
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,620
(Memorial Tablet of Duan Yuan
and Wife)

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,630
Madam, give me a bowl of wontons.

107
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,160
Sure.

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,800
Thanks, madam.

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,270
No problem.

110
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,000
Wenyue, take Xunchu and run.

111
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,830
Xunrui.

112
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,920
Run.

113
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,950
Huaining.

114
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
Xunrui.

115
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,430
Xunrui.

116
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,120
Huaining.

117
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,160
Huaining?

118
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,830
Xunrui.

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Xunrui?

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,360
Xunrui.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,630
Xunrui?

122
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,560
Xunrui.

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,680
Xunrui,

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,750
how do you feel?

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,630
Xunrui?

126
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,430
Duan Xunchu,

127
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,240
who are you calling?

128
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,600
You are my brother, Xunrui.

129
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,510
Director Wang's words,

130
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,120
the jade pendant,

131
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
and the birthmark on your back,

132
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,310
these are all proof.

133
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,830
Why wouldn't you admit it?

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,830
Huaining.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,360
My father is Song Zhenyuan.

136
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
I want to go home.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,870
I am Song Huaining.

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,680
Father.

139
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,310
I almost found the Duan family vault

140
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,270
but Duan Xunchu tricked me.

141
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,390
Huaining,

142
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,800
I've heard about it.

143
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,560
You got caught by Duan Xunchu

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
at the temple the day before yesterday.

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,920
There was also a rumor

146
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,830
that you are...

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,160
To trick me,

148
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,720
Duan Xunchu said I really am
his long-lost brother

149
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,950
but Duan Xunrui is dead.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
He actually believed my act.

151
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,120
You don't suspect it?

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,150
You are my father.

153
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,320
Without you,

154
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,390
I wouldn't have the life I have now.

155
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,150
How could rumors out there

156
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,030
