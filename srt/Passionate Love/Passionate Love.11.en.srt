(Lie Down, Don't Move)

12
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,350
Pingchun,

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,670
get me a few workers.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,670
We're going to Yaren Medical Hall.

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,150
- Miss, what happened?
- Go away.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,640
My dear girl,

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,840
what happened to you?

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
Daddy,

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,470
Duan Xunchu bullied me.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,320
Alright, alright.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,790
Look at how messy you are.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,880
What did he do to you?

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,480
I wanted to teach Lin Wenyu a lesson.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,150
In the end,

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,400
he kidnapped me because of this matter.

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,590
I will make her pay

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,790
with her life.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,040
Outrageous.

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,680
Dad.

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,000
I didn't imagine
you had something to do with this.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,480
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused?

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,710
That is a life.

33
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,510
How could you be so childish?

34
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,640
Dad.

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840
I was fine with Duan Xunchu
and Song Huaining's scolding.

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,000
Am I even your daughter?

37
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,350
Wanzhen.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Director Wang,

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,590
what has Duan Xunchu been doing lately?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,840
General Song,

41
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,230
the Major General

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,430
recruited a group of bandits
just the other day.

43
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,480
He is probably expanding his army.

44
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,950
Bandits?

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,430
They were Su Mu's subordinates.

46
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,040
After Su Mu's death,

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,560
these men escaped into the mountains.

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,150
I have been sending men to pursue them

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,640
but I can't believe Duan Xunchu
got ahead of me.

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,560
Wanzhen made a mistake this time.

51
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,150
Duan Xunchu had the nerve
to recruit them in private.

52
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,400
It seems

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,680
his intention is obvious.

54
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,520
Go back to the police station.

55
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,750
Alright.

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,280
I'll be on my way now.

57
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,360
Father.

58
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,030
Sit.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,680
How is the investigation
into the vault going?

60
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,190
I'm keeping my eye on it

61
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,310
but Duan Xunchu

62
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,870
never reveal a single clue
about the vault.

63
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,200
That's why there hasn't been any progress.

64
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,000
The money in the vault

65
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,750
was all made by me

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,630
but Commander Duan kept it all.

67
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,560
It's time to take back what was mine.

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,360
Huaining,

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
you must keep a close eye on this.

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,750
Duan Xunchu may be extremely cunning

71
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,400
but there will be times
when he makes mistakes.

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,470
Don't worry, Father.

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,590
Huaining,

74
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,360
how many years has it been
since you joined the Song family?

75
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,630
Seven years.

76
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,710
Father,

77
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,750
if you hadn't adopted me seven years ago,

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
I would have died.

79
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,150
Good boy.

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Don't forget

81
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,910
that you became an orphan

82
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,710
because the Duan family
killed your family.

83
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,470
This side effect from your brain injury

84
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,520
was also their doing.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,000
You must never forget

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,360
this pain all your life.

87
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,590
Father,

88
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,430
I will never forget to take revenge
on the Duan family.

89
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,960
You've also just heard it.

90
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,910
Duan Xunchu recruited the bandits.

91
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,710
His power is growing stronger now.

92
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,800
Huaining,

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
keep your eye on him.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,390
Find the vault as soon as possible.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
When you do,

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,160
I will personally avenge your family.

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
Thank you, Father.

98
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,310
I will make Duan Xunchu suffer

99
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,720
what I went through.

100
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,310
Go now.

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,630
General,

102
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
do you really trust Song Huaining?

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,270
That's the reason

104
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,270
I have you spy on him all these years.

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,430
Right, Chen Zhi.

106
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
Just in case,

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,430
go deal with that person for me.

108
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,600
Yes, Master.

109
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,120
I will go now.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,270
What are you doing?

111
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,510
I want a drink.

112
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,630
Sit there, don't move.

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,270
Thank you.

114
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,630
You don't have to stay here all the time.

115
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,510
You can leave if you have work.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,600
If I go,

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
are you going to make trouble again?

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,270
Wenyu,

119
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,430
I'm here to visit...

120
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,600
Xunchu is here too.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,680
Huaining.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't move.

123
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,120
I haven't seen you in days.

124
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,800
I only got know that you're hospitalized

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,390
after I called Yaren Medical Hall.

126
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,680
How could you do something
as dangerous as delivering medicine?

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,120
I am Yaren Medical Hall's owner.

128
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,040
Of course, I have to personally do it.

129
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,070
I'm glad Xunchu saved you.

130
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,000
It was a coincidence.

131
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,000
She got lucky.

132
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,360
You two look like

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
you've known each other for years.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
She is supposed to treat me.

135
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,430
Treat you?

136
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,870
What's wrong?

137
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,430
Do you remember

138
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,190
that I often cough up blood?

139
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,000
A while ago,

140
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,070
I found out that someone had been
slowly poisoning me.

141
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,120
Poison?

142
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,480
Who did it?

143
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,560
I haven't gotten any clues yet.

144
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,920
Xunchu,

145
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,310
you had better be careful.

146
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,600
You just returned to Feng City.

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,950
Some people who are not satisfied with you
will act behind your back.

148
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,270
Give me any information you can get,

149
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,870
I'll catch the culprit.

150
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,360
Wenyu,

151
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,190
I have something to do, so I'll go now.

152
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,240
Take a good rest.

153
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,870
Thank you for taking the time to visit me.

154
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,600
Xunchu,

155
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
she is ill.

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,240
Don't be so mean to her all the time.

157
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,680
You are getting along very well

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
with Song Huaining.

159
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,830
I'm his doctor and he is

160
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,950
just my patient.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,310
Just your patient?

162
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,040
You two seem to be very intimate.

163
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,160
What did he call you?

164
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,830
He called you Wenyu.

165
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,270
It was simply a form of address.

166
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,750
I told you before

167
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,560
to stay away from Song Huaining.

168
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
You...

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,480
Who is it?

170
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,950
It's me.

171
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,030
Miss Lin,

172
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,360
your recovery went well.

173
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,320
Be sure to take more rest.

174
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,200
Thank you.

175
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,240
Xunchu.

176
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,360
Let's go.

177
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,750
I'll take you to see the steward, Mr. Lu.

178
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,200
Now that He Sheng'an
proved your father's innocence,

179
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,790
that means he lied.

180
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,510
We must find out who is behind this.

181
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,320
Let's go.

182
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,790
He's dead.

183
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,510
We're too late.

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,270
The trail went cold again.

185
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Just who

186
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
is always one step ahead of me?

187
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,320
Major General.

188
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,240
Major General.

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,670
I have the latest update.

190
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,480
What update?

191
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,480
Commander Duan had a vault
before he passed

192
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,600
but no one knows its location.

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
A vault?

194
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,870
Spread the word

195
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,200
that I've found the Duan family vault.

196
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,750
Yes, sir.

197
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,750
I'll send you to Yaren Medical Hall.

198
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
I'll come find you later.

199
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,000
Alright.

200
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,390
Wenyu.

201
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,270
Huaining, what brings you here?

202
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,750
I heard you got discharged yesterday.

203
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,661
I was worried you'd lose
your appetite at the hospital,

204
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,360
so I wanted to treat you
to a nutritious meal.

205
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Then, the nurse told me
you got discharged.

206
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,270
You're too considerate.

207
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,000
Come.

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,000
We can still go now.

209
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,200
What's wrong?

210
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,150
Are you busy?

211
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,480
(I told you before)

212
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
(to stay away from Song Huaining.)

213
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,080
No, I don't.

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,910
Let's go.

215
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Wenyu.

216
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
Major General.

217
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,360
Bitao,

218
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
where is Wenyu?

219
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,870
She is having dinner with a friend.

220
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:54,720
A friend?

221
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,390
Who is it?

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,030
Well...

223
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,750
Who is it?

224
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,840
I...

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,840
It's Song Huaining
from the General's mansion.

226
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,660
(Songhe Restaurant)

227
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,000
You treated me to wontons the last time.

228
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,240
This meal is on me.

229
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,360
The taste was good, wasn't it?

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,870
The owner poached the chef

231
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
from Shanghai with a high salary.

232
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,910
The taste was good indeed.

233
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,270
Thank you, Huaining.

234
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,200
Let's go. I'll send you home.

235
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,550
Watch out.

236
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,600
I'll do it myself.

237
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,150
Aren't we friends?

238
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,480
No need to be so courteous.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Adjutant Sun.

240
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,630
Adjutant Sun,
what are you doing here?

241
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,003
Young Master Huaining, the poison
in the Major General flared up again.

242
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,440
He asked me to get Miss Lin.

243
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,270
Miss Lin,

244
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,630
please come with me.

245
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,320
The poison flared up again?

246
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,910
Yes.
