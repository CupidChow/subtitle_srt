we still have one final thing to do.

You know I like to look pretty.

After so many years in Feng City,

55
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,240
I failed to recognize you

56
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,390
to be Su Wenyue.

57
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,950
I had a dream last night.

58
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,630
In it, my parents said,

59
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,560
"Wenyue,

60
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,720
you shouldn't live

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,600
in such a dark and dank place.

62
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,680
You are an adult now.

63
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,950
You should live where warmth
and light shines on you."

64
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,800
Unfortunately,

65
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,310
this warmth and light

66
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,600
are something they cannot enjoy with me.

67
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,430
This dream

68
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
couldn't come at a better time.

69
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,190
Thanks to you,

70
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,270
we lived

71
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,040
hid and lived helplessly for ten years.

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,310
It's finally time to end this.

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:50,830
Song Zhenyuan,

74
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
I took a long time to pick this gift.

75
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,600
Here,

76
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,950
this is for you.

77
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,830
How considerate of you, Major General.

78
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,390
I want to thank you

79
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,950
for sending Wanzhen's body home.

(Memorial Tablet of Song Wanzhen)
How does it feel to lose your family?

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Perhaps this is karma,

82
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,120
a retribution.

83
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,720
I only have one daughter.

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,800
She should bathe in the light.

85
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,430
But she chose to like you.

86
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,510
She chose

87
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,140
(Memorial Tablet of Beloved Daughter,
Song Wanzhen)

88
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,390
to block my shot.

89
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,190
It's retribution.

90
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,190
A retribution.

91
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,120
Why are you acting all merciful?

92
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,430
Do you deserve it?

93
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,630
I swore to my parents

94
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,403
that I will make you kneel
in front of the Duan family ancestral hall

95
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,750
and beg for forgiveness.

96
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,000
I won't let you die that easily.

97
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,750
I will tear you off piece by piece

98
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,950
as sacrifice to my parents' spirits.

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,430
Major General,

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,630
I no longer have

101
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,560
anything to negotiate with.

102
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,600
A dying man speaks true.

103
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,550
Consider this as my return gift.

104
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,000
In here are letters

105
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,440
between me and the Japanese
over the years.

106
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,750
Everything they've done
are recorded in there.

107
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,480
After you take these,

108
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,390
they will temporarily
cease their activities.

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,510
But I'll warn you.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,960
The Japanese will not let this matter go.

111
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,790
They are like a swarm of ants.

112
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,480
You cannot stop them.

113
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,600
The truth is,

114
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,080
I am just another ant.

115
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,270
Stop trying to win our sympathy.

116
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,510
I won't bother.

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,030
There is no turning back for me

118
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,150
since the day I killed your family.

119
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,750
All my life, I pursued power and wealth.

120
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,840
I've committed too many sins.

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
It's time I pay for them.

122
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,440
Wanzhen,

123
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,270
don't be scared.

124
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,390
I'm coming now.

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,030

would've turn into?

130
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,910
I heard the chamber of commerce

131
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,240
voted to have Yaren Medical Hall's
Miss Lin as its president.

132

The city's repairs

133
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,080
were donated by Major General Duan
and Miss Lin.

134
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
They're so kind.

135
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,150
Oh, right.

136
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,030
Wasn't Miss Lin the Major General Duan's
sister-in-law?

are a couple.
