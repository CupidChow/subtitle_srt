(Just Like When We Were Kids)

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,000
Brothers, get into our car.

13
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,030
Take it slowly.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,110
Watch your step.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,560
This way, come on.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,280
Lin Wenyu,

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,840
you're really something.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,840
You would rush into
a bandit's hideout on your own.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,790
My plan was to lure Uncle He out.

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,240
I know he is a good person.

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,280
They used to be soldiers.

22
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,070
If I hadn't made it in time,

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,560
you could've gotten killed.

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,510
Thank you, Xunchu.

25
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
If you want to thank me,

26
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,710
then you had better know your place.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,710
I didn't expect you

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,680
to allow Uncle He
and the rest back into the army.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,200
I recruited them

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,350
to give these former soldiers

31
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,760
a place to stay

32
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,150
and also to protect the citizens.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,480
Allowing them to continue as bandits

34
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,640
does pose

35
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,280
a danger to the safety

36
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,150
of the local citizens.

37
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,000
That was wise of you.

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
I'll send someone

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,000
to look into your father's case.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,790
Did you get hurt?

42
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,950
I'm fine, it's just a scratch.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,560
We have to go to the hospital.

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,150

Song Zhenyuan and my father
were lifelong friends

112
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,800
and saved my father's life
on the battlefield countless times.

When the incident happened,

114
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,920
Song Zhenyuan rushed to rescue my father.

115
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,120

Could the Song family
really have nothing to do with this?

118
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,310
At this point, we have no evidence
to prove that they did it.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,720
I will investigate

120
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,190

126
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,830
The one who leaked Miss Lin's trip
to the bandits is...

127
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,040
Who is it?

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,430
It was Song Zhenyuan's daughter,

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Song Wanzhen.

130
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,720

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,750

Why are you here?

136
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,040
Did you tell the bandits

137
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,600
about Lin Wenyu's trip?

138
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,040
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,240
I've only just heard
that the caravan

140
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,830

141

I had nothing to do with it.

142
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070

143
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,070
you deny it.

144
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,600
Duan Xunchu,

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,950

146
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,390
Don't you know

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,070
what the consequences will be

148
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000

because of that woman?

149
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,920
Bring him in.

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,720

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Pingchun brought Miss Song
to meet me that day.

160
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,240
She gave me two silver yuan
to deliver a letter to the bandits.

161
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,160
She told me

162
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,040
Miss Lin will bring valuable medicine

163
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,270
to Yun City through Mount Qingfeng.

164
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,480
She wants them

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,190
to kidnap Miss Lin

166
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,189
and seize the medicine.

167
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,390
No, I didn't.

168
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,190
It's slander.

169
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
It was you.

170
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,190
Major General, Major General.

171
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,310

Don't kill me.

174
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,120
Don't kill me.

175
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,240
Be quiet.

176
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,920
Get out.

Miss Song,

178
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,440
you had better tell the truth.

180
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,320
Major General.

181
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Major General, I did it.

182
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,510
Miss Song had nothing to do with this.

183
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,840
She had no clue at all.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,000

Major General.

186
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,750
Is that so?

187
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,840
Then I'll kill you too.

Miss.

191
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,600
I'll talk, I'll talk.

192
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,790
I'll talk, I'll talk.

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,870
I'll talk.

194
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,150
I'll talk.

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,960
I heard Miss Lin

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,910
is one of the best businesswomen
in the city

197
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,240
with a lot of courage.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I just wanted to test her courage.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,440
I didn't mean to hurt her.

200
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,790
Xunchu.

201
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
I just...

202
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,910
I just wanted to pull a prank on her.

203
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,790
I didn't mean to get her killed.

204
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,720
Xunchu.

205
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,960
And,

206
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,030
I did this

207
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,790
for you.

208
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,510
A prank?

209
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,320
Was it fun?

210
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm warning you.

211
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,870
Don't disturb Lin Wenyu.

212
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,000
She is still useful to me.

213
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,550
For the sake of our years of friendship,

214
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,440
I will let you go this time.

215
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,720
If you dare stir up trouble again

216
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,030
and ruin my plans,

217
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,390
I won't let you off.

218
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,240
Miss.

219
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,440
Miss.

220
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,670
Miss.

221
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,440
Miss.

222
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,750
Xunchu threatened me over that woman.

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I won't let her off for this.

224
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,550
Lin Wenyu,

225
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,600
