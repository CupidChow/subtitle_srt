(Stay By My Side And Beg For Forgiveness)

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,750
What did you mean, Lin Wenyu?

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,560
How dare you be rude to me.

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,350
I meant whatever Miss Song meant.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,150
Lin Wenyu.

16
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:54,320
I...

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,840
What are you two doing?

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,520
Xunchu,

19
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,320
I came to find you to go horse-riding.

20
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,880
I don't know why I offended Miss Lin.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,280
Adjutant Sun.

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,680
Major General.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,070
Send Miss Song home.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,070
Xunchu.

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,680
I will deal with Lin Wenyu myself.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,950
Go home.

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,230
Miss Song,

28
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,120
this way.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,480
You would hit Song Zhenyuan's
precious daughter.

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,640
I've underestimated you.

31
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,870
She hit me first.

32
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,790
Lin Wenyu,

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,150
have you forgotten who you are?

34
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,230
What can you do if she hits you?

35
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,430
If there is nothing else,

36
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,510
I'm leaving.

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
You didn't get close to Song Huaining

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,640
just to find clues, did you?

39
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,510
What else do you think?

40
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,480
I like him?

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,230
I got close to him

42
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,350
to be their daughter-in-law?

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,000
Lin Wenyu, you're asking for this.

44
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,400
Let go.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Let go.

46
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm giving you two choices.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
Dig up your father's tombstone.

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,710
Hold it

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,630
and repent in front of
the Duan family grave.

50
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,400
Two,

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,240
I send you to the dance club as an escort.

52
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,840
Pick one.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,150
I choose death.

54
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,030
You want to die, but I'll keep you alive.

55
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,310
I'll make your life a living hell.

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,430
I want you and your father
beg my family for forgiveness.

57
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,240
Enough.

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,680
Do you think this is enough?

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,710
Your family is full of

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,910
greedy sycophants.

61
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,280
First, your father killed my family.

62
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,710
Now, you try to kill others' heart.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,400
What can your family do

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
to repay my family?

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,870
You think you have suffered
in these last few years.

66
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,630
Do you know how I lived through them?

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,560
Did you think I had it easy?

68
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,560
What's happening again?

69
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
What is going on with your body?

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,680
If you want to take revenge on me,
you had better be alive to do it.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
Isn't my death

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,120
just what you want?

73
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,030
Who is going to prove my innocence
if you died?

74
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,590
Duan Xunchu.

75
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,430
Duan Xunchu.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Why are you coughing again?

77
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,710
Major General, your medicine is ready.

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Would you like to take it while it's hot?

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,280
Wait.

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,590
Let me check this medicine.

81
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,910
Lin Wenyu,

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,910
what tricks are you up to?

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,430
Something is wrong with your medicine.
Where are the medicine dregs?

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,240
These are right.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,430
These ingredients

86
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,830
are good for hemostasis and healing

87
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,830
but cancel each other out
when mixed together.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,214
Taking them over a long period of time
is like being slowly poisoned.

89
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,270
When did you start taking this medicine?

90
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
After I came back to Feng City.

91
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,360
Why would this person

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,310
slowly poison you

93
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,630
instead of just killing you?

94
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,190
Maybe I have something he wants.

95
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,480
You have to think.

96
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,950
Who gained the most

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
after the Duan family incident?

98
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,160
Stay out of this.

99
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,390
I've sent men to repair the old mansion.

100
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,800
Since you like

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,870
to think of yourself
as a widow of the Duan family,

102
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,510
then move in to live with me.

103
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,665
You want me to move into the Duan mansion?

104
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,120
This will make it easy for you

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,510
to repent in front of
the ancestral hall every day.

106
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,160
I don't need to repent.

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,390
I will prove my innocence.

108
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,430
You don't need to?

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,720
Then, do you think

110
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,720
your malicious father needs to?

111
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,070
After years of living together,

112
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,600
don't you have a hint of trust in me?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,800
How dare you talk about trust with me?

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,240
Ask yourself

115
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,160
if you deserve

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,040
my trust.

117
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,870
I don't deserve it.

118
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,360
Let's just part ways peacefully.

119
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,240
If this goes on, I'd feel bad
and you'd be upset.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,310
So what if I'm upset?

121
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,680
If you have to die,

122
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,160
you will die in my hands.

123
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,830
When it's ready, I hope you will

124
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,310
move into the mansion yourself.

125
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,600
If I have to pick you up,

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,000
you'll know the consequences.

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,950
Did you find them?

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,310
No.

129
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,190
Where are they hiding?

130
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,480
I can't find them.

131
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I don't see them here either.

132
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
Those two brats ran too fast.

133
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,270
We didn't find a clue about the vault.

134
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,240
Come, let's check over there.

135
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,040
Let's go.

136
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,070
When Lin Wenyu and I
were being hunted down,

137
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,870
I think someone mentioned about a vault.

138
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,870
Adjutant Sun,

139
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,870
do you know anything
about the Duan family vault?

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
The Commander served for many years.
He obviously accumulated a lot of money.

141
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,720
I really don't know

142
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,830
where he kept them.

143
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Major General,

144
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,800
are you suspecting...

145
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,040
Did my family almost get wiped out

146
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,070
because of this vault?

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Major General,

148
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,950
I'll look into this vault.

149
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,870
What about Song Zhenyuan?

150
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,800
I'll look into it myself.

151
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,720
Don't worry.

152
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,040
Everyone who poisoned him
has been dealt with.

153
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,040
Duan Xunchu will find nothing.

154
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,560
Any updates on the Duan family vault?

155
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,000
There is still no clue.

156
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,240
Find it.

157
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Find it, then kill him.

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,680
Yes, sir.

159
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:11,830
Miss,

160
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,480
you have a dinner to attend this evening.

161
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,870
How about I dress you up?

162
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,360
Dinner?

163
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,510
Just a group of people
pretending to be civil.

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
It's so boring.

165
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,310
I wonder what is Xunchu doing

166
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,800
right now.

167
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,160
Miss,

168
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,680
the Major General is busy with his duties.

169
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,950
If he doesn't visit you,

170
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,240
you can visit him.

171
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,840
You can invite him to the dinner.

172
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,790
That way, you won't be bored.

173
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,840
The last time I visit him,

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,390
that Lin Wenyu was there.

175
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,150
Miss,

176
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,910
that woman is just a wretched servant.

177
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,630
She is no match for you.

178
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,150
The Major General is here.

179
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
Xunchu?

180
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,120
Xunchu,

181
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,030
why are you here?

182
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
Wanzhen,

183
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,000
I made you upset the last time.

184
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,270
So, I'm here to apologize.

185
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,750
A small gift.

186
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,320
I hope you'll like it.

187
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
I like any present

188
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,550
you give me.

189
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,390
Xunchu,

190
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,670
Daddy is hosting a dinner at home tonight.

191
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,080
Can you stay and keep me company?

192
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm sure he will be delighted to see you.

193
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,360
Of course.

194
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,390
I'm so happy.

195
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,840
General Song,

196
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,360
thank you for the invitation.

197
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,270
You're too polite.

198
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,720
Mr. Chu, I'm honored have you

199
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,600
and everyone grace my home.

200
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,480
Daddy,

201
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,960
look who I brought.

202
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,510
Xunchu is here.

203
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,150
Uncle Song.

204
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm here to visit you.

205
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,360
Good, good.

206
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,000
I asked my men to bring you

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,270
a crate of red wine from overseas.

208
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Uncle Song,

209
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,870
do try them.

210
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,960
Excellent.

211
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,150
Xunchu, you're very considerate.

212
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,440
It's just a gift.

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,000
Good.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,600
Pingchun,

215
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,200
take the wine to the back.

216
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,870
Yes, Master.

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,960
Come with me.

218
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,550
It's great that everyone
happens to be here today.

219
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,510
Actually,

220
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,670
I've long known about Wanzhen's intention.

221
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,030
I have a proposal.

222
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,030
Xunchu,

223
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,440
what do you think

224
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,390
if I betroth Wanzhen to you?

225
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,670
Daddy, what are you saying?

226
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,440
(Good, good.)

227
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,270
Xunchu,

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
if you become my son-in-law,

229
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,840
then I would have done right by Duan.

230
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,670
Uncle Song,

231
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,360
Wanzhen and I haven't met in years.

232
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,670
I believe this proposal came a bit sudden.

233
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,960
It might frighten her.

234
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,720
We could get to know each other better.

235
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,360
Good, good.

236
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,600
You youngsters know what to do.

237
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,000
But

238
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,840
don't disappoint me.

239
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,670
Come, let's get started.

240
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,840
Everyone, please take your seat.

241
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,870
Take a seat.

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,910
Go on.

243
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,790
- Go on.
- Daddy, sit down.

244
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,150
Look at you.

245
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,150
What did you mean?

246
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,910
Go on, take a seat.

247
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,120
Huaining, what's wrong?

248
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,080
Huaining.

249
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,390
Pingchun.

250
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,120
Yes, Master.

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,150
Call Yaren Medical Hall

252
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,080
and ask Miss Lin to come here.

253
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,440
Hurry.

254
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,030
Yes, Master.

255
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,150
Mr. Song,

256
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,750
how do you feel now?

257
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,000
Much better.

258
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,360
You helped me again.

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
The doctors we had

260
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,440
couldn't do anything for me.

261
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,030
Only you were able to bring me relief.

262
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,750
A healer is like a parent.

263
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
When I see you feel better,

264
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,030
I'd feel better too.

265
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,150
The attacks have been recurring lately

266
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,550
and unbearable.

267
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,960
Miss Lin,

268
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,270
would you be willing
to be my family doctor?

269
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,150
Of course,

270
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,440
the pay

271
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,390
is sure to satisfy you.

272
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,870
I'll go check on the medicine.

273
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,390
(Only this room is locked
in this entire mansion.)

274
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,080
(Looks like this is
the confidential office.)

275
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,600
Have you cleaned the rooms
that need cleaning?

276
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,480
Mr. Song, it's getting late.

277
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm leaving now.

278
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,120
Yes.

279
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,510
Miss Lin, let me send you home.

280
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,030
You are very skilled, Miss Lin.

281
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,910
You won't even let
this sickly man escape you.

282
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,840
Wanzhen,

283
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:43,720
be polite.

284
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,030
What gives you the right to nag me?

285
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,200
Miss Song,

286
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,790
you aren't skilled in this, are you?

287
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
You always throw yourself at others.

288
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,600
Lin Wenyu.

289
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,440
Enough.

290
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,550
I'll send you home.

291
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,720
It's on the way.

292
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,030
Xunchu,

293
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,630
didn't you hear what she just said?

294
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,840
Aren't you going to scold her?

295
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,870
I won't bother the Major General.

296
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,960
I can walk home.

297
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,550
What's this?

298
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,240
Do you want Song Huaining
to send you back?

299
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,270
Xunchu,

300
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,200
don't be like this.

301
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,550
I'm warning you.

302
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,120
Get in the car.

303
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,790
Mr. Song, I'm leaving now.

304
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Go get yourself cured.

305
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,080
Don't take anyone into the house.

306
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,720
My dear sister,

307
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,030
go to bed early.

308
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,150
Next time,

309
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,720
don't call me your sister.

310
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,910
After all, you aren't my real brother.

311
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,240
Every time you call me your sister,

312
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,320
I feel sick.
