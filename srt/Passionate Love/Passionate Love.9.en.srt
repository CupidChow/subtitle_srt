(What A Reckless Woman)

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,710
Button up for me.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,520
Don't you have hands?

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

15
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,790
Why are you nervous?

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,150
Done.

17
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,920
Who is it?

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,680
Major General,

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,840
it's me.

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,920
Come in.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,150
Miss Lin.

22
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,070
That is....

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,840
Change into this.

24
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,310
Pretend to be my attendant.

25
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,280
Uncle Song,

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,683
I'm terribly sorry about today.

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,590
Next time,

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,230
I'll bring a few bottles
of finer red wine.

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,310
It doesn't matter.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,790
Don't take it to heart.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,230
Chen Zhi, send our guests.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes, Master.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,310
I want to say thank you.

34
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,750
If it weren't for you,

35
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,710
I probably couldn't have escaped.

36
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,710
No need to thank me.

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,150
Next time, think before you act,

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,360
so you don't ruin my plans.

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,430
Did you find any clue on the vault?

40
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,590
Not yet.

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,680
But I found something else.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
After the Commander's death,

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,590
a group of soldiers under Su Mu
turned into bandits.

44
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,840
Are you saying

45
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,430
that we may find the truth

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,750
if we catch them?

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,870
They usually hide in the mountains.

48
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,870
I'm afraid it's hard to catch them.

49
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,360
I have an idea.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,120
Lin Wenyu,

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,150
have I been treating you too well

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,120
that you've forgotten your status?

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm sorry,

54
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,800
I didn't mean to eavesdrop

55
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,710
but I heard you talked
about catching bandits.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,590
I can help you.

57
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,280
Shut up.

58
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,430
I'm warning you.

59
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,870
Don't come meddling into my business.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,150
Get out.

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,190
Major General,

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,430
I believe we could give her a chance.

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Say no more.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,870
I don't need

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,910
to rely on a woman to manage my things.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Gather the men.

67
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,030
Let's see how cunning these bandits are.

68
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,470
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,060
- Slowly.
- Oh, right.

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,910
Is Miss Wenyu leaving in two days?

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,800
I think so.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
I heard the shopkeeper said

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,560
this batch

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,072
of extremely precious medicine
are to be sent

75
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,000
to Yun City this time.

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,840
Yun City?

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,630
I heard there is a bandit's hideout

78
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,470
on the road to Yun City.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Bandits?

80
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:15,910
Yes.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,560
A lot of caravans never returned.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
A bandit's hideout?

83
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,310
Pingchun,

84
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,680
do you agree

85
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,750
that if I were to make her suffer,

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
it's best to ruin her reputation?

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,430
Will Xunchu

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,720
still cherish her as much then?

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,830
Yes, Miss.

90
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,560
I will get it done.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
Lin Wenyu,

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,120
I will make you suffer this time.

93
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,390
Major General,

94
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,000
I just got word.

95
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,040
Miss Lin personally led a group of people
to catch the bandits.

96
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,600
What a reckless woman.

97
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,070
Move out now.

98
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,190
Xunchu,

99
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,070
where are you going?

100
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,000
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,040
My father is hosting important figures
in the business world today.

102
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,950
He wants to invite you to the banquet.

103
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,390
Please tell Uncle Song

104
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,040
that I have matters to attend to today.

105
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,390
I will play host another day.

106
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,000
Xunchu.

107
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,040
Hurry up.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,720
Go.

109
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,920
Hurry up.

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,920
The famous Miss Lin of Feng City

111
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,160
personally deliver the goods.

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Looks like there is more to these goods.

113
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,190
Who are you?

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
Gun for a stem, bullet for a blossom.

115
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,390
We have no name, no home.

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,310
If you haven't heard of Fort Qingfeng,

117
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,040
why cross Mount Qingfeng?

118
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,430
Since I want to cross the mountain,

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
what makes you think
I'd come unprepared?

120
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,560
Good.

121
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,510
Let's see what treasures

122
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,430
Miss Lin brought us.

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,430
Men,

124
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,800
open the chests.

125
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,870
Useless.

126
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,920
What lousy information.

127
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,830
Didn't you say there were valuables?

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,240
She told me so.

129
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,476
She said this batch of medicine

130
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,510
will make good money.

131
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,040
Miss.

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,190
You...

133
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,000
What is your game?

134
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,040
Why are the chests empty?

135
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,270
Get your boss here.

136
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
I want to talk to him.

137
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,430
It's no loss for you.

138
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,390
I don't know what you're up to

139
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,830
but

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,070
with a beauty like you,

141
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,920
you'd make a good wife for the boss.

142
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
What are you doing to my...

143
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,630
I'll go with you.

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
Let them go.
They have nothing to do with this.

145
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,870
Fine.

146
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,750
Xunchu.

147
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,720
All are family in the wilds.

148
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,680
How have we offended you

149
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,390
to warrant such forceful assault?

150
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,390
Let my woman go,

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,310
and I'll let you go.

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,680
Fine.

153
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,310
Let my brothers go now.

154
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you in any position

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,870
to bargain with me?

156
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
Bring it on.

157
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,510
We're all vagrants.

158
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,720
We owe no one.

159
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,080
We lose no one.

160
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,510
Let my brothers go.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,870
You go your way, we go ours.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,270
Did you hear me?

163
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,360
Stop, Xunchu.

164
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,240
You are He Sheng'an.

165
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,550
You know me?

166
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,600
He used to be my father's subordinate.

167
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,720
Do you know who he is?

168
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
He is Duan Xunchu,
the second son of Commander Duan.

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,030
Duan Xunchu?

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,670
I am Su Mu's daughter.

171
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,000
You...

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
You are Adjutant Su's daughter?

173
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,630
Do you still remember?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,790
Whenever I came to my father's office,

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,360
you'll always buy me candies.

176
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
It's really...

177
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:36,840
It's really you.

178
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,960
Uncle He,

179
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm here to ask you
for the truth about that year.

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,550
After the incident,

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,390
the police closed the case

182
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,670
and said the Duan family were killed
because my father betrayed

183
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,150
the Commander's whereabouts.

184
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
What happened that year?

185
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,120
Was my father involved
in Commander Duan's death?

186
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,200
Adjutant Su will never betray
the Commander's whereabouts.

187
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,240
When that incident took place,

188
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,840
Adjutant Su was purchasing military goods
at another province.

189
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,670
He only got to know
that something had happened

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,480
to the Duan family on the day he returned.

191
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,240
He rushed to rescue the Commander
with a squad.

192
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,080
In the end,

193
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,030
they never returned.

194
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,870
If I come to know

195
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,200
you told even a word of lie...

196
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,910
You can check

197
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,320
Adjutant Su's travel records.

198
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,750
You'll know I told the truth.

199
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
After the Commander's death,

200
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,960
Adjutant Su's subordinates

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,030
were branded as traitors.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,360
For the sake of survival,

203
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,270
we came to this mountain.

204
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,080
Do you know who is the real murderer?

205
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,814
The Commander has
too many political enemies,

206
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
so we don't know.

207
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,030
We only know that General Song

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,750
was the first to arrive at the scene.

209
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,840
But

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,600
he was too late.

211
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
So,

212
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,030
it wasn't him?

213
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
It might not be him.

214
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,120
I'm asking all of you.

215
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,240
Do you want to stay in the mountain

216
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,000
and be bandits all your life?

217
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,320
What do you mean?

218
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,670
If you're telling the truth,

219
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,870
I'm willing to recruit you into my army

220
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,790
and help your family settle down.

221
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,550
Are you willing to follow me?

222
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,030
You were my family's subordinates.

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,510
My father may no longer be around

224
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,910
but I will rebuild the Duan family

225
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,480
and give you a home under my command.

226
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,480
We will follow
the Major General to the end.

227
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,734
We will follow the Major General.

228
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,000
We will follow the Major General.

229
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,294
We will follow the Major General.

230
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,630
We will follow the Major General.
