1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,990
So, you're not afraid of dogs anymore?

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,260
Why would I be afraid of them? They're so cute.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,080
How come all the Keerati family's property belongs to Hia?

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,680
What's going on?

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,790
The old mansion...

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,350
It's not easy to find a location right in the center of the city like this.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,910
Is it still true when you say that you love me?

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,510
The reason that Hia is still nice to me is because it's his duty.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,200
What I want to ask you is...

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,140
Is our family going to go bankrupt?

11
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,509
Mom, can you hear me?

12
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,280
Yes, my son.

13
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,910
What did you ask me again?

14
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,460
Is our family going to go bankrupt?

15
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,050
Oh dear! Where did you hear such a thing from?

16
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,530
Why did you ask me that question?

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,560
Well...

18
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,190
I'm just curious.

19
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,830
The economy seems to be faltering.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,460
Will our silk store survive through this kind of economy?

21
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,829
I see. Well, the business is quite slow at the moment.

22
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,550
We're trying to keep it running. Most of our clients are grandpa's old customers.

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,750
The business might not be doing well, but it's not as bad as going bankrupt.

24
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,870
You don't have to worry.

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,910
My dear, I was shocked to hear you say that.

26
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,300
Is something troubling you?

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
No.

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,120
It's nothing.

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,320
I was just curious.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,630
Mom.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,450
I miss you.

32
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,780
I miss you too.

33
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,420
So, how are you?

34
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,420
How's your life with Hia Lian?

35
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,940
Are you behaving properly?

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,850
I am.

37
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,620
Hia is taking good care of me.

38
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
That's good. You have to take care of him too.

39
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,350
Don't be too stubborn, alright?

40
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,020
How about your studies? How's it going?

41
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,160
My exams are coming up soon.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,750
That's great! Then you can come to visit me during your semester break.

43
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,329
And bring Hia Lian with you, too.

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,850
I... I'll talk to Hia Lian about it.

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Okay. Don't forget to take care of yourself.

46
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,340
Okay, mom.

47
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,570
Nong.

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,510
Don't bark.

49
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,590
Don't you know that no one likes dogs that bark a lot?

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
You have to break this bad habit, okay?

51
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,090
Diao is sleeping right now. You're going to wake him up.

52
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,990
Diao, do you want to go sleep in your bedroom properly?

53
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,240
No. I want to sleep here.

54
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,380
I want to sleep together.

55
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,010
Don't blame me if your body aches tomorrow.

56
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,010
What are you doing?

57
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,330
It smells so good! I can smell it from a mile away.

58
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,270
Don't try to hide it from me with your overacting.

59
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,810
Why did you go to university when you're still sick?

60
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,990
I already told you that I have to work on my group project.

61
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,130
And I'm alright now.

62
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,630
You should have told me.

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,910
I don't want to call you too often.

64
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,600
You'll accuse me of being overprotective.

65
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,390
I was so scared when I came home but couldn't find you.

66
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,960
Did you think I ran away from home?

67
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,310
But you'll never succeed in doing that.

68
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,210
No matter where you are in the world,

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
I'll find you.

70
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,740
Who's the one overacting now?

71
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,890
Try this. I've changed the recipe to make it less spicy.

72
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,740
How is it?

73
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,159
It tastes good.

74
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,980
I'll go put this apron away.

75
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,210
If my mom said that there's nothing to worry about,

76
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,820
I, Kuea Keerati, will pretend to be completely clueless.

77
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,010
I will not try to find out anything about this.

78
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,310
Maybe I'll be happier if I know nothing.

79
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,540
Okay.

80
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,200
You guys pass.

81
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,210
Your group can continue to work on the prototype.

82
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,340
Excuse me then.

83
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,310
Thank you so much, professor!

84
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Yay!

85
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,360
We're the first group that passes! We are so cool!

86
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,160
I can't believe that our model presentation passed since the first round.

87
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,610
-We're freaking awesome!
-Gosh!

88
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,310
I asked the seniors and they said that no one had passed since the first round before, ever!

89
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,510
Ton! Can you shut up?

90
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,230
Oh no. You're in a bad mood today.

91
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,160
Are you on your period?

92
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,270
Ton.

93
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,010
Let me hit you with some knowledge.

94
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,610
Do not say this to any other woman ever again because it shows your low level of intelligence.

95
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,440
It's rude and disrespectful.

96
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,710
You have no conscience, and you're insulting the female gender.

97
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,550
I'm angry because you're so freaking loud, not because I'm on my period!

98
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,550
Also, it's none of your business whether I'm on my period or not. Do you understand?

99
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,960
I understand now.

100
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,360
I've done wrong.

101
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,150
I'll punish myself for my own mistake right now.

102
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,810
Do I have to do it with you?

103
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,110
That would be nice.

104
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,920
Damn it.

105
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,110
I'm such a good friend.

106
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,190
Kuea, are you still feeling sick?

107
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,460
No.

108
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,210
You're not as lively as usual.

109
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,700
Why don't you ask him the same question too?

110
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,860
I won't ask anymore!

111
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,910
It's nothing.

112
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,980
I'm just... thinking about something.

113
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,710
Did you two fight again?

114
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,410
I'm leaving first.

115
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,140
I have some work to do today.

116
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,610
Where are you going, Kuea? Are you going to meet Hia?

117
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,710
What's his job?

118
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,070
I heard that...

119
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,710
he's a singer.

120
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,810
Really?

121
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,930
Where?

122
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,190
Do you want to go to see his show?

123
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,160
Good idea!

124
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,710
Very good. Let's celebrate that we passed our model presentation.

125
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,210
Are you coming with us, Nuchy?

126
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,570
Bye.

127
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,810
Syn, let's go together.

128
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,710
I don't usually go to places like that.

129
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,170
But if you go...

130
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,850
I...

131
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,900
I...

132
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,210
What is it? I'm tired of waiting.

133
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,660
I'll go too.

134
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,190
What's up?

135
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,790
Why are you making such a grumpy face?

136
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,990
I'm not.

137
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,990
This is my normal face.

138
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,590
I think it's you.

139
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,740
You're the one who seems to be in an extra good mood today.

140
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,490
You made up with Kon-Diao, didn't you?

141
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,850
Yes.

142
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,470
I did.

143
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,530
Why?

144
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,690
You don't believe me?

145
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,490
Is there something wrong with me being on good terms with Kon-Diao?

146
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,460
No. I'm just happy for you.

147
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,480
Right.

148
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,990
This Sunday is my dad's birthday. Don't forget, okay?

149
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,490
Will there also be a big surprise this year?

150
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,730
Of course.

151
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,830
It's his 'Sae-Yid' ceremony.
(Sae-Yid = Sixtieth anniversary of age)

152
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,350
Okay. I'll prepare a proper present for him.

153
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,590
You don't have to give him anything.

154
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,790
Just bring Kon-Diao with you.

155
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,410
Hm?

156
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
You're planning something, aren't you?

157
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,890
Just wait and see.

158
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,990
Oh my god, Kuea!

159
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,790
You're here at last!

160
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm going to tearing up because I'm so touched.

161
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,810
You're so dramatic, Jay.

162
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,390
Is there a spot for a performance today?

163
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,690
Nope.

164
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,290
But since you're already here,

165
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,520
I can find a slot for you.

166
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,500
Thank you.

167
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,690
Hello, Jay!

168
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,440
Hello.

169
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,010
Hi.

170
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,590
I'll go arrange Kirin's performance slot first.

171
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,190
Kuea.

172
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,490
Did you tell Hia that you'll go home late today?

173
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,190
No, I didn't.

174
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,390
I don't think I need to tell him that.

175
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,090
What about you? Did you tell Hia Yi?

176
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,390
Not yet.

177
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,880
But Hia Yi told me not to stay out later than 9 p.m.

178
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,990
You seem to be...

179
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,850
extra lively today.

180
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:31,670
Hey!

181
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
Did something good happen to you?

182
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,390
Wait!

183
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,540
Did you and Hia Yi...

184
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,370
Did you guys do it?!

185
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,120
Kuea!

186
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,840
Don't be too loud!

187
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,150
Come on. What happened? Tell me.

188
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,190
You're behaving suspiciously.

189
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,480
Nope. I won't tell you.

190
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,490
So, that means I'm right.

191
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,350
Tell me!

192
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,250
I won't.

193
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,300
I won't. I won't. I won't.

194
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,360
Tell me now! Tell me about it!

195
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,020
I won't. So, you're coming back to perform here now?

196
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,190
Come on. I can see you acting strange since you walked through the door.

197
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,640
Ohayo!

198
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,890
Good morning, sir.

199
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,090
Please prepare a present for Lian's father.

200
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,790
Get a big one.

201
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,440
It's his 60th birthday.

202
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,180
I'll prepare a really big one, sir.

203
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,410
Oh! Mr. Yi.

204
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,740
Kon-Diao's father, Mr. Sattha, has been calling so many times.

205
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,660
Do you want me to tell him off?

206
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,590
Does he want to talk about the shophouses in Ramintra?

207
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,410
Well, yes. But there are other matters too.

208
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,690
Well... He wants to talk to you as soon as possible.

209
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,090
Make an appointment with him tomorrow. I'll call him then.

210
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,790
I'm sorry, boss. Mr. Sattha is actually here. He's been waiting for you since morning.

211
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,000
He went to the toilet when you came in.

212
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,290
Tell him to meet me upstairs then.

213
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:15,079
Yes, sir!

214
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,490
Mr. Business Partner, you must come today. You can't miss it.

215
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,900
Mr. Lian!

216
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,840
The hotel that will organize your father's birthday event sent us some menus for you to choose.

217
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,390
Mr. Lian.

218
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,590
Could you please get that?

219
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,010
Oh!

220
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,540
Here, sir.

221
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,050
You can tell the organizer to decide.

222
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,290
Alright, sir.

223
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,190
What about...

224
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,590
the surprise that I told you to prepare?

225
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,600
How's it going?

226
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:29,380
I'm working on it. I've told your parents already, and they're happy about it. So there's no problem at all.

227
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,190
Thank you.

228
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,100
Yes, sir.

229
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,390
You can leave early today.

230
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:36,690
I'm also leaving now.

231
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,090
Yes!

232
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,090
Leave early!

233
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,090
Thank you so much, boss!

234
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,240
Boss?

235
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,390
Thank you, boss!

236
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,390
Jab! Did you see that girl?

237
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,360
She's so hot!

238
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,390
Damn! Gemini is so big!

239
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,390
It’s going to be a wild night!

240
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,160
That girl over there, Jab!

241
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,620
Look!

242
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:09,860
I think...

243
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,190
I should go back first.

244
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,690
Hey! Why are you going back now?

245
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,570
Don’t be such a wimp!

246
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,870
We're already here. Come on, be brave.

247
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,890
You've never been here before?

248
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,510
A person like Syn always goes to bed at 9 p.m.

249
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,090
There's nothing bad inside.

250
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,290
We're just here to listen to music and support our friend.

251
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:35,970
Let's go.

252
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,690
Hello.

253
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,690
You guys are Nu-Kuea's friends, right?

254
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:46,830
Yes, sir.

255
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,740
Are you guys here to see Nu-Kuea?

256
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,490
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,810
You can go in first, sir.

258
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,870
No!

259
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,120
He can't know that Nu-Kuea is here.

260
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,590
Have you guys been here before?

261
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,270
No, sir.

262
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,390
Does coming here make you break the five precepts of Buddism?

263
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,490
No, sir.

264
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,290
I can come here. I'm not a monk.

265
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,840
Also, I always chant in the morning.

266
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,790
The money that I donated last time, was it enough?

267
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,190
I rejoice in your merit.

268
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,990
I don't need any more money, sir.

269
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't tell Nu-Kuea that I'm here.

270
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,230
I'm afraid it'll make him shy, and he won't be able to sing properly.

271
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,690
Alright, sir.

272
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,140
Well, then...

273
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,040
Please excuse us.

274
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,550
He's over there!

275
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:15,870
Hey!

276
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,330
Jab, Syn, Nuer! Hi!

277
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,420
Have you been waiting long?

278
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,730
I just arrived too.

279
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,300
Hi.

280
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,890
Long time no see.

281
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,480
Kiss...

282
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:53,890
That wasn't a kiss.

283
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,390
A kiss...

284
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,690

Calm down, my friends.

293
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,770
Hey, hey, calm down, calm down.

294
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,180

295
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,780
A little refreshment for you.

296
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,840
Kuea's here!

297
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,500

How come you can make it here today?

301
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,020
Weren't you the one who texted me to come?

302
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,810
I was just asking.

303
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,270
I didn't expect you to actually show up.

304
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,470

You're not going to stay here until Kuea finishes?

325
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,170
I can't.

326
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,330
I have a 9 p.m. curfew.

327
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,470
That's way too early.

328
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,560

356
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,160
Yes, I have.

357
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,330
Okay.

358
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,470
Hia.

359
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,740
You're not going to ask me where I was?

360
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,040
If you want to tell me,

361
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,190
you'll probably say it yourself.

362
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:32,730
Um...

363
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:36,940
I...

364
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,070
I was working on my project with my friends at the university.

365
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,390
There were Syn, Nuer, Ton, and Jab. You've met them all before.

366
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,010
Oh right.

367
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,540
This Sunday is my dad's birthday.

368
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,760
Will you come with me?

369
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,130
But it's your family's special occasion.

370
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,010
Would it be okay if I go with you?

371
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,200
It's my dad's 60th birthday.

372
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,170
Chinese people called it 'Sae Yid.'

373
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,450
It's considered his golden year.

374
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,940
That's why I'm going to organize a big celebration.

375
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,510
I want you to go with me.

376
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,680
Then...

377
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,610
What should I give him for his birthday?

378
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,380
You don't have to get him anything.

379
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,890
If you attend this event,

380
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,340
my dad will already be very happy.

381
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,900
What should I do, Nong?

382
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,000
Help me think.

383
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,110
Should I tell him or not?

384
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,790
Gosh!

385
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,260
This is giving me a headache!

386
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,860
I don't know what to do!

387
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,230
Kuea is my best friend.

388
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,150
But Hia Lian should've told Kuea himself.

389
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,510
He shouldn't hide it from Kuea.

390
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,210
Maybe Hia Lian has his reasons.

391
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,450
What should I do, Nong?

392
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,630
I'd better call Kuea.

393
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:06,890
Hello.

394
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,010
Are you at home now?

395
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,270
I just got home.

396
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,950
What about Hia Lian?

397
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,550
Hia...

398
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,090
Hia's at home too.

399
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,510
Did he say anything?

400
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,040
No.

401
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,410
He didn't even ask where I was.

402
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,830
Don't you think it's strange?

403
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,860
That he didn't ask you?

404
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,230
Actually, I do think it's a bit weird.

405
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,750
But he said...

406
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,400
if I wanted to tell him, I would probably have said it myself.

407
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,180
So I told him that I was working at the university.

408
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,150
You lied to him?

409
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,580
I just don't want to tell him yet.

410
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,790
You know that he's testing you, right?

411
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,050
Hia... What?

412
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,940
Actually, he...

413
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,540
Kon-Diao.

414
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:07,280
It's time to go to bed.

415
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,750
Alright.

416
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,820
Hello.

417
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,280
Sorry, Kuea.

418
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,410
I have to go.

419
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,730
Eh?

420
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,230
Wait!

421
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,760
What's the rush?

422
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,880
What the heck?

423
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,170
Were you having a serious talk?

424
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,840
No.

425
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,770
Just a casual conversation.

426
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,930
Isn't that right, little doggie?

427
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,660
Kon-Diao.

428
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,400
Sometimes you have to let other people handle their own problems.

429
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,160
Or you might become like Nong.

430
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,270
You mean...

431
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,260
I'll become a dog?

432
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,480
Hm...

433
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,820
Let's go to bed, Nong.

434
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,350
Kon-Diao.

435
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,150
Yes?

436
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,370
You let her sleep in your bedroom?

437
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,260
Yes.

438
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,620
Then why...

439
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,730
Why don't you let her sleep in her cage?

440
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,540
I can't do that.

441
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,110
C'mon Nong, let's go to bed.

442
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,500
Don't you think it's strange?

443
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,320
That he didn't ask you?

444
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,520
You know that he's testing you, right?

445
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,300
Actually, he...

446
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,450
Hia... knows?

447
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,140
Why is he still testing me?

448
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,280
I won't put up with this anymore!

449
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,440
Nu-Kuea is doing well.

450
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,650
Don't worry.

451
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,450
About the land title deeds, I've already dealt with them.

452
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,930
There's nothing to worry about.

453
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,450
Alright.

454
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,770
Nu-Kuea, what's the matter?

455
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,720
I...

456
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,080
I know everything.

457
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,290
About the Keerati's land title deeds that were transferred to your name.

458
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,760
What's going on, Hia?

459
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,690
Why didn't you tell me anything?

460
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,280
Did you ever think of letting me know?

461
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,910
Calm down, Nu-Kuea.

462
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,460
How did you know about this?

463
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,260
I saw all the title deeds.

464
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,740
I took pictures of them too, but I already deleted them.

465
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,870
Why didn't you ask me when you saw them?

466
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,540
I don't want to be deceived.

467
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,670
I want to know it by myself.

468
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,050
How much do you know about this?

469
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,700
I know that you're going to sell the Keerati Mansion to Hia Yi so he can turn it into a car showroom.

470
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,370
You're also going to close down the silk business.

471
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,120
I'm not that stupid to be so clueless about why you're doing all this.

472
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,730
But what I don't understand is...

473
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,560
Why are you not telling me?

474
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,840
Aren't you my fiancé?

475
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm sorry.

476
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,700
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you ealier.

477
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,770
My intention was to tell you...

478
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,000
after everything is settled.

479
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,140
Kuea.

480
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,480
It's me, your mom.

481
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,650
Mom!

482
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,300
Yes, aunt Kewarin.

483
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:54,030
Lian, can I talk to Nu-Kuea?

484
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,500
(Mrs. Kewarin)

485
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,270
Kuea.

486
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,210
Listen to Lian.

487
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,670
He's telling you the truth.

488
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,670
That day...

489
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,790
That you called me, but I didn't tell you.

490
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,640
It's because Hia Lian asked me to do that.

491
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,200
He wanted you to hear it from him.

492
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,440
Why did you have to sell everything that belonged to our family to Hia?

493
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,920
You understand it correctly.

494
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,190
The economy is bad.

495
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,790
The silk business is not doing as well as before.

496
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,440
If we continue to run this business,

497
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,630
we might lose everything to someone else.

498
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,390
So I talked to Hia Lian.

499
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,160
I agreed to let Hia Lian become the owner of our property temporarily.

500
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,750
And after everything is settled, he will transfer all the property back to you.

501
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,920
Then why have you never told me about any of this?

502
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,180
Is it because you think that I'm still a kid?

503
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,520
No. It's not like that.

504
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,100
But...

505
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,130
I don't want you to be stress about it.

506
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:57,970
And also,

507
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,310
I don't want you to know about the bad things.

508
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,470
I want you to be happy, just like when grandpa was here.

509
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,690
Do you trust Hia?

510
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,920
I trust him the most.

511
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:15,620
That's why I asked him to take care of the most precious thing in my life.

512
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,360
Nothing is more precious than you, Nu-Kuea.

513
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,110
You can trust Hia Lian, my son.

514
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,650
I believe in Hia Lian.

515
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,040
I believe that he can make you happy.

516
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,750
Thank you, aunt Kewarin.

517
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,130
I'm so sorry.

518
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,140
Please trust me.

519
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,690
I'm ready.

520
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:44,050
(Happy Sae-Yid Day)

521
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:47,250
It's such a big event.

522
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,050
Hello.

523
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,520
Hello.

524
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,020
Thank you so much.

525
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,750
Thank you so much. Please enjoy.

526
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,270
Please enjoy the night.

527
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,720
There are many guests today.

528
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,200
Oh, Lian!

529
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:16,050
I missed you so much!

530
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,250
My son.

531
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,550
-Hello, young master Kuea.
-Hello.

532
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,400
Hello.

533
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,250
Thank you for coming to my event today.

534
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,650
There's no need to thank me for this.

535
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,290
I'm glad to be here.

536
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:34,590
I wish you good health and prosperity.

537
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,960
Thank you so much. It's a very lovely birthday wish.

538
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,960
But can I ask you for one thing?

539
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,400
Can you call me 'dad' as well?

540
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,980
Come on.

541
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,310
Look at him.

542
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,050
He's so shy now.

543
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,590
By the way, how are you?

544
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,910
You've already moved in with Hia, right?

545
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:57,010
Yes.

546
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,160
If you need anything, you can tell this auntie immediately.

547
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,200
Oh, no.

548
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,350
You can tell your 'mom.'

549
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,750
Sure, mom.

550
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,890
I'll leave Nu-Kuea with you two for a moment.

551
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,410
I have to take care of the work over there.

552
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,430
Sure. Don't worry.

553
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,550
Have you eaten anything yet?

554
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,950
Hello, sir.

555
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,340
I wish you good health,

556
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,570
and may you live for a thousand years.

557
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:37,020
-Whoa. Thank you so much, Mr. Yongyut.
-Thank you so much.

558
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,660
Have you ever met young master Kuea Keerati?

559
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,650
Oh, I've never met him before.

560
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,570
Hello, sir.

561
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,770
He's the heir of the Keerati family.

562
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,590
And he's soon to be my son-in-law.

563
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,780
But you only have one son, don't you?

564
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:57,030
That's right.

565
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,980
He is my son's fiancé.

566
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,660
Oh, I see.

567
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,470
Young master Kuea attended high school in the UK.

568
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,620
Right now, he's studying compter engineering.

569
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,550
They will get married right after his graduation.

570
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,530
No wonder why I've never seen him before.

571
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,650
Well, congratulations.

572
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,010
I'm sure that you'll meet him more often after they get married.

573
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,780
You're finally here.

574
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,460
Hello, Hia Lian.

575
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,460
Happy birthday to your dad.

576
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,160
Thank you.

577
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,640
You can go inside to find Nu-Kuea first.

578
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,120
I'll be right there in a bit.

579
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,690
Okay.

580
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,920
Er...

581
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,020
This way, sir.

582
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:58,960
Alright.

583
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,340
Are you ready?

584
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,920
Yeah.

585
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:23,020
I've never been to such a big birthday celebration like this before.

586
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,160
Me too.

587
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,860
Apart from you, Hia,

588
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,070
and Hia's parents...

589
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,770
I don't know anyone else.

590
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:33,920
This is so confusing.

591
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,430
Since that night, after we came back from Gemini,

592
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,310
we haven't talked at all.

593
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,980
Yeah.

594
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,050
I was working on my project.

595
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,320
So I was quite busy.

596
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,780
I see.

597
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,400
What about you?

598
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:47,950
Is something the matter?

599
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,030
Since that night.

600
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,290
It's like you had something you wanted to say, but didn't.

601
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,130
Um...

602
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,210
I'm not sure

603
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,990
if I should tell you this or not.

604
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,300
But I've thought this through.

605
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,080
I think that I should tell you anyway.

606
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,710
Because you're my best friend.

607
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,550
Well...

608
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,680
That night at Gemini,

609
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,630
I saw Hia Lian. He came to watch your performance.

610
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,580
Mhm.

611
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,000
You already knew?

612
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,430
No.

613
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,790
I kind of guessed it.

614
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:37,930
That night, I also talked to Hia and my mom about the land that belonged to my family.

615
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,850
It's just like what I'd thought.

616
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:45,110
Hia did all that because he did have his reasons.

617
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:54,380
It's not because Hia's always doing things behind my back because he thinks I'm just a kid.

618
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,720
But it's because of me.

619
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,390
I've never fully trusted him.

620
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:05,040
I don't think that he can really love me for who I am.

621
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,500
That's why I've lied to him.

622
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,060
I've kept many secrets from him.

623
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,600
I've never told him anything.

624
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:17,790
Kuea.

625
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,030
Do you feel guilty?

626
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,240
Yeah.

627
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,350
(Happy Sae-Yid Day)

628
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,520
Do you like it?

629
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:24,330
Next, please welcome Mr. Cai Wang and his family to say a few words to our guests.

630
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:30,850
Please, sir.

631
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,730
I would like to thank all the guests who have come today.

632
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,530
I feel grateful, and I'm very touched.

633
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,620
I also want to thank my wife...

634
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,220
and my son.

635
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:55,150
They've been working hard to organize this event for me.

636
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:04,870
I've fought, endured, and worked so hard to build up a business centered around drinking water.

637
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,870
I built this business empire right from scratch.

638
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,580
And this business has given me back a lot of money.

639
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,690
But there's one thing that I've built with my own two hands...

640
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:27,100
It is the proudest and greatest thing in my life.

641
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,650
That is...

642
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:31,250
My son.

643
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,610
Kilen Wang.

644
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:45,260
It's time for me to step down and retire from all the duties.

645
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:51,120
From now on, every business that belongs to me will be Lian's.

646
00:50:51,650 --> 00:51:00,150
I believe that my son will be a great general who will lead everyone to success.

647
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,550
He will also be a good family leader.

648
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:13,030
So I would like to dedicate my birthday wish this year to my son.

649
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,980
I hope that he will have a good life.

650
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,970
Whatever you wish, may it be fulfilled.

651
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,950
I wish you all the success in everything that you do.

652
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,590
Thank you so much.

653
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:36,130
Thank you, dad.

654
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,710
Cheers!

655
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,590
Cheers!

656
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,450
Cheers!

657
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,170
Cheers!

658
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,420
Cheers!

659
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:44,050
Thank you so much.

660
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,010
Thank you Mr. Cai Wang and his family.

661
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,050
Thank you.

662
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,150
I would like to thank all our honored guests today.

663
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,700
Thank you, mom and dad.

664
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,540
And thank you to my special someone.

665
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,410
I have a surprise today.

666
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,400
It's a gift for my dad

667
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:24,990
and my special someone.

I love you.

688
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:04,120
I think it's time for me...

689
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,860
to take care of you...

690
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,280
for the rest of my life.

691
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,800
Will you marry me?

692
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:45,350
It's better if we don't.

693
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,360
You don't really love me.

694
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,460
You don't even know the real me yet.

695
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:17,880
I...

696
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,500
I am not who you think I am.

697
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,760
Please don't make me feel any worse about myself than I already do.

698
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,400
I'm so sorry.

699
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:16,590
Lian.

700
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,260
Kuea, listen to me.

701
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,440
I've always listened to you.

702
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,090
That's why I'm the last one to know about anything.

703
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,830
I don't think our relationship will last.

704
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,840
I've probably indulged myself too much.

705
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:03,270
I'm sorry.

706
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,160
Mr. Lian!
