1
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,290
Hia, you like dancing?

2
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,170
Nu-Kuea finally told you his secrets?

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,720
Not yet. I pretend not to know.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,720
I will try to make him open up to me.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,240
I see you've decided to bring your fiancé with you.

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,130
Are you actually going to marry my friend?

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,630
Nu-Kuea really wants to call off our engagement.

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,800
He doesn't like being forced.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
That's not the reason.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,800
You have to love me first.

11
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,220
Only Hia can call me that!

12
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,650
Can you love me back?

13
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,350
You're not allowed to come inside.

14
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,350
Don't call me Nu-Kuea!

15
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,210
Hia...

16
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,340
Wait...

17
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,980
What's wrong?

18
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,950
What are you thinking about?

19
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,870
That night...

20
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,170
It was you, wasn't it?

21
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,800
Why didn't you say anything?

22
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,480
It wouldn't be fun if I told you.

23
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,550
So you're saying...

24
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,350
You're just having fun, seeing me get fooled like that?

25
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,900
I wasn't trying to fool you around.

26
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,800
I just wanted to wait for you to be ready to tell me everything.

27
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,150
That's just an excuse.

28
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,050
That's right.

29
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,350
It's just an excuse.

30
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,040
It's just an excuse to get you to live with me.

31
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,010
Why didn't you just ask me nicely?

32
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,440
If I asked you nicely, would you have moved in with me?

33
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,510
I don't like you anymore.

34
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,880
I don't like you being like this.

35
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:34,440
I already told you that I love you.

36
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,940
But you still don't like me?

37
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,960
Back then, you told me that it wasn't love.

38
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,320
You said that you didn't love me.

39
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,909
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,440
I told you that I didn't love you...

41
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,710
because I didn't want to say it carelessly.

42
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,200
I wanted you to see it for yourself... through my actions.

43
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,300
What's so hard about saying the word love?

44
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,280
Why can't you just say it if you love me?

45
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,800
Why do you have to keep me guessing?

46
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,800
I just told you that I love you.

47
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,500
Did you forget that already?

48
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,200
I've never not loved you.

49
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,200
I love you every day.

50
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,100
I've loved you since the day you were born.

51
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,500
And I will always love you from now on, too.

52
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,320
I want to marry you.

53
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm a human, not a doll.

54
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,800
And I'm not Annabelle.

55
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,840
I already know that.

56
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:39,550
When you said that you wanted to marry a human and not a doll,

57
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,480
did you know that it hurt me so much?

58
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,600
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,970
I also regretted it.

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,210
Why are you suddenly so nice to me?

61
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,780
Why did you finally tell me that you love me?

62
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,480
When we started living together...

63
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,340
When we started living together...

64
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,700
You're so cute.

65
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,100
You're so cute, I could no longer hold back.

66
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,100
Tell me more.

67
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to hear it again.

68
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,750
I love you.

69
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,450
I love you too.

70
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,790
♪ I've never not loved you, but I can't say it ♪

71
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,530

You're not drunk, are you?

79
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm not.

80
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you realize...

81
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,100
what we're doing?

82
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,500
Yes.

83
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,720
If you're not okay...

84
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,150
tell me immediately.

85
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,820
Did you sleep here last night?

86
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,790
Yes.

87
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,900
Oh...

88
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,630
I had no idea.

89
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,250
I probably went to bed already.

90
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,980
Don't worry.

91
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,310
I saw that you were sleeping, so I didn't want to wake you up.

92
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,410
Are you going to university?

93
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,670
I'll drop you off then.

94
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,410
It's okay!

95
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,010
I can go by myself!

96
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,510
Kon-Diao, wait!

97
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,780
Kon-Diao!

98
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,560
What's wrong with me?

99
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,670
When I see his face, it reminds me of what happened yesterday.

100
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,610
Nong Diao.

101
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,140
Do you feel lonely living alone?

102
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,390
Hia...

103
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,750
Why did you steal a kiss from me?

104
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,210
Are you hungry?

105
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,550
Hia.

106
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,910
Stop it.

107
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,230
Don't look at me.

108
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,590
Why are you being shy?

109
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,840
I already saw everything last night.

110
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,960
That was last night.

111
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,260
It was dark.

112
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,710
Nu-Kuea, who is sleeping by my side,

113
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,610
is the cutest person ever.

114
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,850
Are you happy?

115
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm so happy.

116
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,850
What about you?

117
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm even happier than you.

118
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,310
What is it?

119
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,339
You're not going to give me a kiss?

120
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,290
Why are you so cute?

121
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,370
What's the matter?

122
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,090
I...

123
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,930
I just...

124
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,410
I know what you're going to say.

125
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,610
If today is the weekend, I definitely wouldn't let you off of this bed.

126
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,370
Hia!

127
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,000
Stop it.

128
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,730
Hia!

129
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,090
Hia, stop!

130
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,130
You'll be late for work!

131
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,650
Dang! Khao! Come eat your food!

132
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,930
Oh, Syn! You're so hardworking. You don't have any classes today?

133
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,410
I have afternoon classes today.

134
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,090
I will go after finishing sweeping the floor.

135
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,730
That's good.

136
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,610
You should study hard so His Holiness will not be worried.

137
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,410
Yes, auntie.

138
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,890
Syn, you're such a good boy.

139
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,210
I'm not surprised since you got ordained at a very young age.

140
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,330
I wish my son, Odd, could be like you.

141
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,930
But he has been ordained for a while now, hasn't he?

142
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:29,650
I don't want to talk about this anymore, it feels like I'm gossiping about my own son.

143
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,370
I'd been begging him for ages before he agreed to get ordained as a monk.

144
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,810
Plus, he got ordained because he wanted to get married.

145
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,730
But now he won't leave the monkhood because his girlfriend dumped him!

146
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:51,250
You know, my son is not even half as good as you.

147
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,090
That's not true.

148
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,490
I'd better get going.

149
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,370
Hello, Syn.

150
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,930
Can you come to the lab a bit early today?

151
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:15,490
Sure.

152
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,810
Is something the matter?

153
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,650
It seems that there is a problem with the formula one design.

154
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,970
What problem?

155
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,490
I'm not sure too. That's why I need someone who's an expert in the mechanics to check.

156
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,770
Okay. I will also call Kuea and Nuchy to come in for help.

157
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,490
That's not necessary. I mean...

158
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,450
I...

159
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,010
I don't want to listen to too many people.

160
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,410
Just you is enough.

161
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,210
Hia...

162
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,490
That's enough, Hia.

163
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,490
I have to go to the factory today.

164
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,890
I need to refill my energy.

165
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,490
Hia...

166
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,410
Enough already!

167
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,730
You have classes in the afternoon today, right?

168
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,290
That's right.

169
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,410
You should take a nap then.

170
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,490
I'll call to wake you up at 11.30 a.m.

171
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,610
Do you have to go right now?

172
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,210
Can't we go at the same time?

173
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,690
We can't.

174
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,970
My subordinates are waiting for me.

175
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,250
I'm already going to work later than usual.

176
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,290
It's my first time being this late.

177
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,610
Anyway, I'll come back to have dinner with you.

178
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,490
Can I get more of your love?

179
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,810
I need the motivation to go to work.

180
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,290
Can you kiss me one more time?

181
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,410
I love you.

182
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,170
He said he loves me!

183
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,210
Is this even real?

184
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,690
This is real, isn't it?

185
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,290
He's not deceiving me again, right?

186
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,850
How's it going?

187
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,510
I came here as fast as I can.

188
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:46,660
But...

189
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,910
Are you wearing perfume?

190
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,170
I went back home to take a shower before coming here.

191
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,460
This morning, I...

192
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,050
"Sabbe Satta."

193
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:45,810
May all beings suffering from birth, aging, sickness, and death be happy.

194
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,850
May all beings be free from all sufferings and dangers.

195
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,470
Let's forget about it.

196
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,610
So what's the problem with the design?

197
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,750
Here.

198
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,110
The component here is not strong enough to bear the force.

199
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:11,660
How come?

200
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,160
Jay.

201
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,630
Kuea!

202
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,490
What brings you here?

203
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,410
Did you need something?

204
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,640
I don't know where else to go.

205
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,710
What the hell is wrong with you?

206
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,880
I told you to come here on Saturday, but you didn't.

207
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,440
Instead, you're here now.

208
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,570
Jong-Kook already went back to Korea.

209
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,680
I couldn't come out on Saturday.

210
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,060
You're whining like this because you fought with your fiancé, right?

211
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,290
No.

212
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,800
We didn't fight.

213
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,640
You guys didn't fight.

214
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,320
And you didn't correct me by saying that he's your ex-fiancé anymore.

215
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,950
What?

216
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,330
Did you guys get back together?

217
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,220
Yeah.

218
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,100
Hey!

219
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,850
You guys are on good terms now. You should be happy.

220
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,890
He suddenly told me that he loves me.

221
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,690
So?

222
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,920
That's great!

223
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,040
What's your problem?

224
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,840
It's too good to be true.

225
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,070
What?

226
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,970
Suddenly, everything has changed.

227
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,520
Suddenly, he tells me that he loves me.

228
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,410
You can do it!

229
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,310
There's not a single day that I don't love you.

230
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,890
I love you.

231
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,980
He's suddenly so nice to me.

232
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,460
Isn't that weird?

233
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,830
Eh!

234
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,710
You're scared, aren't you?

235
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,670
I should be scared, right?

236
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,020
Whether you should be scared or not...

237
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,100
I can't tell you that.

238
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,420
You have to figure it out yourself.

239
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,060
Whether you'll trust him or not.

240
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,320
You've always wanted him to love you back, haven't you?

241
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
I'm scared...

242
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,810
I'm scared of getting hurt.

243
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,100
But if you never try, you'll never know.

244
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,460
Why don't you try being more optimistic?

245
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,700
Maybe he really loves you.

246
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,790
(Freedom)

247
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,290
Charyeot!

248
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,610
Shio!

249
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,260
Rest.

250
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,620
Thank you!

251
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,470
Thank you.

252
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,120
"Do you feel lonely living alone?"

253
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:51,930
Of course!

254
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,370
How could he ask me that question?

255
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,490
Why did he want to know?

256
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,670
Why did he kiss me?

257
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,680
And when I started to...

258
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,360
I don't understand.

259
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,010
It's useless if you're just going to sit here and sigh.

260
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,730
Just tell him how you feel.

261
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,580
Should I tell him that I'm scared?

262
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,610
Also, if he actually loves me and finds out the truth about who I really am.

263
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,310
If he finds out all the lies that I've told him.

264
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,210
I'm scared that he will stop loving me.

265
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,500
If two people truly love each other,

266
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,610
they should be able to talk and share their feelings.

267
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,880
Kuea!

268
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,290
You're overthinking things.

269
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,680
You mix everything together.

270
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,010
You make it seem like everything is a problem!

271
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,310
Just like my financial statement.

272
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,800
I'll just fucking gobble it up!

273
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,840
Hey!

274
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,390
Calm down, bro.

275
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,720
Mr. Lian.

276
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,500
This is the title deed of the largest silk store.

277
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,490
This one's in Ratchaburi.

278
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,530
This one's in Choburi.

279
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,510
And... this one's in Phuket.

280
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,360
I've changed the name on these documents to your name.

281
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,400
Alright, sir.

282
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,390
Er...

283
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,010
Mr. Lian, could you please get it for me?

284
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,430
I'm so sorry.

285
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,380
Thank you so much.

286
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:56,490
But the title deed of young master Kuea's house at Charoen Krung...

287
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,090
That one isn't included in these documents.

288
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,330
It's okay.

289
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,070
Keep that house under his name.

290
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,380
Yes, sir.

291
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,910
These are all the official documents.

292
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,820
Go get them sorted out.

293
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:27,880
You want me to burn them?

294
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,320
Oh, right. Get it sorted.

295
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,110
Alright, sir.

296
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,740
Thank you.

297
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,200
Hello.

298
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,960
Everything is completed. Don't worry.

299
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,860
I've changed the name on all the land title deeds and other property deeds of the Keerati family into my name.

300
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,930
No.

301
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,960
Nu-Kuea doesn't have a clue about this.

302
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,670
Goodbye.

303
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,510
(Kuea's at the club.)

304
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,630
He's at Gemini.

305
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,310
What's he doing there?

306
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,790
Didn't he say he has classes at 1 p.m?

307
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,520
(Where are you? What are you doing?)

308
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,970
(You unsent a message.)

309
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,750
Hia.

310
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,810
Didn't you say you're going to class?

311
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,110
I already went to class this morning.

312
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,460
I'm free in the afternoon, so I came to teach the kids.

313
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,000
I asked you to tell me your daily schedule.

314
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,780
Why didn't you tell me?

315
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,870
Because I don't want to bother you.

316
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,310
I can take care of myself.

317
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,560
Didn't you say that you want my time?

318
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,880
I already moved back home for you.

319
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,190
Why are you avoiding me?

320
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,760
You're really moving back in?

321
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,660
That's right.

322
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,720
I...

323
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,210
Well, I...

324
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
I think...

325
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,350
Okay.

326
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,020
I get it now.

327
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,980
Let's go.

328
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,700
Get in the car.

329
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,590
Where are we going?

330
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,620
Hia, wait.

331
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
I...

332
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,270
Isn't this what you wanted from me?

333
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,320
What?

334
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,430
A date.

335
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,020
A date?

336
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,010
I'm taking you on a date.

337
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,860
This is not what I want.

338
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,520
I want to know how he really feels.

339
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,410
Do you want to record a video of you skateboarding?

340
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,270
I'll record it for you.

341
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,910
No, it's okay. I'm not good at this yet.

342
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,510
We can take pictures then.

343
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,610
One, two, three.

344
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,920
Thank you.

345
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,380
Can I ask you something?

346
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,810
Yes.

347
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,780
Why do you have to be so nice to me?

348
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,930
Why do you have to take care of me?

349
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,060
You're also taking me out on a date.

350
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,180
What's the point of doing all this?

351
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,860
You really don't know?

352
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,790
Am I bothering you?

353
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,660
No.

354
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,500
It's nothing.

355
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,580
You should finish your drink.

356
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,580
Kon-Diao.

357
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:33,000
What's the matter?

358
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,480
Just tell me what's wrong.

359
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,380
You should be saying that to yourself.

360
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,380
Tell me what's wrong.

361
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,780
Let's go home.

362
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,360
I think you're tired now.

363
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,310
You're right.

364
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,880
I'm tired.

365
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,680
I'm tired because you never tell me anything.

366
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,780
You want to know everything from me.

367
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,220
But you never tell me anything.

368
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,850
What am I to you?

369
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,500
I'm living in your house under what status?

370
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,040
About yesterday...

371
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,260
Why did you kiss me?

372
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,620
I've waited too long for your answer.

373
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,240
♪ If it's love, can you please make me feel more confident? ♪

374
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,000
Diao.
♪ If it's love, can you please make me feel more confident? ♪

375
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,940
♪ If it's love, can you please make me feel more confident? ♪

376
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,750
♪ Please tell me if it's just me who feels this way, so I can stop my heart from falling too hard ♪

377
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:57,820
♪ You avoid looking me in the eye. Does that mean anything? ♪

378
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,580
Can you come to meet me at my place?

379
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:05,410
Yeah.

380
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,180
There's something I want to talk to you about.

381
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,580
You're still here?

382
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,570
I want to fix this first. I can think more clearly when I work here.

383
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,190
I just wanted to tell you that...

384
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm sorry.

385
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
It's my fault.

386
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,750
It's not your fault.

387
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,910
It's everyone's fault.

388
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,880
Since we didn't check it thoroughly.

389
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,410
It's a good thing you saw it first.

390
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,940
Otherwise, we'd fail miserably when we do our presentation tomorrow.

391
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,230
"Sa-tat-tha-pa-su-to-si-ya."

392
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,810
"Strive for your goals."

393
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,480
Did I read that correctly?

394
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,770
Let me see.

395
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,780
Did you just google it?

396
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,280
Well, you told me that I'm responsible for the research part.

397
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,780
So I did some research.

398
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,100
-I need your advice on something.
-I need your advice on something.

399
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,210
You go first then.

400
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,950
Since you're the one who called me.

401
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,870
Why didn't you call me, then?

402
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,070
I was about to, but you called me first.

403
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,230
Oh... then you can tell me first.

404
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,230
It's okay. You can go first. Mine is not that urgent.

405
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,110
Dude, don't call me an idiot right off the bat, okay?

406
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,100
I know. I won't.

407
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,280
Yesterday...

408
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,140
Hia and I...

409
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,870
'Did it'?

410
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,610
Dude! Don't say it like that!

411
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,750
So, what happened?

412
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,370
Hia said he loves me.

413
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,130
Are you serious?

414
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:15,880
Yes.

415
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,880
He's changed.

416
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,200
Did he nail and bail on you?

417
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,010
Are you crazy?

418
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:23,300
Of course not!

419
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,040
What do you mean by 'he's changed,' then?

420
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,030
He's like...he's so cute!

421
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,920
So good!

422
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,130
So caring!

423
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,300
I'm getting goosebumps just talking about this.

424
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,630
I can't believe that he is Hia Lian.

425
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,490
That's good, isn't it? It doesn't sound like a problem to me.

426
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,620
Oh, I know now.

427
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,770
You're worried that he's being good to you because he has an ulterior motive, right?

428
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,530
Or are you worried that if he finds out the truth about who you are, he won't love you anymore?

429
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,150
This is why you're my best friend.

430
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,550
I think you shouldn't be too worried about this. You're happy right now, aren't you?

431
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,030
Don't stress too much about it.

432
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:14,090
At least Hia Lian is brave enough to say that he loves you.

433
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,800
I think it's more important to think about how you actually feel about him.

434
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:28,300
If you love him and he loves you back, then I think you should just do your best in this relationship.

435
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,100
Yeah.

436
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,280
Thank you so much.

437
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:39,080
You always bring me back to my senses.

438
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,190
That's not true! There were so many times that I couldn't stop you.

439
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:52,970
And what about you? Why did you call me?

440
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:00,170
You still there?

441
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,450
I had a fight with Hia Yi.

442
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,940
What! A fight about what?

443
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,120
It's completely the opposite of your problem.

444
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,340
He suddenly kissed me.

445
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,880
But he didn't explain anything to me, didn't tell me the meaning of his actions.

446
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,280
I don't want to live in his house anymore.

447
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,280
How about this.

448
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,900
If you really can't stand it anymore, you can stay at my secret house.

449
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:29,720
Really?

450
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,230
For real?

451
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,680
I will seriously go there.

452
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,970
Yes, I meant what I said.

453
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,010
You should know that my 'dragon's lair' is also yours.

454
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,680
Kuea...

455
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,360
I love you.

456
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,630
You're my best friend.

457
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:56,580
You keep looking at your watch.

458
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,480
Just leave, then.

459
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,650
You're the one who asked me to come here.

460
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,780
You said there's something you needed to talk about.

461
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,880
But you're not saying anything.

462
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,310
Yeah.

463
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:12,880
I'm thinking.

464
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,650
Is it about Kon-Diao?

465
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,210
No.

466
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,410
You're so tight-lipped.

467
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:24,080
If this is about work, you'd be talking non-stop.

468
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,270
What about you and Nu-Kuea last night?

469
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,080
How was it?

470
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:49,380
I've never thought that you and Nu-Kuea would end up together this fast.

471
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,820
I thought you would be strict and wait until you two are married.

472
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,460
I didn't expect it as well.

473
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,900
Stop talking about me already.

474
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,880
Let's talk about your problem.

475
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,880
What are you going to do about it?

476
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,030
Nothing.

477
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,430
Such a waste of my time.

478
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:18,030
I'm going back to Nu-Kuea now.

479
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,980
You're ditching your friend, now?

480
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,180
You should do the same.

481
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,780
Maybe your problem is not that hard to solve.

482
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,780
Just go back to the person you love.

483
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,080
Just try it.

484
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,080
I think it feels so good to do that.

485
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,650
You've been living with Nu-Kuea for only a few days.

486
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:47,320
You've changed this much?

487
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,040
What about you?

488
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,360
How many years have you let Kon-Diao live in your house?

489
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,380
When will you admit

490
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,870
how you actually feel about him?

491
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,910
Stop assuming what he's thinking. And stop making excuses.

492
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,420
You have a house. Why are you staying here alone?

493
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,580
Oh, Hia.

494
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:52,570
Are you tired?

495
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,700
Did you prepare all of this by yourself?

496
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,820
Of course not!

497
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,510
How could I do all of this?

498
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,410
I ordered food delivery.

499
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,300
It feels so nice to know that someone is waiting for you at home.

500
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,580
Do you want to eat now?

501
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,880
Or do you want to take a shower first?

502
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,870
I'll do both at the same time.

503
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,430
You've been trying so hard for me.

504
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,280
I'm afraid you will be disappointed in me.

505
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,880
Thank you for growing up to be my source of happiness.

506
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,420
Have you talked to Kon-Diao? Explain everything to him before it's too late.

507
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,180
What about you? Have you talked to Nu-Kuea about everything yet?

508
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,300
Here is the document for filing for bankruptcy and seizing the Keerati family's property.

509
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,820
It will be a big problem if Nu-Kuea knows about this later.
