1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,840
This house, right?

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,210
What's the password?

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,150
You can't come in!

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,450
Nu-Kuea, you're so drunk.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,600
Are you the real Hia or the fake Hia?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,060
How did you get in here?

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,960
Even the real Hia is not allowed inside!

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,160
I can't remember how I got home last night.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,250
The worst thing is...

10
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,250
Who did I kiss?

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,360
But I vaguely remembered...

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,780
He looked exactly like Hia Lian.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,670
Was it actually him?

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,520
How come all the files from last night are gone?

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,940
What will he think of me if he finds out that I kissed a stranger?

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,910
What are you going to do if it's actually Hia?

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,910
Nu-Kuea is sober now.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,670
He can't remember everything yet.

19
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,090
Although, he vaguely remembers

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,470
that he kissed someone.

21
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,490
Do you know how I got back home last night?

22
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,270
I didn't keep an eye on you all the time.

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,870
Did you see Hia Lian, my fiancé?

24
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,310
The owner of Pentagon.

25
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,650
Did he come last night?

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,030
Is Kirin performing tonight?

27
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,320
You already revealed yourself last night.

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,090
Everyone knows who you are now.

29
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,140
Kirin.

30
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,970
Qilin.

31
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,970
The dragon's lair.

32
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,480
I can't let this go on.

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,880
I already saved all footages from his CCTV cameras last night into this thumb drive.

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,780
You're having fun, aren't you?

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,090
Messing with your fiancé like that.

36
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,620
He's still young.

37
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,900
He has many options.

38
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,360
Someone might snatch him away from you.

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,480
You know how he behaves these days.

40
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,260
Auntie Ja, please tell someone to pack all his belongings immediately.

41
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,310
Now?!

42
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,620
I'm here to take you with me.

43
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,030
I won't go!

44
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,490
If anyone takes my belongings outside of this house,

45
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,970
I will call the police!

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,680
He probably went back already.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,710
Hia!

48
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,470
How did you get in here?

49
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,240
I climbed over the balcony.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,620
It's not that hard.

51
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,440
Why did you have to do that?

52
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,110
You said it as if you've never done it before.

53
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,260
I've never done such a thing.

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,200
Why would I do that?

55
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,770
There's a door right there.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,470
Stop making excuses.

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,180
I know everything

58
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,470
that you do

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,860
behind my back.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,290
But you can't just barge into my room!

61
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,190
I didn't allow you to come in.

62
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,350
This is my room, too.

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,130
You said you'd share it with me.

64
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,079
I never said that.

65
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:41,760
Yes, you did.

66
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,550
I remember.

67
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,960
I was still young. That doesn't count.

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,290
Are you going to break your promise to me?

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,430
I can't remember that promise!

70
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,470
You have no proof.

71
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,220
You should get out now.

72
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,340
I'm not going anywhere.

73
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,590
If you're not coming with me, I'll stay here with you instead.

74
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,320
What?!

75
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,450
What's gotten into you?

76
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,120
How can you stay here with me?

77
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,220
I've told you that I will call off the engagement.

78
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,140
You should leave now.

79
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,550
I won't call off the engagement.

80
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,860
What's wrong with you?

81
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,460
What part of no don't you understand?

82
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,980
You're the one who doesn't understand.

83
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,180
You can't just say that you will call off our engagement.

84
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,810
You should be more reasonable.

85
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,480
My God!

86
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,570
What's wrong with you today?

87
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,590
You don't have to be so close when we're talking.

88
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,180
And I'm too tired to get up anymore.

89
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,000
Well...

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,390
Then don't.

91
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,190
That's right!

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,180
I don't have any reasons to be engaged to you.

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,430
Unlike you.

94
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,830
You have too many reasons to get engaged to me.

95
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,430
I already talked to aunt Kewarin.

96
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,860
You...you talked to my mom?

97
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,100
Aunt Kewarin already gave me the permission.

98
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,220
That's not true!

99
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,580
My mom would never let me go live with you.

100
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,840
Do you think I would lie about something like this?

101
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,310
I don't believe you.

102
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,340
She agreed with me.

103
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,390
That it's time

104
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,300
for the two of us

105
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,780
to get to know more about each other.

106
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,800
I will call my mom!

107
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,980
(Austria)

108
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,760
How are you doing, Nu-Kuea?

109
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,560
You haven't called me for a while now.

110
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,240
Mom.

111
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,690
I have something to ask you.

112
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,270
Hello, aunt Kewarin.

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
Oh!

114
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,300
You're with Kuea right now?

115
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,800
Yes.

116
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,460
I'm in his room.

117
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,940
Give it back to me.

118
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,980
I'm going to talk to my mom.

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,990
So when are you going to move in with Hia Lian?

120
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,050
Mom!

121
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,350
Are you serious?

122
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,460
I'm here to take him with me tonight.

123
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,760
But Nu-Kuea won't come with me.

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,970
I see.

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,180
He thinks that you wouldn't allow it.

126
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,070
Nu-Kuea, you didn't pick up my calls, nor did you call me back.

127
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,320
I was going to tell you that I've talked to your dad about this.

128
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,960
You should move in with Hia Lian already.

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
But I don't want to go.

130
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,380
Are you shy?

131
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't have to be shy!

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,540
You said it yourself that you wanted to stay in Thailand.

133
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,510
You wanted to stay with him, right?

134
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,409
That was before.

135
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,320
What about now?

136
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,390
Why?

137
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,900
What did you do?

138
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,880
I didn't!

139
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,820
I didn't do anything.

140
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,620
Auntie Ja told me that you're acting so naughty nowadays.

141
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,670
Isn't that right, Hia Lian?

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,700
Sometimes.

143
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,780
I'm not!

144
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,220
I'm not naughty at all.

145
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,180
Lian, take him with you now.

146
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,840
And keep an eye on him.

147
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,830
Mom!

148
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,660
Or do you want to come live in Austria with me?

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,470
I don't want to.

150
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,800
Then you have to listen to Hia, alright?

151
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,780
Be a good boy.

152
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,640
Lian, if he doesn't listen to you, you can call me anytime.

153
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,830
Mom... you've kept in touch with Hia Lian this whole time?

154
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,890
Of course!

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,820
Since I've already given permission for Hia Lia be your guardian.

156
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,810
I will report everything to you, aunt Kewarin.

157
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,460
Alright. Have fun and be nice to each other!

158
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,790
Mom.

159
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,710
I'll call you later.

160
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,450
This is unfair!

161
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,740
How can you let my mom force me like this?

162
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,169
I'm not playing games.

163
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,090
And I'm not here to negotiate with you.

164
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,050
You have to listen to what aunt Kewarin and I say.

165
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,590
So you can always keep an eye on me?

166
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,470
You're going to imprison me and won't let me go anywhere, right?

167
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,030
Just tell me what you want to do.

168
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,220
Why are you hiding things from me?

169
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,430
Hia...

170
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,150
You know?

171
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,100
Know what?

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,110
Are you hiding something from me?

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,140
He's got me trapped.

174
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,250
God, what should I do?

175
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,930
Bring only what you need today.

176
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,260
I already told auntie Ja to pack all the necessities for you.

177
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,760
We can come back for everything else tomorrow.

178
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,360
Fine. I will go with you.

179
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,820
Under one condition.

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,640
You...

181
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,380
have to give me Pentagon.

182
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,650
Qilin!

183
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,990
My baby!

184
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,080
I'm so sorry!

185
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,640
I have to leave you here alone.

186
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,940
Why are you being so dramatic?

187
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,060
Hia Lian's house is not even far from here.

188
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,120
You're not me, you'll never understand.

189
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,960
Hia Lian will keep an eye on me from now on.

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,350
The distance between his house and my house is like traveling from Bangkok to London.

191
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,460
Hia probably won't have that much time to be keeping an eye on you all the time.

192
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,480
Diao!

193
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,560
Let's go to the circuit.

194
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,940
I want to say goodbye to my baby.

195
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,240
This might be my last chance to ride him!

196
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,380
No way.

197
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,630
Hia Yi is at the circuit today.

198
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,870
I will never get to ride him ever again in this life.

199
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,810
If I knew that this would happen, I would've ridden him more often.

200
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,430
It might not be that bad.

201
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,180
He might let you off in a few days.

202
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,680
I don't think so.

203
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,160
I made the wrong move.

204
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,830
I told him that I wanted to be the owner of Pentagon.

205
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,500
You mean...

206
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,270
If I give you Pentagon,

207
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,820
you'll move in with me?

208
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,430
That's right.

209
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,540
Deal.

210
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,520
What?!

211
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,360
I will give you Pentagon

212
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,960
as an engagement gift.

213
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,930
What?

214
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,240
No!

215
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,580
You should give it to me without wanting anything in return!

216
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,790
How can I give it to you for free?

217
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,490
Pentagon is worth a lot to me.

218
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,250
I've intended to give you Pentagon as a wedding gift anyway.

219
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,400
But if you want it now,

220
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,340
you'll have to take care of it.

221
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
So I'll just give it to you as an engagement gift.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
Why do I have to do that?

223
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,860
So you will understand how much effort I've put into building Pentagon.

224
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,270
You have to take good care of Pentagon, just as much as I did.

225
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,040
You can no longer indulge in yourself

226
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,440
because you have to be responsible for everything.

227
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,610
Not only running the business,

228
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,200
but also taking care of the employees,

229
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,630
customers,

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,820
and the business ecosystem.

231
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,120
Fine. I don't want it anymore.

232
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,100
Actually, I'm glad that you brought this up.

233
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,460
It's time for you to learn how to run this business with me.

234
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,860
I don't know how long Yi will help me.

235
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,980
Pentagon is not his passion.

236
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,590
I heard that there's a rich kid who's always renting out his circuit to drive around all the time.

237
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,950
That's why Yi wants to focus on his own business.

238
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,770
Really?

239
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,230
Okay.

240
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,580
It's a deal.

241
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,110
It's a deal, my ass! Damn you, Hia!

242
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,960
I've never told Hia Yi about what you do.

243
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,640
I know.

244
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,200
But Hia Lian is so smart, it's scary.

245
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,630
I don't know how much he knows right now.

246
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,550
I think...

247
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,850
that night where you got drunk,

248
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,080
Hia Lian knows about it.

249
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,380
How come?

250
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,240
Did you tell Hia Yi?

251
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,770
No.

252
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,110
I didn't tell him.

253
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,760
But that night that I went back early...

254
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,360
There's one thing...

255
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,910
that I haven't told you yet.

256
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,520
What is it?

257
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,580
Well...

258
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
Hia Yi was waiting for me right in front of Jay's club.

259
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,880
What?!

260
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,850
How did Hia Yi know that you were at Jay's club?

261
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,360
I have no idea.

262
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,510
But if Hia Yi knew,

263
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,960
then Hia Lian probably knew it too.

264
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,060
Maybe...

265
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,520
The guy who kissed you that night was Hia Lian?!

266
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,930
Hey!

267
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,380
Don't say that!

268
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,190
I'm scared to even think of that possibility.

269
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,950
But it's possible, isn't it?

270
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,990
It is possible.

271
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,970
Fine, I'll move in with you.

272
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,540
I need more time to prepare myself.

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,780
One month.

274
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,600
No.

275
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,410
One week.

276
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,040
Now.

277
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,260
Five days then.

278
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:47,910
One day.

279
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,680
Three!

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,400
I have to pack my belongings.

281
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
I have to finish my homework.

282
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,780
I have to finish my project, too.

283
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,900
Can I have three days to prepare myself, please?

284
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,350
Three days, then.

285
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,320
I will prepare the room for you.

286
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,910
You have to keep your promise.

287
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,760
Do not run away.

288
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,710
Or else...

289
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,270
I'll personally go to your university and carry you home.

290
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,080
Actually...

291
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,620
I think Hia is acting very weird.

292
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,820
Yeah.

293
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,040
It seems like he loves you way too much.

294
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,640
That's right.

295
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,180
He's never been like this before.

296
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Why didn't he say anything?

297
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,330
Maybe... he has a plan?

298
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,670
What does he want from me?

299
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,230
I don't think he actually wants me to live with him.

300
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,060
I think he has a hidden agenda.

301
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,340
He even called my mom to ask for permission beforehand.

302
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,310
I will figure out what he's trying to do.

303
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,700
I will not be a well-behaved Nu-Kuea forever.

304
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,430
Maybe...

305
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,310
He's keeping secrets from you.

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,960
Exactly.

307
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,870
That's why I've decided to move in with him.

308
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,990
I will find out what he's trying to do.

309
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,130
And then I will call off the engagement.

310
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,330
Here's the logo design.

311
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,960
We will put the logo on these columns.

312
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,600
And there will be a flag on every pit.

313
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,630
If everything is alright, I'll go back to my office and get started.

314
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,250
Okay.

315
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,180
Secretary Kim.

316
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,490
Secretary Kim.

317
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,640
Send off our guest.

318
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,170
Follow me, then. What are you waiting for?

319
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,310
Well, please excuse me.

320
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,690
Our secretaries

321
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,830
all have a unique character.

322
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,760
besides the logo around the circuit,

323
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,180
it will appear on our social media platforms too, right?

324
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,050
Don't worry, sir.

325
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,960
You're our main sponsor.

326
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,150
I can even change the name of this circuit to...

327
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,930
'Kilen International Circuit' if you want.

328
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,250
Do you mean that?

329
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,740
I'm serious.

330
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,340
Give me ten million.

331
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,650
I'll change it right away.

332
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,250
My dear, don't you know?

333
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,910
That I can give you more than that.

334
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,410
You give me the creeps.

335
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,510
You should only say these sort of things to your fiancé.

336
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,320
It's much harder to please Nu-Kuea.

337
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,160
I even told him I would give him Pentagon,

338
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,500
but he denied it.

339
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,140
You're actually going to give him Pentagon?

340
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:06,310
Yeah.

341
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,030
In the end...

342
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,210
Pentagon,

343
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:10,250
Kilen,

344
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,079
everything will be his.

345
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,550
But right now, I'm pretty sure...

346
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,180
he just wants to test me.

347
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,310
He probably thinks that I will never give him Pentagon.

348
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,450
Did you know that Kon-Diao and Nu-Kuea always come here without you knowing?

349
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,210
You knew it...

350
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,030
yet you've never told me.

351
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,670
I don't have to waste my time letting you know.

352
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,340
You'll find out anyway.

353
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,630
And even if I told you, you probably wouldn't believe me.

354
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,480
Also, I don't want to interfere with other people's lives.

355
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,120
Before you start accusing him of keeping secrets from you,

356
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,610
I think the problem is the way that you're dealing with him.

357
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,310
Are you talking about me

358
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,610
or yourself?

359
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,140
I'm super chill.

360
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm not strict like you.

361
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,640
Then where do you think

362
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,200
Kon-Diao is right now?

363
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,680
No idea.

364
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,760
You don't know.

365
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
And you're still being super chill about it?

366
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,480
Hello.

367
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,810
Is Nong Diao home?

368
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,760
Did he tell you where he was going?

369
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,670
Do you know what time he will come back?

370
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,030
Nevermind.

371
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,160
Nothing.

372
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,080
Thank you.

373
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,880
You can't find him?

374
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm not trying to find him.

375
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,300
Everyone!

376
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,360
We're going to practice penalty kicks today.

377
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,920
In case I'm in the penalty area

378
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,030
and pretend to fall to show off my superb acting skills.

379
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,140
You all must be able to score a penalty.

380
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,370
You cannot miss.

381
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,630
And this is our goalkeeper.

382
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,790
You guys already know how good he is.

383
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,250
I'll show you how to shoot the ball.

384
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,750
You just have to watch

385
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,890
and do it like me.

386
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,720
This is what you shouldn't do.

387
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,120
I just showed you what would happen if you failed to score.

388
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,820
Watch and learn. Do not do that.

389
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:03,720
It's okay.

390
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,230
Next time.

391
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,000
Next!

392
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,320
This is what you can achieve from a consistent meditation practice.

393
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,450
You never disappointed me.

394
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay.

395
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,820
It's time for our secret weapon.

396
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,520
Kuea!

397
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,040
Kuea!

398
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,810
What?

399
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,720
It's your turn! What are you daydreaming about?

400
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,450
Okay, okay.

401
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,120
Shoot it, Kuea!

402
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,650
Just tell me what you want to do.

403
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,270
Are you hiding something from me?

404
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,250
Why aren't you shooting?!

405
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,080
Shoot!

406
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,310
Yay!

407
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,050
Yay!

408
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,690
You really never let me down!

409
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,970
That was a nice kick!

410
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,060
I want to check the VAR.

411
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,550
I want to witness when young master Kuea kicked the ball hard with power!

412
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,530
His shoe was flying through the sky!

413
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,200
Syn-Samer went right up to save the ball.

414
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,000
But he only caught his shoe instead.

415
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,900
Good thing the shoe didn't smack him in the face.

416
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,800
It would've been funny though.

417
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,100
I'm sorry, Syn.

418
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,680
I didn't mean to do that.

419
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,600
It's okay.

420
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,690
It was just an accident.

421
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,010
Kuea.

422
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,280
Syn said it's okay, so don't worry about it.

423
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,880
No.

424
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,680
I didn't feel bad about that.

425
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,570
I'm thinking about something else.

426
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
What are you thinking about then?

427
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,600
If there's something on your mind,

428
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,720
listening to a sermon might help.

429
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,690
But if you don't have time,

430
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,640
making merit can make you feel better too.

431
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,770
I thought you guys already went home.

432
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,470
But you're all here playing soccer.

433
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,490
We play soccer every Tuesday.

434
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,240
You can come join us.

435
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,530
Then, I'll join next Tuesday.

436
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,470
You gave this to the right person.

437
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
This is good stuff.

438
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,690
This one's for you.

439
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,170
Thanks.

440
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,900
Usually, Kuea only drinks Kilen mineral water.

441
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,600
Since his fiancé's the owner of that brand.

442
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,170
Fiancé?

443
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,080
That's right.

444
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,550
Kuea's fiancé is the owner of the Kilen brand.

445
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,070
We're no longer engaged.

446
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,610
What?

447
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,830
How come?

448
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,250
How come we didn't know about this?

449
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,550
Forget it.

450
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,760
It's nothing.

451
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,530
Hey!

452
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,420
-You're not going to tell me anything?
-I'm out of here.

453
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:18,710
Kuea, where are you going?

454
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,310
Kuea, wait!

455
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,250
Kuea is seeking solitude.

456
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,840
It'd be better if you don't disturb him.

457
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:30,700
Okay.

458
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,820
I missed the chance this time.

459
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,940
But Kuea is single now.

460
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,800
So, I still have a chance.

461
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,270
Thanks to you, Syn.

462
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,490
For bringing up that topic.

463
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,970
They're too close. Why don't they just kiss?

464
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,020
Exactly.

465
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,030
Nuer is this kind of person?

466
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,490
Syn.

467
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,310
What's wrong? Why is your face red?

468
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,430
Inhale.

469
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,210
Exhale.

470
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,830
Anger makes you stupid. Anger is temporary madness.

471
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,830
Forgive and forget. Don't hold grudges.

472
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,060
Foei.

473
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,110
Yes, sir.

474
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,340
You saw the room, right?

475
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,750
Yes, sir.

476
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,300
Yes, sir.

477
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,090
Tell someone to come and clear the room.

478
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,690
Keep the things in there somewhere else.

479
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,310
Clean up the room.

480
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,280
Prepare everything as I've told you.

481
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,950
Yes, sir.

482
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,950
Make sure everything is ready before Friday.

483
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,890
Before Nu-Kuea comes.

484
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,380
Yes, sir.

485
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,550
Foei.

486
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,030
Yes, sir.

487
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,510
Make sure everything's perfect.

488
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,790
Make it so that Nu-Kuea will never want to leave this house.

489
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,160
Of course, sir.

490
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Don't forget to go to the toilet.

491
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,360
Yes, sir!

492
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,640
(Freedom)

493
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,250
Let's warm up.

494
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,490
You guys need to stretch a lot.

495
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,850
Teacher Diao is here!

496
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,030
Hello, teacher Diao!

497
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,710
Hello, everyone!

498
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,080
I'll go to change my clothes first.

499
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,910
Are you guys ready?

500
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,790
Let's continue with warmups.

501
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,510
Stretch your arms, too.

502
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
(Freedom)

503
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,560
Kyeong-rye!

504
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,200
Joonbi.

505
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,140
Juchum Seogi Hana.

506
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,140
One punch. Hana!

507
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,860
Dul!

508
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,480
Hana!

509
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,020
Dul!

510
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,520
Hana!

511
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,940
Dul!

512
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,500
Hana!

513
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,820
Dul!

514
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,040
He even has a black belt?

515
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,060
Hana, dul!

516
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,300
Hana, dul, set!

517
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,200
Hana, dul, set!

518
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,500
Hana, dul, set!

519
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Hana!

520
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,320
Dul!

521
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,760
Hana, dul!

522
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,340
Why do you have to care for

523
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,060
and worry about him all the time?

524
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,740
Even when you've never admitted what kind of relationship you have with Kon-Diao.

525
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,500
And also,

526
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,020
you two are not engaged like Nu-Kuea and I.

527
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,820
I want to know why you guys have to live together.

528
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,600
You have a responsibility and a promise to keep.

529
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,560
As for me...

530
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,700
I once did something wrong towards him.

531
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,950
I'm trying to make amends for what I did.

532
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,320
One punch. Hana!

533
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,000
Dul!

534
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,420
If it wasn't because of me,

535
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,260
Kon-Diao wouldn't have lost a part of his childhood memories.

536
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,810
You've never told me this.

537
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,430
Do you feel guilty,

538
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,120
or do you feel sorry for him?

539
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,440
Both.

540
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,220
Does Kon-Diao know about this?

541
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,820
No.

542
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,100
And do you love him?

543
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,100
It doesn't matter how I feel.

544
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,460
It doesn't matter whether I love him or not.

545
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,280
I will take care of him anyway.

546
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,380
It's the right thing to do.

547
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,280
It's what I should do.

548
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,860
This is why I get angry when he comes back home late.

549
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,360
Or when he goes out but doesn't tell me.

550
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,760
It makes me worried.

551
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,800
I'm scared that something bad will happen to him.

552
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,620
I want him to have a better life.

553
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,830
It's the price I have to pay.

554
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,820
I told him that I will call off the engagement.

555
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,960
But he won't let me.

556
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,370
He wants me to move in with him.

557
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,440
What does this have to do with my nightclub?

558
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,540
If you want to break up with him, just do it.

559
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,960
Why do you have to care so much?

560
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,560
You didn't want to call off the engagement, did you?

561
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,340
You're just being sulky.

562
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm not.

563
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,800
I've already decided that I will call off the engagement.

564
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,840
Then there's nothing he can do about it.

565
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,060
Even if takes you in to live with him,

566
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,840
you don't have to listen to everything he says.

567
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,300
Didn't you say that you will be yourself from now on?

568
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,500
What's wrong with you now?

569
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,240
I don't want to make a big deal out of it.

570
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,480
That's why I did what I was told.

571
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,920
And also,

572
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,260
it's a chance to find out what kind of person Hia Lian is.

573
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,360
And the most important thing is...

574
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,220
my mom really believes in everything he says.

575
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,620
She believes him more than you?

576
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,960
Yeah.

577
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,420
Just let it be for now.

578
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,200
I will find a way to come here and perform again.

579
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Alright, whatever floats your boat.

580
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,740
Do whatever you want, man.

581
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,820
Hello.

582
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,640
I already sent you the file.

583
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
Also...

584
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,010
I might not be able to produce music and upload videos on Youtube for a while.

585
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,900
I'm moving out.

586
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,360
I'm so sorry.

587
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:20,920
Alright.

588
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,780
It's already the second day.

589
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,840
Only one day left.

590
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,400
Do I actually have to go?

591
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,940
I've never been on a dinner cruise before.

592
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,790
It has a very nice atmosphere.

593
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,570
I was wondering

594
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,960
what it would be like.

595
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,080
Would the atmosphere be sparkly?

596
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,300
Will the cruise keep moving?

597
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,800
Always swaying?

598
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,560
You like it, right?

599
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,040
I do.

600
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,270
I'm so happy.

601
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,520
Let's think of this as an early birthday dinner too.

602
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,690
Your birthday is next week, but it's not on a Friday.

603
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,300
And I'm not sure if I'll be available on your birthdate or not.

604
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,670
Okay.

605
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,350
It was going well until now...

606
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,170
The river looks beautiful at night, doesn't it?

607
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,760
I thought you would come to see me

608
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,920
on my birthday.

609
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,620
I'll give you your present today instead.

610
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,760
It's so big.

611
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,280
Can I open it?

612
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,900
Do you like it?

613
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,080
Yes.

614
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,480
They're so cute.

615
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,870
They are Qilins.

616
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,420
Similar to my name.

617
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,880
The blue one is Kilen Wang.

618
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,880
The red one is Nu-Kuea Keerati.

619
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,620
Thank you so much, Hia.

620
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,840
Do you really want me to stay with you?

621
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,520
Why?

622
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,040
It's not because...

623
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,500
you love me, right?

624
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,840
Of course not.

625
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,220
I just want to be able to control your behavior.

626
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,980
Why?

627
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,390
What about that night...

628
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,000
The guy who sent me home and kissed me,

629
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,450
was it you?

630
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,100
Obviously not. Are you crazy?

631
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:29,960
If I find out that you got drunk and kissed a stranger, I will lock you in the dungeon for the rest of your life!

632
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,540
What should I do?

633
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,180
The closer we are, the more dangerous this gets.

634
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,220
But I can't not go.

635
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,920
Hia.

636
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,940
Why do you have to force me?

637
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,840
Foei.

638
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,620
Yes, sir.

639
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,190
Let me help you, young master Kuea.

640
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,800
Please take care of him for me.

641
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,400
If he needs anything, you can call me anytime.

642
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,560
Of course.

643
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
I will take good care of him.

644
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,580
There's no need for you to worry.

645
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,000
He will never be out of my sight.

646
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,130
I won't let him go astray.

647
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,560
This way, sir.

648
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,960
Nu-Kuea.

649
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:22,870
This way.

650
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,740
Hia.

651
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,460
We do love each other, right?

652
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,160
I think you're misunderstanding something.

653
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,960
But you said that you will always stay with me.

654
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,880
You said that you will propose to me.

655
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,220
That's right. I will.

656
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,460
If you ask me whether I love you or not,

657
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,180
I don't think it's love yet.

658
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,600
Marrying or being with someone

659
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,260
doesn't mean that you have to love that person.

660
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,770
Wow.

661
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,350
This is not like how I've imagined it in my head.

662
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,160
Hia actually has good taste.

663
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,380
Take Nu-Kuea's luggage up to his room.

664
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,090
Yes, sir.

665
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,350
And from now on, come here once a week to clean up.

666
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:23,620
Yes, sir.

667
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,580
Hia, do you like this style of house?

668
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,650
It's like a resort.

669
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,890
I want my house to be a place where I can actually get some rest.

670
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,720
Do you like it?

671
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,070
Give me.

672
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,070
Let me help you.

673
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,040
Hia.

674
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,710
This is another zone within my house.

675
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,120
You can do whatever you want here.

676
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,150
But...

677
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,340
What is it, Hia?

678
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,740
You must not go into that room.

679
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,640
Why?

680
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,500
No particular reason.

681
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,680
Let's go.

682
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,480
I'll show you your bedroom.

683
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,240
Nu-Kuea.

684
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:04,800
Yes?

685
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,920
This way.

686
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,260
Alright.

687
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,320
This is your room.

688
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,100
Do you like it?

689
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,580
Well...

690
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,220
Not bad.

691
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,460
What about my clothes...

692
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:01,700
Why...

693
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,100
Why are your clothes in this room too?

694
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,560
This is also my room.

695
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,680
What?

696
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,540
We're going to sleep together.

697
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,640
In the same room.

698
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,340
Did he plan to not let me go out anywhere?

699
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,560
He must have an evil plan.

700
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,360
What's this?

701
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,550
He plays this too?

702
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,760
Is this a trap?

703
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,050
Does he only eat healthy food?

704
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,380
Teacher Diao, there's a new kid today?

705
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,080
Please look after me.

706
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,460
Teacher Diao.

707
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,700
I didn't mean to laugh at you.

708
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,140
I'm not here to talk about that.

709
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,370
I'm only working here as a part-time job after class.

710
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,260
That's why you didn't tell me?

711
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,310
I'm so sorry, Hia.

712
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,150
I've never thought a small club that I've built with my own hands

713
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,870
would catch a capitalist's eye like you.

714
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,410
You should consider it.

715
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,410
Because I wouldn't want to have a competitor like Kirin.

716
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,320
Hello, aunt Kewarin.

717
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,000
I can handle his naughtiness.

718
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,020
I hope that my plan to discipline him will work.

719
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,270
I promised your mother that I will take good care of you.

720
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,720
So please, let me keep my promise.
