1
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,200
I believe in marriage.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,000
To have and to hold from this day forward.

3
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:30,900
For good, for worse, for richer, for poorer.

4
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,720
In sickness and health.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,600
Until the death do us part.

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,870
I want to marry someone I love.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,560
A fiancé that I've been engaged to since we were young.

8
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,350
The two of us are so different.

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,900
One comes from a Thai aristocratic family.

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,200
That's me, Kuea Keerati.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,660
Another one is a son of Chinese descent.

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,920
His family moved from China to live in Thailand.

13
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,530
He grew up with nothing, but now he owns companies worth more than ten billion Baht.

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,820
The man who's currently standing right in front of me.

15
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,080
Hia Lian Kilen Wang.

16
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,720
He's my fiancé.

17
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,020
Many people said that my story sounds like a romance novel.

18
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,009
I've been waiting for our marriage which will happen in a couple of years from now.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,590
After my graduation, I will become Kilen Wang's life partner.

20
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,940
I am willing to trade anything and change myself for his happiness.

21
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,300
But why...Why did he have to do that to me?

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,380
Hia.

23
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,930
We do love each other, right?

24
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,790
I think you're misunderstanding something.

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,700
But you said that you will always stay with me.

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
You said...

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,520
You said that you will propose to me.

28
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,120
I will.

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,490
But when I asked you-

31
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,660
If you ask me whether I love you or not...

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,360
I don't think it's love yet.

33
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,420
Hia...

34
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,130
Marrying or being with someone doesn't mean that you have to love that person.

35
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,410
Then since we don't love each other,

36
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,500
we should just call off our engagement.

37
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,100
(Lian Kilen Wang)
(Kuea Keerati)

38
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,750
(One day ago)

39
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,620
Kuea!

40
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,210
Gosh. I almost had a heart attack.

41
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,360
You've finished, right?

42
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,360
Let's go back.

43
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,050
Not yet.

44
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,210
I only completed one lap.

45
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,080
That wasn't even worth the money I spent renting this place yet.

46
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,500
Young master Diao.

47
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,460
You're calling me a young master?

48
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,170
You're acting more like a young master than I am.

49
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,400
Who told you that riding a superbike worth a million Baht in this circuit alone is a good idea?

50
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,220
Hey, everyone needs to de-stress once in a while.

51
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,410
De-stress...

52
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,740
Then why did you bring me with you?

53
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,580
To bring back the memories of our time together in the UK.

54
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,090
Bring back the memories?

55
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,140
That was the UK.

56
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,220
The weather is completely different from here.

57
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,670
But I prefer here.

58
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,420
Aww.

59
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:36,380
I know that the real reason you wanted to come back to Thailand is so that you can stay with your beloved Hia Lian.

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,260
What about you?

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,740
The reason that you want to go home right now is because you're scared that the owner of this place will find out that you're skipping class to be here, right?

62
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,770
Of course!

63
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,480
You know how scary Hia Yi is.

64
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,980
Yeah, I know.

65
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,090
But I don't think he's as scary as Hia Lian.

66
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,620
And yet Young Master Kuea is still acting this naughty!

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
Just let me do what I want today.

68
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:09,250
Tomorrow, I'll have to go back to being Nu-Kuea, Hia Lian's little obedient boy.

69
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,490
But it's okay.

70
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,490
Because my heart is racing for Hia Lian.

71
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,909
The task that is given to my team is to think of a concept that supports the LGBTQ community.

72
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:03,210
I will use two famous trans actresses to show the differences between the products.

73
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,160
The plot for the first trans actress will be comedic.

74
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:16,140
She doesn't drink Kilen water, so her skin isn't fair and white. She never succeeds in anything.

75
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:22,520
Compared to the second trans actress, she has fair, glowing skin, and also a good body shape.

76
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,830
And that's because she drinks Kilen water.

77
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,930
Many people start to-

78
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,020
Stop for a minute.

79
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,310
I have a question.

80
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,050
The idea that you're presenting today,

81
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,020
do you think it's well-thought-out?

82
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,920
Your task is to think of a concept that supports the LGBTQ community.

83
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,520
But you completely failed to do that.

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,020
Your idea is so outdated.

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,730
It's very cliché nowadays to have LGBTQ characters that only portray a comedic story.

86
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,760
Even if I want my products to do well, I still need to be socially responsible for the content I put out.

87
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,250
I will not exaggerate my products in the ads.

88
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,190
And most importantly,

89
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,260
even if some may not come from a wealthy background, everyone has the chance to become successful if they work hard.

90
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,590
I don't think social statuses and social classes has anything to do with this.

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,060
Trust me. I understand this very well.

92
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,770
As for this idea,

93
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,990
you've failed.

94
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,950
Please see yourself out.

95
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,800
Tell the staff at Pentagon that I'm coming tonight.

96
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,770
At 10.15 p.m.

97
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,810
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,250
Is there anything else, sir?

99
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,260
Huh?

100
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,669
Huh?

101
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,300
Oh.

102
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,530
I guess that is a no.

103
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,860
Right.

104
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,660
Why can't he just use his words?

105
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,370
10.15 p.m.

106
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,840
On the dot, like always.

107
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,760
You always come fifteen minutes early.

108
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,940
So, I managed the time for you.

109
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,050
So that you'll arrive here at 10 p.m. on the dot.

110
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,050
How's the situation tonight?

111
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
There's not many people.

112
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,970
But the tables are almost fully booked.

113
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,930
It's a Thursday.

114
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,090
This number of people is good enough.

115
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,130
What about the secret bar?

116
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,520
Secret bar?

117
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,620
I'm talking about Gemini, the bar next to us.

118
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,760
Gemini...

119
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,110
What's so special about it?

120
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,920
There're a lot of people at Gemini today.

121
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,250
Kirin will perform every Thursday at 11 p.m. That's why many fans are gathered there tonight.

122
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,670
Who?

123
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,610
Kirin?

124
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,890
I want to know who Kirin is as well.

125
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,700
♪ Hey, you cutie! ♪

126
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,370
♪ You're making me crazy in love ♪

127
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,580
♪ Where did you learn how to do that? ♪

128
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,170
♪ I can’t handle your cuteness, oh bae ♪

129
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,580
♪ I love you just the way you are, my cutie pie ♪

130
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,870
Kirin! Kirin! Kirin!

131
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,860
That was awesome, man!

132
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,090
Thanks, Jay.

133
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,940
Oh my god.

134
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,560
I just saw this.

135
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,520
You broke a drumstick?

136
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,440
Can we go home now?

137
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,780
Mr. Mysterious Singer.

138
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,590
Kirin.

139
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,480
Come on, Diao.

140
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,120
Why do you always rush me?

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,540
Can I rest for a moment first?

142
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,980
I've used up all my energy today.

143
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm so freaking tired.

144
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,260
No, you can't!

145
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,090
I won't make it in time before Hia Yi calls to check on me at midnight.

146
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,660
Fine!

147
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,980
Let's go back then.

148
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,180
Damn.

149
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,500
I was going to buy you some drinks.

150
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,210
I should give you a tip.

151
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,560
I can sell more drinks every time you come here.

152
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,340
Let's do that next time, Jay.

153
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,160
Tomorrow is a Friday.

154
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,240
So what?

155
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,610
Friday is a good day.

156
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,210
Don't you know?

157
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,360
Every Friday, Mr. Kirin has to transform into little Nu-Kuea and go on a date with Hia Lian.

158
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
He will never miss this date.

159
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,460
Even if he has a class scheduled, he will beg his professor until he's allowed to change classes.

160
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,200
So that's why you never agree to play here on Friday.

161
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,110
I thought you were performing somewhere else.

162
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,720
No!

163
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,200
Do not mess with Nu-Kuea and Hia Lian's Friday dates!

164
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,180
Why don't you just ask him to come here for your Friday date then?

165
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,900
No way!

166
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,740
I can't let him know what I'm doing here.

167
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,330
I can't let him know that I'm a singer and a drummer named Kirin.

168
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,860
Why?

169
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,460
He thinks that I'm a polite and well-behaved kid.

170
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,300
Mr. Wang, this way.

171
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,270
He's handsome. He's rich. He's the best. He's totally my type.

172
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,170
My business partner will be joining us today.

173
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,360
They've been asking to meet me for a while,

174
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,930
but I just don't have time.

175
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,260
So you decided to use our time instead?

176
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,640
It's okay, Hia.

177
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I understand.

178
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,220
Hello, Mr. Lian.

179
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,640
Hello, Ms. Jennie.

180
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,460
Please have a seat.

181
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,430
You brought your brother along too?

182
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,540
You're so cute!

183
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,430
What's your name?

184
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,780
Hello.

185
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,140
My name is Kuea Keerati.

186
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,880
I'm Mr. Lian's...

187
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,130
fiancé.

188
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,760
Aww, you're so funny!

189
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,100
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Kuea.

190
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,950
Oh right, Mr. Lian!

191
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,810
Could you come a little bit closer? I want to show you something.

192
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:08,390
Look at this. I think it will be great if you become the brand ambassador since you're very ambitious and hardworking.

193
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,290
If your team thinks that it's a good idea, I will accept the offer.

194
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,410
I'm so relieved!

195
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,970
You're so good at understanding the situation.

196
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,700
I really love working with someone like you.

197
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,330
Is something wrong, Mr. Kuea?

198
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,500
Nothing. I just feel that I might...

199
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,840
have a sore throat.

200
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,280
Wow! The food is here!

201
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,470
But it seems like the kind of food that will make your throat even worse.

202
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,790
Do you think you can eat it?

203
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,890
Actually, I haven't eaten anything yet.

204
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,670
Mr. Lian, may I join you?

205
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,880
Can she? Nu-Kuea?

206
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,030
Hell no!

207
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,520
What kind of date has three people in it?

208
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Can you be more considerate of my feeling just for once?

209
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,170
It's so obvious that she's here to flirt.

210
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,580
And what the hell is wrong with your hand?

211
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,240
Why does it keep slithering around like a snake?

212
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,750
His fiancé is sitting right here.

213
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,460
How dare you sit here and flirt shamelessly?

214
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,780
And you!

215
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,400
You know that she's here to flirt.

216
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,880
Why are you sitting here like a statue and letting her rub you like that?

217
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
You probably bring her enough good fortune already.

218
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,130
How dare you do this to me?!

219
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,810
This is not what you call a date!

220
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,020
Nu-Kuea.

221
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,720
Are you okay with that?

222
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,650
Of course, Hia.

223
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,580
Feel free to join us, Ms. Jennie.

224
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,450
Aww, you're so cute!

225
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,310
Excuse me, can I have the menu?

226
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,920
This looks so good!

227
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,970
Calm down, Kuea.

228
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,130
I understand now.

229
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,599
I don't know what to say except...

230
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,329
you have to keep fighting.

231
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,540
Fifteen seconds left!

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,520
Come on! Faster, Kuea!

233
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,800
Inhale.

234
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,420
Exhale.

235
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,350
He's doing a practical test, not meditating!

236
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,950
Faster! The time's running out.

237
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,180
Nine.

238
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,650
Five.

239
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm done!

240
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,810
Good job on managing to retrieve this nut.

241
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,400
But this is not the one that I wanted.

242
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,580
I feel sorry for you.

243
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,000
At least, I will give you a point for your effort.

244
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,390
Professor!

245
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,700
Damn, Kuea.

246
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,820
(Faculty of Engineering)

247
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,050
I'm off.

248
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,210
Bye guys.

249
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,150
You're not coming to BBQ with us?

250
00:18:59,230 --> 00:18:59,900
Nah.

251
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,010
I have a date.

252
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,730
"Atta hi attano nato."

253
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,740
God helps those who help themselves.

254
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,010
Amen.

255
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,350
I'm not in the mood to party after I almost failed that test.

256
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,060
I gotta go.

257
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,940
I have to take a shower and get changed too.

258
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,620
Hia is a perfectionist.

259
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,760
Why don't you try going out on a date like this for once? A little bit shabby, y'know what I mean?

260
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,900
Maybe he'll like something new.

261
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,990
Impossible.

262
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,530
His fiancé still thinks that he's majoring in computer engineering.

263
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,600
Really?

264
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,490
Yeah.

265
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,790
The fourth precept states that one must abstain from telling lies.

266
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,790
Amen.

267
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,090
Come on, let's go!

268
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,920
BBQ!

269
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
Mr. Lian.

270
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,470
Young master Kuea Keerati is waiting for you outside the door.

271
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,380
Let him in.

272
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,060
Yes, sir.

273
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,350
Hello, Hia.

274
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,020
7.09 p.m.

275
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:11,030
I'm sorry, Hia. I had an exam today and the teacher won't let us leave. That's why I'm late.

276
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,220
It's okay.

277
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,910
Next time, you should let me know in advance so I won't have to worry about whether anything happened to you.

278
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,090
I'm only nine minutes late.

279
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,940
Let's go.

280
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,470
I booked the French restaurant that you like.

281
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,090
French food again?

282
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,150
When did I tell you that I like it?

283
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,170
Mr. Lian.

284
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,770
What's wrong?

285
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,380
The factory just called saying that there are issues with all the lots produced on the 24th.

286
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,030
Contact the factory manager for me right now.

287
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,240
Yes, sir.

288
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,020
Hia.

289
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,020
Well...

290
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,210
What about our date?

291
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,010
Nu-Kuea, wait for me for a bit.

292
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,200
This is an urgent matter.

293
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,890
Let me sort out this problem first.

294
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,410
Hello.

295
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,380
Yes.

296
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,090
I'll deal with it myself.

297
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,650
Don't worry.

298
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,220
This is a good song.

299
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,210
Do you want to listen?

300
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,010
I'm sorry, Hia.

301
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,850
Are you bored of waiting for me?

302
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,850
Of course! I'm so bored!

303
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,910
But since it's you...

304
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm not bored.

305
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,490
I'm sorry. This problem is bigger than I thought.

306
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,070
It's okay.

307
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,730
I can wait.

308
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,730
I've been waiting for you my whole life.

309
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,530
Because...

310
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,830
I love you.

311
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,150
Did I say something wrong?

312
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,640
Hia.

313
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,370
What's the matter?

314
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
You want to go home?

315
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,700
No, not yet.

316
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,810
I'm just here to see what you're doing outside.

317
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,400
I came out to get the document.

318
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,170
If you want to go back, I'll let Foei drive you home.

319
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,120
I said I don't want to go back home yet.

320
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,780
I will wait.

321
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,150
No matter how long, I will wait for you.

322
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:16,100
But it's pretty late already.

323
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't think we can go out anymore.

324
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,120
Are you hungry?

325
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,510
Do you want to order anything?

326
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,850
It's okay.

327
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,880
I'm not hungry.

328
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,580
I don't want to bother you.

329
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,790
I'll wait until you finish so you can send me home.

330
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,250
Up to you then.

331
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
Hia.

332
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,970
Did I say something wrong?

333
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,750
Did I disturb you because I was too loud?

334
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,820
Or maybe you don't want me to be here?

335
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,130
That's not the reason.

336
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,320
Then why did you walk away from me?

337
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,730
I didn't.

338
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,660
I just came out to get some documents.

339
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,460
That's not true.

340
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,010
Every time I say that word...

341
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,810
It's like you're sick of it.

342
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,280
What are you talking about?

343
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,130
I don't understand.

344
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,070
The word "love."

345
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,530
You've never said that word to me once.

346
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,300
Do you even love me?

347
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,730
The reason for our engagement...

348
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,370
Did you do it because...

349
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,670
The reason for our engagement

350
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,980
is because of your grandfather.

351
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,300
Our young master is so adorable.

352
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,620
He's good-looking and has fair skin, just like his noble family.

353
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,750
Mrs. Kewarin, you also look very happy and lively.

354
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,610
Lian, do you want to have a closer look at him?

355
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,080
Come on over.

356
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,030
His name is Kuea.

357
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,100
Kuea.

358
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,060
Yes.

359
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,750
Lian, you're his older brother, okay?

360
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,540
Okay.

361
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,030
Lian.

362
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,540
Please take care of him.

363
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,950
Can you do it?

364
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,180
Of course.

365
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,590
Sir, Mr. Ping wants to discuss the business matter with you.

366
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,110
About the ice manufacturing plant, right?

367
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,330
I want to create a new branch and expand the business.

368
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,950
Kuea!

369
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,540
Come here for a blessing from your grandpa.

370
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,910
Tell Hia Lian to come too.

371
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,480
Hia Lian, come here.

372
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,670
Hia Lian.

373
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,470
I don't think it's appropriate, sir.

374
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,540
This ceremony is only for the family members.

375
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,020
It's okay.

376
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,700
I consider Lian as one of my grandsons.

377
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,740
Lian, come here.

378
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,090
Pour water on grandpa's hands.

379
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,310
I hope that you will grow up well.

380
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,740
Yes, sir.

381
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,490
I wish you good health and a good heart.

382
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,810
I hope that you two will grow up well, be good and be smart.

383
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,730
I hope that both of you will be good to each other and always take care of each other.

384
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,490
I love you, grandpa.

385
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,930
Who else do you love?

386
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,200
I love grandpa Auea, mommy, daddy, and Hia Lian.

387
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,830
I love you the most, Hia Lian.

388
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:45,090
This holy thread tied around your wrist is like my blessing that will remain with you forever.

389
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,900
It's a promise.

390
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,130
A promise that Lian will always look after Kuea.

391
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,800
Yes, sir.

392
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:57,550
We got the same one! Mommy and daddy have it too!

393
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,910
I knew it. Grandpa arranged this wedding for us because Kuea loves Hia Lian, right?

394
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,590
You can't get married yet.

395
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,650
You're too young for that.

396
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,460
We'll wait until you're old enough.

397
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,210
How old would I have to be?

398
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,510
Wait until you complete your bachelor's degree.

399
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,530
For now, you two are engaged.

400
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,510
What is 'engage'?

401
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,450
To be engaged means that you two will love each other forever.

402
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,280
Wait until the time is right for you to get married.

403
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,560
Dad, but Lian...

404
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,830
"One true friend is worth more than a thousand fake ones."

405
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,710
It is my duty that I promised your grandfather.

406
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,070
He was the most respected benefactor of my family.

407
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,860
That's it?

408
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,990
I thought that-

409
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,700
We have been very close since we were kids.

410
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,170
You don't have any siblings.

411
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,940
You only have me to play with.

412
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,700
You have known me since you were born.

413
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,860
Maybe that makes you think that you-

414
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,610
Hia.

415
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,710
Hia.

416
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,200
We love each other, right?

417
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,220
I think you misunderstood.

418
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,780
But you said that you will always stay with me.

419
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,170
You said...

420
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,840
You said that you will propose to me.

421
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,280
That's right.

422
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,290
I will.

423
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,240
But when I ask you-

424
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,150
If you ask me whether I love you or not,

425
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,690
I don't think it's love yet.

426
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,240
Hia...

427
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,290
Marrying or being with someone doesn't mean that you have to love that person.

428
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,340
You should go back first.

429
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,630
My work is not finished yet.

430
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,450
I'll ask someone to drop you off.

431
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,100
Since we don't love each other,

432
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,340
we should just call off our engagement.

433
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,070
I don't think that is necessary.

434
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,680
We can just live separately.

435
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,210
It's not just you who is a part of this engagement.

436
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,310
This matter is between the two of us.

437
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,470
I have the right to make the decision too.

438
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,890
Nu-Kuea, stop being sacastic.

439
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm not being sarcastic.

440
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,410
I don't know how to do that.

441
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,260
I just realized it now...

442
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,310
that I shouldn't bother you anymore.

443
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,710
All these years,

444
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,260
I have been taking up too much of your time.

445
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,950
Nu-Kuea!

446
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,820
I keep wondering why suddenly everything I do can never please you.

447
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,210
I am not angry yet.

448
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,450
But I will be soon.

449
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,900
But you, are you mad at me because I didn't take you on a date?

450
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,630
You can think what you want.

451
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,260
But I'm not saying this because I'm mad at you.

452
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,199
I just can't stand it anymore.

453
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,940
You can't stand it?

454
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,650
Wow, you're amazing.

455
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,260
Hey! What's the problem at the factory about?

456
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,020
The problem at the factory is not as hard to deal with as Nu-Kuea's problem right now.

457
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,050
Nu-Kuea.

458
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,480
What's wrong?

459
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,610
You should find one good reason...

460
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,130
prepare to explain why I want to call off our engagement.

461
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,870
There's already one reason that comes to mind right now.

462
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
I will say this very frankly.

463
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,050
I want to marry a human.

464
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,110
Not a doll.

465
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,700
Am I as cute as a doll?

466
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,090
You are an...

467
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,630
Annabelle doll.

468
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,850
If you'll excuse me.

469
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,380
Good bye.

470
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,540
Whoever's out there, please drive him home.

471
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,790
Anyone who's not scared of ghosts.

472
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,380
If you ask me whether I love you or not,

473
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,410
I don't think it's love yet.

474
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,060
You asshole!

475
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,270
I'm sorry!

476
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,280
I'm so sorry!

477
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,050
A dog ran out in front of the car!

478
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,510
I'll continue to drive then.

479
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,960
Diao, let's meet at my secret house in 30 minutes.

480
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,240
Don't say no. This is an emergency.

481
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,360
Okay, I'm coming right now.

482
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,700
What happened, Kuea?!

483
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,380
Hia...

484
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:51,160
Hia said he doesn't love me.

485
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,720
He said he got engaged with me because it was his duty.

486
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,420
It's okay, Kuea.

487
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,230
Look at these tears.

488
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,540
Calm down first.

489
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,110
Tell me about it slowly.

490
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,120
Let's talk inside.

491
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,680
Is it very serious?

492
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
Take a break if it's too much.

493
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,740
You seem too distracted to solve any problems right now.

494
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,420
I can't.

495
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,850
I have to solve this problem by tonight.

496
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,890
You mean about your fiancé?

497
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,640
I mean work.

498
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,750
I don't know what the problem is between you two.

499
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,750
But I've never seen you like this before.

500
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,490
What happened?

501
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,530
Suddenly...

502
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,150
Nu-Kuea wants to call off our engagement.

503
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,440
That's because he's feeling slighted.

504
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,230
I know.

505
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:05,850
But...

506
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,870
I don't know.

507
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,260
Do you want to call off the engagement?

508
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,750
I will never call off my engagement with Nu-Kuea.

509
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,420
Why is that?

510
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:21,050
Don't tell me that you're actually serious about this engagement that the elders set up for you.

511
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,000
I don't understand.

512
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,790
I mean, it's okay for two guys to love each other.

513
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:35,120
But you know that your engagement with Nu-Kuea is not legally valid.

514
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,730
It's actually an arranged marriage.

515
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,460
How can you let that happen?

516
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,100
It doesn't make any sense.

517
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,700
You know nothing.

518
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,730
There's something more than that.

519
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,940
Hello.

520
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,040
Hello.

521
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,910
Thank you for coming today.

522
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,340
It's okay.

523
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,500
It's my pleasure.

524
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,330
Have a seat first.

525
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,620
I have something important to talk to you.

526
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,070
About Kuea.

527
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,770
Yes, sir. Please tell me what you want me to do.

528
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,640
I will do anything.

529
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,080
I want to repay you for the help and kindness you have given my family.

530
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:39,980
Actually, I don't want to use this as a reason to ask for your favor.

531
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,710
You can decline my request.

532
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,350
The reason that I'm asking you this is because I trust you.

533
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,740
And Kuea really loves you.

534
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,530
Yes, sir.

535
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,090
Nu-Kuea is studying in the UK. He will be back in two years.

536
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,130
I don't know if I will live until that day or not.

537
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,060
Of course, you will.

538
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,570
Why are you saying such a thing?

539
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,060
I know myself well.

540
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,820
Do you remember when you were around 11 - 12 years old?

541
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,180
During Songkran.

542
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:20,730
I remember.

543
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,290
We were talking casually about the engagement.

544
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,180
But you were too young to understand at that time.

545
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,100
I do understand.

546
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,520
Right now...

547
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,730
Does your heart still feel the same way?

548
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,130
Do you still love him?

549
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,840
If your heart remains the same,

550
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,130
I hope you will keep the promise you gave me on that day.

551
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,190
Can you do that for me?

552
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,010
So that I can rest in peace.

553
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,450
I...

554
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,090
Am I suitable enough for him?

555
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,050
Trust me. I've never misjudged anyone.

556
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,580
I've been helping your family.

557
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,240
I know that you will become successful when you grow up.

558
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,810
I know that you will take good care of my beloved Nu-Kuea.

559
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,520
You don't have to give us the answer right now.

560
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,030
I just hope that you will consider about it.

561
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,570
Grandpa.

562
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,960
Why did no one tell me anything?

563
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,240
No one told me that he was sick.

564
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,400
Grandpa, you didn't wait for me.

565
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,590
You didn't wait for me.

566
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,070
Grandpa...

567
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,510
Lian.

568
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,780
I have something to talk to you.

569
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:00,460
Yes?

570
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,130
Hm...

571
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,050
Kilen.

572
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,270
Is this your own brand?

573
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,410
Thank you so much for helping me with the funeral.

574
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,890
Not at all.

575
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,300
Oh right, have you talked to Kuea?

576
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,200
I still haven't had a chance to talk to him since he returned from the UK.

577
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,550
I talked to grandpa before he passed away.

578
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,810
About the engagement.

579
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,220
Have you thought about it yet?

580
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,130
Have you decided?

581
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,700
Don't worry, auntie.

582
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,260
I made a promise to grandfather since thirteen years ago.

583
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,170
It is a decision that I made myself.

584
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,920
That I...

585
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,410
I will take care of Nu-Kuea forever.

586
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:13,010

587
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,030

Keep your voice down!

593
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,290
You will annoy your neighbors.

594
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,120
Neighbor?

595
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:32,340
That's right.

596
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,440
Hey, don't worry.

597
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,000
My house has really thick walls.

598
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,620
Because I have to practice playing the drums and singing.

599
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,520
I can do whatever I want in this house.

600
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,800
There is no cold-hearted person in this house to keep an eye on me!

601
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,840
Alright.

602
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,380
Young master Kuea, you can do whatever you want.

603
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,380
I will stay here with you.

604
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,580
I can sing.

605
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,600

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,280
Shit.

609
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,720
Hello, Hia.

610
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:27,690
Hello.

611
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,260
Where are you? What are you doing?

612
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,830
I'm at Kuea's house.

613
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,420
Why are you not going home yet? It's already late.

614
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,330
Well...

615
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,390
I'm about to leave.

616
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,420
Are you drunk?

617
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,540
No, I'm not.

618
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,110
I didn't drink at all, Hia.

619
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,390
Are you sure?

620
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,090
Do you want me to pick you up?

621
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,480
It's okay, Hia.

622
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,330
I can go back by myself.

623
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,300
You too, Hia Yi, don't get drunk.

624
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,810
And drive home safely.

625
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,570
Damn it, Diao. What the hell did you just say?

626
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,710
I must be drunk.

627
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:13,950
Kuea.

628
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,860
Huh?

629
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,340
What?

630
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,370
I have to go back first.

631
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,050
What the hell?

632
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,250
Damn it!

633
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,730
Your friend is heartbroken right now.

634
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,730
What kind of friend are you?

635
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,570
How can you ditch me for a guy?

636
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,540
You know what Hia Yi is like.

637
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,560
He's not as scary as my Hia Lian.

638
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,360
They're both the same.

639
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,490
That's why they're best friends.

640
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,210
Just like you and me.

641
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:53,230
My bestie.

642
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,830
Then you must understand why I have to leave first.

643
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:03,040
Whenever Hia Lian calls you, you'll speed up the engine to reach him in a second.

644
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,200
Speed up the engine? What type of figure of speech is that?

645
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,320
Whatever.

646
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,380
I have to go now.

647
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,040
I'm sorry, man.

648
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,520
See ya!

649
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,530
Bye!

650
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:17,530
Hey! Diao!

651
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,060
You can't just leave me here alone!

652
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,040
Diao!

653
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,260
He calls you because he misses you.

654
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,640
Because he worries about you.

655
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,320
Why does Hia Lian never call me?

656
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,630
You're a jerk!

657
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,870
♪ Hia is not cute at all ♪

658
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:44,690
♪ Where did you learn how to do that? I can't handle this anymore... ♪

659
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,630
Hia!

660
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,220
Why are you here?

661
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,400
Are you mad at me?

662
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:58,960
I'm not.

663
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,400
Can you turn around, please?

664
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:16,910
Hia!

665
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,170
It's ticklish!

666
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,990
Are you still angry at me?

667
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:23,650
Yes.

668
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,880
What can I do to make you forgive me?

669
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,780
Tell me that you love me.

670
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:32,170
Also, tell me that I'm not an Annabelle doll.

671
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,850
Okay.

672
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Turn around then.

673
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:11,920
Hia!

674
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,880
You're such a bad person.

675
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,780
You followed me even in my dreams.

676
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,400
That was not dreamy at all.

677
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,540
Do you really want to call off our engagement, Nu-Kuea?

678
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,060
Kirin.

679
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,960
Do you really think you can fool me?

680
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:48,240
Annabelle.

681
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,440
I don't care about Hia Lian anymore.

682
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,700
I will call off the engagement anyway.

683
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,720
I'm at Kuea's house.

684
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,130
Since when did the Keerati mansion move to Thonglor? Don't lie to me!

685
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:01,000
I didn't mean to lie to you.

686
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,310
I have decided that I will take off the mask.

687
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,920
That's right. I am Kirin.

688
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,460
My name is Kuea. No title. No last name.

689
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,420
This is the real me.

690
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,460
Let's go back.

691
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,820
Nu-Kuea, walk carefully and stop pushing me!

692
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,270
Don't call me Nu-Kuea!

693
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,300
Only Hia can call me that!

694
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,300
Can I ask you something?

695
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,710
Why can't you love me?

696
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,080
Have you ever wanted to kiss me?
