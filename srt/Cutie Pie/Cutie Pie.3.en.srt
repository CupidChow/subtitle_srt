1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,490
Ask him!

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,760
Are you Kirin?

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:15,830
Yes.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,490
I am Kirin.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,270
I have decided to take off that mask.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,230
I hope you guys will welcome me the same way you did towards Kirin.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,830
Are you okay?

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,310
You seem very drunk.

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,310
Let's dance.

10
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,170
Come with me.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,110
Kuea Keerati!

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,180
Hia Lian?

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,400
You sound like him.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,670
You have the same ring as Hia?

15
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,110
You must be Hia.

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,530
Why can't you love me?

17
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,790
Can't you love me just a little bit?

18
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,880

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,250

I'll help you, sir.

31
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,450
It's okay.

32
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,680
I got this.

33
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,100
This house, right?

34
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,920
Walk carefully.

35
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,210
Let go of me.

36
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,490
What's the password?

37
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,350
13-digit ID number.

38
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,140
Hia's ID number.

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,850
You can't come in.

40
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,060
I still don't know who you are.

41
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,460
In the car...

42
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,700
Is it Hia Lian?

43
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,790
Come on.

44
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,700
It can't be.

45
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,810
How can it be him?

46
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,060
What happened in the car still couldn't prove who I am?

47
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,720
I don't know!

48
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,580
Nothing happened inside that car.

49
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,500
Nu-Kuea, you're so drunk.

50
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,090
What are you doing?

51
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,120
Let go of me!

52
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,590
You can't do this!

53
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,090
You're not allowed to come inside.

54
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,420
I will call the police!

55
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,340
Is this a house or a museum?

56
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,350
You made all of this?

57
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,370
Nu-Kuea.

58
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,940
Let me go!

59
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,640
Nu-Kuea.

60
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,950
Are you the real Hia or the fake Hia?

61
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,590
How did you get inside?

62
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,540
Even the real Hia is not allowed inside!

63
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,160
Hia still doesn't know that I have this house.

64
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,460
It serves him right.

65
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,380
Hia is such a poser.

66
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,790
Where is your bedroom?

67
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,250
I won't tell, even if you pay me.

68
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,070
I wouldn't believe that you could be this drunk if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

69
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,850
Let go of me!

70
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,780
Nu-Kuea!

71
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,040
Nu-Kuea, stop moving.

72
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,140
We're in your bedroom now.

73
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,840
How did you get in here?!

74
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,550
I don't want to sleep!

75
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,530
Nu-Kuea!

76
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,590
What are you doing?!

77
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,860
You can't do this!

78
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,130
Are you Hia? How dare you do this to me?

79
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,590
Hia is right here.

80
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,050
You still can't remember me?

81
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,390
The real Hia will never kiss me.

82
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,710
Nu-Kuea, you should sleep.

83
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,460
I won't sleep.

84
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,140
Lift your arms up.

85
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,630
I want to play the drums!

86
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,230
I want to ride Qilin.

87
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,820
I want to kiss Hia again.

88
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,600
Hia...

89
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,340
I miss you.

90
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,150
Hia...

91
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,990
I'm right here.

92
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,180
You're so stubborn.

93
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,110
Didn't you just say that you didn't want to sleep?

94
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,010
I don't want this anymore.

95
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,880
I don't want to be engaged with Hia anymore.

96
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,820
I already told you.

97
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,590
Stop following Nu-Kuea, and don't send me these photos anymore.

98
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,270
Kirin.

99
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,420
Qilin.

100
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,300
The dragon's lair.

101
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,100
What else are you hiding from me?

102
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,450
Nu-Kuea.

103
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,770
Let's dance.

104
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,530
Cheers!

105
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,620
You don't want to like me?

106
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,810
I don't want to like you anymore.

107
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,660
You're a bad person.

108
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,710
I can't let this go on.

109
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,340
Shit!

110
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,170
Cheers!

111
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,400
Can I join you for a drink?

112
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,290
You have the same ring as Hia?

113
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,190
Shit!

114
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,530
Who did I kiss?

115
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,970
Shit!

116
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,790
Diao.

117
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,220
Pick up the phone!

118
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,990
My battery is running out.

119
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,770
Diao!

120
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,950
Do you know how I got back to my secret house last night?

121
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,430
I don't know.

122
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,950
I came back first.

123
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,050
Remember?

124
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,010
I do!

125
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,790
But what happened after that?

126
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,330
I can't remember how I got home last night.

127
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,090
Don't you usually just call a taxi?

128
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,060
You're right...

129
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,920
But I vaguely remember...

130
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,850
I think I met a guy who looked exactly like Hia Lian.

131
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,080
Are you serious?

132
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,190
Yeah!

133
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,730
I'm not sure if I asked him to send me to my secret house or not.

134
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,150
The worst thing is...

135
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,920
I think I kissed him!

136
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,560
What!

137
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,110
Did you check if anything is missing?

138
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,550
I did.

139
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,410
Nothing's missing.

140
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,430
And did you talk to Hia Lian yet?

141
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,870
Not yet.

142
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,530
I'm too scared to talk to him now.

143
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,490
Wait.

144
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,050
You said he looked like Hia Lian...

145
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,830
Was it actually him?

146
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,490
Nu-Kuea!

147
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,500
You sound like him. You even smell like him too.

148
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,480
Nu-Kuea. This house, right?

149
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,470
It can't be him.

150
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,790
Hia Lian would never do those kind of things for me.

151
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,170
Do you want to me to come over?

152
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,530
It's okay.

153
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,660
Qilin!

154
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,380
It's still here.

155
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,690
What a relief!

156
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,410
Hello, Kuea!

157
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,030
Hello, Kuea!

158
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,300
Kuea!

159
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,170
Diao.

160
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,110
Shit!

161
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,500
What?

162
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,280
How come all the files from last night are gone?

163
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:19,930
It's not here either?!

164
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,440
Who could've came in here and messed with my CCTV cameras?

165
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,660
Dude.

166
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,220
You're still there.

167
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,740
I checked all the cameras, but the footage from last night has disappeared!

168
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,400
Do you want to try reporting this to the police?

169
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
What am I going to say?

170
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,550
Am I supposed to tell the police that I was drunk?

171
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,010
And that I came back with a random guy who looked like Hia?

172
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,710
He even came inside my house...

173
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,680
And then I fell asleep. Just like that?

174
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,860
Hm...

175
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,690
Why don't you just ask Hia?

176
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
How can I ask him?

177
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,920
I will be busted if I ask him that.

178
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,450
What will he think of me?

179
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,490
If he finds out that I...

180
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,170
kissed a stranger?

181
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,870
And that guy even came inside my bedroom too.

182
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,180
Hold on.

183
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,560
What are you going to do if it's actually Hia?

184
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,210
This is a thumb drive.

185
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,310
I already saved all footages from his CCTV cameras last night into this thumb drive.

186
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,180
Do you want the footage from three days ago too?

187
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:38,970
No.

188
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,730
I don't want Nu-Kuea to know about last night.

189
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,840
Other than that, it's his private life.

190
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,980
Yes, sir.

191
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,940
And about last night...

192
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,420
Do not tell anyone.

193
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,560
I won't say anything.

194
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Not even to myself.

195
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,000
I won't tell anyone.

196
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,670
I won't--

197
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,940
Especially him.

198
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,000
Him?

199
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,540
Oh, him.

200
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,710
Right.

201
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Nu-Kuea is sober now.

202
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,720
He can't remember anything yet.

203
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,579
Although, he vaguely remembers

204
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,780
that he kissed someone.

205
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,740
He told Kon-Diao?

206
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,359
More like yelling.

207
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,569
You're having fun, aren't you?

208
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,520
Messing with your fiancé like that.

209
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
No.

210
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,060
I'm not messing with him.

211
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,000
I just wanted to prove something.

212
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,880
So did you get all the answers you wanted?

213
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,220
Not all.

214
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,140
But at least I know one thing.

215
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,370
The fact that Nu-Kuea was making a fuss about this whole situation...

216
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,540
it's because this is the first time something like this had happened.

217
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,920
Are you sure?

218
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,850
Maybe he made a fuss about it

219
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,580
because that guy

220
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,490
might've been Hia Lian.

221
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,380
Because he wouldn't have minded if it were someone else.

222
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,080
You should stop being so mysterious.

223
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,320
If you're not going to make a move,

224
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,200
then don't regret it later.

225
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,420
Have you ever noticed?

226
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,610
That your beloved Nu-Kuea is getting cuter every day.

227
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,370
And he's still young.

228
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,970
He has many options to choose from.

229
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,760
If you're not going to do anything about it,

230
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,210
someone might snatch him away from you.

231
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,910
Cute?

232
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,730
In terms of appearance,

233
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,040
I agree.

234
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,360
But personality,

235
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,820
Nu-Kuea is secretly stubborn.

236
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,220
He's nothing like Kon-Diao.

237
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,020
You still don't know Kon-Diao well enough.

238
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,670
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lie to you.

239
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,860
He has his own ways of escaping.

240
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,280
Young master Kuea Keerati.

241
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,620
Yes...?

242
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,200
Why didn't you use the front door?

243
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,760
I wasn't trying to go inside.

244
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,070
I dropped my AirPods from the second floor.

245
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,430
I dropped it around there.

246
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,490
So I'll go find it right now!

247
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,870
Hold on!

248
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,250
Come back here.

249
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:02,870
That's right.

250
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,420
Come back. Come back here.

251
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,010
That's right, good boy.

252
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,380
What are those things in your ears, then?

253
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,520
These ones are white.

254
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,830
Those ones are black.

255
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,540
Auntie Ja, if you happen to find them, please give them back to me.

256
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,930
You disappeared again last night.

257
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,050
I didn't.

258
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,690
I...

259
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,540
I was sitting right in front of your room for the whole night.

260
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,770
Did you climb in through the window?

261
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,520
Are you Spiderman?

262
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,460
Spiderman!

263
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,720
Stop!

264
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,140
We're grown-ups, young master Kuea. We will not play like this anymore.

265
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,470
This time!

266
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll have to inform your mother.

267
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,960
I don't think that is necessary.

268
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,740
It is! Your mother will hear about this!

269
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,890
I will not put up with this anymore.

270
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,000
You've disappeared two times already!

271
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,380
Look at my mouth.

272
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,320
I will not put up with this anymore!

273
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,440
If you tell my mom,

274
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,480
I will also tell her that you always take a day off on the 1st

275
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,140
and the 16th of every month.

276
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,560
Young...master...Kuea...Keerati.

277
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,290
I saw you.

278
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,240
The day before your day off.

279
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,930
You go to the shrine behind our house to worship and offer food to the deities.

280
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,490
I also saw you scribbling numbers on paper.

281
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,340
Auntie Ja, you know it, right?

282
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,760
That my mom doesn't like these kinds of things.

283
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,280
So should we make a deal, then?

284
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,600
If you don't tell my mom,

285
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,840
I won't say it, too.

286
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,190
Let's make a pinky promise.

287
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,790
You're still thinking about Nu-Kuea?

288
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,340
Yes, sir.

289
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,860
Are there fewer people today than usual?

290
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:55,380
Yes, sir.

291
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,240
There are fewer people compared to other weeks.

292
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,040
Usually, there are not many people on Sundays.

293
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,090
But this week, many people are at Gemini

294
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,230
because Kirin revealed himself yesterday.

295
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,160
That's why many people are there today.

296
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,360
Kirin?

297
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,900
That's right.

298
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,200
That's why Kon-Diao and Nu-Kuea also went there yesterday.

299
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,280
If that singer is so famous...

300
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,130
Should we hire him to play here at Pentagon?

301
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,530
No need.

302
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,380
Pentagon doesn't need to approach or hire any artists from its competitors.

303
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,520
Many good artists in this country all want to come and perform here.

304
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,460
But we can gain more customers if there are performances by famous artists.

305
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,940
Being a big club doesn't guarantee us high profit.

306
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,880
We have high fixed costs.

307
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,450
Our customers will get bored if there are no new attractions.

308
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,210
You also know, that this kind of business has its own lifespan, right?

309
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,040
I know.

310
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,310
But don't worry.

311
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,960
Pentagon will remain number one for many years to come.

312
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,500
Let's not open pubs and bars.

313
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,660
We just started the bottled water business.

314
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,340
I think you should take it step by step.

315
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,660
I won't wait any longer.

316
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,930
If I don't do it now,

317
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,440
I will never get to do it again.

318
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,350
Why is that?

319
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,410
Many reasons.

320
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,220
I've thought this through.

321
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,900
We have a good location. Plus, the timing is right.

322
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,860
I don't want the profit from the bottled water business to just remain untouched in the bank.

323
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,690
I'm worried that you're biting off more than you can chew.

324
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,730
Also,

325
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,060
this kind of business won't last long.

326
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,080
It has a high risk.

327
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,000
I understand.

328
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,360
But I plan to make a lot of profit from this

329
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
and expand it to other businesses.

330
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,450
If our customers are happy with our service,

331
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,120
this nightclub will be like the shop that we can use to promote our drinks.

332
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,090
They will purchase our products again if they see them somewhere else.

333
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,830
Don't forget that you should think about the Keerati family in everything you do.

334
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,630
You and Kuea are engaged.

335
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,490
Do not do anything that might ruin his family's reputation.

336
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,050
I will never forget what the Keerati family has given us.

337
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,560
I've decided to open this nightclub

338
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,210
because I've thought about whether Nu-Kuea and I are suitable for each other.

339
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,500
And if I'm going to marry Nu-Kuea,

340
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,430
I must become successful.

341
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,100
Have you talked about this with young master Kuea?

342
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,770
Does he know what you are trying to do?

343
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,480
No.

344
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,120
I don't think he needs to know.

345
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,880
I want him to live his life however he wants to.

346
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,870
He's still young.

347
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,620
Do you think that he will wait for you?

348
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,120
Don't forget that the engagement between you two is just a verbal agreement.

349
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,050
It will be a big problem if something goes wrong.

350
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,360
I don't want you to do something risky.

351
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,200
I don't want anyone to think that I married Nu-Kuea for his money.

352
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,580
It's my responsibility to prove myself, and to take care of him.

353
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,340
If I fail to even do that,

354
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,430
then I'm not worthy enough to marry him.

355
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,000
Since you have made the decision,

356
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,700
I will respect that.

357
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,340
Thank you, dad.

358
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,340
Send someone to check if Kirin will perform at Gemini today or not.

359
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
Have you changed your mind?

360
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,320
Kirin is Nu-Kuea.

361
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,410
What?

362
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,700
So the reason that you often go to Gemini

363
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,680
is that you go to check on Nu-Kuea?

364
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,150
Who told you that I go there often?

365
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,170
It's not that hard to guess.

366
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,390
Because Kilen Wang's universe

367
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,110
has Nu-Kuea Keerati as the center.

368
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,470
You're just like a planet

369
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,860
that orbits around the Sun.

370
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,590
I'm not.

371
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,270
You haven't realized it yet?

372
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,000
Ever since you had that fight with Nu-Kuea,

373
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,780
you don't seem like yourself at all.

374
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,320
One moment you're smiling...

375
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,350
Then suddenly, you're angry.

376
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,600
I get it now.

377
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,180
I know what happened last night.

378
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,920
The reason that you understand me so well

379
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,560
is because you're in the same situation as me.

380
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:45,140
Kon-Diao is the center of your universe.

381
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,790
You little planet.

382
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,900
Just don't forget what I said.

383
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,400
Don't be too slow.

384
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,830
Nu-Kuea is still young.

385
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,080
He has many options.

386
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,930
Also, if Nu-Kuea is Kirin,

387
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,910
you'll have even more rivals now.

388
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,380
I know.

389
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,600
But dealing with Nu-Kuea by using force is not the way to go.

390
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,890
There has to be a plan.

391
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,350
Well, then I hope your plan succeeds.

392
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,090
Let's make a bet.

393
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,050
Let's see if Nu-Kuea will go to Gemini today or not.

394
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,720
What does the winner get?

395
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
One hundred thousand baht.

396
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,400
I think Nu-Kuea won't go because he's afraid of you.

397
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:34,090
There's a reason

398
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,650
why I gave him the nickname Annabelle.

399
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,100
Nu-Kuea is not as well-behaved as you think.

400
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:43,670
Deal.

401
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:45,920
Deal.

402
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,570
I really can't go tonight.

403
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,670
Please.

404
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm begging you.

405
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:10,140
All the tables are booked tonight because of Kirin.

406
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,320
You're going to disappoint the audiences?

407
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,380
You're going to do this to the fans who are waiting for you?

408
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,830
I want to go.

409
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,590
But...

410
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,180
Oh, by the way.

411
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,060
Do you know how I got back home last night?

412
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,810
Jay!

413
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
Jay! Where are you?

414
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,740
Jay, help me!

415
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,510
Jay!

416
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,460
Kuea Keerati!

417
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,960
I don't know, man.

418
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,860
I didn't keep an eye on you all the time.

419
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,960
Really?

420
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,740
Did you see Hia Lian, my fiancé?

421
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,030
I mean...

422
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,450
My ex...

423
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,440
Whatever.

424
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,040
The owner of Pentagon.

425
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,980
Did he come last night?

426
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,240
I've never seen him before.

427
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,130
I told you he's never come to my club.

428
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,450
Really?

429
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,890
Think carefully.

430
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,100
He has thick eyebrows.

431
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,850
Always acting cool and aloof.

432
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,880
He always wears a suit.

433
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,520
You didn't see him at all?

434
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:14,950
Kuea.

435
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,580
My VIP guests are here.

436
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,080
I have to greet them first.

437
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,010
Hey! Wait!

438
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,120
Jay!

439
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,260
I haven't even finished asking questions!

440
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,140
Is Kirin performing tonight?

441
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,940
No.

442
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,760
Today is Sunday.

443
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,430
Kirin only performs on Thursdays.

444
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,310
There's still time left.

445
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,520
Cinderella might show up at midnight.

446
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,370
So is he gonna be Cinderella

447
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
or Annabelle?

448
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,200
Let's wait and see.

449
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:10,630
Don't go to Gemini.

450
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,890
- Don't go to Gemini.
- Wait. Wait.

451
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,660
Why are you hypnotizing me?

452
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,590
Hia Yi told me to.

453
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,740
He told me to stop you from going to Gemini.

454
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,610
Hia Yi?

455
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,830
Hia Yi and Hia Lian are betting whether Kirin will perform at Gemini tonight or not.

456
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,480
What?

457
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:28,490
So that means Hia is at Gemini right now?

458
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,590
I think so?

459
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,810
Hia Yi didn't mention it, but I think you shouldn't go.

460
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,720
It's dangerous.

461
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,020
So Hia already knows that Kirin is me?

462
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,530
Isn't that obvious?

463
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,290
You already revealed yourself last night.

464
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,930
Everyone knows who you are now.

465
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,140
You said it yourself that you don't care anymore.

466
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,800
Well, I might have overreacted.

467
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,150
What if...

468
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,130
the guy from last night

469
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,020
was actually Hia Lian?

470
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,190
I don't know.

471
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,710
But I think it's possible.

472
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,710
Then I have to go to Gemini.

473
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,700
I have to find out the truth.

474
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,360
How?

475
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,430
Kuea.

476
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,360
If Hia Yi sees you,

477
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,930
I am doomed.

478
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,640
Just trust me.

479
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,870
No one will see me.

480
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,880
Kuea!

481
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,760
Kuea!

482
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,930
Wait!

483
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,480
Why is he always like this?

484
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,010
Stop!

485
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,060
Stop right there!

486
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,690
I told you to stop!

487
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,810
Cats must equate to the number nine!

488
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,890
Because it has nine lives.

489
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,620
And dogs must mean the number four.

490
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,570
It must be nine and four!

491
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,060
Why aren't you listening to me?

492
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,450
Trust me! I'm telling you. They said the lottery numbers are nine four zero!

493
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,290
Seven and nine?

494
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,640
Where did you get those numbers from?

495
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,890
Hello, Hia.

496
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,090
Mission failed.

497
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,200
Kuea is on his way to Gemini right now.

498
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:12,950
Okay.

499
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,010
I have to go.

500
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,810
Kon-Diao just called. He has a stomach ache.

501
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,660
Don't use him as an excuse.

502
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,210
You're afraid that you're gonna lose the bet.

503
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,520
I'm not.

504
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,050
I'm just regretting that I won't get to stay and have a drink with you.

505
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,580
And since you'll be by yourself now,

506
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,090
don't go around kissing random people, got it?

507
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,620
Kuea.

508
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,670
What are you doing here?

509
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,770
Where's Hia Lian?

510
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,790
Oh, Hia Lian.

511
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,130
Your fiancé, right?

512
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,810
I told you he's never come here.

513
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,710
But today he's here with his friend!

514
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,800
They two of them, both handsome and tall.

515
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,940
Which table are they at?

516
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Those guys who are dressed like the mafia?

517
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,170
They already left.

518
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,370
They paid and left just now.

519
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:52,920
Yes!

520
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,460
Since you're already here, why don't you sing a couple of songs?

521
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,550
I knew that you would come.

522
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,470
I've set the stage for you already.

523
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,600
And you're all dressed up, too.

524
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,640

Kirin!

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,060
You're really just like Annabelle.

552
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,410
(You owe me 200,000 baht.)

553
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,250
You made Hia Yi lose a lot of money.

554
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,170
I'm so sorry.

555
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,030
Your class ends at 4 p.m. today, right?

556
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,160
Let's have a meal together!

557
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,830
Are you trying to make it up to me?

558
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm still mad at you.

559
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,390
You can't stay mad at me for long.

560
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,590
I know.

561
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,600
You love me too much.

562
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,120
You're right.

563
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,240
That's why we're besties.

564
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,250
I was going to give you some sandwiches after the first class but...

565
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,400
Since you're already here...

566
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,360
Here you go.

567
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,980
Share them to your friends too.

568
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,440
Thank you so much.

569
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,540
Young master Diao is the cutest!

570
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,860
Don't be late this evening, okay?

571
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,080
I've got something to do afterwards.

572
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,310
Roger that!

573
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,620
Okay!

574
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,660
It's time to work as a team!

575
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,420
Do you know why I'm showing these gears and cogs?

576
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,850
I don't want you to only work on practical training in class.

577
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,530
I also want you to learn how to apply these skills in real life.

578
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,030
You all are like these gears and cogs.

579
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,500
If you don't know how to work as a team,

580
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,180
this engine will not be able function.

581
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,630
Wait a second.

582
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,890
He can just tell us to work in harmony.

583
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,060
No need to ramble about all these gears and cogs.

584
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,750
That's too confusing, man!

585
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,450
"You all are like these gears and cogs."

586
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,780
Ton!

587
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,030
Hey! Syn, what are you doing?

588
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,570
Are you a raccoon?

589
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,130
My God! Look at his face!

590
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,750
"Appamadarata Hota."

591
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,610
Do take delight in non-recklessness.

592
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,460
I was reckless for only a second,

593
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,500
leading me to my doom.

594
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,420
Amen.

595
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,320
You still have the time to preach?

596
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,520
And why did we even bother saying amen?

597
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,090
Alright, guys!

598
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,750
I want to introduce you to our new friend.

599
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,200
This is Nuer.

600
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,780
From now on,

601
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,220
Nuer will be joining us.

602
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,140
Nice to meet you all.

603
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,090
How is it possible to change your major in the middle of your third year?

604
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,740
He's the top student from computer engineering.

605
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,930
I remember him.

606
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,630
You can join this group.

607
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,460
They're missing one person.

608
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,320
Uh...

609
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,640
Nuchy.

610
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,890
Please look after him.

611
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,300
Okay, Professor.

612
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,250
You've got something on your face.

613
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,650
It's fine.

614
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,250
Hia.

615
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,620
Why are you here?

616
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,870
Is something the matter?

617
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,770
No, nothing.

618
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,180
I just wanted to pick you up.

619
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,910
Your classes have ended, right?

620
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,470
Yes, Hia.

621
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,090
Do you have any plans after this?

622
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,390
Well...

623
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,110
I have to teach English to a sixth-grader at 6 p.m.

624
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,330
You're lying again, Kon-Diao!

625
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,470
Let's get something to eat first.

626
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
Then I'll drop you off later.

627
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,160
Okay.

628
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,010
Okay, Hia.

629
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,580
That was close!

630
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,220
(Hia Yi's here. No need to pick me up.)

631
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,610
(Roger that. Good luck.)

632
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,750
Wow.

633
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,820
This bike belongs to young master Kuea?

634
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,010
It looks cool.

635
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,390
Yeah.

636
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,990
Which one's yours?

637
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,300
You probably have many luxury cars at home, right?

638
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,230
Not really.

639
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,620
There're only old cars.

640
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,710
Yes, auntie Ja.

641
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,660
Young master Kuea.

642
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,990
Your classes are done, right?

643
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,400
Come back home immediately!

644
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,340
Mr. Lian is waiting for you at home.

645
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,350
Shit!

646
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,140
Okay, auntie Ja.

647
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:12,140
Sorry, man.

648
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,540
No time to talk. I'm in a hurry.

649
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,660
Bye.

650
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,340
Kuea!

651
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,470
Kuea!

652
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,630
Kuea, wait!

653
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,970
Too late.

654
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,340
Kuea forgot his notebook.

655
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,660
I can go give it to him.

656
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,460
You know where he lives?

657
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,470
Of course.

658
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,290
Everyone knows where the Keerati Mansion is.

659
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,780
It's okay. I'll hang on to it.

660
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,500
I can return it to him tomorrow.

661
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,130
Maybe he'll need to use it.

662
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,490
No!

663
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,620
It's none of your business.

664
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,500
I'll keep it for him.

665
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,040
Sorry, wrong way.

666
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,430
What did he say?

667
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,430
He's on his way.

668
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,330
But I'm not sure when he will arrive.

669
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,350
Mr. Lian.

670
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,210
Are you sure that you want him to move in with you?

671
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:47,830
Yes.

672
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,670
You know how he behaves these days.

673
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,640
But Mrs. Kewarin...

674
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,820
I've already talked to her.

675
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,060
She agreed with me.

676
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,020
Auntie Ja, please tell someone to pack all his belongings immediately.

677
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,010
Now?!

678
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,010
Um, I mean...

679
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,190
I think that by the time he'll get home, it'll be very late already.

680
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:11,490
It's okay.

681
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,020
I can wait.

682
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,580
I will take him with me...

683
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:21,660
today.

684
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,910
What's the matter?

685
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,070
I'm here to take you with me.

686
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,140
What do you mean?

687
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,660
I already told auntie Ja to pack your clothes.

688
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,340
You can come back to get all the other stuff later.

689
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,320
Where are you taking me?

690
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,370
My house.

691
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:57,400
What?!

692
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,050
Are you crazy?!

693
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,430
I won't go.

694
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,450
I already told you that I will call off the engagement.

695
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,860
You should go now.

696
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,260
I'm not going to go with you.

697
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,990
I won't change my mind.

698
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,260
I'm not asking you to choose.

699
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,280
This is an order.

700
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,130
You can't order me around.

701
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,830
I will get someone to go grab your belongings from upstairs right now.

702
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:15,420
You can't do that!

703
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,250
If anyone takes my belongings outside of this house,

704
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,510
I will call the police!

705
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,160
Why is he always like this?

706
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,270
Do you think you can do whatever you want?

707
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,450
Has he gone back yet?

708
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,120
He probably went back already.

709
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,380
Hia!

710
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,690
I already asked your mother for permission to let you stay at Pentagon.

711
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,390
And she already gave me her permission.

712
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:06,420
Hia...

713
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:08,230
Qilin!

714
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,560
Hia Lian's house is in Thonglor. It's not that far from here.

715
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,090
I will go to stay with you

716
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,030
under one condition.

717
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,070
You have to give me Pentagon!

718
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:18,440
Hia Lian is so smart, it's scary.

719
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,430
I don't know how much he knows right now.

720
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,060
What does he want from me?

721
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,180
Foei, clean up this place.

722
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,010
Make sure that everything's perfect so Nu-Kuea will never want to leave this house.

723
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,900
I'm sure that he has a plan.

724
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,050
Right now, I'm sure that he just wants to test me.

725
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,250
I will figure it out.

726
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:34,310
I will not be a well-behaved Nu-Kuea forever.
