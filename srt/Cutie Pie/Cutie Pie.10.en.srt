1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,320
You did all that for me since you were still so young?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,580
I don't want you to feel embarrassed to have an ice delivery boy as your fiancé.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,340
Thank you for growing up and becoming my source of happiness.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,340
I envy your relationship. It's cute.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,150
So, our plan to let them talk failed.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,850
I'm pretty sure they'll talk after we left.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,910
I have an urgent matter to deal with at Pentagon. I'll come back as fast as I can.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,170
He's such a workaholic.

9
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,440
The sole owner of the Keerati family's property is...

10
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,610
Kilen Wang.

11
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,640
(30 minutes ago)

12
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,340
"When it comes to ordering food, I know I can trust you."

13
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,990
He's putting pressure on me.

14
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,540
I should order something to surprise him.

15
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,740
Hello, thank you for calling Pentagon.

16
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:43,460
Hello, I'm Kuea Keerati.

17
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,340
Oh, young master Kuea. How may I help you, sir?

18
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,250
I want to order food for Mr. Lian.

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,920
Can you deliver the food from Pentagon to his house?

20
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,520
Sure. What would you like to order?

21
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,740
What does he usually eat?

22
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,190
Oh, it actually depends on his guests.

23
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,030
I see...

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,040
What does he order when he's with Mr. Yi?

25
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,490
Mr. Yi... He likes to eat bushmeat.

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,440
Bushmeat?

27
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,550
Yes. It's a special dish that's not on the menu.

28
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,440
Our chef is excellent at cooking these dishes. We have wild boar meat today. Would you like to order that?

29
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,750
Wild boar meat...

30
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,310
So, you're not afraid of dogs anymore?

31
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,140
Afraid of dogs?

32
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,079
Why would I be afraid of them? They're so cute.

33
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,850
I've never been afraid of dogs.

34
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,089
Hia Yi won't play with me.

35
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,640
Hia Yi is so mean.

36
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,440
Kon-Diao.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,750
Hia Yi!

38
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,040
Kon-Diao!

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
Come here, little doggie.

40
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,640
That's good.

41
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,540
You should take good of her then.

42
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,700
You have her now, so I hope that you won't feel lonely anymore.

43
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,200
Give me a big smile!

44
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,850
Oh, Diao.

45
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,340
What's up?

46
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,860
Hello, Kuea.

47
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,440
Look. I have something to show you.

48
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,890
Ta-da!

49
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,430
Isn't she cute?

50
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,800
A Chihuahua!

51
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,940
Where did you get her from?

52
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,950
Hia Yi's client gave him this dog.

53
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,180
Really? She's so cute!

54
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,540
What's her name?

55
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,060
Her name is Nong.

56
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,490
Huh?

57
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,050
This dog belongs to Nong Diao. That's why her name is Nong too.

58
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,340
What kind of name is that?

59
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,210
So...

60
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,240
You're smiling like this...

61
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,659
Does that mean you've reconciled with Hia Yi?

62
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:59,190
I don't know. I haven't really talked to him.

63
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,330
But I...

64
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,630
I was really happy when he gave me the dog.

65
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,320
I'm actually happy.

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,340
I guess he tried to make it up to me.

67
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,620
Obviously.

68
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,530
Of course, he'd want to make it up to you.

69
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,560
By the way,

70
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,140
if you're not home, don't let the dog stay with Hia Yi alone, okay?

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,670
Why?

72
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,470
Hia Yi might eat him!

73
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,170
You're crazy! Why do you think of things like that?

74
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,340
Because his name is Payak, and Payak means tiger.

75
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,159
Also, do you know that Hia Yi...

76
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,740
likes to eat bushmeat?

77
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,630
Like spicy stir-fried wild boar, stir-fried garlic frog, spicy stir-fried crocodile, and dog meat. You know, that kind of stuff?

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,630
Dog meat?

79
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,060
Hia!

80
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,060
Hia.

81
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,940
Hia, you must not eat Nong!

82
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,260
Diao.

83
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,460
What are you going to do to her? You can't eat her.

84
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,590
Let's go. This place is not safe for us anymore.

85
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,720
Let's go.

86
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,340
Since when do I eat dogs?

87
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,240
Yes.

88
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,880
I've sorted out everything already.

89
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:35,950
No.

90
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,940
Nu-Kuea doesn't know yet.

91
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,040
I think I will tell him within a day or two.

92
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,770
Sure.

93
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,940
Thank you so much.

94
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,240
(Yi)

95
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,870
What's up?

96
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,190
Do you know that your Nu-Kuea just messed with me?

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,240
What happened?

98
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,740
Nu-Kuea and Kon-Diao were saying that I like to eat dogs.

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,310
Where did they hear that from?

100
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,540
I have no idea.

101
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,590
But you better deal with your Nu-Kuea right now.

102
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,500
I brought a Chihuahua to make it up to Kon-Diao.

103
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,240
At first, I thought he'd be afraid of the dog, but it turns out that he's scared of me eating the dog instead.

104
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay. I'll scold him for you.

105
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,130
I have to hang up now. Pentagon is calling me.

106
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,790
Did I make the right decision?

107
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,310
Mr. Somsak, your VIP guest is here.

108
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,730
Okay. I'll be there soon.

109
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,240
He also wants to drink Pinot Noir wine. But we already ran out of stock.

110
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,280
Okay. I think I have some at home.

111
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,890
I'll bring it with me. Do you need anything else?

112
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,630
Nu-Kuea.

113
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,040
I have an urgent matter to deal with at Pentagon.

114
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,240
I'll come back as fast as I can.

115
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:36,950
Hia.

116
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,680
The delivery only accepts cash, but I don't have any with me.

117
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,330
There's cash in the drawer in my office.

118
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:46,990
See you later.

119
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,280
Okay.

120
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:16,500
How come all the Keerati family's property belongs to Hia?

121
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,010
What's going on?

122
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,740
Bushmeat? I didn't know that you also eat these kinds of dishes.

123
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,840
I asked the staff at Pentagon about your favorite menu.

124
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,000
You should give it a try then.

125
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,040
I don't know if it's too spicy for you or not.

126
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,240
Oh, I get it now. Is this why you told Kon-Diao that Hia Yi likes to eat dogs?

127
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,840
Why aren't you eating?

128
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,840
Are you too afraid to try?

129
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,370
It tastes good, though. I can assure you that there's no dog meat.

130
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,110
I just...

131
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,520
I feel sick.

132
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,730
What's wrong?

133
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,430
I just don't want you to catch a cold from me.

134
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,050
I'll probably get better after taking some medicine and some rest.

135
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,490
Well, I think I will go to bed first, then.

136
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm so hungry!

137
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,010
I've decided that I'll do it this way.

138
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,240
Or else I'll have to file for bankruptcy.

139
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,590
Or maybe file a plan of reorganization.

140
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,940
I just invested a large sum of money into Pentagon.

141
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,240
I can't spend anymore.

142
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,240
It hasn't even reached payback yet.

143
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,880
Oh, Yi.

144
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,120
You wanted to open another car showroom or museum in this area, right?

145
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,230
I think it's a good idea.

146
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,650
Old mansion and classic car collection.

147
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,240
It sounds interesting.

148
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,640
Also, it's not easy to find a location right in the center of the city like this one.

149
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,360
No, it's hard to run the silk business.

150
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,900
Plus, I don't have any knowledge about this.

151
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,380
Nu-Kuea.

152
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,540
I feel a little hungry.

153
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,320
Do you feel better yet?

154
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,630
Yes.

155
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,760
I took a short nap just now.

156
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,000
You're not going to bed yet?

157
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,040
I was finishing up some work.

158
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,790
Okay.

159
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
You should go to bed.

160
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:18,840
Okay.

161
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,030
Hia.

162
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,520
Can I ask you something?

163
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,300
Of course.

164
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,360
Hia...

165
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,340
Do you really want to marry me?

166
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,640
Why are you asking me this question again?

167
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,340
I've told you many times already

168
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,480
that I love you.

169
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,510
It's nothing.

170
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,110
I just... had a nightmare.

171
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,640
What did you dream about?

172
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,569
I dreamed...

173
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,040
that you didn't love me.

174
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,089
You kept so many secrets from me.

175
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,290
Nu-Kuea, did you watch too many dramas?

176
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,940
I guess so.

177
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,980
Don't think too much.

178
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,650
I will marry you

179
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,780
because I love you.

180
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,080
If you don't believe me,

181
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,140
we can go to the district office tomorrow and apply for marriage registration.

182
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,360
Or we can fly to Austria and meet your parents.

183
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,790
Well, I think I'd better go to bed now. I have morning classes tomorrow.

184
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,140
Is he really not going to tell me why he's doing that?

185
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:31,400
In the end... both of us still keep secrets from each other.

186
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,920
This is such a big problem, but he won't tell me anything.

187
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,100
How is our relationship going to last?

188
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,290
Shit!

189
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,260
It's already 9.30 a.m?!

190
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,850
Nu-Kuea.

191
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,910
You're already up?

192
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,020
Are you feeling any better from yesterday?

193
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,240
I'm much better now.

194
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,150
It seems like you still have a fever though.

195
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,570
I think you should take a day off for today.

196
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,600
I can't.

197
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I have to work on my formula-

198
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,160
I mean, my super computer project.

199
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,110
I have to discuss the project with my friends.

200
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,130
You can tell your friends to come here.

201
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,660
So you can get some more rest.

202
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,430
I'll call the doctor in to check on you in the afternoon too.

203
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,640
It's okay, Hia.

204
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,420
I think I will get better after getting some more rest.

205
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,010
It's just that I couldn't really sleep last night.

206
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,230
Did you have a nightmare again?

207
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,140
No.

208
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,210
I want to stay here and look after you.

209
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,210
But I have an important matter to deal with.

210
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,690
I'll come back home as soon as I can.

211
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,090
Okay.

212
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,020
Come. Get some rest.

213
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,110
I'll go take a shower and get dressed first.

214
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,680
Hia!

215
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,000
You want me to stay here and look after you?

216
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,910
No, it's nothing.

217
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,970
You should go get ready for work.

218
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,710
Nu-Kuea...

219
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,410
Will you be my boyfriend?

220
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,910
Hia...

221
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,270
What do you mean?

222
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,130
I've never asked you before.

223
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,670
But we're already engaged.

224
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,200
Engaged...

225
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,380
That's what the elders arranged for us.

226
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,510
I've been thinking...

227
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,210
I've never asked you to be my boyfriend before.

228
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,060
Why do you have to ask me to be your boyfriend?

229
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,680
We're already like a married couple.

230
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,910
So, will you be my boyfriend or not?

231
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,340
I will.

232
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,590

233
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,110

Hia.

240
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,410
You'll catch my cold.

241
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,950
It's okay.

242
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,810
I can be sick for you instead.

243
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,520
Hia!

244
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,670
You should take a shower and go to work already.

245
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,010

246

247
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,280
Hia just asked me to be his boyfriend...

248
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,750
But why do I still feel worried?

249
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,120
Where are you going?

250
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,910
You'd better take good care of Kon-Diao.

251
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,260
Did you understand what I just said?

252
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,380
Hia! What are you doing to her?

253
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,930
You can't eat her.

254
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,740
Come here. Come to me.

255
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,430
Come here, little doggie.

256
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,890
Me eating dogs? What are you talking about?

257
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,710
Don't lie to me. I heard you when you were scolding her.

258
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,950
What did she do to you? Why did you have to scold her?

259
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,010
I didn't scold her. I just talked to her normally.

260
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,570
She's still young. You can't scold her, or she will be afraid of you.

261
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,880
She's not afraid of me.

262
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,110
Hia!

263
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,500
What are you going to do?

264
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,450
Hia!

265
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:50,910
Nong!

266
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,750
-God damn it!
-Nong, you're scared, aren't you?

267
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,720
I have errands to run today.

268
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,700
Don't be scared, okay?

269
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,500
But she peed on me.

270
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,140
Hia, please don't scold her.

271
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,930
She's afraid of you now. She's still very young.

272
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,310
Nong, why did you pee on him?

273
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,510
I will teach you where to pee, okay?

274
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,060
They're already married.

275
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,750
Really? That's great.

276
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,820
Syn!

277
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,880
Hello, everyone.

278
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,080
Did you see the group chat?

279
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,540
Kuea said he couldn't make it today because he's sick.

280
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,580
Is it serious?

281
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,400
I don't think so.

282
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Or maybe it's serious.

283
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,410
Syn, did you talk to Kuea?

284
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,770
No, I didn't.

285
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,710
Kuea said he's a bit tired because he couldn't sleep last night.

286
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,170
I texted him to ask about his condition.

287
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,890
Wow, you're talking to him privately, too?

288
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,510
Be careful, Hia might find out that you two are talking secretly behind his back.

289
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,210
I heard that Kuea's Hia is very scary.

290
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,240
If he finds out, your head will be chopped off. You'll be killed!

291
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,410
It's not what you think.

292
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,550
I still remember the third precept of Buddhism.

293
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,920
I won't do you wrong.

294
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,410
We'd better disguise ourselves and follow them.

295
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,110
Or else it'll be too late to pry into their businesses.

296
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,810
Let's go!

297
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,870
Do you think we can finish it?

298
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,930
Finish what?

299
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,110
Jab, what are you doing?

300
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,280
I'm drawing the car model.

301
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,340
What's this?

302
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,860
Measure this first.

303
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,460
What are you doing?

304
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,860
I'm looking at the design.

305
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,410
What are we missing?

306
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,610
Is it the shock absorber? The middle one, right here.

307
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,480
You're right.

308
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,310
Syn, can you give me the shock absorber?

309
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,910
Shock absorber...

310
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,230
You think a shock absorber looks like this?

311
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,110
I'm going to punch you in the face.

312
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,850
It's that one.

313
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,410
Right.

314
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,230
Come on.

315
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,770
I'm sorry.

316
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,410
You keep looking at Nuer. That's why you picked up the wrong one!

317
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,580
No, I'm not looking at him.

318
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,730
Yes, you are.

319
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,700
I'm just checking whether he's doing his task correctly or not.

320
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,670
You are looking at him!

321
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,410
All humans make mistakes.

322
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,390
Come on, just admit it that you're looking at him.

323
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,610
I can see that you're looking at him. Why are you arguing with me?

324
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,510
Are we done fighting?

325
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,310
Let's get back to work, or we won't have anything to present.

326
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,400
Fine.

327
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,930
Syn is not himself anymore.

328
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,750
He's actually looking at Nuer. I'm serious.

329
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,020
I'm not feeling well today.

330
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Please cover for me.

331
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,880
Sure.

332
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,850
It's not severe, right?

333
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:18,260
Don't let me find out later that you didn't come because you had a hot night with your fiancé.

334
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,630
That's enough, Ton.

335
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:22,120
Let me get this straight.

336
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,010
You're making jokes like this last time too.

337
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,400
At first, I tried to ignore it.

338
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,010
But it's getting more and more uncomfortable when you keep making these types of jokes.

339
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,110
Also, if someone hears you say something like this,

340
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,610
they will think badly of you.

341
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,220
Even if we're close friends,

342
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,710
we still need to recognize and respect each other's comfort zone.

343
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,270
Don't get mad at me for saying this frankly.

344
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,110
But it's because we're close, that's why I have to talk to you about this.

345
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,680
Okay. Thanks for telling me.

346
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,620
I just wanted to create a joyful atmosphere.

347
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,420
I didn't have any bad intentions.

348
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,630
But I agree with what you said. I'll be more careful from now on.

349
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,300
I'm sorry, Kuea.

350
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,910
Don't get mad at me, okay?

351
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,600
You're not angry at me, right?

352
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,780
Not at all.

353
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,780
It's reasonable for you to warn me about this.

354
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,670
If I said it to other people, they probably wouldn't bother warning me about my actions.

355
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,670
They'd just immediately think badly of me.

356
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,510
So, it's very nice of you to tell me this.

357
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,410
See you after you get better, then. I have to get back to work now.

358
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,710
Okay. See you.

359
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,610
Where is it?

360
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,160
Did he hide everything already?

361
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,010
Hia...

362
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,230
Yes, Hia?

363
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,770
Nu-Kuea, how are you?

364
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,510
Are you feeling better now?

365
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,450
Yes. I'm much better.

366
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,090
Have you eaten anything yet?

367
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,250
Yes.

368
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,690
I already ate bread with ham.

369
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,590
Is that all you ate?

370
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,090
I'll order something for you then.

371
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,650
It's okay, Hia.

372
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,410
Hia, I need to go to the toilet. I'll be hanging up now.

373
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,230
I love you...

374
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,350
But I don't understand why you're hiding things from me.

375
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,150
Is it still true...

376
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,660
when you say that you love me?

377
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,750
You don't have to be afraid of Hia Yi, okay?

378
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,990
He might look scary,

379
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,720
but actually,

380
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,880
he's just pretending.

381
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,030
Also...

382
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,600
Hia Yi is not home often.

383
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,690
But you don't have to worry.

384
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,850
We can stay together, just the two of us.

385
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,000
But I have to go to classes

386
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,360
and teach Taekwando sometimes.

387
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,630
You might feel...

388
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,610
a bit lonely in the beginning.

389
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,730
But after a while...

390
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,380
you will get used to it.

391
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,010
I will try to come back home as fast as I can.

392
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,810
I won't let you feel lonely.

393
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,530
Kuea.

394
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,270
What's wrong?

395
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,720
I will call off the engagement.

396
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,210
I'm serious this time.

397
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,720
Kuea...

398
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,420
So...

399
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,280
All the Keerati's property

400
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,550
belongs to Hia Lian now?

401
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,040
Yes.

402
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,110
And Hia will sell the mansion to Hia Yi so he can turn it into a car showroom.

403
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,530
I saw the lease purchase agreement.

404
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,200
But it's not signed yet.

405
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,570
But, why would he do such a thing? Your mom must know about this then.

406
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,970
Yeah, I guess.

407
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,770
But I'm too afraid to ask.

408
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,430
Why?

409
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,430
You should ask her so that you will understand the situation.

410
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,430
If my mom agrees to sell the mansion that my grandpa treasured most,

411
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,150
then that means the Keerati family has nothing left.

412
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,440
I hate myself so much.

413
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,430
I hate myself for not knowing anything.

414
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:30,060
An old family like Keerati will come to an end in my generation.

415
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,090
But I had absolutely no idea.

416
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,070
I went to study abroad.

417
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,150
All I worried about was playing drums, riding superbikes, and driving supercars.

418
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,160
I was worried that Hia would find out, but in actuality, Hia didn't even care about it.

419
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,530
I don't think your mom would do that to hurt your feelings.

420
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,310
Think carefully.

421
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,680
Then why didn't she say anything to me?

422
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,310
Why didn't she tell me anything?

423
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,120
Maybe...

424
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,300
she doesn't have the chance to tell you yet.

425
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,320
Everyone.

426
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,180
Hia, my dad, and my mom.

427
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,780
They probably think that I'm still just a kid.

428
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,340
The reason that Hia is still nice to me

429
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,430
is because it's his duty.

430
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,330
What about this house, Kuea?

431
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,630
This house belongs to grandpa Auea.

432
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,630
He gave this house to me.

433
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,030
It's not Keerati's property.

434
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,430
Do you still remember?

435
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,780
Last time,

436
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,770
you told me that I could always come here if I had no place to go.

437
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,610
I was so happy to hear that.

438
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,930
But if, in the end,

439
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,030
you really have nothing left,

440
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,930
you will still have this house.

441
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,130
And you will also have me, who will always be by your side.

442
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,000
At least I'll have a place to sleep at night.

443
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,930
Kuea, you're a very talented person.

444
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,360
You have a singing career.

445
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,630
Many people also contacted you because of your Youtube channel.

446
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,930
A person like you won't starve to death.

447
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,630
Thank you so much.

448
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,280
What are you doing?

449
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,290
I'm checking the details

450
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,120
before making the prototype car.

451
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,930
I'm trying to compare this with the model design and see if I can add anything to it.

452
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,120
Why didn't you ask our friends to come in and help, then?

453
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,770
Well...

454
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,430
I wanted to try it out by myself first.

455
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,950
So this is what top students usually do.

456
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,330
I'm not always like this.

457
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,900
But...

458
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,470
I want to prove to family

459
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,960
that I'm serious about this and that I can do it well.

460
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,630
No one thinks it's a good idea for me to change my major halfway through my studies.

461
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,980
Can you help me check this part?

462
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,040
It's okay.

463
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,550
This one too.

464
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,460
Hello, mom.

465
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,230
There's something important I need to talk to you about.

466
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,810
What do you think?

467
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,330
It sounds so formal.

468
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,310
Do you usually talk to her like this?

469
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,490
Yeah.

470
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,130
I'm more polite when I talk to her.

471
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,540
I think this might scare her.

472
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:45,570
Let's change a few words.

473
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:55,880
Hello, mom. Are you busy?

474
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,330
I miss you.

475
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,230
How about this?

476
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,560
I think this is okay. You can send it.

477
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,630
I'll send it now.

478
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,550
Thank you for coming here.

479
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,610
Of course, I'll come whenever you call.

480
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,430
Don't stress too much!

481
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,420
Let's eat some snacks.

482
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,430
Here.

483
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,430
And also some orange juice.

484
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,530
I think you're dehydrated from all the crying you've been doing.

485
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,070
You'd better drink some liquid.

486
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,270
Orange juice?

487
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:54,410
That's right.

488
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,790
And snacks, too.

489
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,230
You have to eat it with me.

490
00:43:58,530 --> 00:43:59,030
Sure!

491
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,430
Nong.

492
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,430
Is Hia home already?

493
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:07,950
Nong.

494
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,120
Kon-Diao.

495
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,310
You can just sit and wait for me. I'll cook for you.

496
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,460
What are you making?

497
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,540
Um...

498
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,940
I'm making spaghetti carbonara.

499
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,330
Your favorite dish...

500
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,760
Right?

501
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,400
Look at all the mess.

502
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,930
Are you sure that I will get to eat it today?

503
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,430
I already looked at the recipe.

504
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,530
I think...

505
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,650
I can do it.

506
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,490
Okay...

507
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,670
I don't know if it's edible or not.

508
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,510
You don't have to eat it. I can just give it to the dog.

509
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:51,240
You can't! You can't let her eat human food.

510
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,930
It's not bad.

511
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,030
It tastes much better than I expected.

512
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,070
But...

513
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,340
It's a bit too salty.

514
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,930
Kon-Diao.

515
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,230
After you finish eating,

516
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,970
don't go to bed just yet.

517
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,690
I have something to talk to you about.

518
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,080
Okay, Hia.

519
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,760
Kon-Diao.

520
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,800
There's something I want to tell you.

521
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,800
Can I say something first?

522
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,780
Do you really want me to stay here?

523
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,810
And when you said that you're coming back to live here,

524
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,850
are you going to live here with me?

525
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:20,880
Do you want to stay here with me?

526
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,260
Of course.

527
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,750
I want to be with you.

528
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,960
Why?

529
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,110
Do you have to know why?

530
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,020
Yes.

531
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,850
If it's possible,

532
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,020
can you please answer my question?

533
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,290
Because...

534
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:28,000
♪ If it's love, can you please make me feel more confident? ♪

535
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,690
♪ Please tell me if it's just me who feels this way, so I can stop my heart from falling too hard ♪

536
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,670
♪ You avoid looking me in the eye. Does that mean anything? ♪

537
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:46,230
You want to know why?

538
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,000
It's because I love you.

539
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,220
I love only you.

540
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,230
Kon-Diao.

541
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,070
Is this answer good enough for you?

542
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:11,640
Yes.

543
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,400
Why are you crying?

544
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:33,800
If that's not enough...

545
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,640
I can keep telling you again and again, that I love you.

546
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,180
I'll keep saying it until you wouldn't doubt it anymore.

547
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,940
What's past is past.

548
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:50,020
Let's forget about it.

549
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,600
Let's start over.

550
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,940
Okay.

551
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,280
Let's start over.

552
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,730
Because you're also the only one I love.

553
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,760
Nu-Kuea, I'm home.

554
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,800
Nu-Kuea.

555
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,170
Yes, mom.

556
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,900
Nu-Kuea.

557
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,350
What I want to ask you

558
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,220
is...

559
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,630
Nu-Kuea.

560
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,080
I want to ask you...

561
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,450
Is our family going to go bankrupt?

562
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,640
This Sunday is my dad's birthday. Don't forget it.

563
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,450
Will there also be a big surprise this year?

564
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,100
Of course.

565
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,250
Why did you have to sell everything that belonged to our family to Hia? What is happening?

566
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:51,350
Calm down, Nu-Kuea.

567
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,310
Why didn't you tell me?

568
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,510
Aren't you my fiancé?

569
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm sorry.
