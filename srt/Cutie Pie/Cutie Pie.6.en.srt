1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,420
Is the reason why you've decorated my room like this because you like this style?

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,780
Yeah, I like it.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,380
I've never known how he spends his days.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,580
I've never thought a small club that I built with my own two hands would catch a capitalist's eye like you.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,340
You should consider it.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,860
I can handle his naughtiness.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,180
I can deal with him even if he's worse than this.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,540
That's enough. Stop it, guys!

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,580
Do you think it's cool to tease your friend like this?

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,200
Let's go, Kuea.

11
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,759
It's fine.

12
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,960
Thanks.

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,640
But I'm okay.

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,160
Hey, you guys.

15
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,479
Let's go to class.

16
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,560
We'll be late.

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,840
Let's go.

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,320
So what are we going to do?

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,199
Who's going to be in my group?

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,640
Nuer, you'll be in my group too, right?

21
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
Up to Kuea.

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,520
If he's okay with that, I'll join.

23
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,680
He can't!

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,280
There's always five of us in the group.

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,240
We've never had any problems.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
Why are you acting like a kid splitting their football teams?

27
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Actually, Nuer doesn't even want to be in our group.

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
The professor forced him to be here.

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Isn't that right, Syn?

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
"Nanajitang," to each his own.

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
I wouldn't know.

32
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
But Nuer was a computer engineering student.

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,920
He's also the top of the class.

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,640
I think this formula one project needs his godlike skill.

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,920
You're right.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
We can't, Jab!

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,240
There're always just the five of us!

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,360
Each hand has five fingers. Have you seen anyone with six fingers?

39
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,880
- One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
- Will you shut up?

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,520
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,880
This is such a waste of time. I'm going to another group.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,320
Hey! Wait!

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,160
Calm down and drink YenYen first.

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,360
Please.

45
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,600
We're about to sort out this issue.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,120
Right, Kuea?

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,560
Please stay calm and sit down.

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,120
Please.

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,520
Let's finalize this already.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,200
If Kuea lets me,

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,760
I'll be in this group.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
But if Kuea doesn't want me to,

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
I can go to another group.

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,480
There's just Kuea in this group for him, huh.

55
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,480
Fine.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
So there's me,

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,360
Nuchy,

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,040
Ton,

59
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,600
Jab,

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,320
Syn,

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
and Nuer.

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,280
Six of us.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay?

64
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,720
Thank you.

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,120
Let me know if you need any help.

66
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Kuea.

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
Can I talk to you for a bit?

68
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
About what?

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
About what happened this morning.

70
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,959
It's okay. I know that you didn't mean to tease me like that.

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,560
But the other two.

72
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,520
Does he mean you and me?

73
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,640
I think so.

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,200
He's staring at us.

75
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,880
If you feel like there's an evil ghost following you around,

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
I can take you to the monk so he can sprinkle you with holy water to get rid of the bad fortune.

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,080
Hia...

78
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
You can do it!

79
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,800
What's that?

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
Over there, see?

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Where?

82
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,560
You can do it!

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,340
What's wrong, Foei?

84
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,400
I see that Hia--

85
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
I mean...

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,240
I see that Mr. Lian is happy, so I'm happy too.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
Here.

88
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,800
The document from the legal department.

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
About buying the Keerati Mansion.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
I've sorted everything out for you.

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Oh, put it down.

92
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
Everything's done.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
You want me to get out, don't you?

94
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,840
Alright, sir.

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,320
You're not scolding me yet.

96
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
You're in a good mood, right?

97
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,240
Foei.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,640
You're going to scold me soon.

99
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
I got it, sir.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Try moving this one here.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
This one?

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,080
Yeah.

103
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
Okay.

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
Move it over here?

105
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Yes.

106
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,240
Syn!

107
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,240
Can you bring me a pen?

108
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,240
Sorry.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,640
I just went to the lavatory.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,440
Nuer.

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,480
You're Nuchy's partner, aren't you?

112
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
Why don't you go and help her?

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,159
I saw that no one was helping Kuea.

114
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,200
I only came here to give him a pen.

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,640
Gosh!

116
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,680
Come check this first.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
Ton, Jab!

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
What?

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,560
What's wrong?

120
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,360
It's like this again.

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
It's frozen?

122
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,720
Yeah.

123
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,960
I think we should clearly define our roles and responsibilities for this project.

124
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,200
I agree.

125
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Right now, we're working in pairs.

126
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,720
So there's Kuea and I, Ton and Jab, Nuchy and Nuer.

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,480
Kuea and I will be responsible for the engine part.

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,120
Ton and Jab will be responsible for the external part.

129
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,520
As for Nuchy and Nuer,

130
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,880
you guys can be responsible for the research and data collection part.

131
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,120
I think we all should help with the research and data collection.

132
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,200
Let's just do what he said.

133
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,680
There are two geniuses in our group.

134
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
We should make use of them.

135
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,040
Syn, you're a visionary leader.

136
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,200
You're amazing.

137
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,160
But...

138
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,240
It's okay, Kuea.

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm not good at the engine stuff anyway.

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Let's follow Syn's suggestions for now.

141
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,080
We can make adjustments later.

142
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Okay.

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Are you okay with that, Nuer?

144
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,120
Sure.

145
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't have any problems with that.

146
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm not the problematic one here.

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,520
But right now,

148
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,720
we should solve this problem first.

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,920
Dude, it's too hard.

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,920
I fixed it. Have a look.

151
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,160
Hey!

152
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,600
We've been trying to fix this problem for ages, but we couldn't do it.

153
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,680
How did you do it?

154
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,040
You're good at setting your hair and also fixing computers?

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,360
You're amazing!

156
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,880
The length of the front wheel...

157
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
630.

158
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Alright. Let's change this one here.

159
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,520
40 degrees, right?

160
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,880
Please forgive me, Kuea.

161
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,880
It looks more symmetrical now.

162
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,320
Let me go!

163
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,300
Bring him this way!

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
What are you guys doing?

165
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm so sorry, Kuea. But we have to do this.

166
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,180
We need to talk without Nuer following you around.

167
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,800
We can just talk in our group chat.

168
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Oh, right!

169
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,480
We can't! You might not believe us if you can't see our facial expressions.

170
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
We're really saying this from the bottom of our hearts.

171
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,520
I strictly uphold the five precepts.

172
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
You know it, right?

173
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,620
That I never lie.

174
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,520
Yeah!

175
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,680
I know.

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,520
What do you want to tell me?

177
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,280
No one thinks it's a good idea to let Nuer be in our group.

178
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,680
Why?

179
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Syn.

180
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,080
You're acting weird these days.

181
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,440
That's because...

182
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,680
Nuer is approaching you with bad intentions.

183
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,120
He knows that you already have a fiancé.

184
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,280
But he's still trying to flirt with you.

185
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,760
This is not something a good person does.

186
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
You're going too far.

187
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
Nuer hasn't even done anything yet.

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,120
I know Nuer's intention of approaching me.

189
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
But I don't care.

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay?

191
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,440
Kuea.

192
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
I agree with Syn.

193
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,800
I think Nuer is not a good person.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
Listen to me, Kuea.

195
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,640
That day.

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,040
After our most entertaining football match.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
You told us that you called off the engagement.

198
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
And I don't know what the situation with that is right now.

199
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,560
But after you left,

200
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,040
Nuer turned into a completely different person.

201
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,680
From white

202
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,160
to black.

203
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,960
He made Syn so angry even his face turned red.

204
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,280
He's definitely got something up his sleeves!

205
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
So what?

206
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,600
It's okay if he wants to flirt, isn't it?

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,720
I will call off my engagement with Hia Lian soon.

208
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
So you like Nuer?

209
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,400
I don't.

210
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
Do I have to like everyone who approaches me?

211
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,320
No one's ever tried approaching me before anyway.

212
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,800
All throughout my life, there's only been Hia.

213
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,760
I've never cared about anyone else.

214
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,960
But right now.

215
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,800
I should start gaining experience.

216
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,200
But you should be careful, Kuea.

217
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,200
You're handsome and rich.

218
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,160
There will be people who approach you with questionable intentions.

219
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,720
That's fine!

220
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,240
I have you guys to protect me.

221
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,500
Especially you, Syn.

222
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,920
Thank you so much.

223
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,040
So when you told us you're going to be single soon...

224
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,800
Is that true?

225
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,880
Well...

226
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,240
Yeah.

227
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,120
Please forgive Kuea.

228
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
Everyone, put your hands together.

229
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,240
Let's chant together, requesting for three refuges and five precepts.

230
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,520
"Mayam bhante."

231
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
"Visum visum."

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,720
"Rakkhanat thaya."

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Wanna play football today?

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
Just a match!

235
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,360
You brought your clothes?

236
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,800
Of course!

237
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,320
Ton-Rak can wash, dry, and iron your clothes.

238
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,840
Wow. You're amazing.

239
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,020
Are you coming, Kuea?

240
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,200
Sure.

241
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,520
Hey, guys!

242
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,600
Who's that guy?

243
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,040
He's wearing a suit on campus.

244
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,280
He looks like a mafia.

245
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
He's cool and handsome!

246
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,640
Shit!

247
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,360
What the hell?

248
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,800
What's wrong with you?

249
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,320
I haven't even called him yet. Why is he here?

250
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
What's wrong, Kuea?

251
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,160
That guy.

252
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,840
That's Kilen Wang.

253
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,840
My fiancé.

254
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,040
I mean,

255
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,360
my ex-fiancé.

256
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
You're really something, Nu-Kuea.

257
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,360
Introduce us to him.

258
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,720
Why should I do that?

259
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,400
No way!

260
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,480
Why not?

261
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,240
Is he bothering you?

262
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,600
Do you want us to chase him away?

263
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,760
No, don't do that!

264
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,600
He's not bothering me.

265
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,320
It's just...

266
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
I told him that I'm majoring in computer engineering.

267
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,080
If he finds out that I'm in automotive engineering,

268
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,960
he definitely wouldn't let me study here.

269
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
Well, I guess you have a point.

270
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,520
But what's wrong with that?

271
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,240
Well...

272
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
We're not neat and tidy.

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
So you're saying that we're lousy?!

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,520
That we're filthy?!

275
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,200
That we're not like other normal human beings?!

276
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,400
No!

277
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,920
It's not like that.

278
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,520
Kuea.

279
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,240
How about this?

280
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,120
In order to prove that automotive engineer majors like us

281
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,800
are not inferior to computer engineers.

282
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,880
We will

283
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,600
help you out.

284
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,520
Hello, Hia.

285
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,589
Are these your friends?

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,240
That's right.

287
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,829
This is Syn-Samer.

288
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,240
This is Ton-Rak.

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,200
And this is Pongsatorn.

290
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,680
How are you guys getting home?

291
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,560
Do you want me to drop you guys off?

292
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,520
It's okay, sir.

293
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,280
I have my own car.

294
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,840
As for me, I have a driver, sir.

295
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
As for me,

296
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,600
I like to practice going on a pilgrimage, sir.

297
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,400
We are Mr. Kuea's friends from the computer engineering major, sir.

298
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,840
We really like to learn about computers.

299
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,120
Isn't that right, everyone?

300
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
That's right, sir.

301
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
Even when it's Saturday, we're still here to study.

302
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,560
Pongsatorn.

303
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,120
Should we go to the library and revise for about two hours before going home?

304
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,720
That's a very good idea, sir.

305
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,840
You guys should hurry up then, or the library will be closed.

306
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,400
That's right! We'd better get going now. Please excuse us, sir.

307
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,200
You dropped your nut, sir.

308
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,320
This is not a nut, sir. It's a gear.

309
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
It is an essential component of a computer, sir.

310
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,240
Thank you so much, sir.

311
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,240
Your welcome, sir.

312
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,720
Why aren't you guys leaving yet?

313
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,240
Hello, Father.

314
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,560
May I invite you to join us in making merit by joining The Robe Offering Ceremony.

315
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,480
You're calling me Father?

316
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,940
It's better if you ask him.

317
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,280
You'll get more donations this way.

318
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,920
I would like to invite you, Mr. Fiancé, to be one of the hosts for The Robe Offering Ceremony.

319
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Let's make merit together in this life so we can meet again in the next.

320
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,400
Foei, deal with this.

321
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
Yes, sir.

322
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,520
This way, sir.

323
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,640
Here you go.

324
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,880
Amen.

325
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,920
I rejoice in your merit. I wish you more and more happiness and prosperity throughout your whole life.

326
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,720
Thank you so much, sir. Let's go to the library now.

327
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,060
We're engineers majoring in acting!

328
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
Your friends are pretty funny, aren't they?

329
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Right.

330
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,800
Where are you going?

331
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,560
I'm on my way to get my bicycle.

332
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,800
I forgot it at school last night.

333
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,560
Do you have to go and get it today?

334
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,360
Yes. I'm afraid of losing it.

335
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,800
Get in the car.

336
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
I'll drop you off.

337
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,600
It's okay, Hia.

338
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,000
I can go by myself.

339
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,400
Okay.

340
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,040
(Freedom)

341
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
Oh, no.

342
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,520
How has my tires gone flat?

343
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Why is it flat now?

344
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,920
Come on, I'll buy you a new one.

345
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,000
It's okay.

346
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,640
I can ask the uncle at a shop on the main street to inflate the tire for me.

347
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
I really like this bicycle.

348
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
Then I'll let my subordinate fix it for you.

349
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,280
From now on, if you want to go somewhere, just tell me.

350
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,560
I'll drop you off and pick you up.

351
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
It's okay.

352
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,880
I don't want to bother you.

353
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,640
You're already very busy.

354
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,740
Just let me know beforehand.

355
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,280
Tell me your daily schedule.

356
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,200
I can take care of myself.

357
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,880
How?

358
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,800
You only have this bicycle.

359
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,160
And you have a part-time job too.

360
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,680
I think I haven't taken care of you well enough.

361
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,920
You've given me a place to live...

362
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,720
and come visit me when you have time...

363
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,680
That's already enough for me.

364
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,520
Let's learn how to drive tomorrow.

365
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,840
I'll give you a car.

366
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,120
I don't want it.

367
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,000
But if you really want to give me something...

368
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,920
Can I have...

369
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,240
your time?

370
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,100
Can you come back and stay with me?

371
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,560
Do you have to go there every night?

372
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,160
Not every night.

373
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,560
But I have to go on Saturdays because that's when they'll be a lot of customers.

374
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,200
I see.

375
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,320
I just have to go check if every thing's running smoothly.

376
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,520
I'll be back before midnight.

377
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,160
Then...

378
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,120
Next Saturday...

379
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,680
Can I go with you?

380
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,440
No.

381
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,960
Didn't you say that you will give me Pentagon?

382
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,360
You said that you didn't want it anymore.

383
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
You didn't really mean what you said, right?

384
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,520
I will give it to you eventually.

385
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,600
I just need to see if you can behave or not.

386
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,720
Stay home and be a good boy.

387
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,240
I'll be back soon.

388
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,520
Don't go to bed just yet.

389
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,280
Why did he tell me not to go to bed yet?

390
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,720
What is he planning to do?

391
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,440
Pull yourself together!

392
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,880
Pull yourself together!

393
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,800
Kuea!

394
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,640
You can't be like this.

395
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,920
Don't forget why you're here.

396
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,130
Hello.

397
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,180
What's the matter?

398
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,210
Kuea!

399
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,220
Where are you?

400
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,380
I'm at Hia's house.

401
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,640
Guess who's at my club right now.

402
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,740
Hia Lian?

403
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,220
Jong-Kook!

404
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,720
The Korean producer!

405
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,970
What?

406
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,960
How is that possible?!

407
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,130
How am I supposed to know?

408
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:57,670
You have to come here right now. He's here to see you.

409
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,830
He said he saw Kirin's Youtube channel.

410
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,890
I can't go.

411
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,830
Dude, listen to me carefully.

412
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,570
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.

413
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,470
If you don't come and perform tonight, you may never get a chance like this again.

414
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,650
Hia's house is just opposite from here, isn't it?

415
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,090
Just run!

416
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,730
Mr. Yi has been here since evening.

417
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,290
What are you doing here?

418
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,850
Just drinking.

419
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,150
I'm not here to see you.

420
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,470
Can I sit with you?

421
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,300
It's your club.

422
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,670
Do whatever you want.

423
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,030
I'm just a small business partner.

424
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,250
What's wrong?

425
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,330
A personal issue?

426
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,590
I won't tell you.

427
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,910
I'm not like Kon-Diao.

428
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,880
He tells Kuea everything.

429
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,240
He never tells me anything.

430
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,060
He has so many fucking secrets.

431
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,430
If you want to know, you should ask Kuea.

432
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,250
You're too drunk, Yi.

433
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,330
Who's drunk?

434
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,890
I'm not drunk!

435
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,010
I'm a heavyweight.

436
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,920
He came back too early!

437
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,670
Just sit still.

438
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,830
What are you so angry about?

439
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,810
Hia Yi!

440
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,910
Is he drunk?

441
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,930
Shit.

442
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,470
Why did they come back now?

443
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,060
Gosh!

444
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,790
Think, Kuea!

445
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,310
He said he didn't want anything from me.

446
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,900
Except my time.

447
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,120
You should make time for him then.

448
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,450
His time means

449
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,690
he wants me to go back home.

450
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,730
But how can I live with him?

451
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,290
I was the one who did it.

452
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,610
I'm a bastard.

453
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,770
He lost his memory because of me.

454
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,290
Have you ever thought of talking about this with him?

455
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,810
How can I talk to him about this?

456
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,650
I can't do it.

457
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,670
If he knows,

458
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,570
he'll be sad.

459
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,670
And he will hate me.

460
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,630
I don't know how you guys live together.

461
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,870
But isn't it better to tell the truth?

462
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,470
You're talking as if you and Kuea has no secrets between each other.

463
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,270
Yi!

464
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,130
You and Kuea's kept secrets from each other too.

465
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,610
Or are you telling me that's not true?

466
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,790
Foei.

467
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,960
Come pick up Mr. Yi at my house now.

468
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,210
This is driving me nuts!

469
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,870
Yi.

470
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,030
Water.

471
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,850
Oh, Hia Yi.

472
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,730
Hello.

473
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,870
Hi.

474
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,510
Is Hia Yi drunk?

475
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,410
A little.

476
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,690
I already asked Foei to come pick him up.

477
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,830
You're going to bed now?

478
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,710
Well...

479
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,430
Why don't you drive him home by yourself?

480
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,890
I promised you that I'd come back as soon as possible.

481
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,930
What about you?

482
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,300
I told you not to go to bed yet.

483
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,330
Well...

484
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,990
I'm so tired today.

485
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,690
I'm completely exhausted.

486
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,850
What are you doing down here then?

487
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,090
Oh.

488
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,090
I ran out of water!

489
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,210
So I came down to grab some.

490
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,690
It's okay.

491
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,290
You can take this.

492
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,230
Yi probably won't drink it anyway.

493
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,610
Thank you, Hia.

494
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,070
I will go back to sleep then.

495
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,430
Nu-Kuea.

496
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,130
Why did you set your hair before going to bed?

497
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,670
I didn't.

498
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,070
This is my natural hair.

499
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,170
See?

500
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,890
I will go to bed now. Good night.

501
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,150
Nu-Kuea!

502
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,530
Don't tell Kon-Diao about this.

503
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,290
Okay.

504
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,330
Why did I just say okay?

505
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,690
I give up!

506
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,130
There's no hope tonight.

507
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,520
(Jay, I can't go tonight.)

508
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,810
Where is he?

509
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,610
Hia!

510
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,430
How did you get in here?

511
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,690
Hia.

512
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,990
Get out right now!

513
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,210
Didn't you say you're going to bed.

514
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,210
Why did you just take a shower?

515
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,630
Why can't I do that?

516
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,190
I can do what I want.

517
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,210
You actually did set your hair before.

518
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,850
Where did you think you were gonna go?

519
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,850
You're acting naughty...

520
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,010
Should I just chain you up?

521
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,230
Hm?

522
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,370
Hia.

523
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,090
What are you doing?

524
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,930
Don't come any closer!

525
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,420
Where is the "krub" at the end of your sentence?

526
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:17,070
You're talking to me informally these days.

527
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,030
Is this the time for that, Hia?!

528
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,470
What did you just say?

529
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,890
I said that out loud?!

530
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,110
You're a pretty funny guy.

531
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,430
I guess there're many things on your mind that you want to tell me.

532
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,870
There's none!

533
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,090
Don't come any closer!

534
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,510
If you take one more step,

535
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,110
I will bite you!

536
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:44,890
Oh.

537
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,410
That's so scary.

538
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:53,090
Why is it so hot in your room?

539
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,100
Hia.

540
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,150
Stop fooling around.

541
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,230
This is not funny.

542
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,970
I'm not fooling around.

543
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,310
I'm serious.

544
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,770
Be a good boy.

545
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,670
Good night and sweet dreams, Nu-Kuea.

546
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,070
Don't try to sneak out.

547
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,310
Because I'm a vampire.

548
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,530
I never sleep.

549
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,120
What the heck? Why is he playing with my heart like this?

550
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,060
Is it impossible for me to win against him?

551
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,960
Damn it! Did I make the right decision to move here?

552
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,990
Why are you so adorable, Nu-Kuea?

553
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,600
(How to plan a date that wins the heart?)

554
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,690
Nu-Kuea.

555
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,770
Yes, Hia?

556
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,890
I see that your hair is back to normal now.

557
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,130
So the reason that I'm here...

558
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,770
is that you can keep an eye on my behavior?

559
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,450
Please excuse me if you're just here to pick a fight with me.

560
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,010
Wait.

561
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,170
Let's go on a date.

562
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,310
This evening.

563
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:56,670
Huh?

564
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,830
A date?

565
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,990
We still have to go on dates?

566
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,990
I thought we no longer had this rule ever since I moved in with you.

567
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,510
Nu-Kuea.

568
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:14,650
The reason I wanted you to move in is not only so that I can always keep an eye on you.

569
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,050
I also want us to know more about each other.

570
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,210
And about this dating thing.

571
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,690
I want to make up for all the dates we've had before.

572
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:26,850
After this,

573
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,670
I think we shouldn't have a rule

574
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,550
to only go on dates every Friday.

575
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:33,510
We can go on a date

576
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,910
whenever we want.

577
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,930
Are you okay with that?

578
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,750
Yes, Hia.

579
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,690
I will pick you up at 5 p.m.

580
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,990
I have to go to work now.

581
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,690
Is he possessed by a ghost?

582
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,010
But...

583
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,060
Nu-Kuea.

584
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,780
If you don't like anything, just let me know.

585
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
Don't hesitate.

586
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay, Hia.

587
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,060
But...

588
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,520
I'm still not used to this version of you.

589
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,100
Can I ask you something?

590
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,160
What are you thinking?

591
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,820
Like I told you.

592
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,820
I think we should get to know each other better.

593
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,320
We should try new things.

594
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,120
Like today.

595
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,760
But today...

596
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,900
we've come to the same restaurant.

597
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,420
But,

598
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,880
it's fine.

599
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,640
It's the same restaurant, but the atmosphere between us has changed.

600
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,980
It feels new to me.

601
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,520
Wow!

602
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,340
This cauliflower looks so good. Do you want to try it? I'll give it to you.

603
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,520
That's a broccoli, Nu-Kuea.

604
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,340
Oh, it really is a broccoli.

605
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,540
I'm not that knowledgeable about food, Hia.

606
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,560
It's okay. I understand.

607
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,740
Let me do it for you.

608
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,720
It's okay. I can do it.

609
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,960
It's okay, Hia.

610
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Let me pour it for you.

611
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,320
Or else it won't feel like we're on a date.

612
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,640
All dishes have been served.

613
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,180
If you're not satisfied with anything, please let me know.

614
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,020
Okay.

615
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,640
You guys are so cute.

616
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,060
Big brother is taking his little brother out for dinner.

617
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,440
It's very heartwarming to see.

618
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,720
This makes me miss my family.

619
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,140
If you need anything else, please let me know.

620
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,740
Nu-Kuea.

621
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,800
You don't have to count today as a date.

622
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,080
Hm?

623
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,280
Just think that I took you out for a normal dinner.

624
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,260
I'll take you out on another date.

625
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,980
Let's go somewhere...

626
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,700
we've never been to together before.

627
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,940
What do you think?

628
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,840
It's okay, Hia.

629
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,180
I think...

630
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,100
a date is not that important anymore.

631
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,680
Is there something wrong?

632
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,740
I think that...

633
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,340
maybe...

634
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,660
"date" is just another word.

635
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,920
The fact that we're spending time together like this

636
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,160
is even more meaningful than a date.

637
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,240
I don't understand.

638
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,800
The reason you want to call off our engagement

639
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,180
is because I don't pay enough attention to you, isn't it?

640
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,360
That's absolutely right.

641
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,860
I'm sorry.

642
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,420
I didn't mean to say that.

643
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,640
It's okay.

644
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,700
I understand.

645
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,180
I'm trying to improve myself.

646
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,100
You're not okay with that?

647
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,960
It's fine.

648
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,440
But I'm just not used to it yet.

649
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,080
You were still teasing me yesterday.

650
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,700
That's because you're always sneaking around.

651
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,680
How can I not keep an eye on you?

652
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,040
You also like to tease me.

653
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,020
You also scold me.

654
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,480
How can I dare to show you my true self?

655
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,260
But...this is who I am.

656
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,640
The more you know me, the more I seem to be naughty, right?

657
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,440
You can be naughty as much as you want.

658
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,440
I just want you to feel comfortable being yourself.

659
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,260
You too.

660
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,800
You don't have to change yourself for me.

661
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,480
You make me so confused already.

662
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,420
I guess we both have to make some adjustments.

663
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,760
If two people love each other,

664
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,860
they should adapt towards one another.

665
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,380
Find comfort in each other.

666
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,040
Um.

667
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,900
I will try.

668
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,620
But if it comes to cooking,

669
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,080
I admit that I'm not good at it.

670
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,940
But...I will try to improve myself.

671
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,180
And also...

672
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,220
I haven't said that I wouldn't call off the engagement.

673
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,680
Don't try to fool me with sweet words.

674
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,500
You're awake?

675
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,400
Are you hungry?

676
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,100
Yes.

677
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,420
What are you cooking?

678
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,640
Do you want some help?

679
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,380
You can help me cut the salted eggs.

680
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,060
Just cut it into slices.

681
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,500
I'm going to make spicy salted egg salad.

682
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,280
It's not that complicated.

683
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,100
You can do it, Kuea!

684
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,320
That's dangerous!

685
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,040
If you don't know how to do it, why didn't you just tell me?

686
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,500
You're an adult now.

687
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,380
I can do it.

688
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,040
Who uses such a big knife to slice an egg?

689
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,900
Go sit there and wait.

690
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,160
I'll do it myself.

691
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,900
Nu-Kuea.

692
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,400
Why are you crying?

693
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,960
I can't do anything, right?

694
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,620
Everything I do is wrong.

695
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,440
I didn't mean it like that.

696
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,880
I raised my voice because I was scared.

697
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,900
I was afraid that you'd cut yourself.

698
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,300
I'm not good enough.

699
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,940
I'm just a burden to you.

700
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,080
I understand now.

701
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,660
Why you don't love me.

702
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,060
Whoa!

703
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,500
Is this yours?

704
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,700
Get in.

705
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,420
This is where you think I'd want to come for a date?

706
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,460
This outfit looks good on you.

707
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,900
Hia, you're acting weird.

708
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,020
I like to see you making a fuss. It's funny.

709
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,820
I'll keep teasing you like this for a really long time.

710
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,100
Hia, are you stressed about work?

711
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,580
Or is it because...

712
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,100
Is it because I asked you to come back and stay with me?

713
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,460
You didn't bring Kon-Diao with you?

714
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,860
Is it okay to leave him alone at home?

715
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,500
You never let Nu-Kuea and Kon-Diao come to Pentagon.

716
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,700
You're okay with bringing him here now?

717
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,820
From now on,

718
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,100
there will be no more secrets between Nu-Kuea and me.

719
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,700
If I want him to tell me everything,

720
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,220
I must let him into my world first.
