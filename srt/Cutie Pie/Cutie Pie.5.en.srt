1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,450
So when are you going to move in with Hia Lian?

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,940
Can I have three days to prepare myself, please?

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,290
Fine, three days. I will prepare a room for you.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,820
Prepare everything as I've told you.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,280
Make it so that Nu-Kuea will never want to leave this house.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,120
Did you know that Kon-Diao and Nu-Kuea always come here behind your back?

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,960
Where do you think Kon-Diao is right now?

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,480
You have a responsibility and a promise to keep.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,020
As for me, I once did something wrong towards him.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,940
Do you really want me to stay with you?

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,850
The closer we are, the more dangerous it gets.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,650
Why do you have to force me?

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,070
Why are your clothes in this room too?

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,460
We're going to sleep together in the same room.

15
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,430
No!

16
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,970
This wasn't part of our deal!

17
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,970
You said that I just have to move in with you.

18
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,940
You didn't say that we have to also stay in the same room!

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,979
Do I have to explain everything to you?

20
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,780
We're going to be living together as a married couple.

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,110
That's why we'll also sleep together.

22
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,620
Don't you think so?

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,660
But we're not husb--

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,680
I will call of the engagement!

25
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,080
Come on.

26
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,060
There's an old saying.

27
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,960
A couple in an arranged marriage,

28
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,460
once they live together,

29
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,070
will fall in love with each other anyway.

30
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,660
Have you gone mad?!

31
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,630
And who said that this is an arranged marriage?

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,620
The reason why I agreed to get engaged with you is because I--

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,040
Because we've been close since childhood.

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,380
Oh, I see.

35
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,960
Really?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,970
Really, what?

37
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,770
He's getting on my nerves.

38
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,130
You want to mess with me, right?

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,750
Bring it on!

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,110
You really want me to sleep with you?

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,430
I snore very loudly when I sleep!

42
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,380
I have earplugs.

43
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,660
Also...

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,380
I keep tossing and turning while I sleep.

45
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,220
Like this.

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,329
Do you still want to sleep together?

47
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,400
Hia...

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,510
What are you doing?

49
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,550
Tossing and turning, huh?

50
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,350
Hia!

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,450
What are you trying to do?!

52
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,260
You keep moving in your sleep, right?

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,940
I have handcuffs.

54
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,280
Do you want to try it on?

55
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,460
Hia...

56
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,630
What is it, little troublemaker?

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,260
Do you have any other excuses?

58
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,820
I won't be that mean to you.

59
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,460
Your room is the opposite one from here.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,390
But you can choose any room you want.

61
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
You keep putting your face close to mine.

62
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,120
But you're not brave enough to do it, right?

63
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
But what if I am?

64
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,840
Hia.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,290
You keep fooling around.

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,690
I'm out of here!

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,370
This is my room, right?

68
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,500
I almost lost my virginity!

69
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,260
I just got here, and he already asked me to sleep with him.

70
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,620
I shouldn't have done that.

71
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,250
He can't be trusted!

72
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,659
Kuea, you have to be more careful.

73
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,460
Whoa.

74
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,980
What kind of room is this?

75
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,620
Why are there so many things that I like?

76
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,710
He couldn't have prepared all of this in three days.

77
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,250
Did he...

78
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,320
make this room since the beginning?

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
All these things...

80
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,140
are they his?

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,600
Maybe it's just a coincidence that he likes the same things as me.

82
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,490
Does he know everything?

83
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,020
No way.

84
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,660
But he's not trustworthy.

85
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,220
This is our new home.

86
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,510
I mean temporary.

87
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,620
It's our temporary home.

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,780
Don't get too used to it.

89
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,900
Make sure to lock the door every time.

90
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,150
Got it?

91
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,440
It shouldn't be more than a month before we can go back to our lair.

92
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,350
Hia?

93
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,990
Nu-Kuea.

94
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,750
I'm going to the office now.

95
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,550
I'll come back to register your fingerprint into our security system in the evening.

96
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,820
If you're going out, don't close the door.

97
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,150
Or you won't be able to come back in.

98
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,810
What does he want from me?

99
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,240
Just leave if you have somewhere to be.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm not going anywhere yet.

101
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,510
-Did you hear what I just said??
-Shit.

102
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,350
This is important.

103
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:24,770
Yes!

104
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,340
I heard what you said.

105
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,530
See you later then.

106
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,070
Text me if you want to eat anything.

107
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,120
Alright, Hia.

108
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,610
Is there anything else?

109
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,460
Hia.

110
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,520
Hia?

111
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,540
He probably left.

112
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
Do you like your room?

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
Is it too small?

114
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,940
You can change your mind and move to my room if you want.

115
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,900
Nu-Kuea.

116
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,010
Gosh!

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,940
I'm so tired of walking backwards.

118
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,870
It's like we're practicing ballroom dancing every time we meet.

119
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,220
We keep walking back and forth.

120
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,000
Since you're already here.

121
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
I wonder if you've prepared my room like this,

122
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,960
because you personally like these things?

123
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,600
How come I never knew?

124
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:01,940
Hm.

125
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,710
I like it.

126
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,620
This stuff is all mine.

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
If you don't like it,

128
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,490
you can sell everything.

129
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,070
Or if you don't want to stay in this room,

130
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,740
you can move to another room.

131
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,230
You should think that my house...

132
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,960
is your house too.

133
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,410
Except my office.

134
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,100
This room is fine.

135
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,480
And as for your office,

136
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,630
I won't set foot in it.

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,340
Then...

138
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,870
I'll come back soon.

139
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,870
What was that?

140
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,680
Wasn't that like a husband's kiss before going to work?

141
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,260
Do I have to face this kind of situation every day?

142
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,760
Kuea, you can't be like this!

143
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,710
You must not fall for this!

144
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,610
How come he has this?

145
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,520
Hia plays this kind of game too?

146
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,180
Is this a trap?

147
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,130
You think that I will like it, don't you?

148
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,930
Why are there so many kitchens in this house?

149
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,710
Does he want to be a chef?

150
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,850
Did he plan to not let me go out anywhere?

151
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,880
I won't drink this.

152
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,040
Boring!

153
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,310
You don't know Nu-Kuea well enough.

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,670
What?

155
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,950
What's this?

156
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,930
Housewarming gift for you.

157
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,860
From Hia!?

158
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,460
How did he know I like this kind of stuff?

159
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,780
Is this another trap?

160
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,500
But Hia just said that he likes this kind of stuff too.

161
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,830
It's just another coincidence.

162
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,850
He just guessed it right.

163
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,030
No way.

164
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,670
He doesn't know that I like it.

165
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,200
It's just a coincidence.

166
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,350
Whatever.

167
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,320
Let me play this. I need to vent!

168
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,280
Mr. Lian, there's a problem at Pentagon.

169
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:44,140
Foei.

170
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,990
Remove all the CCTV cameras except the one in front of the house.

171
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,910
And don't forget to install an air conditioner in the music room.

172
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,940
Yes, sir.

173
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,920
- And about the problem, sir.
-Do it now.

174
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,670
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,540
Did he even listen to what I said?

176
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,870
Three punches!

177
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,550
Hana dul set!

178
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:21,590
Baro.

179
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,230
Charyeot.

180
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,770
Kyeong-rye.

181
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,250
Let's take a five-minute break.

182
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,830
Thank you.

183
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,230
Come on.

184
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,090
Teacher Diao.

185
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,950
What is it?

186
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,730
Teacher Diao, there's a new kid today?

187
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,430
New kid?

188
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,930
I have no idea.

189
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,930
Where is he?

190
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,810
That uncle over there.

191
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,070
An uncle?

192
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,630
Please look after me, Teacher Diao.

193
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,350
Guys.

194
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,130
Don't laugh at him.

195
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,830
Does he only eat healthy food?

196
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,700
Does he not know how to eat snacks?

197
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,620
Do I have to do it myself?

198
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,690
Is there a maid who can help?

199
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,190
Why is there nothing that seems edible?

200
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,930
Actually...

201
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,630
I've never known how he spends his days.

202
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,510
What if...

203
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,490
Hia!

204
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,430
Kuea, you're crazy!

205
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,390
You're getting delusional!

206
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,970
Your imagination goes too far.

207
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,410
Maybe I'm too stressed these days.

208
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,830
Diao!

209
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,250
I...

210
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,010
I didn't mean to laugh at you just now.

211
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,070
But you looked...

212
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,090
I'm not here to talk about that.

213
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,170
If it's about how I'm a teacher here,

214
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,350
I only do this as a part-time job.

215
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,470
Why didn't you tell me?

216
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,880
Why did you lie to me?

217
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,170
I had no intentions of lying to you.

218
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,110
I just don't have a chance to tell you yet.

219
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,050
So you lied to me?

220
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,200
After all this time,

221
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,630
you told me that you went out with Nu-Kuea.

222
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,970
You said you went to participate in club activities.

223
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,750
How will I believe you after this?

224
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,970
I'm so sorry, Hia.

225
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,940
I'm not mad at you.

226
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,710
I just want to know

227
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,220
what you've been doing

228
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,470
or who you're hanging out with.

229
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,430
I just want to...

230
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,450
I want to..

231
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,750
Don't be afraid, Hia.

232
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,070
He belongs to the owner of this school.

233
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,150
This way, sir.

234
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,370
Mr. Lian is waiting for you.

235
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,170
Alright.

236
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,450
Hey, how's it going, Mr. Lian?

237
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,630
Pentagon is nice.

238
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,430
I don't have much time.

239
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,990
Let's get down to business.

240
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,470
Oh, right.

241
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,270
Today is Friday.

242
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,880
You have a date.

243
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,130
Do you want alcohol or coffee?

244
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,290
No, thanks.

245
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,650
Coffee is not my cup of tea.

246
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,370
It makes me want to...

247
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,290
poop.

248
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,190
Thanks but no thanks.

249
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,920
I can't read Thai that well.

250
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,090
I'll let someone read it for me.

251
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,110
Can I have the answer before Sunday?

252
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,110
Of course.

253
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,170
There's not a lot for me to think about.

254
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,450
But are you sure that you want to be my business partner?

255
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,930
I always think very carefully before I do something.

256
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,390
Especially when it comes to business matters.

257
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,830
But my club barely makes any profits.

258
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,470
There are a lot of customers only when Kirin comes.

259
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,970
That's the reason why I want to be your partner.

260
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,330
I don't want to have a competitor like Kirin.

261
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,030
Let's get this straight.

262
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,750
This agreement is not a business matter, is it?

263
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,530
This is totally a personal matter.

264
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,590
If this is a personal matter,

265
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,730
I wouldn't buy stocks from every pub and bar in Thonglor.

266
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,470
I want to remain number one in this business.

267
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,590
And there's only your secret bar left.

268
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,070
Mr. Gemini.

269
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,510
I've never thought a small club that I've built with my own hands

270
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,470
would catch a capitalist's eye like you.

271
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,350
I should thank Nu-Kuea Keerati for this opportunity.

272
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,090
Unfortunately,

273
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,730
Kuea just told me that he wants to quit a few days ago.

274
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,710
I guess my club will become unpopular and lame once again.

275
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,790
He quit?

276
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:02,690
Yeah!

277
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,290
Do you know why?

278
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,010
What a waste.

279
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,930
Hold on.

280
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,070
Just joking.

281
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,830
I just want to know if you plan to interfere with my singer or not.

282
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,610
And it seems like you do.

283
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,730
And if I do,

284
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,470
what are you going to do about it?

285
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,120
I think you should change the details on this contract first.

286
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,760
You will not interfere with how I run the business.

287
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,890
This club is my life.

288
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,510
I can't let anyone take over and do whatever they want.

289
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,450
Don't worry.

290
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,770
I already included that in the contract.

291
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,550
You should consider it.

292
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,430
Good to know that we're on the same page.

293
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,870
Kuea won't quit.

294
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,850
He loves to perform too much.

295
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,330
And if you're the one who forces him to quit,

296
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:19,870
then you're not worthy of being his fiancé.

297
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,410
About that...

298
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,390
I'll let Nu-Kuea decide.

299
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,230
Diao!

300
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:45,190
You texted me, and now you're not picking up?

301
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,310
What should I do?

302
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,570
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

303
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,570
Hello, Jay.

304
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,050
Hey, Kuea.

305
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,640
My singer couldn't make it tonight.

306
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,410
Can you come instead?

307
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,070
I just told you that I'm taking a break.

308
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,210
Come on!

309
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,550
One last time.

310
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,770
I can't go.

311
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,590
Today is Friday.

312
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,950
Oh, right.

313
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,350
Today is Friday.

314
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:36,450
I'm so sorry, Jay. I really want to go but I can't.

315
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,530
Hold on, Jay.

316
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,630
Diao is calling me.

317
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,690
Okay.

318
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,150
Wait, Hia?!

319
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,730
Excuse me.

320
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,350
Could you please turn off the radio?

321
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,390
He's not picking up the phone.

322
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,910
He's probably planning something right now.

323
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,770
Hia...

324
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,730
Is something the matter?

325
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,810
I was sleeping.

326
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,590
I know that it's Friday,

327
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,090
and we have a date.

328
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,090
But I have an urgent meeting.

329
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,750
I think I will be back a bit late.

330
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,350
Around...

331
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,850
10 p.m.

332
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,790
10 p.m.

333
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,010
You should have dinner and go to bed first. Don't wait for me.

334
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,450
Hia.

335
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,030
There's nothing I can eat in your house.

336
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,030
I don't know how to cook.

337
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,750
Also, this is my first night in this house.

338
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,750
You're really going to let me stay alone tonight?

339
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,730
I'll let Foei deliver some food for you.

340
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,370
What do you want to eat?

341
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,090
Anything.

342
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,130
Anything...

343
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,550
I'll let Foei choose then.

344
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,590
Hia.

345
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,400
Then...

346
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,070
Can you tell him to leave it at the front door?

347
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,970
I'll come out and get it myself.

348
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,950
I have to concentrate on my studies.

349
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,230
Okay.

350
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,810
I will go back as soon as possible.

351
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:08,970
Don't worry.

352
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,850
The distance between our house and my office is not that far.

353
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,390
You don't have to hurry.

354
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,330
I understand.

355
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,970
Okay.

356
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,290
All clear.

357
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,250
What's up?

358
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,210
Jay, okay.

359
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,410
All clear.

360
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,350
But let me take the first stage.

361
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,990
I have to go back before 9 p.m.

362
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,090
Nice job, man.

363
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,630
See ya.

364
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,870
All done.

365
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,650
Diao.

366
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,550
Hello, Diao.

367
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,770
Where are you?

368
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,090
I'm at the Taekwondo School.

369
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,790
What's with that text?

370
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,150
Oh, it's nothing.

371
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,730
I'm on the way to see you right now.

372
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,150
I'm sorry, Kuea.

373
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,290
But you don't have to come anymore.

374
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,470
Hia Yi came to see me at the school.

375
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,390
What?!

376
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,090
Did he go on a rampant?

377
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:26,290
I sent you an "SOS" because I thought he would kill me!

378
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,810
But Hia Yi wasn't angry at all.

379
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:32,650
Are you sure that's really Hia Yi?

380
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:35,170
Yeah. I'm confused too.

381
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,130
Kuea.

382
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,530
Maybe...

383
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,990
telling the truth is not that bad.

384
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,230
I'm so relieved now.

385
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,330
Kon-Diao.

386
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,210
I have to go. Hia is here.

387
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,460
Wait, Diao!

388
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,650
Yes, Hia.

389
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,290
Let's find something to eat.

390
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,310
Sure.

391
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:12,950
Let's go.

392
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,010
Okay, Hia.

393
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,350
I'm sorry. I'm not going there anymore.

394
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,050
Could you please drive back to Thonglor?

395
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,010
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,630
Thank you.

397
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,470
Kuea!

398
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,170
Come on, man. You can do this.

399
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,130
I didn't go home before coming here.

400
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,870
Do you think I look okay in these clothes?

401
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,590
Of course.

402
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,750
You look handsome in anything you wear.

403
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,430
Don't you think it's too formal?

404
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,670
Dude.

405
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,290
Kirin's selling point is your unique voice.

406
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,120
Your drumbeat is unlike anyone else's.

407
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,950
No one cares about how you're dressed.

408
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,550
But this is not my style.

409
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,070
Then...

410
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,310
You can try going through the clothes in here.

411
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,610
Maybe you can mix and match something.

412
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,810
Have a look.

413
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,050
Do your best today.

414
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,710
You don't have to care about anything else.

415
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,090
Why are you so eager to let me perform tonight?

416
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,370
What's going on?

417
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,630
You're the most popular singer here.

418
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,990
And also...

419
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,250
My future business partner is here tonight.

420
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,810
So I want to attract more customers.

421
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,170
You have a partner now?

422
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,290
Not yet.

423
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,870
But I will have one soon.

424
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,410
It depends on how you do.

425
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,790

I can't open it!

465
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,290
What should I do?

466
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,510
Where did you go, Nu-Kuea?

467
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,530
Well..um...

468
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,990
I...

469
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,890
I went to drop something off to Kon-Diao.

470
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,650
Hia...

471
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,630
Were you back for a while already?

472
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,570
Yes.

473
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,890
I've been waiting for quite some time.

474
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,950
I was wondering where you were.

475
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,690
I already told you not to close the door when you go out.

476
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,570
Give me your hand.

477
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,590
What?

478
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,890
Give me your hand.

479
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,810
What's he going to do?

480
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,840
He can't be trusted.

481
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,750
Is he going to hit me like he did when we were young?

482
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,390
Done.

483
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,310
You can go in and out whenever you want now.

484
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,210
Thank you.

485
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,290
No date tonight, then?

486
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,870
You seem very tired.

487
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,570
Yes.

488
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,620
It's okay.

489
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,710
How's the first day? Was he naughty?

490
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,290
Not at all.

491
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,180
What a relief.

492
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:41,910
I was worried that Nu-Kuea would be too stubborn to the point where you might want to return him to me.

493
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,190
I can handle his naughtiness.

494
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,630
I can deal with him even if he's worse than this.

495
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,290
I hope that my plan to discipline him will work.

496
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,590
Alright.

497
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,070
Why does he wake up so early?

498
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,010
His house is so big. But there's only one exit?

499
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,160
How can I sneak out, then.

500
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,890
Where are you going this early in the morning?

501
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,110
Um...

502
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,690
I...

503
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,750
I have to work on my formu--

504
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,850
I mean, I have to work on my final project with my friends.

505
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,170
You guys are meeting this early in the morning?

506
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,470
You're all so hard-working.

507
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,030
Let's eat breakfast together. Then I'll drop you off.

508
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:08,840
Well...

509
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,770
This looks yummy.

510
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,850
And I'm hungry right now.

511
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,690
Fine!

512
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,190
You know how to cook?

513
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,630
Yeah.

514
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,150
Um...

515
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,830
I don't want...

516
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,550
ginger.

517
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:49,990
You made that too?

518
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,470
I bought it when I went out for a run.

519
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,430
Then why didn't he just buy congee too?

520
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,330
That's so Hia. He likes to make everything more complicated than it needs to be.

521
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,110
How's the taste?

522
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,150
Is it okay?

523
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,650
It's really good.

524
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,170
It tastes like the congee shop near your house. The one I liked to eat when I was young.

525
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,050
Nu-Kuea, after you finish eating,

526
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,190
wait for me to take a shower and get changed.

527
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,730
I'll drop you off at university.

528
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,510
It's okay, Hia.

529
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,130
I can go by myself.

530
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,840
I'm free today.

531
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,230
Well...

532
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,030
You should take a rest.

533
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,070
You've been working hard for the whole week.

534
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,070
I've promised your mom that I would take good care of you.

535
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,110
You couldn't even enter the house on your first day here.

536
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,190
How can I let you go by yourself on the second day?

537
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,050
If she finds out, she'll probably scold me.

538
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,480
So let me do what I've promised to do.

539
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,910
♪ Always you ♪

540
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:18,470
♪ I want you to know how important you are to me ♪

541
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,250
♪ Always you ♪

542
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:29,190
♪ Please understand ♪

543
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,200
Hia, it's Saturday. Isn't it your day off?

544
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,750
Since I'm already coming out to drop you off,

545
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,370
I might as well go to work, too.

546
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:52,640
We've arrived.

547
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:02,610
Hia...

548
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:08,330
You can do it!

549
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:24,130
This is actually quite nice.

550
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,510
What do you mean?

551
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,840
What's that?

552
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,930
Do you see it?

553
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,570
Where?

554
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,510
Over there.

555
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,150
I can't see anything.

556
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,080
Keep working hard.

557
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,210
You can do it!

558
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,630
Call me when you're almost done.

559
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,290
I'll come pick you up.

560
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,830
Alright.

561
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,070
You see too much, Foei.

562
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,630
You can do it, sir.

563
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:58,070
Wow. You're dressed up properly today.

564
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,950
Kuea.

565
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,070
Kuea!

566
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:09,930
Syn.

567
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,310
Dude.

568
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:12,870
I think I was tricked by a ghost.

569
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,950
Hm? This early in the morning?

570
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,410
Yeah.

571
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,670
Put your hands together.

572
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,470
Repeat after me.

573
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,210
What?

574
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,630
"Namo Tassa."

575
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,050
"Namo Tassa."

576
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,830
"Bhagavato."

577
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:30,730
"Arahato."

578
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:32,430
"Sammasambuddhassa."

579
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,170
Lucky you that I bought some holy water with me today.

580
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,570
Syn!

581
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,030
It's cold!

582
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,810
Syn, stop it. Enough!

583
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,990
What are you guys doing?

584
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,150
Kuea was tricked by a ghost.

585
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,710
What?

586
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,410
I'm getting rid of bad omens.

587
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,450
That's not it!

588
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,990
Dude, he's shaking!

589
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,550
-Do it now. Get rid of it.
-Syn, stop! It's cold!

590
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,550
-That's right, Syn. Keep doing it.
-Enough!

591
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,470
That's enough. Stop it, guys!

592
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,590
Are you okay?

593
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,250
Do you think it's cool to tease your friend like this?

594
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,270
Syn, I think you're being weird these days.

595
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,800
I know Nuer's intention of approaching me.

596
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,160
It's okay if he wants to flirt, isn't it?

597
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,630
So you like Nuer?

598
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,790
From now on, let me know where you want to go.

599
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,710
I'll drop you off and pick you up.

600
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,110
Can I have your time instead?

601
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,370
Can you come back and stay with me?

602
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,150
I'm a bastard. He lost his memory because of me.

603
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,450
How can I live with him?

604
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,780
Didn't you say you were going to bed?

605
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,180
Why did you just take a shower?

606
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,770
Why is your room so hot?

607
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,530
Hia.

608
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,440
Don't try to sneak out.

609
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,960
Because I'm a vampire.

610
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,070
I never sleep.
