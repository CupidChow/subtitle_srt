1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,860
If you're not okay, tell me immediately.

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,980
Are you happy?

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,270
I'm so happy.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,750
You guys are on good terms now. You should be happy.

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,980
It's too good to be true.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,590
If you love him and he loves you back, then I think you should just do your best in this relationship.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,010
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,490
It feels so nice to know that someone is waiting for you at home.

9
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,590
It tastes good.

10
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,890
I might not know how to cook.

11
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:44,130
But if it comes to ordering food, I think I'm really good at it.

12
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,990
Do you often order delivery?

13
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,390
I thought you only eat auntie Ja's food.

14
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,160
I usually don't order delivery that often.

15
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,110
I have to hide it from auntie Ja when I do that.

16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,090
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,820
I also like to look at food review sites.

18
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,729
So because you have a way of getting food without having to cook by yourself, you end up not knowing how to cook at all.

19
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,060
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

20
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,440
It's okay.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,380
I understand.

22
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,340
Do you want to learn how to cook?

23
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
I can teach you.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,010
How come you know how to cook? You have so many helpers at home.

25
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,610
Look at me...

26
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,340
I studied abroad and lived by myself, but I still don't know how to cook at all.

27
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,490
My family didn't always have it as easy as you think.

28
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,220
I was taught that if I wanted something, I had to work hard for it.

29
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,170
I wasn't born rich.

30
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,350
So...

31
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,130
Every dollar and every penny should be spent wisely.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,200
When I wanted something, I had to save up for it.

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,200
That's how I was brought up.

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,590
Really?

35
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,640
I've never known about this.

36
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,590
When I was young...

37
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,920
I had to wake up at dawn to help my dad at the ice factory.

38
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,230
It would be very busy in the morning because the markets were open.

39
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,230
I still remember...

40
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,020
my mom sitting at her desk picking up the phone calls

41
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:59,910
while my dad, a few subordinates, and I delivered bags of ice according to orders.

42
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:07,630
At 7 a.m., I would take a shower, eat my breakfast, and go to school.

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,790
After school, I had to come back home and help them deliver ice to the shops that were opened during the night.

44
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:20,990
I would come back home late at night, eat dinner, do my homework, and go to bed.

45
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,780
Wow.

46
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,510
So that's why you always wake up so early.

47
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,409
Well, I'd get days off on Saturdays and Sundays.

48
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,880
My mom would wash me, dress me up properly...

49
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,780
get me ready...

50
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,740
and take me to the Keerati mansion.

51
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,790
My parents were very concerned about our manners when we visited your family.

52
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,250
It's a very important day for my family.

53
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,040
I had to be well-mannered and behaved properly.

54
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,190
I had to talk very politely.

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,150
Eventually, I've become the person I am today.

56
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,530
I did all this because I respected your grandfather.

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,890
And another reason is...

58
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,610
I had to make myself suitable for a young master...

59
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,860
My fiancé.

60
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,550
You did all that for me...

61
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,420
since you were that young?

62
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,610
My parents didn't want other people to gossip about us.

63
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,530
They didn't want others to think that my family is leeching off of your family.

64
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,590
But for me, I didn't care about what other people think.

65
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,070
I just wanted you to feel lucky to be engaged with me.

66
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,740
I wanted you to feel that you can rely on me when we live together.

67
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,970
Hia...

68
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,390
I don't want you to feel embarrassed

69
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,159
to have an ice delivery boy as your fiancé.

70
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,750
I've never once thought of it that way.

71
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,010
I know that you've never felt that way...

72
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,020
But I wanted to prove it to you.

73
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,900
And to other people.

74
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,460
That I'm ready to take care of you for the rest of my life.

75
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,170
Hia...

76
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,490
You make me feel...

77
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,750
special.

78
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,390
Can I sleep with you tonight?

79
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,090
What!

80
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,690
What did you just say?

81
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,210
You slept in my room last night.

82
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,490
So tonight I'll sleep in your room instead.

83
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,490
Let's take turns.

84
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,350
You can't...

85
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,460
Are you going to do what you did last night... every night?

86
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,590
Sure.

87
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,890
Because I like it.

88
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,210
I don't think that's a good idea.

89
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,780
If my mom finds out, she'll scold me.

90
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,840
You don't have to tell her. There's no need to tell aunt Kewarin.

91
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,580
And I won't tell my mom too.

92
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,950
Hia!

93
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,560
That's enough.

94
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,230
Stop it.

95
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,760
I'm tired now.

96
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,340
Hia, you keep teasing me.

97
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,850
I'm not teasing you.

98
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,630
I'm serious.

99
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,360
Serious about what?

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,400
Can I sleep with you tonight?

101
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,950
Why do you have such a strong desire?

102
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,980
You have to understand me.

103
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,800
I've been waiting for ages.

104
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,490
No...that's enough.

105
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,560
Stop it.

106
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,990
Hia.

107
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,170
Sorry.

108
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,190
It's okay.

109
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,930
♪ Maybe it's love ♪

110
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,110
♪ Maybe you’re my heart ♪

111
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,080

♪ Let me be yours ♪

115
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,600
Good morning, Nu-Kuea.

116
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,460
You're not going to say it back to me?

117
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,860
Good morning.

118
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,290
Good morning to you, too.

119
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,450
Did you have a sweet dream last night?

120
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,740
Did you dream about me?

121
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,070
I didn't dream about anything.

122
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,310
You can let go of me now.

123
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,420
I won't.

124
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,590
You have to kiss me on the cheek first.

125
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,430
No, I won't.

126
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,520
Come on, just a kiss on the cheek.

127
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,690
If you don't do it,

128
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,980
I won't make us breakfast.

129
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,370
I'll eat you instead.

130
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,580
Are you still sleepy or are you just being shy?

131
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,450
I'm just not used to this yet.

132
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,770
If you're not used to this yet, I'll do it every day then.

133
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,750
No way. I will never get used to this.

134
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,520
Why not?

135
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,130
I've known you my whole life,

136
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,220
but I'm still not used to waking up and seeing your face like this.

137
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,830
That's good.

138
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,540
So you won't get bored of me.

139
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,190
You won't get bored of me, right?

140
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,090
Right?

141
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,280
Hia!

142
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,180
That's enough.

143
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,790
Stop it.

144
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,720
You're calling me. Is something the matter, dad?

145
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,490
It's nothing. I just want to know how you're doing. Are you doing well?

146
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,690
Yes.

147
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,280
Is Hia Yi taking good care of you?

148
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,680
He's really good to me.

149
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,790
You two didn't fight or anything, right?

150
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,890
Why are you suddenly asking me that question?

151
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,490
It's nothing. It's just that you haven't come back home for a while now.

152
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,700
I have classes.

153
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,890
Do you want to come back home?

154
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,980
Your aunt and your siblings are asking about you. We're all worried about you.

155
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,760
Okay.

156
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,190
Let me think about it first.

157
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,130
Also, can you talk to Hia Yi about shophouses in Ramintra for me if you have a chance?

158
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,030
Can you ask him if he's going to use it for anything?

159
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,890
What are you planning to do?

160
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,290
They're still unused, so I thought he might have a plan to do something with them.

161
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,340
Oh. Okay.

162
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,990
I'll ask him for you later then.

163
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,640
Just ask him now. Is he home?

164
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,590
Yes, he's here. But he seems very busy.

165
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,870
I'll ask him for you when he's free.

166
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:45,640
You can just ask him. Why are you so afraid of him? He won't yell at you.

167
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,690
He's the one who should be afraid after what he did to you.

168
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,490
I still remember what he did.

169
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,430
You better tell him that!

170
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,569
Almost good.

171
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,089
Just almost?

172
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,810
It's not that bad.

173
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,900
You just need more practice.

174
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,590
I want to be able to do it.

175
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,920
You want to do it because you want to know how to cook,

176
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,380
or you just want to prove me wrong.

177
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,970
Well...

178
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,980
Hm?

179
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,510
Both.

180
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,490
You've been trying so hard for me.

181
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:55,280
I'm afraid you will be disappointed in me.

182
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,710
Your inability to cook

183
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,300
doesn't make me love you less.

184
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,520
You should focus on what you're good at.

185
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,320
About cooking,

186
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,220
you don't have to be bothered by it.

187
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
This isn't the reason why I want to be with you.

188
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,380
Even if you're a Michelin Star chef,

189
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,420
it won't make me love you any more or any less.

190
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,950
But if you really want to know how to cook, I'll teach you.

191
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,740
I really want to learn how to cook.

192
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,540
Nu-Kuea.

193
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,640
You've never disappointed me, not even once.

194
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,020
Thank you...

195
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,950
for growing up and becoming my source of happiness.

196
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,330
What's wrong?

197
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,460
Here.

198
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,490
A consolation prize for you.

199
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,620
You can use it for stirring the rice porridge.

200
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,750
You can also use it for hitting me if I make you sad.

201
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,780
I will never hit you.

202
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,330
I love you.

203
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,970
I've always loved you.

204
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,660
Since I was young until now.

205
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,150
I love you the most.

206
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,300
It's okay.

207
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,570
I love you the most too.

208
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,770
I don't want to cook.

209
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,080
I don't want to cut limes.

210
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,820
I don't want to slice salted eggs.

211
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,890
I don't even know what this giant spoon is called.

212
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,850
I just want to be close to you.

213
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,570
I want you to know that I'm trying.

214
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,400
Young master Kuea Keerati.

215
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,920
From this day forward, I, Kilen Wang,

216
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,270
President of Kilen brand, CEO of Pentagon, and your fiancé,

217
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:04,670
would like to announce that Mr. Kuea Keerati is the sole owner of this rice ladle.

218
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,520
You can use it to stir the rice porridge.

219
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,690
Or you can use it to hit me.

220
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:11,980
Oh, right.

221
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,220
This big spoon is called a ladle.

222
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,490
Hia, stop teasing me!

223
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,020
What kind of person would go for a run right after they've just finished eating?

224
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,190
We'll get heartburn right after.

225
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,520
I'm just worried that you won't have enough strength

226
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,960
after what we did last night.

227
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,420
Hia!

228
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,660
You're so cheeky!

229
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,120
We're just going out for a run. Why do you have to style your hair?

230
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,820
You have your own style when you come out to meet me.

231
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,840
It's not weird if I also have my style when I'm meeting you.

232
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,260
Okay.

233
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,400
Then you should style your hair when we're home too.

234
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,830
Nu-Kuea.

235
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,590
I'm just kidding.

236
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,140
In my eyes,

237
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,240
you're cute no matter what you do.

How much is one bottle?

251
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,940
It's 20 Baht, Handsome Brother.

252
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,460
Aww. You're such a sweet talker.

253
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,960
I'll pay.

254
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,780
Thank you so much, Handsome Uncle.

255
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,510
You can keep the change.

256
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,560
Here you go.

257
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,230
Thank you.

258
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,930
Are you bored?

259
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,180
You mean jogging?

260
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,550
Hia.

261
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,680
What are you thinking about?

262
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,170
About the future.

263
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,160
I know that there's an age difference between us.

264
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,950
Our lifestyles are also quite different.

265
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,560
I just think that you might be worried

266
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,120
about how we're living together like this.

267
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,410
How so?

268
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,920
People might have bad opinions about us when they see us together.

269
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,980
What about you?

270
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Do you think it's not good that we're together like this?

271
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,020
It's really good.

272
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,270
Why wouldn't it be good?

273
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,510
I think so too.

274
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,400
I understand that love is not just about the two of us.

275
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,730
There are many, many factors involved.

276
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,260
There are some things that I still don't know about.

277
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,110
There are also some things that you don't know about.

278
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,620
But we can learn about it together.

279
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,510
Since when are you all grown up.

280
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,120
I've grown up ages ago.

281
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
You just didn't realize it.

282
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,370
Well then, from now on...

283
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,560
I will do my best to learn

284
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,360
and grow together with you.

285
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,380
Okay?

286
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,710
I don't want to be engaged with you anymore.

287
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,410
I want to marry you...

288
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,120
today.

289
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,040
But we're living together like a married couple already.

290
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,710
If we can be married legally like in other countries,

291
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,200
you will be entitled to all of my rights and benefits.

292
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,950
We can always look after each other.

293
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,060
I don't understand.

294
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,790
What's the difference between same-sex and heterosexual couples?

295
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,110
But at least we're lucky

296
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:17,220
that our families embrace all differences.

297
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,280
It's not just luck.

298
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,100
But the two of us

299
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,740
belong to each other.

300
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,750
It doesn't matter what other people say.

301
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
Doesn't matter if the law will allow us to be legally married or not.

302
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,550
I will always love you.

303
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,890
I will always love you too.

304
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,130
Are you full already?

305
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,590
I haven't seen you eat anything.

306
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:52,340
You can put all the plates in the sink after you're done. I'll come back to clean them.

307
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,270
Goodbye.

308
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,170
Kon-Diao.

309
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,620
Kon-Diao.

310
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,100
I...

311
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,160
I...

312
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,180
Yes?

313
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,770
Let me give you a lift.

314
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,330
It's better if you don't.

315
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,710
I want to be alone for a while.

316
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,200
Here, Mr. Lian.

317
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,290
Hia.

318
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,750
I'm going to play football with my friends after class today. I'll come back home by myself after I finish.

319
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,910
(Automotive Engineering)

320
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,290
Foei can pick you up.

321
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,620
It's okay, Hia.

322
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,820
It's more convenient coming back by myself.

323
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,720
I'd better go now. I'm already late.

324
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,380
Hia, I'm off.

325
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,380
Foei.

326
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,850
Yes, sir.

327
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,370
Go wait for him at 6 p.m. in case he changes his mind.

328
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,320
Alright, sir.

329
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,090
The vehicle performance testing machine functions by shooting a beam of light onto the ground

330
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,120
which will be reflected back to the receiver.

331
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,600
Then, the computer will calculate the physics data for us.

332
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:36,470
It will give accurate results on the actual speed while the car is running, acceleration, distance, stopping time at different speeds, and fuel consumption rate.

333
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,220
Thank you.

334
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,040
Sadhu!

335
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,750
Does anyone want to give any comments?

336
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,310
No comments, sir.

337
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,460
Alright. That's it for today then.

338
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,790
Thank you.

339
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:55,980
Ton...

340
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,620
You always pull such pranks.

341
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,020
How come I didn't know...

342
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,960
that you two secretly prepared this presentation?

343
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,120
We didn't do it secretly. We just helped each other.

344
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,840
It's nothing much, so I didn't tell everyone.

345
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,660
Ohh...

346
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,950
We all have to thank Nuer. He's the one who realized that our design had an error.

347
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:25,970
Really?

348
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,650
What error?

349
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,850
It's nothing serious. It's just that the component wasn't strong enough to bear the force.

350
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,850
Ahh...

351
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,320
Why?

352
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:40,720
This is not just a minor problem.

353
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,210
It's like Syn and Nuer did the whole thing by themselves.

354
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,020
I can't accept this.

355
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,720
Kuea, Ton, and Jab.

356
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,020
We can't just let the two of them do all the work.

357
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,620
We have to help each other.

358
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,820
Yeah.

359
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,640
Of course, we'll all help.

360
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,020
Wait. Does anyone notice that Kuea seems to be too lively today?

361
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,730
Well?

362
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,340
What? There's nothing going on.

363
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,520
Kuea, what did you do?

364
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,030
What did I do? I didn't do anything!

365
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,210
Stop it.

366
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,520
You too!

367
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,580
Nuchy!

368
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,280
What?

369
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,570
So, what should we do next?

370
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,880
Our next step is to work on our car model.

371
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,460
Nuer and I made a few adjustments to Ton and Jab's exterior design.

372
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,630
You seem to be in a good mood today.

373
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,020
Your outfit is quite colorful.

374
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,200
Your Ducati is not here yet.

375
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,130
There's a small problem with customs.

376
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,240
I'll get it sorted as soon as possible.

377
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,580
It's okay. There's no hurry.

378
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,500
I already told my subordinates to deal with it.

379
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,720
Don't worry.

380
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,750
I'm not worried.

381
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,890
I trust you.

382
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,700
Is something wrong?

383
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
You seem to be more moody than usual.

384
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,620
It's Kon-Diao's father. He wants another building on Ramintra road.

385
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,640
He wants to open a car showroom.

386
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,670
Can't he do that?

387
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,420
You two are business partners, aren't you?

388
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,660
The last investment still hasn't gotten payback yet.

389
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,380
Plus, it's not even a good location.

390
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,600
I bet he just wants more money from me.

391
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,750
Have you talked to Kon-Diao about this?

392
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,680
Don't leave things unresolved.

393
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,120
Kon-Diao will misunderstand you if he hears it from someone else.

394
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,700
You'd better explain it to him by yourself as soon as possible.

395
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,500
Before it's too late.

396
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,500
What about you?

397
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,400
Have you talked to Nu-Kuea about everything yet?

398
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,460
Not yet.

399
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,670
But I'll talk to him soon.

400
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,040
I'm talking about the land and property that was transferred to your name.

401
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,520
It will be a big problem if Nu-Kuea knows about this later.

402
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,490
I know.

403
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm finding the right time to explain this to him.

404
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,000
A time when you guys aren't all over each other.

405
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,280
Does that even exist?

406
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,240
Here is the document for filing for bankruptcy and seizing the Keerati family's property.

407
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,590
Don't send it to the lawyer yet. I have to talk about this with Ms. Kewarin first.

408
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,830
You guys!

409
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,020
So, are we going to play football today?

410
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,480
Of course! How can we let those civil engineers think that we've chicken out?

411
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,030
Let's go!

412
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,350
Let me join your team this time.

413
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,830
Of course, Nuer. We're in the same team now, my friend.

414
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,750
Kuea, are you coming?

415
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,790
Sure. Let's go.

416
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,970
Nuchy, are you coming with us?

417
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,200
Oh, right.

418
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:12,130
We can let Nuchy be our goalie.

419
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,640
Right. Our team is missing a goalie.

420
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,890
Please spare me.

421
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,330
Maybe she wanted to be a forward.

422
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,110
Hey! Pass it properly!

423
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,040
The ball!

424
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,020
Go get it!

425
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,150
Come on! Get the ball. Don't be lazy!

426
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,170
Defenders! Come on!

427
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,880
Kuea! Go!

428
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,080
Stop spacing out.

429
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,720
Gosh! We missed it!

430
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
Kuea! Run!

431
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,630
Watch me. You guys, watch me!

432
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,950
Nuer, don't!

433
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,600
We were awesome today!

434
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,040
Even my shoes are clapping for us.

435
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,660
Syn, you're the real entertainment. It would've been a boring winning match if we didn't have you.

436
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,680
That's right! We're amazing.

437
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,760
We won this match even without a goalie!

438
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,680
That's because civil engineers are losers!

439
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,580
Where are they now?

440
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,580
Syn...

441
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,480
I'm sorry about what happened.

442
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,730
No need to be sorry. It's just an accident.

443
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,800
We won this match because Nuer defended the other team from reaching the goal.

444
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,680
You're the best.

445
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,280
That's right. My only shot couldn't have made us win.

446
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,270
But Kuea, you're the worst player in this match! You've been spacing out all day.

447
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,040
Why are you yelling at me?

448
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,330
I'm just telling you the truth.

449
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,380
Come on, give me your shirts.

450
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,470
Give it to me.

451
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,160
Wash it with care.

452
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,940
Thanks.

453
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,980
You can give your shirt to Ton. His family owns a laundry shop, he can wash it for you.

454
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,840
Damn! You're hot.

455
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,270
Kuea! Why are you not taking off your shirt?

456
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,390
Why are you acting strange?

457
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,550
What's wrong? Let me have a look.

458
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,100
Leave me alone!

459
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,300
Did you have a hot night with Mr. Fiancé?

460
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,820
Hia, don't. Stop it. I'm not ready yet, Hia.

461
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,730
Don't stop, Hia. Keep doing it. I can't take it anymore!

462
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,690
I was just teasing you a little, and you're already feeling thirsty, Mr. Kuea?

463
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:56,290
You're crazy!

464
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,090
Shut up. Stop teasing me.

465
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,760
You two made up already?

466
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,390
Well...

467
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,180
Well, let's just forget about it.

468
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,780
I have to go now. My car is here to pick me up.

469
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,040
Hey! Why are you in such a hurry?

470
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,080
Yeah! What's the rush?

471
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,890
See you guys tomorrow!

472
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,380
I know! You're in a hurry to go back to your Hia.

473
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,380
Hia, please stop. Hia, I can't wait any longer.

474
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Stop.

475
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,630
You're wearing your pants backwards.

476
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,580
Oh, shit!

477
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,900
Damn! I'm actually wearing my pants backwards.

478
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,020
I've been wearing them like this since the beginning of the match! No wonder those civil engineers were laughing at me.

479
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,920
That's why they were laughing!

480
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,160
I'm so cool!

481
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,200
Love is like a disease.

482
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,100
Here we go again.

483
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,910
It makes you blind.

484
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,270
I guess it's a long sermon this time.

485
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,390
You can no longer hear or see..

486
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,880
any obstacles right in front of you.

487
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,300
Love is like a wild cow that cannot be caged.

488
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,320
He will try to escape no matter how hard you tie him.

489
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,950
Okay. Alright.

490
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,450
Sadhu!

491
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,210
Can you make it shorter next time?

492
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,130
It's hard to understand.

493
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,160
You're done preaching, right? I'm leaving.

494
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,050
Let's go. Be careful on your way back.

495
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,680
Kuea!

496
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,130
What's wrong? I saw your text.

497
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,750
Calm down.

498
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,440
You'll find out later.

499
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,600
Hello, Hia.

500
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,770
If this is what you've planned, you can just tell me frankly.

501
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,830
Didn't you say that you wanted to be alone?

502
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,630
Kon-Diao.

503
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,090
I'm sorry.

504
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,850
From what I heard from you and Hia,

505
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,790
it made me worry.

506
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,280
So I...

507
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,990
I want you guys to open up and talk to each other.

508
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,080
If there's anything you want to say to him,

509
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,250
you should just tell him.

510
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,150
This is so childish.

511
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,670
Since having a younger boyfriend,

512
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,010
you're starting to act childish too.

513
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:22,380
Kuea.

514
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,980
I guess there're only downsides to dating a younger person.

515
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,350
Hey, calm down.

516
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,450
Please excuse me.

517
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,790
My childish behavior is probably not appropriate for a place like this.

518
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,680
Kon-Diao, what's wrong with you? Why are you so stubborn?

519
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,070
Yi.

520
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,750
I've always been this stubborn.

521
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,050
But you've never realized because you've never noticed or even cared to pay any attention to me.

522
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,770
Kon-Diao.

523
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,100
I'm just going to the toilet.

524
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,020
I'm sorry, Hia.

525
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,850
I didn't know that the situation would be this bad.

526
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,450
I'm so sorry, Hia Yi.

527
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,220
Well... I think we'd better leave first.

528
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,950
What are you going to do?

529
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,000
You guys can leave first.

530
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,450
He'll probably come back soon.

531
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,950
I think I have a way to deal with him.

532
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,250
But thanks, anyway.

533
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,080
I envy your relationship.

534
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,450
It's cute.

535
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,900
I can't beat that.

536
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,000
I hope you can resolve this.

537
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,200
I'm here to support you.

538
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,660
Let's go.

539
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,740
Okay.

540
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,050
Goodbye, Hia Yi.

541
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,300
So, our plan to let them talk failed.

542
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,860
Don't worry.

543
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,050
I'm pretty sure they'd talk after we left.

544
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,870
I hope so.

545
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,220
Right.

546
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,650
I will continue to work for a bit.

547
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,060
If you want to eat anything, you can order delivery.

548
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,110
Order it for me too.

549
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:20,980
Okay.

550
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,950
When it comes to ordering food,

551
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,450
I know I can trust you.

552
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,290
Thank you for dropping me off.

553
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,650
Who said I'm here to drop you off?

554
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,640
I'm not here to do that.

555
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,600
This is my home too.

556
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:31,810
Right.

557
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,850
Little doggie.

558
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,170
Whose dog is this?

559
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,750
How did you get here?

560
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,710
You're so cute! What's your name?

561
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,390
What's your name?

562
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,160
Hia, whose dog is this?

563
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,050
She's yours.

564
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,960
You brought her here?

565
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:52,700
Do you like her?

566
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,650
I really like her.

567
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,290
You're the cutest! You're mine!

568
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,070
Let's get to know each other some more.

569
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,550
Let's go, little doggie.

570
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:30,810
Nu-Kuea.

571
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,650
I have an urgent matter to deal with at Pentagon.

572
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,000
I'll come back as fast as I can.

573
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,330
Hia.

574
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,550
Um...

575
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,480
The delivery only accepts cash, but I don't have any with me.

576
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,580
There's cash in the drawer in my office.

577
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,680
Okay.

578
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,680
He's a workaholic.

579
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,080
Where is it?

580
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:33,020
Oh, it's here.

581
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,060
Land title deeds...

582
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,380
He's so rich.

583
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:22,350
The sole owner of the Keerati family's property is...

584
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,520
Kilen Wang.

585
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,640
So, you're not afraid of dogs anymore?

586
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,450
How come all the Keerati family's property belongs to Hia?

587
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:55,600
Nu-Kuea doesn't know yet. I think I will tell him soon.

588
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,410
Hia, do you really want to marry me?

589
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,380
I've told you many times already that I love you.

590
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,710
Is it still true when you say that you love me?
