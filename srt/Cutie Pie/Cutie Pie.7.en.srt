1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,760
Who's that guy? He looks like a mafia.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,640
Hello, Hia.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,100
Your friends are pretty funny, Kuea.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,680
I think I didn't take care of you well enough.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,360
Can I have...

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,000
your time?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Can you come back and stay with me?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,140
Didn't you say that you will give Pentagon to me?

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,860
I'll have to see how you behave first.

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,200
But...this is who I am.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,180
The more you know me, the more I seem to be naughty, right?

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,080
You can be naughty as much as you want.

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,580
I just want you to be comfortable with being yourself.

14
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,940
If two people love each other, they'll learn to adjust towards one another.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,480
I'll try my best.

16
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,410
Hia...

17
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,250
Wait.

18
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,170
I...

19
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,050
I can't take it anymore.

20
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,430
W-what are you doing?

21
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,730
I'm going to take you to the bedroom.

22
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,370
Why?

23
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,810
You just said you can't take it anymore.

24
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,890
I didn't mean it that way.

25
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,870
I'm taking you to my bedroom so you can take a rest.

26
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,070
I think...

27
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,910
We...

28
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,110
We should continue cooking.

29
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,750
You have such low vitality, Nu-Kuea.

30
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,470
- Nu-Kuea.
- Hia.

31
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,610
You go first.

32
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,210
I'm sorry about earlier.

33
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,010
It's okay.

34
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,050
I understand.

35
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,290
Let's eat.

36
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,850
I made that salted egg salad myself.

37
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,210
No.

38
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,770
I don't want to.

39
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,750
I don't want to eat.

40
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,710
Why not?

41
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,410
You still...

42
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,410
can't take it?

43
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,710
Hia!

44
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,930
Stop teasing me!

45
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,550
I won't talk to you anymore.

46
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,310
I can't help it.

47
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,730
I'll keep teasing you like this for a long time.

48
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,630
Who would let you do that?

49
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,430
Fine, I won't tease you anymore.

50
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,230
But you have to finish your breakfast.

51
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,430
After we finish eating, let's take a shower and get dressed.

52
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,710
I have something to show you.

53
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,990
S...show...

54
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,070
What are you going to show me?

55
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,710
If I tell you, it will spoil the surprise.

56
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,050
But I can give you my word...

57
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,750
If you don't like it,

58
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,470
I'll let you tease me back.

59
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,850
For real?

60
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,590
Have I ever lied to you?

61
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,909
Close your eyes first.

62
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,250
No!

63
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,090
I don't want to.

64
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,810
Why do I have to close my eyes?

65
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,690
Hia!

66
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,090
You're acting strange.

67
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,409
There's a door.

68
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,130
See?

69
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,110
I will run into the door.

70
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,170
Why are you closing my eyes?

71
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,490
Careful, there are stairs.

72
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,050
Stairs too?

73
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,750
Gosh! Hia!

74
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,950
Can't you just let me see normally?

75
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,350
Why do you have to close my eyes?

76
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,050
I like it when you make a fuss.

77
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,150
It's fun to tease you.

78
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,090
Hia!

79
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,330
Can I open my eyes now?

80
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,530
Whoa.

81
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,450
A sports car?!

82
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,750
Whose car is this?

83
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,070
Is this yours?

84
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,590
It's in my house, so it has to be mine.

85
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,730
Oh, right.

86
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,900
I'm sorry.

87
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,419
I'm too excited.

88
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,990
I never knew that you like sports cars too.

89
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,910
Can I try driving it?

90
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,830
Of course.

91
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,430
But not here.

92
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,130
Hm?

93
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,470
Get in.

94
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,330
Where are we going?

95
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,910
We'll go for a drive.

96
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,150
So are you coming?

97
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,150
Let's just go.

98
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,110
Yes, I'm coming.

99
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,370
Where are you taking us?

100
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,510
Well, where do you want to go?

101
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,700
I don't know where I want to go.

102
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,460
Usually, you're the one who decides.

103
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,420
That's why I'm asking you this time.

104
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,340
If you can choose,

105
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,060
where do you want to go?

106
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,100
Where do I want to go?

107
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,660
You should have told me first.

108
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,940
So I can dress up properly.

109
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
You already look good.

110
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
You're cute.

111
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,020
I don't know where I want to go.

112
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,500
Why don't you try surprising me?

113
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,940
I've always tried to surprise you.

114
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,980
But it's not that successful, right?

115
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,060
Then...

116
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,780
if you didn't have to try and surprise me...

117
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,260
impress me...

118
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,900
Where do you want to go?

119
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,060
What do you want to do?

120
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,100
And...

121
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,340
I want to know what kind of person you really are.

122
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,820
Why are you suddenly asking?

123
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,660
Because your house...

124
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,860
your car...

125
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
It's actually who you really are that surprises me.

126
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,300
I never know any of your likes and dislikes.

127
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
What about your true self that I've never seen?

128
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,820
Will it surprise me too?

129
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,260
I am who I am.

130
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,380
I don't know what you actually think of me.

131
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,700
This is also who I am.

132
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,260
If I don't reveal my true self to you,

133
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,940
you will never know...

134
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,860
how you actually feel about me.

135
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,420
Then...

136
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,940
Anywhere is fine.

137
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,780
We can go to a place you think I would want to go to.

138
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,100
You're awake?

139
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,980
What did you do last night?

140
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,980
I drank a bit with Lian.

141
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,860
A bit?

142
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,860
When you came back last night,

143
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,420
you kept talking nonsense.

144
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,700
You wouldn't go back to your place, too.

145
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,940
Drink some water first.

146
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,540
Thanks.

147
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,700
Are you stressed about work?

148
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,540
No.

149
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,900
If you need someone to talk to,

150
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,260
you can always talk to me.

151
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,820
It's nothing.

152
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,060
Or is it because...

153
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,180
Is it because I asked you to come back and stay with me?

154
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,380
It's nothing.

155
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,700
Hia.

156
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,460
You still haven't answered my question.

157
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,180
Stop overthinking things.

158
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,900
I'm going to go take a shower.

159
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,500
Wow!

160
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,180
This circuit is so big.

161
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,200
Hia Yi actually owns this place?

162
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,160
How come I never knew this before?

163
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,210
Was I overreacting?

164
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,000
Whatever!

165
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,480
This is where you think I want to come for a date?

166
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,860
This race suit looks good on you.

167
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,460
It's so hot!

168
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,520
If you feel hot,

169
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,240
you can go wait in the room.

170
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,720
No!

171
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,540
I don't want to sit there and do nothing.

172
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,260
Instead, I can drive for you.

173
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,580
It probably won't be that different from playing games, right?

174
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,600
Eh?

175
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,760
Hia!

176
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,820
You won't let me drive?

177
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,060
That was so much fun!

178
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,480
Ah!

179
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,280
You're scared, aren't you?

180
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,240
I'm not.

181
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,280
Let's go.

182
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,080
We're done here, right?

183
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,180
Can we go for another round?

184
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,820
I'm not satisfied with last round's time, it was too slow.

185
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,900
Where should we go next?

186
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,040
Wait. I'm falling for his tactics again.

187
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,360
Aren't I here to find out his true motives?

188
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,130
I keep forgetting this.

189
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,480
But... I guess it's okay.

190
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,880
I haven't felt this happy in a long time.

You like dancing?

Yeah.

201
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,580
I like to dance.

202
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,540
Let's dance together sometime.

203
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,960
Er...

204
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Then... I'd better wait for you outside.

205
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,360
Nu-Kuea!

206
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,580
Thank you.

207
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,000
Hia...

208
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,120
Do you like pink?

209
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,300
Fine.

210
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,840
Hia.

211
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,980
Have you liked supercars for a long time?

212
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah.

213
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
I don't have that much free time.

214
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,260
So normally I just leave it parked.

215
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,560
I see.

216
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,440
I also...

217
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,700
like it too.

218
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,240
You still eat messily, just like when we were kids.

219
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm not a kid anymore.

220
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,720
Is there anywhere else you want to go to?

221
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,960
Let's take turns.

222
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,260
I will surprise you this time.

223
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,860
Let's go.

224
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,880
You drive this time.

225
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,940
Okay.

226
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,160
Should I just ask him?

227
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,040
Maybe...

228
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,780
The reason that he doesn't come back home

229
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,500
is because I'm here?

230
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,800
Is he annoyed?

231
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,500
Is he bored?

232
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,300
Or maybe...

233
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,200
Kon-Diao.

234
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,820
Is the reason why your name is Kon-Diao

235
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,860
because you like talking to yourself?

236
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,760
It seems to be incurable.

237
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,980
No, it's not.

238
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,680
Everyone talks to themselves.

239
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,640
Kuea also talks to himself.

240
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,100
It's not weird to talk to yourself.

241
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,820
Then while you're talking to yourself...

242
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,060
Did you get an answer?

243
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,260
I think so.

244
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,920
But I'm not sure...

245
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,400
if it's correct or not.

246
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,280
It's not.

247
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,100
Everything that you speculated just now...

248
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
none of it was right.

249
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,980
You heard everything?

250
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,740
The reason I was drunk last night...

251
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,660
it's because...

252
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,420
I drank a little bit too much.

253
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,380
You have nothing to worry about.

254
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,420
Really?

255
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,100
Nong Diao.

256
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,060
Do you feel lonely living alone?

257
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,520
I'm sorry.

258
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,480

00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,060
Yeah.

264
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,820
Your fridge is full of things that are not edible.

265
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,560
So I brought you here to buy some food.

266
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,580
You don't like the food that I make?

267
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,400
That's not it.

268
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,000
I like it.

269
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,820
But there are many other things that I want to eat.

270
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,640
Also...

271
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,220
Since I moved in with you...

272
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,080
If we know what each other likes,

273
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,360
we'll get to know each other better, right?

Where were you?

290
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,240
I went to your circuit.

291
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,100
Why did you go there?

292
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,500
Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,100
I took Nu-Kuea to drive around.

294
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,120
Nu-Kuea finally told you his secrets?

295
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
Not yet.

296
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,740
I pretend not to know.

297
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,940
Damn.

298
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,500
Are you going to meet Top and others at Pentagon today?

299
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,260
Yeah.

300
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm taking Nu-Kuea with me.

301
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,340
What?

302
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,160
Are you serious?

303
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes.

304
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
I will try to make him open up to me.

305
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,260
What?

306
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,000
Damn you, Lian.

307
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,780
You hung up on me!

308
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,260
Why the hell is he so crazy in love now?

309
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,540
Hia.

310
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,140
Which one is holy basil, and which is sweet basil?

311
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,040
None of them.

312
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,080
Eh?

313
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,080
I'll show you.

314
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,740
What about--

315
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,940
Hey, Syn.

316
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,140
What are you doing here?

317
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,180
It's boring to always work in the lab.

318
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,880
I need a change of scenery.

319
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,280
So...

320
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,180
Are you here alone?

321
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,860
Why didn't you wait for everyone to do it together?

322
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,780
I want to make some progress on this.

323
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,800
And I'm free today.

324
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,980
What about you?

325
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,920
What are you doing here?

326
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,040
I...

327
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,580
I'm here to get some stuff.

328
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,620
I forgot it here.

329
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,940
Why didn't you wait until tomorrow to come get it?

330
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,620
You really like to talk back, don't you?

331
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,420
It's pretty cool.

332
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,540
You're the one who did it.

333
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,300
I only helped with the programming.

334
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,060
You guys did most of it.

335
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,020
Well...

336
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,300
We already divided the work.

337
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,520
How come you're doing it by yourself?

338
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,900
Because I take this project very seriously.

339
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,000
Actually, I assigned the work like that on that day

340
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,170
because I wanted to tease you.

341
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,170
I don't want you to be close to Kuea.

342
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,620
I know.

343
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,280
Now that you're here, I might as well say this.

344
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,980
I want you

345
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,500
to forgive me.

346
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,630
It's not that big of a deal.

347
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,820
I'm not angry at you.

348
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,340
But can I ask you something?

349
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,020
Why are you so possessive of Kuea?

350
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:49,940
Is it because...

351
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,060
you like him?

352
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,940
I don't.

353
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,540
I don't like Kuea that way.

354
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,140
I like him

355
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,620
as a friend.

356
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,340
Well...

357
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,000
I don't want my friend to commit a sin.

358
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,760
Commit a sin?

359
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:09,840
Yes.

360
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,620
Kuea already has a fiancé.

361
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,360
I don't want Kuea

362
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,540
or any of my friends to do something wrong.

363
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,820
You are my friend too.

364
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,990
I don't want you to commit any misconduct against the precepts.

365
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,180
You're so...

366
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,320
cute.

367
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,100
I've never met anyone like you before.

368
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,100
Nu-Kuea.

369
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,900
I'm going to meet my friends at Pentagon tonight.

370
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,400
Do you want to come with me?

371
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,360
Yes, I'd love to.

372
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,220
I want to go.

373
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,640
Are you that happy?

374
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,920
Today is full of surprises, isn't it?

375
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,940
You wouldn't even let me go yesterday.

376
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
You're well-behaved today.

377
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,120
Our date at the supermarket was also really nice.

378
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,460
Actually, you want me to teach you how to cook, right?

379
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,880
I don't!

380
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,480
I just wanted some snacks.

381
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,980
He's unusually nice... he must be plotting something.

382
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,900
I must not fall for it.

383
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,350
Just a second, Hia.

384
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,110
All my friends are already here.

385
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,910
Are you okay?

386
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,450
I'm nervous.

387
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,990
I've never been to Pentagon before.

388
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,120
Do you want to come another day instead?

389
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,500
Does he have another secret plan behind this?

390
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,850
Are you scared?

391
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,820
Or you think that I'm secretly plotting something?

392
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,950
No.

393
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm ready.

394
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:39,870
I can't wait to find out

395
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,090
what's inside Pentagon.

396
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,820
I want to know why you've never let me come here before.

397
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,150
Are you ready, Nu-Kuea?

398
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,130
Yes.

399
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,430
Hey, Lian!

400
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,030
Hello.

401
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,410
You're...

402
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,630
Mr. Kuea, right?

403
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:02,750
Hello.

404
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,250
Hello.

405
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,890
Wow, Lian.

406
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,790
I see you've decided to bring your fiancé with you.

407
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,070
I've only heard his name before.

408
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,510
I've never met him until now.

409
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,590
He's even more cute in person.

410
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,090
So that's why

411
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,550
Lian never introduced him to us before.

412
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,490
You're possessive, aren't you?

413
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,310
Aww.

414
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,310
Look at these two.

415
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,290
Ever since they became official,

416
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,130
they've been inseparable.

417
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,850
Wait.

418
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,710
Answer my question first, bro.

419
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,510
Why did you suddenly bring him here with you?

420
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,550
He was too young.

421
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,870
So he's not young today?

422
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:56,250
Hm.

423
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,170
It's okay if he comes with me.

424
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,630
So...

425
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,510
You'll only let him come here

426
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,590
if he comes with you?

427
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,050
I don't want...

428
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,950
I don't want him to meet bad people.

429
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,990
'Bad people'... are you referring to us?

430
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,990
Yeah! He means you!

431
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,250
You guys too!

432
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:19,950
Me too?

433
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,550
Nu-Kuea just turned 20 years old.

434
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,970
That's why he was just allowed to come here.

435
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,370
What about you, Yi?

436
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,610
I heard that...

437
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,930
You also have someone.

438
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,870
Why don't you introduce him to us too?

439
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,650
Keep your nose out of my business.

440
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,090
There.

441
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,870
He's the real MVP of the day.

442
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,310
Young master Kuea.

443
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,630
That's right.

444
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,930
I finally get to meet him. I have so many questions to ask.

445
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,330
What is it with you guys and the engagement?

446
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,010
So you guys are engaged and will get married?

447
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,050
We're just like any other couple.

448
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,190
Like normal couples do.

449
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,310
It's not normal.

450
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,650
A man and a man.

451
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,450
It's not possible.

452
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,370
You have such an outdated opinion.

453
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,110
Because there are people like you,

454
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,010
our country can never move forward.

455
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,690
You can't blame me for that.

456
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,650
The law doesn't even support this.

457
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,190
What's the point of doing all this?

458
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,690
I think love is enough in this case.

459
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,370
But I think just love

460
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,030
is not enough.

461
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:30,450
If we don't have the rights or a law that supports us.

462
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,910
Anyway, I will get married no matter what.

463
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:37,870
Do you guys have a problem with that?

464
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,270
Oh shit.

465
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,810
Damn, man.

466
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,810
Why is my friend so cool?

467
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,730
I'll get wine for Nu-Kuea.

468
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,730
Look after him for me.

469
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,150
And don't spout any nonsense to him.

470
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,970
Nu-Kuea.

471
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,870
If they talk shit about me,

472
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,310
don't listen to them.

473
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:12,890
Okay.

474
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,830
Nu-Kuea.

475
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,210
If you want to know anything about Lian,

476
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,410
you can ask us.

477
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,370
Ask me anything and I will answer.

478
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:25,990
Yeah.

479
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,250
That's right. Ask us!

480
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,870
I know everything.

481
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:30,390
You probably have so many questions.

482
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:32,490
Just ask! We'll tell you everything we know.

483
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:47,130
Why did you follow me?

484
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,170
I don't think you'd want me to talk about this in front of him.

485
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,390
The Ducati that you asked my dealer to handle for you,

486
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,490
we'll get it soon.

487
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,110
Okay.

488
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,330
Since when are you interested in superbikes?

489
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,770
Why can't I be interested?

490
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,230
Did you buy it for Nu-Kuea?

491
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,890
Why didn't you bring Kon-Diao with you?

492
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,310
Is it okay to leave him alone at home?

493
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,770
You asshole.

494
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,830
You've never let Kon-Diao and Nu-Kuea come here before.

495
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,130
I already told you.

496
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,470
That I will bring Nu-Kuea with me today.

497
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,570
Is it really okay to bring him here?

498
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,690
What are you thinking?

499
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,630
I think...

500
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,010
From now on, there will be no more secrets between Nu-Kuea and me.

501
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:54,170
If I want him to tell me everything,

502
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,210
I must let him into my world first.

503
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:05,570
Are you sure?

504
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:08,470
You'll really tell him your secret?

505
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,190
Are you serious?

506
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,070
Yeah!

507
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:24,970
Hia was like that before?

508
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,150
He was ten times worse than that!

509
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,170
He was beyond that. I'm serious!

510
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,830
Whoa.

511
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,350
Have you seen him dance before?

512
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,430
What are you guys talking about?

513
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,070
Don't worry.

514
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,370
We're not talking about you.

515
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,990
It's nothing, Hia.

516
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:54,070
Top was telling me about his university life.

517
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,870
When he was the cheerleader.

518
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,830
Also...

519
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,910
About someone...

520
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,070
who said that he didn't want to be a cheerleader.

521
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,250
But in the end, he was the one who led the whole thing.

522
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,590
I really can't imagine you being a cheerleader.

523
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,710
Your dancing is actually a bit...

524
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,870
off beat.

525
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,190
You can check it out on my Facebook.

526
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,690
I have lots of photos and videos.

527
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:30,670
Win!

528
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,390
That's enough.

529
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,170
Whoa.

530
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,390
He's the real MVP.

531
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,490
The owner of Pentagon is pouring wine for him.

532
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,170
Who wouldn't fall for that?

533
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,390
Wow.

534
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,770
He personally selected the wine for him.

535
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:52,970
Even poured the wine for him.

536
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,710
The only thing left is you feeding him.

537
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,470
Yi!

538
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:58,810
It's true!

539
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,810
Yeah.

540
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,390
You're not going to feed him?

541
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,610
You should!

542
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,490
Hey!

543
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:10,550
Let's play a game.

544
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:12,430
Have you ever played "never have I ever"?

545
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:13,970
- Yes.
- Ah, that game.

546
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:14,690
I played it before.

547
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,650
Let me start then.

548
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,250
I've never...

549
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,110
been to Africa.

550
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,990
Top!

551
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:23,690
Are you teasing me?

552
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,690
You couldn't remember our first date?

553
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:29,150
Come on! Why are you guys fighting?

554
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,650
We're here to have fun!

555
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,650
So, all of you've been to Africa before.

556
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,950
My turn to ask then.

557
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,490
Hey!

558
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,070
It's my turn.

559
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,810
You're drunk already, Black.

560
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,750
I'm not drunk.

561
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,510
I'm just not the same.

562
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,310
I've never...

563
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,430
owned a superbike.

564
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,220
Superbike...

565
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,710
Do you own one?

566
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,890
Why do you seem indecisive?

567
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,710
I can't remember.

568
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,990
I have too many cars.

569
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,930
Superbike...

570
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,190
Ducati...

571
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,630
There's no way you'd forget if you have one of those.

572
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,930
Oh!

573
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:20,730
Young master Kuea has a superbike?

574
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,090
Well...

575
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,090
I'm not sure too.

576
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,610
But I think I have one at home.

577
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,010
Even he's brave enough to admit it.

578
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,670
Oho!

579
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:39,830
He couldn't accept defeat.

580
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,070
I don't have one yet.

581
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,430
But I drank because I might get one in the future.

582
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:47,830
Respect, man.

583
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,430
Your turn.

584
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:51,970
I've...

585
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,190
never kissed a stranger.

586
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:05,890
Fine, I'll drink.

587
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,570
What!

588
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,170
Game over?

589
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,130
But...

590
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:22,550
But you only kiss a stranger when you're drunk.

591
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,010
Also, only when you're single.

592
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,570
Nu-Kuea.

593
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:31,870
Are you okay?

594
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,250
Or you didn't hear the question?

595
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,730
How about this.

596
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,770
Everyone, turn your face another way first.

597
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,390
And let Lian say it again.

598
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,050
I've never kissed a stranger.

599
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,650
It's your turn, Nu-Kuea.

600
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,330
I've never...

601
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,270
Um...

602
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,210
I can't think of a question.

603
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,910
You can't think of one?

604
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,450
Or are you afraid to ask?

605
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,030
Uh...

606
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,070
I seriously don't know what to ask.

607
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,010
Whatever. Let's stop playing this game.

608
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,120
Let's be straightforward and just ask.

609
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,790
Can I ask a question? I really want to know.

610
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:53,810
You're just 20 years old.

611
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,670
Don't you want to...

612
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,730
try being in a relationship with someone else?

613
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,530
You won't get any answer for that.

614
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,150
Right now.

615
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,130
Nu-Kuea really wants to call off our engagement.

616
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:13,750
Right?

617
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:19,870
How come?

618
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,830
Is my friend not good enough?

619
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,410
He doesn't like being forced.

620
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:31,610
That's not the reason.

621
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:35,290
Then what's the reason?

622
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,010
You don't like me?

623
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,890
I don't.

624
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:45,420
Then what can I do to make you like me?

625
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:52,950
You have to love me first.

626
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,320
I think you're misunderstanding something.

627
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:06,310
I've never not loved you.

628
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,520

Nu-Kuea who is sleeping by my side,

646
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,490
are you happy right now?

647
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,370
He's not lying to me, right?

648
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,630
Hey! You guys are on good terms now. You should be happy.

649
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,110
He's suddenly so nice to me.

650
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:36,390
He tells me that he loves me.

651
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:37,670
It's too good to be true.

652
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,170
What if everything is a lie.

653
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:41,170
And if I trust him.

654
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,710
Should I be scared?

655
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:46,910
I've changed the name on all the land title deeds and other property deeds of the Keerati family

656
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:48,410
into my name.
