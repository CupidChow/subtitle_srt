1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,260
Why did you have to sell everything that belonged to our family to Hia?

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,160
Why didn't you tell me?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,720
My intention was to tell you...

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,040
after everything is settled.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,820
Mom, do you trust Hia?

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,050
This Sunday is my dad's birthday. Don't forget, okay?

7
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,720
From now on, every business that belongs to me will be Lian's.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,770
I hope that my son will have a good life.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,090
I wish you all the success in everything that you do.

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,570
Will you marry me?

11
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,100
It's better if we don't.

12
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,890
You don't really love me.

13
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,170
You don't even know the real me yet.

14
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,120
I am not who you think I am.

15
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,150
And currently...

16
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,910
I don't know...

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,009
if I know you well enough or not.

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,430
Nu-Kuea, listen to me.

19
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,850
I've always listened to you.

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,240
That's why I'm the last one to know about anything.

21
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,670
About my grandpa and the Keerati's property.

22
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,170
But we've already cleared things up, didn't we?

23
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,990
It's just you who thinks it's resolved.

24
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,880
I never said I was fine with it.

25
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,590
But everything I did,

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,170
I did it for you.

27
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,090
Do you trust me?

28
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,190
Trust you?

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,410
What about you?

30
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,500
Do you really trust me?

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,829
The Nu-Kuea that you say you love...

32
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,910
How well do you actually know him?

33
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,460
No matter who you really are,

34
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,990
I still love you.

35
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,520
I've always loved you.

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,460
Enough, Hia.

37
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,210
Please don't make me feel...

38
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,870
any worse about myself than I already do.

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,350
I don't think our relationship will last.

40
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,540
Please excuse me...

41
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,630
Before I make a fool of myself more than I already did.

42
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,220
I'm so sorry.

43
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,680
Kuea, wait!

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,170
Lian, stop!

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,040
Kon-Diao and I will go after Nu-Kuea.

46
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,370
Lian! Get a hold of yourself!

47
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,970
This is your dad's birthday event!

48
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,260
I'll call you.

49
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,390
Sorry.

50
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,390
Sorry.

51
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,840
Kuea, wait for me!

52
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,870
Kuea!

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,880
Kuea!

54
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,610
Hia, Kuea's gone. What should we do?

55
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,260
You can go, my son.

56
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,460
Don't worry about my event.

57
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,570
I'll take care of this.

58
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,190
Alright.

59
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,790
Lian, listen to me carefully.

60
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,520
Married life is not about solving problems alone.

61
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,170
If two people truly love each other,

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,170
they must be ready to share their suffering and happiness together.

63
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,790
And most importantly,

64
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,180
you have to trust and support each other.

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,409
This is what married life is.

66
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,470
Do you understand, my son?

67
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,370
Yes.

68
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,970
Now go.

69
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,820
Go and show him your sincerity.

70
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,070
So that Nu-Kuea will not doubt your words.

71
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,110
Go, my son.

72
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,830
Pick up the phone, Kuea!

73
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,120
He won't pick up the phone.

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,220
What have I done?

75
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,390
Hello, Kuea.

76
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,940
Where are you?

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you on the way to the dragon's lair?

78
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
Don't worry about me.

79
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,560
I'm okay.

80
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,250
I just want to be alone right now.

81
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,260
I'm on my way to see you. Wait for me.

82
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,470
You don't have to come.

83
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,110
I'm okay.

84
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,170
I just want to be alone.

85
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,000
But...

86
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,670
Please, I'm begging you.

87
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,190
Please understand me.

88
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,280
I'm really okay. Don't worry.

89
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,540
Okay...

90
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,750
But you know, right?

91
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,390
That if you don't have anyone,

92
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,340
I will still be here for you.

93
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,450
I know.

94
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,430
Thank you.

95
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,820
Thank you so much.

96
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,289
Hia.

97
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,919
Let's go back.

98
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,530
Kuea said he's okay.

99
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,830
He just needs some time to be alone.

100
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,590
Are you sure?

101
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes.

102
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,770
I trust him.

103
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,310
Hello, Lian.

104
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,870
Kuea is at the dragon's lair.

105
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,540
You know where that is, right?

106
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,820
Thank you.

107
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,410
It's okay. I'll get off here.

108
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,030
Mr. Lian!

109
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,280
Mr. Lian!

110
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,080
Mr. Lian!

119
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,870
Hia.

120
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,260
How did you come inside?

121
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,650
It's my ID number, right?

122
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,400
What about the event?

123
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,860
It's alright.

124
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm so sorry.

125
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,630
I shouldn't have ruined your dad's birthday.

126
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,720
You don't have to say sorry.

127
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,710
It's okay.

128
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,950
You didn't do anything wrong.

129
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,600
But...

130
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,810
I'm the one

131
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,710
who should apologize.

132
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,760
I've probably indulged myself too much.

133
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,740
I'm sorry.

134
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,650
You didn't do anything wrong.

135
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,010
Do you want to take a shower?

136
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,300
Hia.

137
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,260
Why did you follow me here?

138
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,310
You're not mad at me?

139
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm not mad at you.

140
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,360
I forgive you for everything.

141
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,510
Everything?

142
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,260
What do you mean?

143
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,950
What about you?

144
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,630
When you said that I don't know the real you.

145
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,190
What do you mean by that?

146
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,010
I mean...

147
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,630
Do you mean this house?

148
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,680
And all of these things you own?

149
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,610
Why would I not know?

150
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,310
Qilin, your superbike.

151
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,910
Automotive engineering.

152
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,540
Kirin.

153
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,510
And the Youtube channel that you created.

154
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,710
You're also interested in these kinds of things?

155
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,090
I'm interested because it's you.

156
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,730
Then aren't you mad at me that I lied to you?

157
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,950
I'm not mad.

158
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,330
But I'm sad.

159
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,610
I'm sad that you didn't trust me.

160
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,090
I was scared.

161
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,810
I was scared that if I'm not the young master Kuea that everyone thinks I am,

162
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,710
you would no longer want to marry me.

163
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,730
That's why you said that today?

164
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,350
I thought that...

165
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,070
I would stop doing all this

166
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,860
after I married you.

167
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,070
But...

168
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,440
Why would you stop being yourself?

169
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,970
I know more about you than you think.

170
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,610
You like to eat BBQ buffet

171
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,420
more than the expensive food I'd buy for you on our dates.

172
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,100
You got cut by a knife when you were young.

173
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,490
That's why you're afraid of cooking.

174
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,310
And when you're mad,

175
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,050
you like to make this kind of face.

176
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,550
Hia!

177
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,230
Can you do it again?

178
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,280
Do it again.

179
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,030
That's enough.

180
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,290
But when you say you love me,

181
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,610
you never avoided looking into my eyes.

182
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,660
That's how I know...

183
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,380
that you really love me. That it's not a lie.

184
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,290
You don't have to try to be someone else for me.

185
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,150
I also want to apologize

186
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,420
for not telling you about this.

187
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,060
I love you in every way.

188
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,450
Every version of you.

189
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,099
What about...

190
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,349
Annabelle?

191
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,910
I love that doll

192
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,000
the most.

193
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,410
Are you worried about Kuea?

194
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,340
I think they've reconciled now since they've gone quiet.

195
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,910
I feel guilty.

196
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,940
About what?

197
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,880
I knew everything.

198
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,120
I knew what Kuea was hiding from Hia Lian.

199
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,940
And I also know that Hia Lian knows the truth. But I...

200
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,470
It was too late when I decided to tell Kuea.

201
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,450
That's why all of this happened.

202
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,790
Maybe...

203
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,410
The reason that Kuea wouldn't marry Hia Lian

204
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,290
is because of what I told him earlier.

205
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,280
Come on.

206
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,110
Stop blaming yourself.

207
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,150
It's their problem.

208
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,950
They have to find a way to solve it by themselves.

209
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,920
Then what about us?

210
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,140
When are you going to tell me?

211
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,340
The reason that you want me to stay here...

212
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,730
is because you feel guilty.

213
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,180
I know what my dad is trying to do.

214
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,010
What brings you here?

215
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,260
It's nothing much.

216
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,210
I was just passing by so I thought I should come to visit you.

217
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,510
My secretary told me that you've been waiting for me for the whole day.

218
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,410
Come on, I'm just an old man.

219
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,370
I don't have anything to do, and I don't know anywhere else to be.

220
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,080
You don't go to the showroom these days?

221
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,610
Not anymore. I let my subordinates take care of it.

222
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,780
I'm getting bored of it.

223
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,650
That location is not good. None of the businesses are doing well in that area.

224
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,030
How do you want me to help, then?

225
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,490
Well...

226
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,560
I think the shophouse on Ramintra road is a good spot.

227
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,710
I don't think so.

228
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,010
Those shophouses are in the alley.

229
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,840
They're not even near the main road.

230
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,110
Why don't we build a condominium then?

231
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,330
Right now, the Skytrain is currently undergoing expansion.

232
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,950
I think building a condominium is a good idea.

233
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:51,240
I wonder what Kon-Diao will think of you if he knows that you refused to help me...

234
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,770
He's such a poor boy.

235
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,970
He trusts someone who made him lose his memory.

236
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,560
I told him many times to come back and stay with me.

237
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,710
But he wouldn't.

238
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,010
I don't know how long he will be this stubborn.

239
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,330
You can remember now?

240
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,710
I couldn't remember at first.

241
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,710
But after my dad told me.

242
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,210
I could recall it now.

243
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,780
My dad is using this as a tool to negotiate with you.

244
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,410
Are you angry at me after remembering what happened?

245
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,320
I'm not angry at you.

246
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,920
It was an accident.

247
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,990
I should be thanking you instead...

248
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,980
for always taking care of me.

249
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,310
You're probably doing all that because you felt guilty.

250
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,410
At first, it was just guilt.

251
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,310
I felt guilty.

252
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,110
That accident caused you to lose your memory.

253
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,010
But right now,

254
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,760
I want to take care of you.

255
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,560
I want you close to me.

256
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,720
I have feelings for you.

257
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,560
I told my dad

258
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,810
that I don't care.

259
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,710
I told him to stop using what happened in the past to threaten you.

260
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,480
Because everything you've done for me is more than I can repay you.

261
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,930
Come on.

262
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,690
I'm not doing it because I want something in return.

263
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,050
But my father will keep demanding more things from you.

264
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,730
Let him do that.

265
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,840
I was trying to be considerate

266
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,730
because he's your dad.

267
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,330
But since you already know everything,

268
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,620
if he dares to mess with the tiger, he must be ready to be mauled.

269
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,730
I'm starting to worry about my dad now.

270
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,100
I won't use violence.

271
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,310
I just want him to know that...

272
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,210
he shouldn't dare to mess with me again.

273
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,210
What are you laughing at?

274
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,060
You're so fierce.

275
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,790
I promise I won't keep any secrets from you.

276
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,110
I'm glad I didn't give up.

277
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,370
Damn you, Nong!

278
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,090
Oh, no. I forgot that you might eat him.

279
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,490
Nong, let's run away from him.

280
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,830
Aren't we already clear about this?

281
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,530
I don't eat dogs!

282
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,650
But you eat frogs, buffalos, and crocodiles!

283
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,400
I still can't trust you.

284
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,140
Let's go.

285
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,210
I will eat a person tonight.

286
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,610
I should be satisfied with just you.

287
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,930
No! Hia! Don't!

288
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,680
Hia.

289
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,660
Where is he?

290
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,070
Shit!

291
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,060
It's Monday!

292
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,060
Hia!

293
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,510
I'm off to university.

294
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,110
I made breakfast for you.

295
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:22,600
Won't you eat first?

296
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,720
It's okay, Hia. I don't want to be late for class.

297
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,950
Diao, when did you get here?

298
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,930
I got here since you were in the bathroom.

299
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,570
I was worried, so I came to check on you.

300
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,310
But from what I see...

301
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,970
There's nothing to worry about.

302
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,630
Eh! Hurry up, we're going to be late!

303
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,870
You should at least eat something.

304
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,620
Thank you, Hia.

305
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,970
Do you want one too?

306
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,350
It's okay. I've already eaten.

307
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,550
Hia, please lock the door for me before you leave.

308
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,190
Also...

309
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,000
See you at home.

310
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,920
Diao, let's go to class!

311
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,870
Come on! Quick!

312
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,360
I love you so much!

313
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,610
I know.

314
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,090
Thank you for everything.

315
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
Right now, I'm so happy!

316
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,270
Me too.

317
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,920
What about you?

318
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,010
Why?

319
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,520
You haven't told me about you and Hia Yi.

320
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,260
I'll tell you tonight.

321
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,230
Okay?

322
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,480
Tonight.

323
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,840
I'll go then.

324
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,970
Pay attention in class, alright?

325
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,370
Me too.

326
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,830
I'm off.

327
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Bye.

328
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,010
Bye. See you.

329
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,450
My friend is finally happy.

330
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,770
When is Kuea coming? He's so late.

331
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,290
What should we eat for dinner?

332
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,170
What about BBQ at the restaurant we usually go to?

333
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,610
Good. It has a lot of MSG.

334
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,970
I'm losing a lot of hair.

335
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,170
You're right.

336
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,480
But the food is too good.

337
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,970
I'm sorry, guys. I'm here now.

338
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,440
Aww, you seem so happy. Did Mr. Fiancé give you lots of tips for singing on stage?

339
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,610
Ton!

340
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,470
No, I mean... He might be kind enough to buy you a lot of things. Nothing more than that.

341
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,760
I know.

342
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,850
Know what?

343
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,070
I know that Hia was there that night.

344
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,640
That's good.

345
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,390
You can be yourself with your fiancé now, right?

346
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,000
Syn.

347
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,270
How did you know that I've got that issue?

348
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,090
Are you a psychic?

349
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,270
The observer knows and gains wisdom.

350
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,440
Sadhu!

351
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,150
So, these two...

352
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,100
Are they together?

353
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,150
Syn has breached his vow.

354
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,370
Syn is no longer himself.

355
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,990
I suddenly feel thirsty.

356
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,870
Cheers!

357
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,230
To our success.

358
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,270
Oh, guys.

359
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,750
After the prototype car is finished, what do we need to do next?

360
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,070
We have final exams.

361
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,170
What will it be like in the fourth year?

362
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,670
Well... I guess we have to work on our thesis independently.

363
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,950
Why do we have to work independently?

364
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,690
Can't we all stick together forever?

365
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:52,030
And after we graduate, we can open an auto repair shop. So we can always be together.

366
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,290
Count me out.

367
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,020
Why? You don't want to be my best friend anymore?

368
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,570
Haven't you heard that it never ends well when friends do business together?

369
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,050
But that's not always the case.

370
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,270
Hia Lian and Hia Yi also do business together.

371
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,770
Hia Yi is Kon-Diao's boyfriend.

372
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,080
How about you?

373
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,020
Are you getting married right after graduation?

374
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,210
Actually,

375
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,230
he asked me to marry him yesterday.

376
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,380
But I rejected his proposal.

377
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,390
Eh?

378
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,250
Why?

379
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,770
I was shocked at that time.

380
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,560
But we already talked it through.

381
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,730
So, I'm thinking

382
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,330
I will be the one who proposes instead.

383
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,910
Whoa.

384
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,870
Seriously?

385
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,310
What if he rejects you back?

386
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,220
I will keep asking him.

387
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,010
I've decided to marry only him in this life.

388
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,010
Wow.

389
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:56,070
How about this? We buy an enormous cake and put it in front of Hia's house.

390
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:02,170
Kuea will hide in that cake, and when Hia comes out, you can surprise him!

391
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,370
Ton! That's too silly!

392
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,460
I think Kuea should fly a parachute with a big sign saying 'will you marry me?'

393
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,720
That's great! He should fly right into Hia's house.

394
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,280
Too spicy!

395
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,870
'My Fiancé' is always interrupting us.

396
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,260
Yes, Hia.

397
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:31,990
Of course, Hia.

398
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,750
See you at home.

399
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,070
So?

400
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,560
So?

401
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,870
Guys, I gotta go first.

402
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,840
That's what I thought.

403
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,100
I'm off.

404
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
We're running out of pork.

405
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,390
It's burnt already.

406
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,420
You want wood ear mushrooms?

407
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,980
Syn.

408
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,140
Where there is love, there is also pain.

409
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
Kuea!

410
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,360
Sadhu!

411
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:36,670
You're home?

412
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,150
Where are you?

413
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,570
Come meet me at the backyard.

414
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,020
Backyard?

415
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,110
Okay. I'll be right there.

416
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,070
Nu-Kuea will arrive here soon.

417
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,170
Oh, okay.

418
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,770
Don't be too dramatic.

419
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,270
Don't worry.

420
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,460
Nu-Kuea, surprise!

421
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,870
A present from Hia Lian! He bought it from my boss.

422
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,050
Ducati!

423
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,370
Aren't you excited?

424
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,480
Please appreciate the present.

425
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,770
Three. Two. One.

426
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,170
It won't come out.

427
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,970
Is this a surprise for me?

428
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,170
Do you like it?

429
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Qilin number two.

430
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:15,170
At first, I would give it to you as a gift after you accepted my marriage proposal.

431
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,690
Then you better keep it first.

432
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,020
You don't like it?

433
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,670
I'll tell you when the time comes.

434
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,280
I feel bad for Hia Lian.

435
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,740
Why do you have to feel bad for him?

436
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,990
I guess Nu-Kuea is getting back at Lian now.

437
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,370
It serves him right.

438
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,300
Are they going to fight again?

439
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,990
You know your best friend well.

440
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,940
Since he's making a face like this,

441
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,570
it probably means that he has a plan.

442
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,440
We don't have any third wheeler today.

443
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,020
It's not just you who's a tiger.

444
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,770
I've been practicing martial arts for quite a while now.

445
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,880
So?

446
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,480
Hia.

447
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,970
What are you looking at?

448
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,670
You've never seen people flirting with each other?

449
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,410
Hia.

450
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,170
I'm not afraid of you.

451
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,650
Hia!

452
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,440
Hia!

453
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,840
This is the exact same spot.

454
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,970
Hia!

455
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,250
Hia, stop it.

456
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,650
After we get married,

457
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,450
we will become one person.

458
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,750
Become one person...

459
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,310
But we can't decide anything for each other.

460
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,480
You know that our society doesn't legally accept our marriage.

461
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,360
We don't even get the basic rights of a married couple.

462
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,650
That's why

463
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,910
we have to keep fighting.

464
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,500
Our society will accept this someday.

465
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,060
No matter what marital status we are in this society,

466
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,380
you will always have me by your side.

467
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,300
But I haven't agreed to marry you yet.

468
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,800
It's okay.

469
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,940
I can wait.

470
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,940
Hia.

471
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,290
Well...

472
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,470
You can be my lover.

473
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,070
I can't hear you clearly. What did you say?

474
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,670
You're my lover.

475
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,730
What did you say?

476
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,020
You're my lover!

477
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,580
Hia!

478
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,170
I heard it already.

479
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,400
I want you to smile like this everyday.

480
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,500
You don't have to make a straight face and try to be well-mannered.

481
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,140
You don't have to act like a doll anymore.

482
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,640
It's your fault. You like to make a scary face.

483
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,770
I didn't.

484
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,790
See! You're doing it again.

485
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,700
Hia.

486
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,240
Again?

487
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,130
What bad timing.

488
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,780
Are you hungry?

489
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,520
Can I eat something first?

490
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,440
I was so tensed that I didn't dare eat anything.

491
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,720
Aww.

492
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,070
Before you go and eat your porridge...

493
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,970
Can you eat me first?

494
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:50,950
Hm?

495
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,830
Hia.

496
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,850
That's enough.

497
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,680
Are you okay?

498
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:42,850
Of course.

499
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,430
But next time, don't ride the bike this fast if you go out alone.

500
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,730
Gosh!

501
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:52,080
Hia, I was going as slow as a turtle just now.

502
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,270
If you meet me at the circuit, you will have a heart attack.

503
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,550
You're so stubborn. You should be punished.

504
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,530
How will you punish me?

505
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,660
Are you really not afraid of me?

506
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,560
Why did you pretend to be a doll for so long then?

507
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,500
You behaved so well at first

508
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
because you were afraid, weren't you?

509
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,260
I'm not afraid.

510
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,560
I just felt obligated.

511
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:18,460
But let me get this straight. It's too late now if you want me to become a doll again.

512
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,710
You don't have to change.

513
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:24,660
Even if you're like this,

514
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:26,870
I still love you.

515
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,700
Grandpa.

516
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,790
I'm here to bid you farewell.

517
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,270
I'm moving out of the mansion to live with Hia Lian.

518
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,360
I want to thank you for letting me get engaged with Hia.

519
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,060
I didn't really understand why before.

520
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,450
But I understand now.

521
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,050
If it weren't because of you, grandpa.

522
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,350
I wouldn't be this happy.

523
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,570
I will marry Hia soon.

524
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,990
I also know that...

525
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,560
the most important thing...

526
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,390
is getting to be with someone you love the most...

527
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,030
To live together...

528
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,700
To adjust to each other...

529
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,630
No matter what happens,

530
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,080
we will hold hands like this forever.

531
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,240
Hia.

532
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,200
This is a picture of Grandpa and Grandpa Auea.

533
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,320
Life partner...

534
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,460
probably means something like this.

535
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:20,960
Hia.

536
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,080
Should we bring this picture back home?

537
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,170
Hia!

538
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,110
Let's go. I already booked the restaurant. We'll be late.

539
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,090
Hia.

540
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,390
What's wrong? Why don't you eat? The food doesn't taste good?

541
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,310
No.

542
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,950
It tastes good.

543
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,950
The view at that table looks so nice.

544
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,860
Let's sit over there next time.

545
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,580
Yes, it looks lovely.

546
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:42,940
Hia.

547
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:46,540
I...

548
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,480
Well...

549
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,400
Today, I...

550
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,060
Nu-Kuea, the food here doesn't taste good at all. Let's go eat something else at home.

551
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,950
What? Why? I think it tastes alright.

552
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,230
Let's go.

553
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,950
Hia!

554
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,260
I'm already full.

555
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:08,200
Hia!

556
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,110
You should eat it.

557
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:16,060
I'm on diet these days. I don't want to eat desserts.

558
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,460
Gosh! I don't how to propose to him anymore.

559
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:42,760
Damn it! He knows everything. He ruined the whole plan.

560
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,640
Why don't you just ask him to marry you? No more surprises.

561
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:50,710
I feel dizzy now after looking through all these marriage proposals on Youtube.

562
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,290
I can't! I have to create new memories for him.

563
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,560
But from what I see, they are using the same old ways to propose.

564
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,490
There must be a way.

565
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:10,800
By the way, Kuea.

566
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,260
Have you checked the bank account of Kirin's Youtube channel?

567
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,360
I've never heard you say anything about this.

568
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:21,400
I just linked it to my bank account. I rarely ever check it.

569
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,120
Even more so since I've had issues with Hia.

570
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,610
Why?

571
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,680
I'm just asking.

572
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:35,480
Since I saw that you enabled the monetization on your Youtube channel.

573
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,790
You should check it.

574
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,660
Alright.

575
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,270
Hey!

576
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,510
Why is there so much money in your account?

577
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,120
Dude!

578
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,520
I know what to do now!

579
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,230
I know how I'm going to propose to him!

580
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,350
Thank you so much!

581
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,500
Mr. Business Partner, can you come to Gemini now?

582
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,410
What's the matter?

583
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,660
There are many thugs at the club.

584
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,610
Hey! Take Mr. Kirin away first!

585
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,350
Nu-Kuea.

586
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,550
Mr. Lian!

587
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,910
Mr. Lian, wear your suit first.

588
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,600
Here.

589
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,030
Wear the suit first.

590
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,470
Wait, Mr. Lian! Button your suit too!

591
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,460
Mr. Lian, one more! Let me button one more.

592
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,860
What are you doing?

593
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,780
It's done.

594
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,460
Oh my, you're so handsome! Awesome!

595
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,020
Mr. Lian, I will go check inside first.

596
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,360
See you later.

597
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,160
Hello, sir.

598
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,460
What are you guys planning to do?

599
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,160
Kathina-Robe Offering Ceremony is ready.

600
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,920
Good luck. God bless you!

601
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,060
Please go inside.

602
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:04,400

Hia Lian.

628
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:03,480
Will you marry me?

629
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:13,790
Hia!

630
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,370
Why?

631
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,760
Didn't you say you wanted to call off our engagement?

632
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:45,140
That was before.

633
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,460
But right now, I want to marry you.

634
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,160
I don't want to be engaged any longer!

635
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,160
I want to marry you.

636
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,360
I love you.

637
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
I love you the most.

638
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:10,890
I've loved you all my life.

639
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,760
Why did you do this to me?

640
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:40,560
How could you steal all the lines that I'm going to say?

641
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,780
I should be the cool one who proposes to you.

642
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:50,980
I even avoided your proposal so many times.

643
00:58:58,970 --> 00:58:59,940
Hia.

644
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,890
You haven't told me your answer yet.

645
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,950
So...

646
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,230
Will you marry me or not?

647
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,980
Can I not give you an answer yet?

648
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,620
Foei.

649
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,740
Go get the box-

650
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:32,460
Mr. Lian, I think you might need to use it. So I took the liberty to bring it with me.

651
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:36,970
Good luck, sir.

652
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,500
Nu-Kuea Keerati.

653
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,360
Will you marry me?

654
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,810
In the end, you're the one who proposes.

655
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,160
Yes, I will.

656
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,000
Hia.

657
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,110
I won't ask you anymore.

658
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,140
But I will command you.

659
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,380
You must marry me.

660
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:08,640
Yes.

661
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:49,080
Now kiss!

662
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,700
Hia.

663
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:57,060
He's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.

664
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,410
Hia.

665
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,960
He's the one who makes my life meaningful.

666
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,010
He's the reason that I want to wake up every morning.

667
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:12,670
I want to see his face before I close my eyes every night.

668
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,440
I want to be with him,

669
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,220
love him,

670
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,610
and take care of him for the rest of my life.

671
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,600
Love is a magical thing.

672
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,160
I knew that I loved him since I saw his face for the first time.

673
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,630
7-year-old Kilen Wang

674
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,060
didn't know anything about marriage,

675
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,820
life partners,

676
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,640
or engagement.

677
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,700
I want to do what Hia Lian likes.

678
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,510
But this little boy knew what love was.

679
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:55,950
I think love is the purest feeling people can have for each other.

680
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:03,140
Gender, social status, society, skin color, or education does not define you.

681
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,280
For me, love is wanting to take care of him.

682
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,420
I want him to be happy.

683
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,840
I want to see his smile.

684
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:14,730
I want to hear his laugh.

685
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,170
I want to hug and wipe away his tears when the world is too harsh for him.

686
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,470
I want to spend my life with him

687
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,730
until...

688
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,490
we grow old.

689
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,990
No matter what the future holds for us.

690
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,940
Whatever is going to happen.

691
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:42,470
Happiness.

692
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:44,240
Or sadness.

693
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,320
I'm ready to face it

694
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:50,740
as long as the one I love is beside me.

695
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,970
I've learned that if we never let go of each other hands,

696
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,900
our love can always begin again.

697
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:04,020
Sometimes, love comes into your life unexpectedly.

698
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:08,050
The person you never thought you'd fall in love with might turn out to be the right one.

699
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,530
We are all special in our own way.

700
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,070
But love also needs effort.

701
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,320
We have to adjust to each other.

702
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,520
We have to learn from each other.

703
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,250
through actions and words,

704
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,780
Love is everything.

705
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:32,230
I've said it before that I believe in marriage.

706
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,750
I thought I had to change myself for someone I love.

707
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:38,920
Today,

708
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:44,070
I know that marriage is not the only thing I believe in.

709
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,370
I also believe in love.

710
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:50,370
Love and accept each other.

711
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:53,060
Love them for who they are.

712
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,920
And also, love yourself just the way you are.

713
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,800
I'll cherish our love.

714
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,240
I believe in love.

715
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:13,270
I love Hia.

716
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,050
I don't care how other people define what our love is.

717
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,890
Because my love is real.

718
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,490
And it will always be like this forever.

719
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,490
Love is not just about getting married.

720
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:38,330
It's about human rights

721
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,380
and equality.

722
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,650
It's what we all deserve.

723
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:47,620
It might not exist in this society yet.

724
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:55,140
But I hope that one day we will have equal rights.

725
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,690
To have and to hold someone from this day forward,

726
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,530
for better, for worse,

727
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,260
for richer, for poorer,

728
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:11,510
in sickness, and in health,

729
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,220
until death

730
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,140
do us part.

01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,030
(Behind The Scenes)

741
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:36,850
Cut.

742
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:41,130
Mr. Lian.

743
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:43,860
Cut.

744
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,420
Foei.

745
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:45,390
Mr. Lian.

746
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:46,450
Foei!

747
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,600
Remove all the CCTV cameras in the house.
(Zee mispronounced CCTV cameras, "klong-wong-jon-pid" as "klong-wong-jon-BID")

748
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,460
Do I have to twist a lot?
("Bid" in Thai means twist)

749
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,040
Not a lot.

750
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:51,830
Not a lot, right?

751
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:53,070
Let's do it again.

752
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:54,820
I'm sorry, everyone.

753
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:55,530
Cut.

754
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,390
That's right. Turn your face like that.

755
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,950
Don't keep a straight face.

756
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:00,790
Blink your eyes.

757
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,350
Sorry.

758
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,000
I saw that no one was helping Kuea.

759
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,070
I only came here to-

760
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,300
Too aggressive!

761
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,480
Yeah, you're too aggressive. It's like we're going to punch each other now.

762
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,700
Hia!

763
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:13,780
Hia!

764
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:16,350
Hia.

765
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,430
Hia, stop it.

766
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,560
Hia, stop it.

767
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:19,770
Stop it.

768
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,000
Hia!

769
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:25,260
You're telling him to stop, but why are you lying down?!

770
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,460
You can sit and wait. I'll cook for you.

771
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:35,020
Did I put on the apron correctly?

772
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,600
We need to talk without Nuer following you around.

773
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,950
Say it again. It wasn't clear.

774
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,810
...without Nuer following you around.

775
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,020
"Doy. Doy."

776
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:48,760
"Duay."

777
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:49,790
"Doy."

778
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:50,620
"Duay."

779
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,500
It's not "Duay," it's "Doy."

780
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,220
"Duay."

781
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,250
"Doy Tee..."

782
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,100
"Duay Tee."

783
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:55,960
"Doy."

784
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:56,600
"Duay."

785
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:57,350
"Doy."

786
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:57,970
"Duay."

787
01:08:58,390 --> 01:08:58,890
"Duay."

788
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,670
Cut! Let's practice how to pronounce it first.

789
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,290
It' D-O-Y.

790
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:09,920
Mr. Lian, could you please get that?

791
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, no. I mean, please take a step back. I'll get it myself. Sorry.

792
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:14,470
I think-

793
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:18,090
What?

794
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,100
I'm sorry.

795
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,100
Nu-Kuea, where do you want to go today?

796
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,500
I want to stay in the room.

797
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,220
I want to stay in the room too.

798
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:31,090
You can do whatever you want.

799
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,100
I'll scrub your back.

800
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,220
Can you do more than that?

801
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,300
What do you mean?

802
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,460
What else do you want to do?

803
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,500
I just want to lie on the bed.

804
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,700
But I don't want to just lie still.

805
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,060
Maybe Kuea has to use it.

806
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,860
What a firm grip.

807
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:57,990
It's okay.

808
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,630
I have-

809
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:01,120
I have-

810
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,620
It's so hard to say this.

811
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:03,800
I have earplugs.

812
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,800
I have e-plugs.

813
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:05,900
I have earplugs.

814
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:06,840
I have earplugs.

815
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:07,480
I have-

816
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,650
Keep roll. Again.

817
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,050
Cut.

818
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:19,050
Cut.

819
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:27,000
Are you trying to get back at me?

820
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,610
Yeah.
