1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,540
Since we don't love each other,

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,950
we should just call off our engagement.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,900
That's because he feels slighted.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,480
I know.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,590
I will never call off my engagement with Nu-Kuea.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,350
Why?

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,290
You know nothing. There's more to it than just an engagement.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,750
I can't let him know what I do in my free time.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,510
That includes being a singer and a drummer named Kirin.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,010
Kirin...Do you think you can fool me, Annabelle?

11
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,009
It's just a promise that you gave to my grandpa. Is that all?

12
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,210
You don't have any siblings. You only have me to play with.

13
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,030
Maybe that makes you think that you-

14
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,270
You said that you will propose to me.

15
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,470
That's right. I will.

16
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,620
But when I asked you...

17
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,460
If you ask me whether I love you or not,

18
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,750
I don't think it's love yet.

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,730
How the hell could it not be?

20
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,010
You should find one good reason...

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,170
and prepare to explain why I want to call off the engagement.

22
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,250
I will say this very frankly.

23
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,010
I want to marry a human.

24
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,980
I don't want to marry a doll.

25
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,140
Annabelle.

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,320
Do I look like Annabelle?

27
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,990
Does he mean that I look like a ghost?

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,170
I will go get a skinhead cut then!

29
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,790
Nu-Kuea, what kind of hairstyle do you want?

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,970
I want to do what Hia Lian likes.

31
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,900
Sure. That's not hard to do.

32
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,660
Mommy, make sure I look exactly like him.

33
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,230
Sure.

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,640
I always dress up and do everything the way he likes.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,620
Kuea, what's the matter?

36
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,010
I have decided...

37
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,430
I will not go back to the UK.

38
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,440
How come?

39
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,980
I want to stay here.

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,690
I will study at a university in Thailand.

41
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,290
But we've prepared everything for you to continue your study in London.

42
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,340
I know that.

43
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,620
But...

44
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
I miss grandpa.

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,660
And...

46
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,130
I want to spend more time with Hia Lian.

47
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,910
Since we'll get married in the future.

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay.

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,070
If that's what you've decided, I won't object.

50
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,130
Have you decided what major you want to choose then?

51
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,630
I want to study engineering.

52
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,290
I thought you wanted to study political science.

53
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,700
But it's okay.

54
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,340
I think computer engineering is okay too.

55
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,380
He can study whatever he likes.

56
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,890
As long as he's obedient and well-behaved.

57
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm just worried that you will live apart from us.

58
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,970
But if Lian is there to take care of him for me, I think it should be okay.

59
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,990
Okay.

60
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:30,170
I want you to be Nu-Kuea's guardian while he's living in Thailand.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,210
Keep us updated on his schedules as well as his grades.

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,100
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,550
I don't think that is necessary.

64
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,790
I can take care of myself.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,800
But I'll will be less worried if Lian is also there to look after you.

66
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,180
Please take him out sometimes.

67
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,710
I don't want you to look after him like you're his parent or brother.

68
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,790
Look after him like he's your life partner.

69
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,030
Can you do that?

70
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,020
Of course.

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,300
It's my pleasure.

72
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,030
I will take him on a date every Friday night.

73
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,070
Starting from this week.

74
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,020
That's great. Then I can him stay in Thailand.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,780
I'm okay with it too.

76
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,930
Kuea!

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,650
I want to ask.

78
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,980
Do you have a girlfriend?

79
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,150
Come on. Only you want to know this.

80
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,420
Yeah. I want to know.

81
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,970
Answer or drink? Answer or drink? Answer or drink?

82
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,610
I...

83
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,430
I don't have a girlfriend.

84
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,750
But I have a fiancé.

85
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,690
What?

86
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,790
Fiancé?

87
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,500
Our family planned our engagement since we were young.

88
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,940
He's like a brother to me.

89
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:23,790
What?

90
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,140
Brother?

91
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,230
It might sound weird.

92
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,920
It seems impossible, isn't it?

93
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,340
My family and his family are very close.

94
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,370
Everything is possible in this world.

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,850
Wait. So, you two have been in an arranged marriage since you guys were kids?

96
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,630
No.

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,880
They didn't force us.

98
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,380
Well..

99
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,180
I've loved him for a really long time.

100
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,630
But it still seems a bit weird.

101
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,810
Gosh! Because a person like you exists in this world,

102
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,690
that's why our society will never be open-minded.

103
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,630
Do you know that our society has become more diverse than you could imagine?

104
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,120
Keep your eyes, your ears, and your heart open.

105
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,180
And stop that kind of thinking.

106
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,330
Calm down, mom. I'm just asking because I want to know.

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,210
What about your fiancé? Does he love you too?

108
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,820
Where there is love...

109
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,850
there is also pain.

110
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,900
Shit.

111
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,070
Amen.

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,630
I think he must've come from the Shaolin Temple.

113
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,610
Let's drink!

114
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,409
Cheers.

115
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,730
Nu-Kuea.

116
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,050
Are you awake?

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,640
I bought snacks for you.

118
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:07,710
Look!

119
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,390
I'm relieved.

120
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,020
I'm glad that you're still alive.

121
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,270
I know.

122
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm not dead yet.

123
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,890
I don't want to become a haunted doll like what Hia said.

124
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,780
You two haven't reconciled yet?

125
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,169
It's his fault.

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,090
He hasn't contacted me since last night.

127
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,900
He's probably dead in the office by now.

128
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,460
It's okay. Let's focus on this instead.

129
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,190
Deep-fried dough stick.

130
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,220
And congee from your favorite restaurant.

131
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,480
A perfect breakfast for this lovely morning breeze.

132
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,920
Are you possessed by a Disney princess?

133
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,060
I think I'm pretty normal.

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,170
But look at you.

135
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,060
You look so depressed it's like there's a black cloud hanging over your head.

136
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,450
Whoa. It's so gloomy.

137
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,610
Look at that.

138
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,940
I'll help.

139
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,700
Just sit still and wait.

140
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,730
I'll do it for you.

141
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,690
Why are you doing so much for me?

142
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,730
I'm afraid that you will burn down the whole kitchen just like the first time we met.

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,720
You'll probably starve to death if I didn't come here.

144
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,540
I know how to use an app to order food.

145
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,400
Alright.

146
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,030
Anyways, thank you.

147
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,780
I miss those times when we were in the UK.

148
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,500
Me too.

149
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,210
Damn it! Why is there smoke?

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,270
What should I do?

151
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,420
How do I open this?

152
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,730
What are you doing?

153
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,880
You will make the smoke detector go off.

154
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm hungry.

155
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,900
I saw this on the table so I just...

156
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,380
I just want to eat it.

157
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,430
This is so basic. You don't know how to cook this?

158
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,700
When you're in Thailand, someone always cooks for you, right?

159
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,130
This is my first time.

160
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,920
First time cooking?

161
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,200
First time in the kitchen.

162
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,230
Alright. I will help you to do this then.

163
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,480
This should be okay.

164
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,190
You can eat it in five minutes.

165
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:31,730
Okay.

166
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,930
By the way, my name is Kuea.

167
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,460
Kuea.

168
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,780
Kuea Keerati.

169
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,370
You're the famous young master, Kuea Keerati?

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm not famous.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,260
Who told you that?

172
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,620
You are descended from a very old aristocratic family.

173
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:04,810
I remember it on the TV that they looked for the treasure from the Ayutthaya period at the Keerati Mansion.

174
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,220
That belongs to my grandpa.

175
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,530
But I live in there too.

176
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,870
What about you? What's your name?

177
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,450
Kon-Diao.

178
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,920
No, I'm not living alone.

179
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,410
No. I mean, my name is "Kon-Diao," not as in "alone."

180
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,160
Sai-Prik-Mai.

181
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,800
Your name is weird.

182
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,710
Your surname is weird too.

183
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,860
I mean, "Sai-Prik-Mai" as in "do you want to put in the chili sauce?"

184
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,160
Oh.

185
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,410
Of course!

186
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,660
No one in the world would have Sai-Prik-Mai as a surname.

187
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah.

188
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,620
Here.

189
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,660
Put the chili sauce too.

190
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:50,490
Okay.

191
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,830
Kuea!

192
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,340
Are you going to eat?

193
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,270
Wow.

194
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,740
You can do this much?

195
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,700
I just put everything I bought on a plate.

196
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,160
Can you come marry me instead?

197
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,720
I don't want to marry Hia Lian anymore.

198
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,890
Are you crazy? God will punish us!

199
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,880
How can I live alone for the rest of my life?

200
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,350
Come back to your senses first.

201
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,300
You have to decide first whether you will call off the engagement or not.

202
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,390
Look at that. You're still wearing the engagement ring.

203
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,770
I will take it off after we officially end our engagement.

204
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,810
I will definitely call of the engagement.

205
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,560
I will never go back to him.

206
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,610
There will be no more Kuea Keerati who's crazy in love.

207
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,480
I don't care about Hia Lian anymore.

208
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,740
I will remove my engagement status with Hia Lian.

209
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,230
I'll let the whole world condemn me if I go back to Hia Lian.

210
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,510
Shit!

211
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,110
Dude.

212
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:56,690
What?

213
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,950
Hia Lian called me last night. Three missed calls!

214
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,440
You should call him back immediately!

215
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,000
He must be really angry at me.

216
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,960
What should I do?

217
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,270
I don't want to get involved.

218
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,880
I know now.

219
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,890
Let's play rock, paper, scissors.

220
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,730
If you win, I will call him back.

221
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,470
If I win, I will not call.

222
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,920
Let's do it.

223
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,710
Let's do it.

224
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,600
Rock, paper, and scissors!

225
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,380
You're really not going to call me back, Nu-Kuea?

226
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,990
Are you sure you're going to do this?

227
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,660
I am sure.

228
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,130
I guess.

229
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,800
I just don't want to force anyone.

230
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,910
Then you have to be patient

231
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,290
and be strong.

232
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,130
Thank you for worrying about me.

233
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,860
Thanks for listening to me whine last night.

234
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,940
Oh right.

235
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,330
Did Hia Yi scold you for coming back late?

236
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,500
Nope.

237
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,360
Hia Yi likes to pretend that he's fierce.

238
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,510
But actually, he never scolds me.

239
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,430
Then why are you so afraid of him?

240
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,110
Don't you think it's scarier when he's like that?

241
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,650
It makes me feel obligated all the time.

242
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,880
He's so scary.

243
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,760
That's so him, Phayak Chen.

244
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,680
Exactly.

245
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,400
And last night...

246
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,550
When I got back home.

247
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,210
I'm home, Hia.

248
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,830
He went right back to his condo.

249
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,320
Why did he come back home then?

250
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,710
Hia Yi and Hia Lian are so confusing.

251
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,310
Why do they have to act all mysterious and hard to figure out?

252
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,410
Kuea...

253
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:07,960
Huh?

254
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,210
Can I ask you something?

255
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,680
Did you two...

256
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,359
do "it" yet?

257
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,140
What do you mean?

258
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,660
I've never!

259
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,260
Have you?

260
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,810
I've never done such a thing.

261
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,330
As for me...

262
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,740
It only goes that far.

263
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,020
My crazy-in-love corner.

264
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,140
It's not that I don't want to do it.

265
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,860
But I think he respects me.

266
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,830
He's probably waiting until we get married.

267
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,840
Don't you ever want to...

268
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,590
hold his hand?

269
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,300
Or kiss him?

270
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,140
Kiss?

271
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,100
Yeah.

272
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,920
Well...

273
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,350
I guess I do sometimes.

274
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,290
The weather is lovely, isn't it?

275
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,930
This place is nice too.

276
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,840
The decorations are also very beautiful.

277
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,370
It reminds me when I was in the UK.

278
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,700
Do you like...

279
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,550
Is this the 'magic moment' between us?

280
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,920
It's finally time, right?

281
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,760
I should give him my first kiss.

282
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,010
Kiss me, Hia.

283
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,010
I'm ready.

284
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,660
Nu-Kuea, you should walk carefully.

285
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,640
This close...

286
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:27,810
But it was just a short moment. It comes and goes.

287
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm sad that I missed that chance.

288
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,580
But it's okay.

289
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,840
I can wait.

290
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,090
But right now...

291
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,470
I don't even know what I'm waiting for.

292
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,840
Maybe...

293
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,230
This is the real reason.

294
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,640
What do you mean?

295
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,850
The reason they've never shown us that they love us

296
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,270
is because they don't.

297
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,720
That's why they never act caring towards us.

298
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,000
You're crazy.

299
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,620
You're thinking too much.

300
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,830
I saw you calling off the engagement last night.

301
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,520
And I can't stop thinking about my own situation.

302
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,680
I think both of us shouldn't be alone.

303
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,200
How about you come with me?

304
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,110
Since I can't practice music today anyway.

305
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,110
Where are we going?

306
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,650
We haven't eaten anything yet.

307
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,240
I will go surrender myself.

308
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,280
Young master Kuea Keerati! Where have you been all night?

309
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,950
Why didn't you tell me that you're going to stay over at that house?!

310
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,700
Do you know how worried I was!? I couldn't sleep because you didn't even pick up my phone calls!

311
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,170
I was going to call the police!

312
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm so sorry!

313
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,120
I was so tired last night. I fell asleep right away.

314
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,800
Mrs. Kewarin told me to take good care of you.

315
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,630
What if something happens to you?

316
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,390
My head would be chopped right off!

317
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,710
You're the best auntie ever!

318
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,960
Is there anything to eat today?

319
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,370
Do you know how much I missed your cooking when I was in the UK?

320
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,760
Can you cook something for Kon-Diao and I today?

321
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,860
Please, auntie Ja?

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,140
Please?

323
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,450
Young master, I'm too old already. My cooking is not as good as before.

324
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,600
You're not old at all!

325
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,160
I've never eaten any Thai food that tastes as good as yours.

326
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,550
Please, auntie Ja.

327
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,420
Aww, my young master.

328
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,230
Of course. How can I say no?

329
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,930
But it has to be for dinner because I have to buy ingredients first, alright?

330
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,970
Young master Diao.

331
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,680
Please stay for dinner.

332
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,470
Of course!

333
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,490
I will do my very best!

334
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,010
I don't have a lot of time, I should go now!

335
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,390
Okay, auntie Ja. I will wait for your cooking!

336
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,480
Me too!

337
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,210
Goodbye...

338
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,780
My beloved high-end brands.

339
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,040
Don't you feel sad that you have to donate all these clothes?

340
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,450
I am.

341
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,390
But I don't want to be the young master Nu-Kuea Keerati that Hia likes anymore.

342
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,470
From now on, I will just be Kuea.

343
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,650
Kuea, the drummer, the singer, the biker.

344
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,660
Be the person I want to be.

345
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,400
I understand what you're trying to say.

346
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,900
But look at all these clothes.

347
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,960
They're all in good condition.

348
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,170
And they're all very expensive, too.

349
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,150
If there's any that you like, you can have it.

350
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,190
Mr. Lian.

351
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,360
Mr. Lian!

352
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,280
Here's the summary of the problem yesterday.

353
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,890
Foei.

354
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,860
Did Nu-Kuea say something while you drove him home last night?

355
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,140
You asshole!

356
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,640
What?

357
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,590
Let me explain this to you. I was driving quite fast.

358
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,530
The road was very dark.

359
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,530
I thought a person was coming out of nowhere.

360
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,650
And something did!

361
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,010
It was a dog!

362
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,750
The first thing that came right into my mind was to figure out its breed.

363
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,690
Was it a Dalmatian? Or maybe a Bangkaew?

364
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,760
Turns out it was actually a Poodle!

365
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,270
It ran out in front of the car, so I had to slam on the breaks.

366
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,100
I turned around to check on young master Kuea.

367
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,730
And then young master Kuea said...

368
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,550
You asshole.

369
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,310
That's it, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

370
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,600
Okay.

371
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,290
Okay...

372
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,130
It's Saturday. You can go back early.

373
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,530
And do not tell anyone about what happened last night.

374
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,490
It will ruin the image of young master Kuea Keerati.

375
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,710
Yes, sir.

376
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,200
You even called me an asshole, Nu-Kuea?

377
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,970
I don't think you can completely get rid of the young master Nu-Kuea inside of you.

378
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,610
It's just too much.

379
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,390
At least I have to try.

380
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,040
I don't want to be the young master Nu-Kuea Keerati anymore.

381
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,840
But you're still Nu-Kuea in auntie Ja's, your mom's, and your dad's eyes.

382
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,560
You're right.

383
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,890
But I don't have to pretend or try so hard like when I'm with Hia.

384
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,680
What about that picture?

385
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,430
You don't want to keep it anymore?

386
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,120
I don't think you two can be apart,

387
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,930
even if you guys break up.

388
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,810
Being Nu-Kuea is still a part of who you are.

389
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,490
You can't throw away or donate that side of you.

390
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,870
'My fiancé.'

391
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,310
Your fiancé is calling you.

392
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,730
Ex-fiancé.

393
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,530
I should change his name now.

394
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,090
Are you going to pick up the phone?

395
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,430
No.

396
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,020
He just wants to hear that I'm still okay.

397
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,360
Not that he cares.

398
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,000
But since we're no longer engaged.

399
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,120
He doesn't have to do this anymore.

400
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,270
You're so naughty, Nu-Kuea.

401
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,100
Same table tonight.

402
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,630
Book it for me.

403
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,000
I know you already have a band playing tonight...

404
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,850
but can Kirin join too?

405
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,400
Well yeah, of course you can.

406
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,660
But the problem is...

407
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,010
you use so much time to set up the stage more than any other band.

408
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:39,550
Today.

409
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,540
No, not today.

410
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,680
I mean from now on, there's no need to do that.

411
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,270
What?

412
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,730
Don't tell me that you're going to reveal yourself?

413
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,130
That's right.

414
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,690
I will stop hiding behind the curtains.

415
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,190
I'm going to be myself.

416
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,780
You're not afraid that your fiancé will find out?

417
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,130
I don't have a fiancé anymore.

418
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,700
I already called off the engagement.

419
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,560
What?

420
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,910
Didn't you just go on a date with him the other day?

421
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,540
Things have changed.

422
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,430
Kiddo.

423
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,770
Aren't you being too hotheaded?

424
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,090
You should think carefully about revealing yourself.

425
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,070
All the secrets that you've kept...

426
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,540
Everything you've kept hidden will end right here.

427
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,450
That's right, Kuea.

428
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,830
Think carefully.

429
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,830
Don't be too impulsive.

430
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,670
I don't care anymore.

431
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,400
The reason that I keep everything a secret

432
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,400
is because I'm afraid that Hia will find out.

433
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,090
But right now...

434
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,950
I just want to sing.

435
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,920
I just want to be myself.

436
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,200
And I also want to know that if I reveal myself...

437
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,710
will anyone recognize me?

438
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,780
Will they still want to find out...

439
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,800
who Kirin is?

440
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,970
How about this?

441
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,710
You just do whatever you want tonight.

442
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,720
And after the show, I'll buy you guys some drinks.

443
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,520
Okay?

444
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,450
What?

445
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,440
Where is Kon-Diao?

446
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,730
How am I supposed to know?

447
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,480
You're calling me but asking for him?

448
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,480
Whatever. I can't contact Nu-Kuea, so I thought they might be together.

449
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,610
I don't know.

450
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,990
I don't keep tabs on Kon-Diao's whereabouts all day like you do to Kuea.

451
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,500
Thanks for being useless.

452
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,160
What the hell is wrong with him?

453
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,360
Why is he taking it out on me?

454
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,870
Whatever. I can't contact Nu-Kuea, so I thought they might be together.

Hello, Hia.

497
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm helping Kuea at the moment.

498
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,139
Helping him do what?

499
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm helping him pack some clothes.

500
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,080
For the whole day?

501
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,929
There are a lot of clothes.

502
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,670
But I will be back within thirty minutes.

503
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,739
Good.

504
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,500
I'm waiting at home.

505
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,260
Huh? How come?

506
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,850
Usually you don't come back home on Saturdays.

507
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,320
I can come back whenever I want. This is my house.

508
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,920
Okay, Hia.

509
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,590
I will be back soon.

510
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,080
Should I ask him?

511
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,800
Ask him!

512
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,990
Are you Kirin?

513
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,540
Yes.

514
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,350
I am Kirin.

515
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,320
Kirin is the mask that I used to hide myself.

516
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But today...

517
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,880
I have decided to take off that mask.

518
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,700
My real name is Kuea.

519
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,240
No title.

520
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,930
No surname.

521
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,070
No fake names.

522
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,480
Just 'Kuea'.

523
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,750
This is the real me.

524
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,920
I hope you guys will welcome me the same way you did towards Kirin.

525
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,300
Kuea! I can't stay any longer! I have to go back home now!

526
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,590
Thank you.

527
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,710
(Kon-Diao is with Kuea at the Keerati Mansion.)

528
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,960
(Wrong.)

529
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,830
Kon-Diao!

530
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,660
You dare to lie to me nowadays?

531
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,660
Are you okay? You seem so drunk.

532
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,910
Let's dance.

533
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,040
Kuea.

534
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,970
Let's call it a day. Let's go back now.

535
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,850
If you don't want to be alone, you can sleepover at my house.

536
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,010
Please?

537
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:20,850
Hey!

538
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,000
How do you feel when you don't have to keep it a secret anymore?

539
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,790
It feels great!

540
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,000
I feel so good.

541
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,100
I can sing what I want to sing.

542
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,800
I can make eye contact with the audiences.

543
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,770
It means a lot to me.

544
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm so happy for you, man.

545
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,860
Let's go!

546
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,800
It's time to celebrate.

547
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,080
Jay.

548
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,740
Um...

549
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,010
We have to leave now.

550
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,910
How come?

551
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,010
We already made a deal.

552
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,580
But...

553
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,740
You can go back first.

554
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,690
I really want to celebrate this moment.

555
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,320
But I'm worried about you.

556
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,920
You don't have to worry about me.

557
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,950
I'm not the old Nu-Kuea who didn't even know how to cook instant noodle.

558
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,780
I know.

559
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,280
You won't be mad at me, right?

560
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,250
I'm not mad at you.

561
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,070
I know that Hia Yi cares about you.

562
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,340
It's not like it's his job to look after you like this.

563
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,810
But he does it anyway.

564
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,930
It's because he loves you.

565
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,130
Fine.

566
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,450
Jay, don't let him drink too much.

567
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,160
He becomes another person when he's drunk.

568
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,100
Don't worry.

569
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,630
I'll look after him.

570
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,200
You should go back now.

571
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,470
Okay.

572
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,180
Take care.

573
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,150
Okay.

574
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,840
Go. Don't make Hia Yi wait for too long.

575
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,290
See you then.

576
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,500
Jay.

577
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,730
I'm serious.

578
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,280
Don't trust him when he's drunk.

579
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,280
Okay.

580
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,820
See you.

581
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,280
Hia...

582
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,820
Since when did the Keerati mansion move to Thonglor?

583
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,300
It's-

584
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,430
Go on, tell me more lies, why don't you?

585
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,650
I really came from Kuea's house.

586
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,860
But...

587
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,180
Kuea is still inside the club.

588
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,040
As for me...I will go back home now.

589
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,870
And why does Kuea have to come to a small club like this?

590
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,330
When Lian's Pentagon is right at the opposite side.

591
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,960
Kuea is not allowed to go inside Pentagon, Hia.

592
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,190
So that's why you guys are here?

593
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:12,110
You know how much I hate liars.

594
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,000
Don't you lie to me.

595
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,340
I didn't mean to lie to you.

596
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,900
Let's talk at home.

597
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,990
Cheers!

598
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,740
To Kuea Keerati!

599
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,960
Excuse me, can I have one more drink?

600
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,550
Just call me Kuea.

601
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,440
No need to mention my surname.

602
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,940
I'm used to it already.

603
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,640
Just Kuea sounds weird to me.

604
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,020
Or...

605
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,120
Should I just call you Kirin?

606
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
No.

607
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,690
Kirin means Qilin.

608
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,900
Qilin means Kilen.

609
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,690
Kilen is Hia Lian.

610
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,090
You still love him?

611
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,550
You know my Thai is not that good.

612
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,710
Kirin equals to Hia Lian.

613
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,010
Got that?

614
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,080
Fine. Okay.

615
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,340
You're too complicated.

616
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:04,290
Who will understand you?

617
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,910
I don't want to be Kirin anymore.

618
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,080
I just want to be Kuea.

619
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,320
What's wrong with being Kuea?

620
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,900
I'm not saying that it's bad.

621
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,840
I just want to help you figure out which choice is the best.

622
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,010
I don't want that.

623
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,410
I don't need your help.

624
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,260
Are you okay?

625
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,000
You seem very drunk.

626
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,900
Do I look drunk?

627
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,940
Do whatever you want then.

628
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,520
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

629
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,690
Young master Kuea.

630
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,660
I just told you I'm not a young master!

631
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,380
Okay. I know. I know.

632
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,650
Can I join you for a drink?

633
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,360
Join me?

634
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:05,940
Yeah.

635
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,880
You're Kirin, right?

636
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,580
Hey! I'm Kuea.

637
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,250
My name is Kuea.

638
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,440
Okay, okay. Let's dance.

639
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,460
Yeah, sure.

640
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,420
Come with me right now.

641
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,010
Who are you?

642
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,370
Hia...Lian.

643
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,550
Are you Hia Lian The Asshole?

644
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,290
Nah, you're not him.

645
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,130
You just look like him.

646
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,090
You look very similar to him.

647
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,660
Hia Lian, is that you?

648
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,780
Hia!

649
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,290
You're way too drunk.

650
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:14,920
Come with me.

651
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,910
No!

652
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,790
Who are you?

653
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:20,170
Don't touch me.

654
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
Stop being so difficult.

655
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,690
Come with me.

656
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,320
Hia...

657
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,740
Jay!

658
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,970
Jay, where are you? Help me.

659
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,530
Jay!

660
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,710
Jay!

661
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,740
Jay!

662
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,780
Kuea Keerati!

663
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,780
Hia Lian?

664
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,790
Why are you here?

665
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,400
No way.

666
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,930
You're not him.

667
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,890
He'd never dress up like this.

668
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,990
Don't bother trying to trick me.

669
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,480
Let's go. I'll send you home.

670
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,740
I'm not going with you. You're not Hia Lian!

671
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,850
I didn't expect you to be this drunk.

672
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,040
No! I'm not going with you!

673
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,530
Nu-Kuea!

674
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,190
Nu-Kuea.

675
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,040
Where are we going?

676
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,270
I'm not going to go with you.

677
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,640
Nu-Kuea, walk carefully and don't push me.

678
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,690
Don't call me Nu-Kuea!

679
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,880
Only Hia can call me that!

680
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,820
What do you want me to call you?

681
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,700
Anything!

682
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,750
Except 'Nu-Kuea.'

683
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,110
What about...

684
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,460
Annabelle.

685
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:56,620
Annabelle...

686
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,730
Don't call me that.

687
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:03,900
I hate it!

688
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,620
Why are you smiling?

689
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,560
Don't laugh at me.

690
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:09,800
Stop it!

691
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,810
You don't like it when I smile?

692
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,150
No.

693
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,090
I don't want to fall for you.

694
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,520
Do not flirt with me!

695
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,000
You don't want to like me?

696
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,100
No.

697
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,490
I don't want to like you anymore.

698
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,690
You're a bad person.

699
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,760
Don't think that I will like you just because you look like Hia.

700
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,600
But I want to flirt with you.

701
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,120
Are you Hia Lian?

702
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,560
You sound like him.

703
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,970
You smell like him too.

704
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,530
No way!

705
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,350
It can't be.

706
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,140
You must be a top-grade replica.

707
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:24,680
I thought this kind of situation only exists in dramas.

708
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,630
You're talking nonsense now.

709
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,560
Let's go.

710
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,320
I'll send you home.

711
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,280
Where are you taking me?

712
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,820
Where are we going?

713
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,300
Let's go.

714
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,910
Oh, I'm sorry!

715
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,210
Young master Kuea, this way.

716
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,450
What's wrong with you? What's gotten into you?

717
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,330
Should we go straight to his house?

718
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,700
No! You can't!

719
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,040
I can't go back home!

720
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,080
Auntie Ja will tell my mom.

721
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,790
She will also tell Hia.

722
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,810
Go to my secret house.

723
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,970
Can you tell me the way?

724
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,090
Here.

725
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,140
Take a look for yourself.

726
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:18,400
'The dragon's lair'?

727
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:21,860
That's right.

728
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,440
Foei.

729
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:26,640
Yes, sir.

730
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,860
You have the same ring as Hia?

731
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,820
You must be Hia.

732
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,780
But it can't be.

733
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,970
Can I ask you something?

734
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:29,720
Have you ever wanted to hug me?

735
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,840
Have you ever wanted to kiss me?

736
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,660
Nu-Kuea...

737
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,480
You don't love me...

738
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,720
That's why you've never wanted to do that, right?

739
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:00,320
Why don't you ever love me?

740
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,100
Can't you love me just a little bit?

741
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,590
Just a bit is enough for me.

742
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,930
Why?

743
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,320
Why don't you love me?

744
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,650
I want you to love me.

745
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,090
I've always been a good boy.

746
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,980
I want to marry you.

747
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,720
But why don't you want to marry me?

748
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,510
Why don't you love me?

749
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,170
I love you so much.

750
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,330
I didn't want to call off the engagement.

751
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,220
Can you love me back?

752
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,310

Diao, do you know how I got back to my secret house last night?

763
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,050
Did you talk to Hia Lian yet?

764
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:02,740
I will be busted if I asked him that!

765
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,760
Where were you yesterday?

766
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,400
I will not put up with this anymore!

767
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,480
Kirin. Qilin. The dragon's lair.

768
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,320
What else are you hiding from me?

769
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,490
I can't let this go on.

770
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,710
But I vaguely remember...

771
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,330
I met a guy who looked exactly like Hia Lian.

772
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,960
Are you actually Hia Lian?

773
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,010
Nu-Kuea, you should sleep.

774
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,200
What are you going to do if it's actually him?
