EPISODE 10

2
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,720
-No, talk with me instead.
-About what?

3
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,600
Why should I hear you out
when you've been ghosting me?

4
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,394
-Am I invisible?
-I could ask you the same thing.

5
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,855
I wasn't joking when I said we're done.

6
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,316
You ignored me,
even though I told you so many times,

7
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,859
so don't yell at me.

8
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,486
You have no right.

9
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,780
Whatever I do, whomever I meet,

10
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,241
you have no right to judge me.

11
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,993
Why did you meet my father then?

12
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,286
To tell him it was over.

13
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,082
I told him that we failed as a couple.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,468
And that prick's your success story?

15
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,556
You're mistaking pity for love.

16
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,723
Watch your mouth.

17
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,560
Ji-ho, no!

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey, I said you'd only get one pass.

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,190
-Want to go at it then?
-Don't.

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,359
-Get over here.
-Ji-ho, please let go!

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,527
Stop it.

22
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,320
-Don't.
-Let go of me.

23
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,322
-Bring it on.
-Stop.

24
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,283
-Come on. Do your worst.
-Ji-ho...

25
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,910
-What are you waiting for?
-Hey!

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,580
What?

27
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:44,998
Wait for me in the car.

28
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,124
Get over here!

29
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,589
Hey, let go of me.

30
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,633
Jeong-in.

31
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,552
Jeong-in!

32
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,012
Get back over here!

33
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,640
Talk to me instead.
It's me you're pissed off at, anyway.

34
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,102
-Let go of me.
-Maybe next time, all right?

35
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,021
You're pushing it.

36
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,523
Let's leave Jeong-in out of this.

37
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,026
Stay back.

38
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,570
-Don't!
-Get off me!

39
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,489
-Just talk it out, all right?
-Get over here.

40
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,701
Let go.

41
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,693
Just a month after Eun-u was born...

42
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,113
his mother disappeared.

43
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,825
It made me furious.

44
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,452
While searching for her,

45
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,080
I promised myself I'd have a go at her.

46
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,916
That's all I thought about.

47
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,503
Worries swept over me as time passed.

48
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,549
"What if she won't come back?

49
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
Then how do I raise Eun-u alone?

50
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,516
Do I have to give him up for adoption?"

51
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,607
I stooped down so low

52
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,402
because all I could think about

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,113
was how desperate I was.

54
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,534
It was only after a while...

55
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,747
that I realized she had her reasons too.

56
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:36,210
She could've been overwhelmed
to the point that I couldn't comprehend.

57
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,590
I still couldn't understand her...

58
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,968
but letting myself admit that much...

59
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,597
set my heart at rest.

60
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,855
When I said that we should
take our time...

61
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,983
it's not because I'm generous

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,402
or the nicest man alive.

63
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,740
It's just that Gi-seok needs time
to let this sink in.

64
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,498
Us being understanding and considerate
doesn't really matter to anyone.

65
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,585
To others, I'm a woman
who's seeing two men,

66
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,547
and you're the guy
coming onto a woman who's taken.

67
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,760
Why should we be seen that way?

68
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,429
I don't want that.

69
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,850
I'd rather cut you from my life.

70
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,561
I'm not one to put on a calm face

71
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,314
when I'm exploding in the inside.

72
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,821
Just like how you don't hold back
when it comes to Eun-u...

73
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,949
I can't put up with it, while others...

74
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,243
trample on my feelings and decisions.

75
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,788
I'd rather face it and let it shatter...

76
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,416
than avoid the situation.

77
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,546
Then why did you stop me earlier?

78
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,466
Because I was embarrassed.

79
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,137
Two men were growling over one woman.

80
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,723
Passersby would've thought
I'm some kind of princess

81
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,101
or an heiress of a rich CEO.

82
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,853
It looked ridiculous.

83
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,238
You working tomorrow?

84
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,408
No.

85
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,802
What?

86
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,930
How have you been?

87
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,017
As if you care. What do you want?

88
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,394
Come on.

89
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,606
Oh, please. You're the one
who said you needed to study.

90
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,983
Did you pass the exam?

91
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,405
What's with your other arm?

92
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,658
Is that your exam certificate?

93
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:13,993
No.

94
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,289
Don't tell me... you bought me flowers.

95
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,548
I just saw some while I was passing by.

96
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,300
How much was it?

97
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,844
Well, 5,000 won.

98
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:32,845
So it was 2,000 won.

99
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,972
-In fact, 3,000 won.
-Don't you have to study?

100
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,559
I studied hard today.
I was at the academy until now

101
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,311
even when there weren't any classes.

102
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,480
Good for you, I guess.

103
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
So what are you doing here?

104
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,821
You said I was getting in the way.

105
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:51,781
When?

106
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,494
I overreacted to the whole thing,
and now I feel bad about it.

107
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,704
I was hoping to clear the air.

108
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,375
Do you have some money?

109
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,584
What? Money?

110
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,088
I do. I have some left from buying...

111
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,090
-the flowers.
-Save it.

112
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,926
Let's go upstairs for some tea.

113
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:13,928
I can't!

114
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,016
How can I, after what it led to last time?

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,142
I'd rather not.

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,436
As if.

117
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,480
I know about the pharmacist.

118
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,448
Thanks. Wait, this is too much.

119
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,286
It's for the flowers.

120
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,579
Oh, right.

121
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,914
-Here.
-Thank you.

122
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:26,709
So...

123
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,795
Where's your sister?

124
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,797
With the pharmacist.

125
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,929
Is his son something to be ashamed of?

126
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,058
Why hide the truth?

127
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,518
You don't have to, you know.

128
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,981
Of course, I know that.
It's his personal life, though

129
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,150
and not something to blabber about.

130
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,526
Why are you being defensive?

131
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,739
-I wasn't telling you off.
-I didn't say that.

132
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,286
Ji-ho and...

133
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,624
And what?

134
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,629
Is it okay for your sister to be with him?

135
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,133
Love isn't something you can control.

136
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,526
Have you lived here since you were little?

137
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,738
Yes, since elementary school.

138
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,200
I see. You must've been a tidy boy.

139
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,663
I would've been even if
my parents didn't run a dry cleaner's.

140
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,040
My mother likes everything neat and tidy.

141
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,458
I see.

142
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,919
Who do you take after?

143
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,340
My good qualities are from my parents,

144
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,260
but the others I picked up myself.

145
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,056
You're a sweet son.

146
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,269
Hardly. I've caused them so much trouble.

147
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,984
-Can we sit?
-Sure. Go ahead.

148
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,826
This place feels oddly familiar.

149
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,787
It brings back memories too.

150
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,333
It's a familiar place, that's why.

151
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,544
The pharmacy too?

152
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,425
Come to think of it,
you've never felt like a stranger either.

153
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,429
You were drunk that first day.

154
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,390
Don't kill the mood.

155
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,851
It was the opposite for me.

156
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,397
I was fascinated by how innocent you were.

157
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,650
Am I not anymore?

158
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,404
That side of you has completely gone.

159
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,703
There's some instant coffee here.

160
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,956
I like the vibe of this place.

161
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,042
A drink would be perfect.

162
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,462
Would you like one?

163
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,173
You have drinks here?

164
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,592
Probably.

165
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,481
Hold on.

166
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,067
What did I do wrong?

167
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,905
I did everything right by her...

168
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,283
while we were dating.

169
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,452
Jeez.

170
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,955
Okay, sure. I've been to hostess bars

171
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,457
and had a few drinks

172
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,585
with some ladies
while out with my friends.

173
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,879
But who hasn't in his life?

174
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,798
Right? You've done it too.

175
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,092
How's that important right now?

176
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,428
So why the hell is this happening?

177
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,433
Does her choosing Ji-ho make sense?

178
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,978
She chose him over me.

179
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,897
It's Yu Ji-ho.

180
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,650
I lost to none other than Ji-ho.
Are you kidding me?

181
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,569
Am I that pathetic?

182
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,405
In what way is Ji-ho better than me?

183
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,115
Damn it.

184
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,288
Why is it Yu Ji-ho of all people?

185
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,748
You prick.

186
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,711
Am I wrong though?

187
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,921
I didn't say anything.

188
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,381
That bastard...

189
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,051
He's a nobody, you know.

190
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,845
Okay, fine.

191
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,264
He's nothing.

192
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,934
He's nothing compared to me.

193
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,353
All right, I get it.

194
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,815
-Damn it.
-I need to take a piss.

195
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,583
Hello?

196
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,463
What do you want from me?

197
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,677
What do you mean?

198
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,847
What is it that you truly want?

199
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,184
Why didn't you tell me
what Jeong-in told you?

200
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,936
Why?

201
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,647
She said she wasn't going to marry me.

202
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,900
Why didn't you tell me that?

203
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,902
You're drunk.

204
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,446
When you first gave us your blessing,

205
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,782
I was even touched.

206
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,035
Not knowing what she had said to you...

207
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,121
I was over the moon.

208
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,000
How could you make me look like a fool?

209
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,461
You made a mockery out of me.

210
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,089
You're drunk, so just head on home.

211
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,051
You should've told me the truth.

212
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,514
Instead of making me
read between the lines...

213
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,978
you should've told me
what really happened.

214
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,105
Gi-seok.

215
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,274
Do you really need to hear

216
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,403
that your girl doesn't want to marry you
from your old man?

217
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,240
You've always been
embarrassed of me, haven't you?

218
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:36,912
I know.

219
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,625
You've never once been satisfied with me.

220
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,211
I know that too.

221
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,340
I take after Mom...

222
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,098
and you see me as a coward.

223
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,144
You think I'm nothing but a fool.

224
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,605
I've known that
for as long as I can remember.

225
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,359
Father...

226
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,283
you only think that way
because you don't know me better.

227
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,495
I'm not viewed as inferior, you know.

228
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,831
Out in society,

229
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,667
people look up to me.

230
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,128
I'm not too bad.

231
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,883
I bet that sounds pathetic too.

232
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,264
Of course. It's not like you've ever...

233
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,393
You always twist things
and let sarcasm take over.

234
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,565
This is why I said
that Jeong-in is maturer than you.

235
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,610
You're not levelheaded enough
to marry anyone.

236
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,111
But I will.

237
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,198
Just you wait and see.

238
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,159
I will marry her no matter what.

239
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,331
No matter who or what
tries to get in our way...

240
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,875
I will marry Jeong-in.

241
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,923
Jae-in told me...

242
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,759
I should be selfish.

243
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:19,139
She says nothing else matters
if it's to protect my true feelings.

244
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,520
At first, I only thought
she said that to comfort me,

245
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,480
but that wasn't it.

246
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,066
That's how it should be.

247
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,611
So I'm not going to feel guilty anymore.

248
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,201
He's not mad because of the timing.

249
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,081
He's humiliated because it's me.

250
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,918
I'll be disappointed
if you're intimidated.

251
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,549
How can I be when you have my back?

252
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,558
You're smart, right?

253
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,604
I will say this once and only once,

254
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,772
so take it to heart.

255
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,362
When I'm not satisfied with you,

256
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,406
I'll call you out on the spot.

257
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,910
My bursts of anger
might not seem reasonable,

258
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,080
and I could say harsh words as well.

259
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,959
When I do though,

260
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,629
don't think that I'm being dismissive.

261
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,967
Don't walk on eggshells around me either.

262
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,261
Or I'll kick you to the curb.

263
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,025
I didn't say this to please you, you know.

264
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,068
It's important.

265
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,362
So don't forget it.

266
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,742
Okay?

267
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,083
Look at you thinking of a way out.

268
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,213
You only gave me a peck
so that you'd pass a breathalyzer.

269
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,581
PYEONGCHANGSA LAUNDRY

270
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,553
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

271
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,180
What?

272
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,395
What's going on?

273
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,814
I...

274
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,524
My gosh!

275
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,611
What are you doing?

276
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,578
What's going on?

277
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,080
Hold on.

278
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,960
PYEONGCHANGSA LAUNDRY

279
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:40,961
Gosh.

280
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,090
Why come to the library
if you're going to stay on your phone?

281
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,508
You called me here.

282
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,554
What good does
an expensive education abroad do

283
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,806
when it's practically useless?

284
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,476
I'll find something to do, so don't worry.

285
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,980
You think way too highly of your talents.

286
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,773
Anyway, that's that,

287
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,484
but who's the guy Jeong-in's been seeing?

288
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,403
-How should I know?
-Come on.

289
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,822
I don't know him that well.

290
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:12,701
Then tell me what you do know.

291
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,413
This is Jeong-in's workplace,
so ask her yourself.

292
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,545
You should tell me before
your father gets to the bottom of this.

293
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:28,008
How can I help her out if I don't know?

294
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:32,679
Do you think he'll ever let this slide?
You saw what happened that day.

295
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,642
Your father was so startled
that he even forgot to scold you.

296
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,603
Who is he?

297
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,855
Tell me!

298
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,151
He's a pharmacist.

299
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,569
What?

300
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,321
They're the same age too.

301
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,948
That's all I know.

302
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,786
-Then--
-I'm hungry. Let's eat.

303
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,456
Wait, hold on. Hey!

304
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,749
Jae-in!

305
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,085
When should I pick up my clothes?

306
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,841
Why is Jeong-in being this way?
I'm completely clueless.

307
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,013
She won't say anything else

308
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,933
apart from the fact that she likes him.

309
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,520
Even you think there's
something going on, right?

310
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,522
-I couldn't care less.
-Why you...

311
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,026
Just let her be.

312
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,112
Jeong-in always knows what she's doing.

313
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,697
Of course, I know that.

314
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,408
Still, it's not like her
to hide things from me,

315
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,785
which is why this is weird.

316
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,206
Can't you try to
pry some information out of her?

317
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,582
Find out what's going on.

318
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,086
Will you disapprove if he's not up to par?

319
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,422
I will if I have to.

320
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,383
Not Dad, but you?

321
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,678
I can't let my daughter
make the wrong choice.

322
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,015
In what way?

323
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,273
Why are you staring at me?

324
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,318
You're mostly open-minded, so this is new.

325
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,070
It's unlike you.

326
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,033
It's not like I'd actually say anything.

327
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm curious, that's all.

328
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,038
Precisely. I know
you're not that kind of person.

329
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,462
Wouldn't you get scolded first
once your mom finds out?

330
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,299
That I can easily take.

331
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,009
My dad's the problem.

332
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,803
He's too hot-tempered.

333
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,681
Does he get physical?

334
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,850
He doesn't.

335
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,644
But who knows...

336
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,022
if he'll make history.

337
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
Do you think he could beat up the guy?

338
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,863
You're worried about yourself
and not Ji-ho, right?

339
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,781
Look, that's just...

340
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,826
You're getting way ahead of yourself.

341
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,203
All right. Whatever you say.

342
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,256
Kiss me and you're dead.

343
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,973
Who else needs lunch?
Is five orders enough?

344
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,852
-We'll share if there's not enough.
-All right.

345
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,979
That'll be all. No drinks are needed.

346
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,816
Three steak sandwiches
and two bulgogi sandwiches.

347
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,276
And the salad. To go, right?

348
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,194
-Yes.
-Yes.

349
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,791
-Great. Thank you.
-You can wait over there.

350
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,127
One Hawaiian seafood
and one seafood classic, please.

351
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,338
The heart emoji
next to Gi-seok's name is gone.

352
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,301
Here.

353
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,220
What's this?

354
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,848
Eun-u gave it to me.

355
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,642
Eun-u? Who's that?

356
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,811
Ji-ho's son?

357
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,398
Hey, then those dinosaur books...

358
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,443
That's right. I'm getting sneaky.

359
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,446
Your nephew? Oh, please.

360
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,217
-Hello?
-It's been a long time.

361
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,845
Oh, hello.

362
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,806
Were you surprised
to hear from me out of the blue?

363
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,100
I knew you'd get in touch with me.

364
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,730
My show is about to begin,
so I can't talk for long.

365
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,022
Anything I can do for you?

366
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:54,941
Well...

367
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,778
I'd rather not talk about it
over the phone.

368
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,114
I'd like to talk in person.

369
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,075
Well, I can meet you anytime.

370
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,204
-I have plans, so I should get going.
-Okay, bye.

371
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,166
Ms. Wang! I'm off.

372
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,418
-Okay, bye.
-See you tomorrow!

373
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,544
-All right.
-Bye.

374
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,299
ONLINE BANKING
FOR EVERY FINANCIAL MATTER

375
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,050
ENTER YOUR PASSWORD

376
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,261
Are you lending money to someone?

377
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,512
No, it's for my father.

378
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,723
What for?

379
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,892
I stole something from him.

380
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,187
What did you steal for 300,000 won?

381
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,688
Some booze.

382
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,732
Didn't you say he only drinks soju?

383
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,444
-To make sure he doesn't tell Mom.
-I'm not following at all.

384
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,906
Anyway, never lend money to anyone
even if it's a close friend.

385
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,115
When did I?

386
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:48,578
I know you've lent people money
and never got paid back on many occasions.

387
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,872
That's why I can't stand
any of your friends...

388
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,041
WOORI PHARMACY

389
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,375
Hi.

390
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,252
Oh, be careful.

391
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,257
I mean...

392
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,136
it's not like I set you up with Jeong-in
behind his back.

393
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,389
Why is he always so mean to me these days?

394
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,808
It pisses me off.

395
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,310
Try to be understanding.

396
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,316
So, are you really seeing her now?

397
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,322
Dude.

398
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,908
You're starting to scare me.

399
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,035
Are you really my buddy, Ji-ho?

400
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,414
Just think of it as you doing me a favor.

401
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,041
Tolerate him, please.

402
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,878
Yes, I get it.

403
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,632
But he makes it obvious
even in front of other people at work.

404
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,883
That's what's killing me.

405
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,349
It'll get more stressful.

406
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,018
Just try to be patient with him.

407
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,771
Jeez, what is this?
The arrogance of the winner?

408
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,107
Why are you worried about him?

409
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,652
I'm not worried.
I just understand how he must be feeling.

410
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,908
Is this a "Love your enemies"
kind of thing?

411
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:13,246
You see, he may perceive this

412
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,499
as you gloating.

413
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,210
That is out of my control.

414
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,215
You're a weirdo.

415
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,556
-I'm okay.
-Gosh, eat slowly.

416
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,728
Thanks for this.

417
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,733
Your cappuccino is ready!

418
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,610
Jeong-in does that too.

419
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,778
What?

420
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,864
You sound just like her.

421
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,492
We're sisters, so I'm sure we're similar.

422
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,494
Right.

423
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,915
You wanted to see me
because of Si-hoon, right?

424
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
Here's what you ordered.

425
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,003
I know about the loan.

426
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,965
Oh, that...

427
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,928
There's nothing I can do to help him,

428
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,888
and I've explained that to him.

429
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,601
Then why did you want to see me?

430
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,647
Because of Jeong-in?

431
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,732
Yes.

432
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,820
I don't know the details,

433
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,073
but I can gather what's going on.

434
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,699
But I think...

435
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,243
you're talking to the wrong person.

436
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,538
Jeong-in and I are very close...

437
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,792
but I don't like to stick my nose
into her personal life.

438
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,877
She wouldn't want that either.

439
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,506
It's one of the things
that Jeong-in is sensitive about.

440
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,758
So I understand.

441
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,930
But about what's going on...

442
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,434
It's not something I can let slide.

443
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,898
I know that she trusts you
and respects your opinion the most,

444
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,943
so I wanted to talk to you
about it in person.

445
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,697
Your iced Americano is ready.

446
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,956
Things between us...

447
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,334
are very rocky at the moment.

448
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,803
Do you believe...

449
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,098
this can be remedied?

450
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,061
Does it seem impossible?

451
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,107
What is it that you want to say?

452
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,861
Are you here to ask me
to help you mend your relationship?

453
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,157
Shouldn't you figure it out on your own?

454
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,413
Gosh, this is...

455
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,718
She has feelings for someone.

456
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,428
Another guy.

457
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,641
You're not asking me
to stop that, are you?

458
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,686
You knew about it?

459
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,027
It must be hurtful for you.

460
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:32,987
But you see...

461
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,575
I don't think anything will change,
even if I get involved.

462
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,162
And as her sister...

463
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,166
I should respect her decision.

464
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,504
What if he's a single father?

465
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,890
The man she's seeing has a son.

466
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,727
He's a single dad.

467
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,113
Mending our relationship comes second.

468
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,783
We must dissuade her
from getting involved with him.

469
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,162
She's not in her right mind.
I can't let her be.

470
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,087
SEO-IN

471
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,260
I met Gi-seok earlier today.
Can you come over now?

472
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,886
I sure did.

473
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,804
-Really?
-Yes.

474
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,806
I have to go see Seo-in now.

475
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,099
-Why?
-Enjoy the food.

476
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,059
See you.

477
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,523
I don't know.

478
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,316
At first,
the idea itself was inconceivable.

479
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,446
Regardless of whether
I break up with Gi-seok or not...

480
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,243
I didn't even dream of doing anything
with him.

481
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,288
But...

482
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,541
I realized...

483
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,711
that I kept looking for him.

484
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,132
Even though he kept...

485
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,010
pushing me away...

486
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,391
I clung to him... more.

487
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,022
Yes, you can develop feelings for him.

488
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,692
I understand that part, but...

489
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,319
It's Eun-u.

490
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,571
That's his son's name.

491
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:46,949
I see.

492
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,662
I may be feeling this way...

493
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,791
because I like him.

494
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,254
Or perhaps, it's just because of
my natural affinity with kids.

495
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,300
I don't know the answer yet.

496
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,848
Whatever it is...

497
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:16,479
I adore...

498
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,981
Eun-u.

499
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,404
I don't even know
when I began feeling this way.

500
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,116
I found myself cherishing him.

501
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,706
I'm sorry.

502
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,461
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner...

503
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,842
and for worrying you like this too.

504
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,762
I'm really sorry for everything.

505
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,104
Seo-in.

506
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,403
I'll sort everything out.

507
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,738
Okay?

508
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,743
I'm not upset.

509
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,288
I'm ashamed.

510
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,629
I'm pregnant.

511
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,760
I was going to give it up.

512
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,221
It's too cruel, you know.

513
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,306
And...

514
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,977
I even thought of...

515
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,732
that innocent baby as a punishment.

516
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,236
But how could you...

517
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,164
You will be...

518
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,583
a great mom.

519
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,836
You'll figure it all out.

520
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,339
You have to.

521
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,344
Okay.

522
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,473
Gosh.

523
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,538
This is my sister.

524
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,706
Oh, hello.

525
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,876
It's nice to meet you, Ji-ho.

526
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,838
Thank you. Likewise.

527
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,507
And...

528
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:51,967
I'm sorry.

529
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,430
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

530
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,142
Thank you.

531
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,938
By the way, why are you here?

532
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,148
Oh, I was just...

533
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,776
-Did you want to see this news anchor?
-Hey.

534
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,196
So, what do you think?

535
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:13,948
Is she prettier than me?

536
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,662
Come to think of it,
you've never said I'm pretty.

537
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,415
Really? Jeong-in is pretty.

538
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,751
I know. That's why I like her.

539
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,836
-You said you love me.
-Yes.

540
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,227
I actually regret
not telling Seo-in sooner.

541
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,063
I was so worried while waiting outside.

542
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,899
I told you not to wait for me.

543
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,279
It was because of me,
so it'd be irresponsible to take off.

544
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,657
I must say, you're such a smooth talker.

545
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,243
I'll even get smacked on your behalf.

546
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,996
Who'd dare to smack me?
Do you think I'd hold myself back?

547
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,083
Don't judge a book by its cover.
I'm very strong.

548
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,044
Okay, I'll be careful.

549
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,757
I mean it though.

550
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,094
I won't let you get hurt.

551
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,683
I'm touched by just hearing that...

552
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,728
so don't try to handle everything alone.

553
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,188
And how can I just sit back and watch?

554
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,899
You told me not to be a loser.

555
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,569
So, you do take my advice.

556
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,405
I don't want to get smacked.

557
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,073
Behave yourself, Ji-ho.

558
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,909
I will, Jeong-in.

559
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,747
So?

560
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,832
Am I pretty or not?

561
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,169
It's getting late. Let's go.

562
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,087
Look at you.

563
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,966
-And you still expect a compliment?
-What? Come on.

564
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,219
So, I'm not pretty?
You don't think I'm pretty?

565
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,429
We should get going.

566
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,307
You're not going to say it? Fine.

567
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,728
I didn't think Gi-seok
would stoop this low.

568
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,564
He's as much of a loser as Si-hoon is.

569
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,816
Why didn't he just tell on Mom or Dad?

570
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,611
I should leave 30 minutes early tomorrow
for the meeting.

571
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,987
You shouldn't let it slide.

572
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,989
Tell him to stop or something.

573
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,576
That's what he wants.

574
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,709
I used to get all angry
and meet him in person,

575
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,796
then we'd end up getting back together.

576
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,881
He thinks it'll happen again this time.

577
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,260
I bet he's in disbelief now
because he didn't get a call from me.

578
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,640
Whether it's his strategy or not,
will you just let it slide?

579
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,476
Both Seo-in...

580
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,979
and Ji-ho think
I shouldn't do anything to provoke him.

581
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,274
-So what? Wait until he gives up?
-He won't give up that easily.

582
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,529
Will he seek out both Mom and Dad?

583
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,907
I should tell Mom and Dad
before it gets to that.

584
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,867
Jeong-in.

585
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,245
You might get killed.

586
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,498
I'm prepared for the worst-case scenario.

587
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,057
-Will you be all right?
-Yes.

588
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,476
Go back inside.

589
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,188
-Hey, I'll hail a taxi for you.
-No, don't worry.

590
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,815
-Let me do it.
-It's okay.

591
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,817
I'm off. Bye.

592
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,885
-Isn't she a news anchor?
-Yes, sir. She is.

593
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,225
What is this place? Is it a bar?

594
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,105
Yes, sir.
It's known as a hangout for musicians.

595
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,327
PRINCIPAL LEE TAE-HAK

596
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,165
-Hello?
-Let's grab lunch together somewhere.

597
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,755
-Oh, well...
-Do you have other plans?

598
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,927
-Yes, I'm sorry.
-Don't be. All right, then.

599
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,730
-Take it before meals.
-Okay, have a nice day.

600
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,524
-You too. Bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

601
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,529
I've been on my feet all day.

602
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,364
You must be tired.

603
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,699
I don't know why,
but we are busier these days.

604
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,285
Now that Ji-ho is on a path to happiness,

605
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,204
I have to do more work.

606
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,122
What kind of logic is that?

607
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,458
-Send this off with our order.
-Got it.

608
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,794
I'm just happy for you.

609
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,463
Hey, no one else cares about you
as much as I do.

610
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,800
That's true. Every time
we have lunch together, she says,

611
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,802
"Ji-ho deserves to be happy.

612
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:30,013
I hope only good things await him."
She's always so worried about you.

613
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,515
You're all talk.

614
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,268
So, when's Jeong-in coming?

615
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:35,769
Why?

616
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,062
I want to see her.

617
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,273
Maybe another day.

618
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,316
Come on! Tell her to come today.

619
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,946
Because of what you told her,
she thinks I have many secrets.

620
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,407
You are the worst guy, indeed.

621
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,659
-Why?
-I can go on and on.

622
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,996
You're such a dutiful son.
From the money issue to your exes--

623
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,497
Hye-jeong, please.

624
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,625
-So, when can I see her?
-What?

625
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,811
Hey, Ji-ho wants me to meet
the pharmacist he works with.

626
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,898
You're getting to know
the people around him.

627
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,065
You should come too.

628
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,817
Me? Why?

629
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,236
He's bringing a supporter.

630
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,946
Are you going to ditch me?

631
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,866
Hey, I never said I'm in support of this.

632
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,578
I have to persuade my parents.
Must you add to that stress?

633
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,997
Why are you leaving out Ji-ho's parents?

634
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,458
There's no guarantee
that they'll like you.

635
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:44,046
Well, they at least won't treat you as if
you don't exist, unlike Gi-seok's parents.

636
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,633
The way they treated me
made me so miserable.

637
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,636
Ji-ho will have it a lot tougher, right?

638
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,057
Don't worry about that yet.
It'll only wear you out.

639
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,851
So you'll help me, right?

640
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,604
I'm going to help Ha-rin first.

641
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:03,941
Hey, are you really going to be like this?

642
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,818
I can do this by myself.

643
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,363
Then you shouldn't have whined about it.

644
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,448
Yeong-ju was going to come down as well.

645
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,203
I've never worked with a book club before,

646
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,330
and I'm extra nervous
because they're kids.

647
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,918
I heard kids can actually tell
whether you're a good person or not.

648
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,381
In my sister's experience
of raising her own kids,

649
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,801
she's learned that children are indeed
our greatest mirrors.

650
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,595
She said you can never fool kids.

651
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,014
They don't want to be hated,

652
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,558
so they don't say anything
even if they don't like you.

653
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,313
That means they can pretend
they like you when they don't.

654
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,523
Yes, of course.

655
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,153
Why do you suddenly look all serious?

656
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,364
What? It's nothing.

657
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,330
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

658
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:08,171
Eun-u, it's too dusty here.

659
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,966
Take Grandpa's phone and go home.

660
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,511
-I'll follow you shortly.
-Okay.

661
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:21,643
Well, we have so many masks.
Why don't you use them?

662
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,103
You should use them.

663
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,356
Why is this stuck?

664
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,363
I only had a shot of it the other day.

665
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,325
Was the shot glass as big as a bowl?

666
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,579
What?

667
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,331
When did I drink this much?

668
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,168
Goodness, you kill me.

669
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,878
My goodness.

670
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,643
Best of luck.

671
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,032
Mr. Kwon, here.

672
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,368
-These were left out. Please go through--
-I heard you.

673
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,583
The team manager wants to review them
first thing tomorrow morning.

674
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,590
-Are you giving me orders now?
-No, I'm not.

675
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,844
I'm sorry.

676
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,364
Hey, Gi-seok.

677
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,658
Hi, can you talk now?

678
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,201
Yes, for a few minutes.

679
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,871
Okay. I was wondering
what your schedule is like for today.

680
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,581
Why do you ask?

681
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,084
I haven't seen you in a while,

682
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:13,130
and I need to talk to you about
the loan as well.

683
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,715
Well, today is...

684
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,846
If you're busy,
we can meet up another day.

685
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,723
Is it because of Jeong-in?

686
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,143
Sorry?

687
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,229
I met Father. He seemed worried about you.

688
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,440
About what?

689
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,318
About your marriage, of course.

690
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,784
I probably should talk to him soon.

691
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:52,919
Hello.

692
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,223
-You had a late lunch today.
-Yes.

693
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,934
Oh, Mr. Kwon
already took care of your bill.

694
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,227
Sorry?

695
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,232
He left just after you arrived.

696
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,610
My goodness.

697
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,325
Oh, boy.

698
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,118
CHIEF DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

699
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,876
-Are you here to see me?
-Oh!

700
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,088
Yes, I heard you paid for my lunch.

701
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,343
Well, I saw you came alone
when you told me you had plans.

702
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,720
I thought you were upset with me
about something

703
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,388
and left quietly.

704
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:55,357
What happened was,
my plans suddenly got canceled.

705
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:00,070
You should've called me
even if it happened at the last minute.

706
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:10,455
I think your daughter
may be seeing someone else.

707
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,459
I just had an inkling,
but I suppose it's actually true.

708
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,587
No, I never heard anything about it.

709
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,675
Who told you such nonsense?

710
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,009
So you don't know about it?

711
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,262
What's there to know about?

712
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:30,308
You're saying this because you don't know
what my daughter is like.

713
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,644
She's such an upright person,

714
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,438
so she'd never do such a thing.

715
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,444
By the way, what exactly did you hear?

716
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,906
Just based on the circumstances.

717
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,494
Your daughter
doesn't want to marry Gi-seok.

718
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,745
Did you know?

719
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,833
Well, she's just saying that.

720
00:54:57,168 --> 00:55:00,714
I mean, many young people these days
don't believe in marriage.

721
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:03,216
I think that's why she said that to you.

722
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:06,261
I'm sure Gi-seok doesn't love
everything about it either.

723
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,349
Things aren't like
how they used to be back in our day.

724
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,519
You always emphasize that yourself.
My goodness.

725
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:22,569
So you're sure
she's not seeing someone else?

726
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,446
Yes, I'm sure.

727
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,907
I'm telling you.
She'd never do such a thing.

728
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,619
You look like you're in a job interview.

729
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,079
No, I'm totally comfortable.

730
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,999
-Ji-ho is...
-What? What are you going to say?

731
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,960
I haven't even said anything yet.

732
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,503
What about him?

733
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,965
His specialty is doing things
that women hate.

734
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:48,136
I mean, he can lend money to his friends.

735
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:50,263
They're his friends, so I get it.

736
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,516
The issue is, he doesn't bother
getting the money back.

737
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,479
-That would drive me nuts.
-Yeong-ju, hear me out.

738
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,563
What else?

739
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,732
Be it a pal, a classmate,
or a friend's friend.

740
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,193
He pays for everything
whenever he hangs with anyone.

741
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,488
-Not all the time.
-Be quiet.

742
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,908
And he's like Santa Claus
to all the ladies.

743
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,410
What are you talking about?

744
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,247
You buy them birthday and Christmas gifts
whenever they bring it up.

745
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,124
Goodness. Just call it quits, Jeong-in.

746
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,294
No, she's exaggerating it
because she's drunk now.

747
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,296
Shall I call them, then?

748
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,839
What? Call who?

749
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,508
You're not helping me at all here.

750
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,763
Jeong-in, you know
what I'm trying to tell you, right?

751
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,599
Yes, I sure do. Don't worry.

752
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,520
Disciplining him will be a piece of cake.

753
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,231
I like you.

754
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,788
-Are you going somewhere?
-I want some fresh air.

755
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,374
What's wrong?
Is your stomach upset?

756
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,751
-Shall I come with you?
-No, it's okay.

757
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,899
Hello!

758
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:46,212
-Oh, no. Let me pour you one.
-Okay.

759
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,507
Thank you.

760
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,427
So? Is the talk about marriage...

761
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:54,846
going well?

762
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,433
Well, so-so.

763
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,730
How come you guys never seem passionate?

764
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:12,906
By the way, how much money do you need?

765
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,703
Well, it's tricky to get approved
for a loan,

766
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,873
but I figured I could help you personally.

767
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,130
Here is what you ordered.

768
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,303
You have some money...

769
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,932
No, it's not that.

770
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,394
I just think
I may be able to help you out a little.

771
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,313
-Eat this.
-Thank you.

772
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,610
-The food is good here. Eat up.
-Okay.

773
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,248
Did I offend you by any chance?

774
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:13,341
I don't need any money.
Or that loan.

775
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,348
I see. Then are you all ready now?

776
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,977
My wife will divorce me
if I take out a loan.

777
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:34,070
When you're married,
you have to obey your wife.

778
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,573
Thanks for your help anyway.

779
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,870
I won't bug you anymore.

780
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,456
Gosh, don't say that.

781
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,755
She's even done something worse.

782
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,882
-You're so chatty today.
-Be quiet.

783
00:59:56,426 --> 01:00:00,263
When my body temperature was hovering
at 40 degrees because of a cold,

784
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:03,016
Jeong-in watched a movie on her laptop

785
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,935
and drank beer right next to me

786
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,562
without even batting an eye.

787
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,274
Jeez, that is simply unacceptable.

788
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,526
I guess Jeong-in isn't
the affectionate type.

789
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,945
-Exactly!
-She's not affectionate. She sure isn't.

790
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,698
So what? You don't like me now?

791
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,784
-I like you despite that.
-Even if I'm not affectionate?

792
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,369
It's fine cos I'm affectionate.

793
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,423
The door is opening.

794
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:02,885
Bye.

795
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,599
The door is closing.

796
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,356
Going up.

797
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:17,608
The door is closing.

798
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,700
See? I told you.

799
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,668
Gi-seok is meeting my dad?

800
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,670
Ji-ho, I'll handle this.

801
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,006
Until when do I have to hide behind you?

802
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,884
I don't plan to let Gi-seok
have his way indefinitely.

803
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,011
Being understanding and patient
isn't working.

804
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,763
His goal is to take me down.

805
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:31,974
Neither Gi-seok nor your father
will back down easily.

806
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,267
Gi-seok won't stay quiet.

807
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:36,979
I think you should decide
on the date for us.

808
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:39,106
As they say,
"Strike while the iron is hot."

809
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,567
Let's nail down a date
for their wedding.

810
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,361
It looks like you already know.

811
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,613
Don't jump to your own conclusions though.

812
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,990
I'll never avoid running into Ji-ho.

813
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,367
You must know what it means.

814
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,036
Let's go somewhere fun with Eun-u.

815
01:03:53,037 --> 01:03:56,040
I see that you're touched again.
You're seriously too easy.

816
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,084
Thank you, God.

817
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,461
I'm in love.

818
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,758
