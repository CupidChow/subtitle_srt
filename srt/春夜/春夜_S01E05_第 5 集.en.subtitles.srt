1
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,892
I won't expect anything from you,

2
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,060
EPISODE 5

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,020
...so just let me see you.

4
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,482
I promise I won't get caught.

5
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,153
No, that's not right.

6
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,947
I understand how you feel, but--

7
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,282
I'm talking about you.

8
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,828
I won't get caught by you.

9
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,670
I told you.

10
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,924
I went there because I wanted to see you.

11
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,054
I went there impulsively
because I wanted to see you,

12
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,058
but the moment I saw Gi-seok...

13
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,523
I felt as if someone was telling me
that I was doing what I shouldn't do.

14
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,442
So?

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,779
You're not going to get caught by me

16
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
and watch me secretly?

17
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,576
If you allow me to do so.

18
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,288
-If you say that I can't--
-Of course you can't.

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,582
I can't allow that.

20
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,302
Right. From your perspective,
it is complete nonsense.

21
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,679
What is my perspective?

22
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,684
If you know
that someone is watching you secretly--

23
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,768
Who cares?

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,771
You said you won't get caught.

25
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,151
Then I wouldn't be aware of it,
so it doesn't matter.

26
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,781
The problem is me.

27
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,576
Yes.

28
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,246
You can see me whenever you want.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,751
But what should I do, then?

30
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,512
Shall I also get your permission
to peep at you secretly?

31
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,185
Why are you only thinking about yourself?

32
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,103
Is your satisfaction all that matters?

33
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,231
Don't you care about how I'd feel?

34
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,569
Were you always this selfish?

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,992
Shall I really let myself be selfish?

36
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
No.

37
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,654
MY GIRL

38
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,178
We should end this here.

39
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,100
I thought about it on our way here.

40
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,520
If we keep this up,

41
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,315
you'll lose many things
because of your fleeting emotions.

42
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,110
And a lot more pain will follow.

43
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,198
I'm not saying this
to look like a good person.

44
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,616
I was being selfish.

45
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,999
To be more honest with you,

46
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,340
I was wallowing in emotions
that I thought I'd never feel again.

47
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,676
I was being reckless.

48
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,971
I keep getting lame, pathetic thoughts.

49
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,102
If this continues,
I'll turn into a total loser.

50
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,564
In any case,

51
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,567
what am I supposed to do, then?

52
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,529
I don't know. This is killing me.

53
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,908
Do you actually think I'll buy that lie?

54
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,123
Just act like you believe me.

55
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,584
I'm begging you.

56
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
Help me.

57
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,574
They'll get married eventually, you know.

58
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,201
They might waste another year
at this rate,

59
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,413
so all I'm saying is
we should probably pressure them a little.

60
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,584
That's not how I'd describe it.

61
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,754
It's more like, "I'm the only adult
in this family, so you all must obey me."

62
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,090
Don't you know how Jeong-in is?

63
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,095
Because she was uncomfortable
that you taught at her school,

64
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,472
she went on a hunger strike

65
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,474
and managed to transfer to another school.

66
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,684
When she feels
she's right about something,

67
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,103
she has to see it through no matter what.

68
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,815
I mean, why do you think
Seo-in made such an alarming comment?

69
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,820
Do something if you think
you understand the girls that well.

70
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,364
You're doing nothing
like a mere spectator.

71
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,617
That's why the girls think
that I'm overbearing.

72
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,952
You are overbearing though.

73
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,539
So what? Just see what happens?

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,085
I'm sure Jeong-in has a plan.

75
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,087
She has a strong sense of responsibility.

76
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:39,477
I'll meet up with her and try to find out
what's going on.

77
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,115
I'm off. I'll get going, then.

78
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,578
Hello.

79
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,498
-Mom.
-Hey, wait up!

80
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,875
My gosh. It's been a while, Jeong-in.

81
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,001
Yes, hello.

82
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,756
-We'll get going, then.
-All right.

83
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,509
-See you next time.
-Okay, take care.

84
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,593
Bye.

85
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,263
Do you want to go for lunch?

86
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,140
Why would I have lunch with you?

87
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,060
Mom.

88
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,064
Just a second.

89
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,501
-Show me what you did today.
-Gosh.

90
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,504
Mom, please.

91
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,341
Do you respect me as your mom?

92
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,136
How could you keep it even from me?

93
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,054
If I didn't see Jae-in that day,

94
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,599
you'd still be hiding it.

95
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,892
No, I wouldn't.

96
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,353
First off,
I was surprised to see her back.

97
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,314
And I've been all over the place.

98
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,399
With what?

99
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,318
You have the same job.

100
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,112
And you threatened us not to bring up
the topic of marriage.

101
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,530
What's been keeping you busy?

102
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,866
Jeez, when did I threaten you?

103
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,201
You also agree that Dad was out of line.

104
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,662
Look at you getting all riled up
with no remorse.

105
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm sorry.

106
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,420
As for the thing with Jae-in,
I'll talk to Dad about it.

107
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,882
She's not the only problem.

108
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,260
Seo-in came over the other day
and threw a fit.

109
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,680
She did? What did she say?

110
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,225
What do you mean?

111
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,645
Do you know something that I don't?

112
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,358
No, it's just that it's out of character
for Seo-in to do such a thing.

113
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,818
Well...

114
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,821
I don't know what's gotten into Si-hoon,
but he also stopped by

115
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,492
and went on about how we should
encourage you to get married soon.

116
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,535
And what happened?

117
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,788
What do you think?

118
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,209
Seo-in told your dad
not to make you end up like her.

119
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,053
-Mom.
-Yes?

120
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,391
What kind of guy should I marry?

121
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,602
What about Gi-seok?

122
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,854
You don't think it'll work out?

123
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,403
Arguing and fighting
can make you get more attached.

124
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,738
It's not easy to sever such a bond.

125
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,992
I didn't say we're breaking up.

126
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,878
You can't control what your heart wants.

127
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,466
This has been done too many times.

128
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,886
-What about this one? It's simple.
-It looks like a copy of the other one.

129
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,723
-Gosh, I'm getting a headache.
-Maybe this...

130
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,981
Forget a special theme.

131
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,735
For example,
"Book of the Year on My Bookshelf."

132
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,194
How about such an easy one?

133
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,405
Yes, I like how simple it is.
What do you think?

134
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,533
"Unexpectedly You"?

135
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,035
What?

136
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,163
I mean...

137
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,623
Who are you referring to?

138
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,544
Well, no one specific.

139
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,298
It's still the seasonal theme,
but I added another element.

140
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,178
We usually get the same participants
for this book review event, you know.

141
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,223
But when people see the phrase,
"Unexpectedly You,"

142
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,477
even those who have never done it
might think,

143
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,645
"Can someone like me
participate in it too?"

144
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,398
I think it can be motivating.

145
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,777
Not a good idea, right?

146
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,571
Then let's scratch this off the list.

147
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,989
I love that idea.

148
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,701
Finally, we have our theme!

149
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,204
It's awesome.

150
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,207
-Jeong-in, you rock.
-Does it sound okay?

151
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,875
-Yes.
-It's amazing.

152
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,418
It's pretty good.

153
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,090
And just one more box
of amlodipine, please.

154
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,345
Oh, internal medicine doctors
won't prescribe it anymore,

155
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,096
so you can take it out of our order.

156
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,349
Yes.

157
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,476
Okay, thank you.

158
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,738
You know it's a rare opportunity.

159
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,534
Yes, I'm fully aware.

160
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,911
And that's why I thought long and hard.

161
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,288
Then how could your answer be no?

162
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,290
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,084
I don't need your apology.

164
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,045
Don't say you can't handle the pressure

165
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,923
because neither the higher-ups
nor I will buy such an excuse.

166
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,301
What is it? You must have another reason.

167
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,392
I bet you got a job offer.

168
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,769
No, that's not the case at all.

169
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,396
That's what everyone says.

170
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,357
Everyone acts all surprised like that
and ends up quitting.

171
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,902
If that's what you want to believe,
then go ahead.

172
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,240
If that's not the reason,
then why are you being like this?

173
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,997
I have nothing to say to you. I'm sorry.

174
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,375
You're driving me nuts.

175
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,670
The entire building consists of clinics,

176
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,297
so you'll get new patients easily.

177
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,507
Transportation-wise,
a subway station is nearby.

178
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,595
This clinic's owner wouldn't be moving out
if he didn't have health issues.

179
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,890
Does Dr. Sin own all the equipment
and machines here?

180
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,184
Of course. We set everything up for him,
including the decor.

181
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,395
So when can I take it?

182
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,648
You'll actually take it?

183
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,282
Call me right after you speak
with the building owner.

184
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,575
I'll sign the lease.

185
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,744
But this building is new,

186
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,872
so the deposit and rent are
on the higher side. Have I mentioned it?

187
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,582
That doesn't matter at all.

188
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,418
I just want a lot of discount
on the equipment and machines.

189
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,422
Sounds good. I've been doing business
with him for years, so it'll go well.

190
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,594
Then when can you have
the fees and deposit ready?

191
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,596
First, do your best with the negotiation.

192
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,932
Okay, I will.

193
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,270
Do you think I'm biting this
when I can't even afford it?

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,606
-No, that's not what I meant. I was just--
-Then?

195
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,275
-See what you can do.
-All right, I will.

196
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,363
-Thank you.
-Get going.

197
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,073
-Okay, I'll be in touch.
-All right.

198
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,206
Jeez, everyone is getting on my nerves.

199
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,260
Did you see Si-hoon recently?

200
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,930
Yes, we met up.

201
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,892
He said he needs to take out a loan.

202
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,686
He wants to expand his clinic.

203
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,567
He said we should all hang out.

204
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,904
When would be good?

205
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,864
Forget it.

206
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,617
Forget what?

207
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,453
Why hang out with him?

208
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,623
Give him some excuse about the loan
and don't get involved.

209
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,294
What is your reason?

210
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,548
Just because.

211
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,591
Why get involved?

212
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,345
He said he'll actively support
our plan to get married.

213
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,268
What's with that stare?

214
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,522
You really don't want to get married?

215
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,076
What do your parents say about it?

216
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,248
If that's sorted out,

217
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,167
you'll do it no matter what?

218
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,295
It's not something to be stubborn about.

219
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,255
You just don't want to lose, do you?

220
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,592
It's not like you let me win every time.

221
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,178
-Gi-seok.
-Forget it. Let's change the topic.

222
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,685
This is why I'm scared
to spend time with you these days.

223
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,146
We always end up arguing.

224
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,066
We keep fighting, and I end up
blaming it all on my bad temper.

225
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,777
I don't even know what to do anymore.

226
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,576
Get in.

227
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,711
What do you want?

228
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,464
What do you want me to do?

229
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,635
Nothing. Let's just go.

230
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,305
We won't get married, okay?

231
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,767
Isn't that what you want?

232
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,019
I won't bring it up. Happy now?

233
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,233
-For God's sake.
-Happy about what?

234
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,153
Do you think I'm an idiot

235
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,280
because I haven't brought it up?

236
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,742
Do you really think I wouldn't know

237
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,828
what your parents think about me?

238
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,832
Do you even know what it feels like

239
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,126
to be disapproved of?

240
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,088
How could I be excited,
fully knowing they don't like me?

241
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,215
Do you think I'm crazy or what?

242
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,800
Would you be excited?

243
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,263
-Jeong-in, that's--
-I haven't brought it up

244
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,141
because I knew I'd feel petty and lame.

245
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,061
Did you have to make me talk about it
and feel this miserable?

246
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,938
Why are you being so mean?

247
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,524
And you say you want to marry me?

248
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,526
Do you actually mean it?

249
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,112
Even just for a moment...

250
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,828
Have you ever felt sorry for me?

251
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,417
I never begged for your love

252
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,335
or pestered you to marry me.

253
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,463
I just hoped you'd understand how I feel.

254
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,382
Is it that hard?

255
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,010
Okay, I heard you.

256
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,847
-Now, I know.
-No.

257
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,350
You've known from the get-go.

258
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,062
You've been just neglecting it all along.

259
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,357
That's what hurts me the most.

260
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,292
-Hello.
-You're early.

261
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,049
Hello.

262
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,967
Do you have any medicine for hangovers?

263
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,346
Do you have any medicine for hangovers?

264
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,390
I need something strong.

265
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,975
Medicine for hangovers?

266
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,904
-Here you go.
-How much is it?

267
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,116
It's 4,000 won.

268
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,774
You're here.

269
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,235
This is for Eun-u.

270
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,986
They're my son's shoes and clothes.

271
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,531
They're barely worn,
and some of them are brand new.

272
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,949
Thank you.

273
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,371
Does the lady you're seeing
know about Eun-u?

274
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,998
I'm not seeing anyone.

275
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,584
You can't fool me.

276
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,336
I'm not fooling you.

277
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,674
It looked like you were seeing someone.
Is it over already?

278
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,678
I'm too good for her.

279
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,222
Get out. Get out of here.

280
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,348
Get out already.

281
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,267
Give me that.

282
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,523
Things like this.
"Budget for book purchases."

283
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,734
The students don't even have time
to read their textbooks.

284
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,531
And this too, "the reserve fund."
Take out things like this first.

285
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,786
Here.

286
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,545
The budget is almost finalized,

287
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,089
but I asked him to take out
a few more things.

288
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,430
You must be sad about retiring soon.

289
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:38,852
You're expected to retire so early.
You can definitely work a few more years.

290
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,942
Well,
I've worked in education my whole life.

291
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,738
But I can't say it's been rewarding.
I guess I have more regrets.

292
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,076
Does your second daughter
still work at the library?

293
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,497
Yes, what she does
is related to her major.

294
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,167
What is she good at?

295
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,086
-Pardon?
-Your daughter.

296
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,088
She must be good at something.

297
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,177
You see,

298
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,473
I know that she's my daughter,
but she's exceptional in many aspects.

299
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,352
She's smart,
and she has her own opinions about things.

300
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,771
-I mean, she is...
-Who does she take after?

301
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,316
Me, of course.

302
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,991
My wife is an upright person,

303
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,703
and Jeong-in is just like her.

304
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,205
That's good.

305
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,374
Yes.

306
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,335
Why are you asking about her though?

307
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,547
I was just curious as to what she's like.

308
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,384
Let's go for lunch.

309
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,680
Hey.

310
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,307
Are you not going to get married?

311
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,519
All you do is play sports
with your buddies.

312
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,146
Don't laugh.

313
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,859
Hey, that will make
even the most loyal woman run away.

314
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,698
Get your act together already.

315
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,996
I'll check the school schedule
and let you know.

316
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,248
All right.

317
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,090
It sounds like Gi-seok wants to use
the basketball court again this weekend.

318
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,135
Sure, I'll ask the admin office staff
about it.

319
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,680
Like I mentioned earlier,

320
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,433
Jeong-in always acts on her beliefs,

321
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,103
and she's incredibly
thoughtful and upright.

322
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:50,442
In other words,
she'll never betray anyone.

323
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,280
I know that she's your daughter,
but don't trust her too much.

324
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,283
How do you think I've come this far?

325
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,870
Even if it's my child,
I don't believe everything I hear.

326
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,081
The same goes for you.
I don't believe everything you're saying

327
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,292
about your daughter.

328
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,338
How dare I tell you
things that aren't true?

329
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,048
I'd never do that.

330
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,926
And she's my daughter, for God's sake.
That's just absurd.

331
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,471
Honestly,
I'd rather tell her not to get married.

332
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,389
I'd just never do something like that.

333
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,226
You see,
Jeong-in may not be the greatest catch,

334
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,187
but she doesn't lack anything.

335
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,523
All right. Eat your food.

336
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,246
I'm going to break up with Gi-seok.

337
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,250
Do you like the pharmacist that much?

338
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,961
Enough to end your relationship?

339
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,964
That's not the only reason.

340
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,550
I guess you won't believe me.

341
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,138
I do believe you as I wasn't
in support of your relationship.

342
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,894
But you're basically saying
you've decided to betray your boyfriend.

343
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,231
It's just bad timing, that's all.

344
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,650
Call it unfair, but that is betrayal.

345
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,862
Should I stay with him, then?

346
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,157
Gosh.

347
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,452
If you can be with him
when you have feelings for another man.

348
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,293
You can't break up with him.

349
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,548
I mean, it's not that you can't do it.
Your boyfriend won't let you go.

350
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,719
He can't swallow his pride,
so he won't do that.

351
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,721
Then what if you get caught?

352
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,016
What will happen if that proud man
finds out that another guy beat him?

353
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,893
Do you think he'll let you go?

354
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,314
And this guy isn't a stranger.
They went to college together.

355
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,275
He won't let you go, 100 percent.

356
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,574
How could my ex and I go cold turkey
after being together for six years?

357
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,868
Because there was no one else involved.

358
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,245
If there was a third party involved,

359
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,873
the war would be still going on.

360
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,462
Whatever, I don't care.
I can't be with him anymore.

361
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,341
Well, is the pharmacist
just waiting for you or what?

362
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,430
I can't

363
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,183
be with him either.

364
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,147
So you won't date him
even if you break up with your boyfriend?

365
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,650
I'm not sure

366
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,112
if I can stay by his side.

367
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,868
Hold on. I'm not following at all.

368
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,204
What?

369
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,000
I'll explain later.

370
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,504
Gosh, my hands are shaking.

371
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,966
-When can I pick them up?
-The day after tomorrow.

372
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,219
I'll drop them off on the way
to buy something.

373
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,470
-Thank you.
-No problem.

374
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,096
-Have a nice day.
-You too. Bye.

375
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,936
-What do you think?
-Sorry? About what?

376
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,313
The owner of the corner store.

377
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,650
That's her daughter who got divorced
about two years ago

378
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,361
and recently moved into her place
with a kid.

379
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,446
For Ji-ho?

380
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,533
Obviously. Why else would I bring it up?

381
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,618
Just leave him be.

382
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,120
-He'll find someone.
-Goodness.

383
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,790
He'll grow old all alone at this rate.

384
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,583
I don't want to be like this,

385
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:40,421
but I feel like Ji-ho is wasting
all his time.

386
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,511
What about Eun-u's mom?
No news from her whatsoever?

387
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,309
Do you want to see Ji-ho
going all crazy again?

388
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,895
Don't even bring her up.

389
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,985
My pumpkin is here.

390
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,028
Eun-u.

391
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,698
Hello. Hui-seong and Eun-u, right?

392
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,908
Hui-seong, your mom is here.

393
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,828
Let's bow. Bye.

394
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,830
Eun-u, your grandmother is here.

395
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,625
He ate all his food and had fun today.

396
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,961
Eun-u, let's bow.

397
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,963
-Bye.
-Bye.

398
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,758
-I'll see you tomorrow. Take care.
-Yes, thank you.

399
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,265
Did you have fun with your friends?

400
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,018
-Grandma.
-Yes?

401
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,646
-When is Daddy coming home?
-Why do you ask?

402
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,940
The library.

403
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,442
What?

404
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,153
What is at that library?

405
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,031
The library I took you to
is just like that place.

406
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,991
No, it's different.

407
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,702
You keep saying that,
but I don't know how it's different.

408
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,747
Was there something special
at the other library?

409
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,294
I can't take you there unless you tell me.

410
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:02,921
The teacher.

411
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,131
"Teacher"?

412
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,926
There was a teacher at the library?

413
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,469
Yes.

414
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,639
-Does Daddy know the teacher?
-Yes.

415
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,933
-How do they know each other?
-I don't know.

416
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,489
Those who suck always invest
in state-of-the-art equipment.

417
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,450
How many times must I tell you?
You're no match for me.

418
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,454
Hey, let's say you got better grades
and everything else.

419
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,873
But I'm better when it comes to dating.

420
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,958
Do you admit it?

421
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,168
You just hit on girls.
That's not called dating.

422
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,629
Hey, when you were dating that girl
back then...

423
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,884
I'm sorry.

424
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,933
Every time I eat this fried chicken,

425
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,978
I'm impressed by how good it is.

426
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:07,068
If I invested in something like this
years ago and made money off it,

427
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,821
I'd probably be cruising
around the world now.

428
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,574
How did you even land a job at a bank?

429
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,454
Hey, I'm everyone's favorite at work.

430
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,999
The manager is so fond of me as well.

431
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,667
Gi-seok.

432
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,131
Hey.

433
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,341
His girlfriend is so pretty.

434
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,594
He keeps saying they're getting married,

435
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,391
but I don't really think he wants to.

436
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,560
Why not?

437
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,187
They've been together for a long time,
you know.

438
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,564
That's probably why.

439
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,357
Are all long-term couples like that?

440
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,568
Then why are they still together?

441
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,361
And what does that make her?

442
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,489
Why are you getting mad at me?

443
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,502
About Yeong-jae...

444
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,047
He must be studying very hard.

445
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,090
I can't get a hold of him.

446
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,551
Leave him alone. Don't distract him.

447
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,219
So...

448
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,680
what's your plan?

449
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,850
I mean, you can't stay jobless forever.

450
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,563
Don't underestimate me.
There are so many things that I can do.

451
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,567
I can get many part-time jobs as well.

452
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,197
I'm good enough to teach piano.

453
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,950
Painting and French too.

454
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,703
And I can converse in English.

455
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,291
When did you learn all those things?

456
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,212
While you were failing
the civil service exam.

457
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,342
Hello, welcome to Language Excursion.
I'm Lee Seo-in.

458
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,054
The Ministry of Employment and Labor
recently released...

459
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,347
What do you think of her?

460
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,392
I'm a huge fan of hers.
She's very close to my ideal type.

461
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,146
Do you like girls who act all coy?

462
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,274
What? She's a news anchor.

463
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,610
-I know.
-Right.

464
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:15,029
"Coy" is not the right word at all.

465
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,241
I think she's sophisticated and elegant.

466
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,325
"Elegant"?

467
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,244
Elegant, my ass.

468
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,830
What's our total?

469
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,873
Why?

470
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,042
Hey.

471
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,253
Hey, who's texting you?

472
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,421
It's Hyeon-su.

473
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,799
He's out drinking with Ji-ho now.

474
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,177
Let's join them. Let's go!

475
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,012
It'll be awkward.

476
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,057
If they see us, they'll be like,
"Look at you two!"

477
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,475
They'll get the wrong idea.

478
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,727
Gosh, they won't. We're just friends.

479
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,106
And I'll just tell them
that I came to see the pharmacist.

480
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:54,819
Hey, are you actually interested in Ji-ho?

481
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,946
You keep asking about him.

482
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,407
Why? Are you jealous?

483
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,367
Hey.

484
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,744
Nonsense. Cut it out.

485
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,125
Well, don't pull funny pranks on Ji-ho.

486
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,794
Why not?

487
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,797
No reason.

488
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,592
-Is he seeing someone?
-Yes.

489
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:18,926
Well, no.

490
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,264
There's someone he likes. A lot, actually.

491
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,767
-Who is she?
-I don't know for sure yet,

492
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,895
but he's head over heels for her.

493
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,315
I've never seen him
fall for a girl this hard before.

494
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,278
Fine.

495
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,586
What's with the late dinner?

496
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,755
You haven't even finished.

497
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,716
I started eating after some contemplation,

498
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,509
but I don't really have an appetite.

499
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,970
By the way,
the pharmacist has a girlfriend.

500
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,391
He's head over heels for her.

501
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,730
He rarely dates,

502
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,192
but he's fallen hard this time.

503
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:25,076
Aren't you curious when
he's not the type to fall in love easily?

504
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,996
Why are you so interested in Ji-ho?

505
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,540
Ji-ho?

506
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:35,753
What else do I call him?

507
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,090
I can't say "that friend" like
you call that guy who's studying.

508
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,427
Also, watch your manners
with other people.

509
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
Don't be your silly self.

510
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,224
So I won't be an embarrassment
to your boyfriend?

511
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,229
If that's it, you've really gotten lamer.

512
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,898
I miss my fearless sister.

513
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,535
Si-hoon, I'll be honest with you.

514
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,246
Do you have some time right now?

515
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,165
There's a conference today,

516
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,167
so I only have patients in the afternoon.

517
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,673
Before the bank approves a loan,

518
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,842
it considers one's ability to pay it back.

519
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,762
If you declare less earnings

520
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,180
to pay a lower tax rate,

521
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,474
then the loan you can take out
decreases too.

522
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:34,020
-Also, you already took out two loans--
-You know,

523
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,105
I should just forget about it.

524
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,274
Someone said that a loan would be easier,

525
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,276
but I should use my own money

526
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,528
even if that means a higher tax rate.

527
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,738
Unbelievable.

528
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,407
I'm sorry about this.

529
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,201
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

530
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,912
It's all good.

531
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,667
Just so you know,
I mentioned your marriage with Jeong-in

532
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,462
to her father over dinner.

533
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,630
You need to step up your game.

534
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:03,382
What did he say?

535
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,469
You're still not marrying
his beautiful daughter,

536
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,720
so how could he be happy?

537
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,393
Don't be intimidated though.
It'll be all right.

538
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,854
Like I said,
I'm going to help you get the girl.

539
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,397
This is what families are for.

540
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,609
It's why grudges between family members
last long.

541
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:28,157
I'm not saying that I'm upset
about this loan approval though.

542
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,784
Don't get the wrong idea.

543
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,665
I'll see what I can do about the loan.

544
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,251
See? This is what I was worried about.

545
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,504
You shouldn't...

546
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,256
I'll look into it and get back to you.

547
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,342
Thank you.

548
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,971
Anyway, don't worry too much
about the loan.

549
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,306
Why would I?

550
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,183
It's not like I need it to get by.

551
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,518
Of course not.

552
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,978
When can Jeong-in and I meet you guys?

553
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,480
I already told her we should.

554
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,524
Not this week,

555
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,318
but I'm free any time
next week for dinner.

556
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,237
We can meet anywhere you want too.

557
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,030
Actually, come over to our house.

558
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,658
My wife's a public figure,
so she's comfortable at home.

559
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,034
-Right?
-Sure.

560
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,620
We're good either way, so we'll come over.

561
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,372
-Okay, I'll see you then.
-Sure.

562
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,623
-Bye.
-See you.

563
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,582
Have a good one.

564
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,472
I want to talk to you. Let's meet.

565
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,854
Damn it.

566
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,148
Come in.

567
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,817
Sir, we're calling it a day.

568
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,277
-Sure, good job today.
-Bye.

569
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,864
Hello.

570
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,409
-Would you like some tea?
-No, I'm good.

571
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,244
Instead, and I'm sorry to ask,

572
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,205
but can you buy me digestive medicine?

573
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,331
Sure.

574
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,501
-Hello.
-Hi.

575
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,430
Come in.

576
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,146
I put the house on the market.

577
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,940
What about your loan?

578
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,860
If you can't pay it back soon,

579
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,487
I'll put a rush on the sale.

580
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,073
That won't speed up the divorce, you know.

581
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,285
I'm going to sell it one way or another,

582
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,662
so hand over your legal seal.

583
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,043
Hand it over.

584
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,295
I don't have time to come back for it.

585
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,645
-I won't let you anymore.
-As if you have a choice.

586
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,605
Get back here.

587
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,399
See? What are you going to do?

588
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,528
-Are you all right?
-I...

589
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,154
Why haven't you left?

590
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,073
Thank you.

591
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,409
Tell me when it's ready. I'll see you.

592
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,078
Sure.

593
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,205
I'm leaving too. Let's head out together.

594
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,582
See you tomorrow.

595
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,753
I could help with the paperwork.

596
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,672
I can too as long as there are snacks.

597
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,340
Am I supposed to pay for all that?

598
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,259
You should go home already.

599
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,470
-All right.
-See you tomorrow.

600
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,729
I'm busy tonight.
I'll call you some other time.

601
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,064
Did you two agree to meet?

602
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,441
He's busy today.

603
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,364
The nasty war has begun.

604
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,367
I wish you luck.

605
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,255
PHARMACIST

606
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,861
The person you have reached...

607
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,918
The person you have reached...

608
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,115
Why are you ignoring my calls?

609
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,910
Is that what you're going to do now?

610
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,497
I didn't know you called.
It was on vibrate.

611
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,042
-Did something happen?
-Am I the only one having a hard time?

612
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,253
You're fine?

613
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,673
I guess you're totally fine.

614
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,677
You've got to be kidding me.

615
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,265
Am I a hassle to you?

616
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,644
Am I annoying?

617
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,771
Yes, you are.

618
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,234
You shouldn't have come here.

619
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,820
Why did you come?

620
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,823
We should just go back to being strangers.

621
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,617
What do you expect me to do
if you show up now--

622
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,443
Have you had dinner?

623
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,367
How about we get some?

624
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,915
What are you buying?

625
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,044
Why do I have to buy?

626
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,421
Of course.

627
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,299
I took a taxi to get here.

628
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,260
It's not like I told you to come.

629
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,722
Is that a no?

630
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,309
I'll just go home then.

631
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,687
You're selfish, you know that?

632
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,990
Are you closed?

633
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,200
Oh, it's you.

634
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,036
We already took our last order,

635
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,121
but you're a regular, so come on in.

636
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,873
Please take a seat.

637
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,833
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

638
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,753
Let's sit here.

639
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,726
Everything's good here,
but I especially like the spicy kalguksu.

640
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,687
Then I'll have that.

641
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,856
You should...

642
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,026
order sujebi so that I can have some.

643
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,904
That's what we'll have.

644
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,781
Sure.

645
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,410
One spicy kalguksu and sujebi.

646
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,245
Coming right up.

647
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,249
You said it's good, but I guess it's not.

648
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,335
We could've gone somewhere else.

649
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,631
Actually, I already had dinner.

650
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,928
You must be at ease

651
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,222
since you're not skipping any meals.

652
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,852
Did you want me to lose
my appetite over you?

653
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,856
It's not like you did.

654
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,322
Do you find it a burden

655
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,409
to even text or talk to me?

656
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,495
Greatly.

657
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,836
I shouldn't have gotten involved with you.

658
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,382
Do I seem like a loser?

659
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,012
You're worse.

660
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,110
What time does that coffee shop
we went to close?

661
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,489
Will it still be open
if we go there after dinner?

662
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,700
Aren't you going home?

663
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,620
Will you let me stay at your place
if I don't?

664
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,207
You're really something.

665
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,735
Am I really...

666
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,573
a burden to you?

667
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,328
You came to my house when I needed space,

668
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,746
so of course you're a burden.

669
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,502
If we just let ourselves
follow these feelings,

670
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,340
it'll be much harder for me to stop.

671
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,675
When that happens,

672
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,177
things will be

673
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,389
a lot harder for you.

674
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,602
So up until now,

675
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,689
you've been holding back for me.

676
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,484
That's why

677
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,487
I'm the idiot who couldn't even hug

678
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,657
the woman who cried
after stopping me from talking.

679
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,123
I'm the loser and you're the idiot.

680
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,758
I don't want anyone
to suffer because of me,

681
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,888
so please don't cry from now on.

682
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,143
I didn't cry because of you.

683
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,230
I know you don't like to lose,

684
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,317
but don't be stubborn with me.

685
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,403
It'll only be your loss.

686
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,492
So...

687
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,831
should I stick to doing nothing?

688
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,666
I said I'd be your friend.

689
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,878
Just like how you suggested,

690
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,838
we will...

691
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,342
grab a meal sometimes,

692
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,219
get coffee,

693
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,679
and ask each other how we're doing.

694
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,350
That much we can do.

695
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,690
I don't think I can anymore.

696
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,610
There's nothing I can do about that.

697
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,698
You sound so cold.

698
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,957
Can't you tell that
this is torture for me?

699
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,673
Why should I care?

700
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,677
Again, the mean Lee Jeong-in has surfaced.

701
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,763
You'll be seeing her often now.

702
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,058
I'm known to be a troublemaker.

703
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,566
Help me. I mean it.

704
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,403
I need your help, Jeong-in.

705
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,240
What if I can't?

706
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:46,950
Then force yourself to.

707
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,453
-No.
-You must.

708
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,042
You're...

709
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,422
too good for me.

710
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,103
What are you doing here?

711
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,898
What brings you by?

712
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,150
I had some business around here.

713
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,112
How come you two are together?

714
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:50,407
Us? We're friends now.

715
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,158
Oh, well...

716
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:55,995
What?

717
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,040
The door is closing.

718
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,715
Jeong-in!

719
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,678
Where do you go all the time
when you have nothing to do?

720
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,430
I'm busy despite being broke.

721
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,098
I saw the pharmacist out front.

722
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,434
Really?

723
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,602
He's probably still talking to his friend.

724
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:22,564
Were you with that guy
that's studying again?

725
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,023
I told you we're friends.

726
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,317
He dropped me off,

727
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,236
but I couldn't invite him in for coffee

728
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,029
because you might be against it.

729
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,991
I'm not that much of a snob, you know.

730
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,578
-Then I'm inviting him in.
-Hey, Jae-in!

731
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,080
Is she insane?

732
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,951
My sister invited you both in.

733
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,661
You should ride shotgun.

734
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,460
Come on. Let's go!

735
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,286
This way.

736
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,352
Come on in. Jeong-in!

737
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,478
Right.

738
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,148
You can wear the slippers.

739
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,819
Come on in.

740
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,404
-Come.
-Okay.

741
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,325
Come on in.

742
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,952
Come on in.

743
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,829
Come this way.

744
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,000
There you go.

745
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,627
Just think that
you're at a friend's house.

746
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,004
Thank you.

747
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:53,464
So what do we do now?

748
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,552
How should I know? They're your guests.

749
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,310
I boiled water for the tea.

750
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,062
So we're having tea? That's boring.

751
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,274
-Do we have any drinks left?
-I polished them off...

752
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,198
I should go out and buy some.

753
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,159
Let's go.

754
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,995
We'll go and buy the drinks then.

755
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,623
The convenience store
is quite far away and hard to find.

756
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,750
-Let's go. We won't be long.
-But...

757
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:31,502
Take my credit card then.

758
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,296
Seo-in gave me some money.

759
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,557
Hello?

760
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,434
What did you want to talk about?

761
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,606
You said you wanted to talk.

762
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:39,112
Let's break up.

763
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,073
It's the same for
my son and your daughter.

764
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,993
If we aren't careful,
it can end badly for both families.

765
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,870
Let's not make a rash decision.

766
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,706
I keep forgetting the old Ji-ho.

767
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:33,958
You were fun, smart, and competitive.

768
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,627
Can I see
that high-spirited version of you again?

769
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,130
I hear you're with someone,
must seem like the world.

770
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:40,131
Not for you anymore?

771
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,924
It'd be weird if it still was.

772
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,468
Then you could fall out of love.

773
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,136
I'd break up
with my girlfriend.

774
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,304
You'll just let her go?

775
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,806
I wouldn't get revenge,
but I guess I'd make a scene.

776
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,142
You must be objective
with those closer to you.

777
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:54,103
Blindly believing in them
will drive you off a cliff.

778
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,230
Could Gi-seok know about the pharmacist?

779
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,024
Don't think you're safe yet.

780
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,401
You're the woman he likes?
Do you like him too?

781
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,236
I like him. Gi-seok has no idea.

782
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,613
He'll figure it out today.

783
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,616
I got pissed because
it seemed like she had someone else.

784
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:08,618
I want to ask you something just in case.

785
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,998
