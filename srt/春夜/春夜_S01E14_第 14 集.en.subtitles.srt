1
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,264
Yes?

2
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,350
Your dad found out. You should run away.

3
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,070
I'll call you back.

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,541
EPISODE 14

5
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,427
I'll drop Eun-u off at home first.

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,554
No, I'll just get out here.

7
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,561
Are you really going to run away?

8
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,773
I need to save myself first.

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,401
Stay on my tail, okay?

10
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,497
Goodness.

11
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,265
I need to get going. I'll call you.

12
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,267
What?

13
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,394
Ji-ho...

14
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,637
My goodness.

15
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,264
Jeong-in?

16
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,932
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,977
Hey. What's with the photos?

18
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,770
How should I know?

19
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,898
It was from an anonymous sender.

20
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,484
-Where's Dad?
-Just leave.

21
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,237
Leave if you want to live.

22
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,906
I've already braced myself for this.

23
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,283
Jeong-in, wait! Gosh, what do I do?

24
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,829
Explain yourself.

25
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,251
Explain what's in these photos.

26
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,504
It's as you see.

27
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,007
He has a child.

28
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,054
-What the hell are you--
-I'm going to marry him.

29
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,807
Jeong-in, this isn't the time or place--

30
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,017
There's never a good time!

31
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,853
You're not in your right mind, are you?

32
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,648
You're telling us,
instead of asking for our permission?

33
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,858
How is this appropriate?

34
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,945
-We're your parents--
-If I ask,

35
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,571
will you approve?

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,032
You've totally lost it.

37
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,744
Jeong-in, you're being too one-sided.

38
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:08,206
You need to give us time
to think about this too.

39
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,583
I know that your answer is no.

40
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,586
What point is there in thinking
when you've made your decision?

41
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,546
I'm glad you said that.

42
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,841
The fact that you know we'd disapprove

43
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,595
means you know
just how absurd this idea is!

44
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,723
You're right. It's absurd.

45
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,519
I didn't think I'd be like this either.

46
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,815
Sometimes, I even catch myself in a daze.

47
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,443
I think to myself,
"How did this even happen?"

48
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,363
But you know what?

49
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,699
I've never once

50
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,034
regretted this.

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,954
It's why I proposed to him first.

52
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,047
-Bring him home.
-No.

53
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,093
Why not? You said you'll marry him.

54
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,763
I know you're planning to
humiliate him and drive him away.

55
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,515
So lash out at me.

56
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
I'll gladly take the beating,

57
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
but I won't bring him over.

58
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,997
-Hello?
-It's Jae-in.

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,791
My mom isn't picking up,
so I have no idea what is going on.

60
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,668
I'm on my way there though.

61
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,629
I'm outside the house.

62
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,135
Don't tell me you're planning to go in.
Don't you dare. My dad will kill her.

63
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,138
You don't

64
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,348
have to date Gi-seok.

65
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,020
Fine.

66
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,148
I'll give up the job at the foundation
after I retire.

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,359
What?

68
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,780
I'll give up what I want as well.

69
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,866
I'm sorry,

70
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,993
but I can't give him up.

71
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,704
Jeong-in.

72
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:16,084
You're only thinking about yourself.
Don't be stubborn about this.

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,003
Also, you should
take some time to think it over.

74
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,379
Think about what?

75
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,131
This isn't happening.

76
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,383
The possibility of it happening is zero!

77
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,262
Honey, please!
We can give her our opinions,

78
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,223
but the choice is hers.

79
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,766
Why do parents exist?

80
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,519
We're not supposed to
just watch from the sidelines.

81
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,813
We shouldn't boss them around either.

82
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,897
Stop it.

83
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,983
I know I'm hurting you two.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,569
I'm really sorry.

85
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,368
I don't want to hurt you,

86
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,330
and I'm truly sorry.

87
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,499
But I...

88
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,835
I can't control my feelings.

89
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,672
That's because even though you act tough,
you're too soft inside.

90
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,049
You can put an end to this,

91
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,136
but you're hesitating
because you're worried about others.

92
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,054
What's so hard about this?

93
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,306
-Just suck it up and--
-Don't!

94
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:38,207
You've been fidgeting with your phone
for a while now.

95
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,417
Are you waiting for a call?

96
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,545
No.

97
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,009
You're drinking faster than usual too.

98
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,510
Something's up, right?

99
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,598
You're the one with news.

100
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,767
Tell me. How does it feel to be a father?

101
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,771
You just completely changed the subject.

102
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,738
Well, I guess it hasn't sunk in yet.

103
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,617
However,

104
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,995
although I feel pressured,
I also feel reassured.

105
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,706
It's like nothing can faze me now,

106
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,834
and I can face just about anything.

107
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,302
Is that what children mean to parents?

108
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,849
If you want to know, go and get married.

109
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,228
Stop talking about it and take action.

110
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,279
You only say that you'll help me as well.

111
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,952
I'm kidding.

112
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,333
Honestly, how was it when you got married?

113
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,835
What do you mean?

114
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,922
-It's just us here.
-Come again?

115
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,178
It's not like you and Seo-in
were madly in love, right?

116
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,810
It'll just stay between us, so tell me.

117
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,689
You know how Jeong-in has been

118
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,234
snippy lately.

119
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,239
I'd like for you to help me
get my head in the game.

120
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,117
How determined do I need to be
to marry someone?

121
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,169
Maybe I should elope with her.

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,631
Why not?

123
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,634
It sounds solid, right?

124
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,516
-Did Jeong-in call?
-No.

125
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,560
Shit.

126
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,187
-I'll call you when I know something.
-Wait.

127
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,732
I don't care what it is.

128
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll wait here, so please call me.

129
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,196
Enter your passcode.

130
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,574
The door is opening.

131
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,748
Either the phone will crack
or you'll crush your hand.

132
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,166
One is bound to happen.

133
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,181
-Jeong-in.
-Jeong-in?

134
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,351
You can't just leave like this.

135
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,727
What else is there for me to say?

136
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,897
Your father has every right
to be upset about this.

137
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,608
I know,
and I never said I did right by him.

138
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,943
-But Dad--
-What about me?

139
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,155
Do you even have any idea
how much anger I'm holding back?

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,866
What kind of humiliation is this?

141
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,244
How can I face Mr. Kwon tomorrow?

142
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,289
Was it him who sent the photos?

143
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,666
Isn't it obvious?

144
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,043
What did I tell you before?

145
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,962
How on earth have you been
conducting yourself?

146
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,924
Mr. Kwon figured it out as well!

147
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,263
Now, there won't be a chance for you
to get back together with Gi-seok.

148
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:22,932
Good.

149
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,810
-Why you little--
-Honey, please!

150
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,311
-Ji-ho's downstairs.
-Move!

151
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,855
Dad, let's talk this out.

152
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,857
-Dad, no violence.
-Get out of my way!

153
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,692
-Jeong-in!
-Jeong-in!

154
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,902
-Dad!
-Jeong-in!

155
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,446
It's all useless.

156
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,281
In this world, only money counts.

157
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,200
It holds all the power.
That's just how it is.

158
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,078
Damn.

159
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,581
What can't money buy?

160
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,047
Money can even buy love and affection.

161
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,638
That's just sad though.

162
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,684
Let me be honest with you then.

163
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,020
Why...

164
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,108
Why do you think
I wanted to expand the clinic?

165
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,447
For my patients? No, that's nonsense.

166
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,827
I wanted my wife to be able to

167
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,289
brag about her husband.

168
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,874
Am I being cocky? No.

169
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,002
Truth be told,

170
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,088
it's love.

171
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,301
It's due to my love for her.

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,475
Then you should've pushed forward.

173
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,310
Why did you scrap the plan?

174
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,732
You piece of jerk.

175
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,235
It was you who didn't grant me the loan.

176
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,993
When I inherit my dad's building,

177
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,953
I'll rent you an office, free of charge.

178
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,499
Wait, is that favoritism?

179
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,834
Fine, I'll only take
a million won a month.

180
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,884
Still, we must become a family first.

181
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,390
-You're hilarious.
-I'm not joking.

182
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,148
Please tell Seo-in

183
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,235
to persuade Jeong-in for me.

184
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,363
If we end up getting married,

185
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,740
I'll make it worth your while.

186
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,502
I'm asking you once again.

187
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,588
I sincerely mean it.

188
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,346
You do seem more sincere this time.

189
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,823
Do you know what
I'm most grateful for after meeting you?

190
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,119
I'm happy

191
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,498
to have someone I can put before myself.

192
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,418
That...

193
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,462
and courage.

194
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,925
You've always been brave.

195
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,304
I thought so too,

196
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,474
but I've only been pretending to be.

197
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,187
On the other hand,

198
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,149
you're going through an ordeal
because of me too.

199
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,445
You said so yourself.

200
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,198
That we shouldn't make excuses

201
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,158
saying we're leaving
for the other person's sake.

202
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,037
I guess I dug my own grave again.

203
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,377
I like that you're brave and courageous,

204
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,424
but lean on me just like you're doing now.
Literally and emotionally.

205
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,803
I want to be someone
who can be there for you.

206
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,771
Then I'll keep on leaning on you.
Don't you take it back.

207
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,699
Your father's words
must've hurt you today.

208
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,085
I guess I brought that on you.

209
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,509
Don't be too stressed out by it.

210
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,013
No matter what others say,

211
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,515
we share the same fate now,

212
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,686
so it's wrong to be hurt by them.

213
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,649
You're right.

214
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,194
You really are.

215
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,615
See?

216
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,166
Let me hug you.

217
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,919
No, let me hug you instead.

218
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,280
The smaller portions are for Jeong-in.

219
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't leave them outside her door.

220
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,868
Make sure to put it in her fridge.

221
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,580
Aren't you even angry about this?

222
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,666
Why would you want to pack her food?

223
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,547
What did Dad say?

224
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,507
Isn't it obvious?

225
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,681
They're in love, so just let them be.

226
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,560
Don't you ever become a parent.

227
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,731
Do you know why Seo-in suggested
you meet Ji-ho?

228
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,860
Of course, I know what she meant.

229
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,654
She said that because he's a decent man.

230
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,241
Soon, Seo-in will be a single mother.

231
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,787
Would you be okay

232
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,123
if others pointed fingers at her?

233
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,545
I just don't know anything anymore.

234
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,778
I sorted out those we need to return.

235
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,197
I'm going over the products
that don't sell.

236
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,784
What did you do over the weekend?

237
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,536
Nothing much.

238
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,123
Who are you trying to fool?

239
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,751
What?

240
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:55,587
What's this about?

241
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,173
You always wash your coat on the weekend,

242
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,508
but it was just left here.

243
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,594
I forgot to take it home.

244
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,554
What's with the interrogation?

245
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,642
That response tells me
that something happened.

246
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:11,311
Nothing happened,
I was just with Jeong-in.

247
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,479
Hey.

248
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,107
-Can you move, please?
-Only for a cost.

249
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,733
What do you mean?

250
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,278
I'm going to tell your mother.

251
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,363
You're unbelievable.

252
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,418
Yes, Ms. Go.

253
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,129
Ms. Wang, do you have time to talk?

254
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,256
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

255
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,552
Please don't tell Ji-ho that I called.

256
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,513
Well, I'm alone right now.

257
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,473
I see.

258
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,437
There's just something
I've been wanting to ask you in person.

259
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,899
I can't believe
that people actually do this.

260
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,402
I'm just as fascinated.

261
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,282
Is this how the rich and famous operate?

262
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,702
Anyway, what are you going to do?

263
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,412
Aren't you going to go after Gi-seok?

264
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,122
Could it be his doing?

265
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,500
Isn't it obvious? He still wants you back.

266
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,294
He's too proud

267
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,005
to hire a private investigator.

268
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,882
Then why isn't he giving up on you?

269
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,470
Actually, his pride is probably
why he can't let you go.

270
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,432
"If I send this,
Jeong-in's father will be outraged,

271
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,143
and she'll come back to me."

272
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,394
That's his scenario.

273
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,647
But then I'll find out that

274
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,441
he was the one who sent the photos.

275
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,235
You're right.
It'll make you hate him even more.

276
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,323
If it wasn't Gi-seok,

277
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,784
who could've done such a thing?

278
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,952
Gi-seok's father.

279
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,454
No way.

280
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,873
Even my dad assumed that.

281
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,633
-It's me.
-What do you want?

282
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,928
Nothing.

283
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,846
I thought we could grab dinner.

284
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,474
Where should we meet?

285
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,979
Why aren't you speaking?

286
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,232
You said you'd always comply.

287
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,734
Fine. Let's meet.

288
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,531
-Where?
-At your father's house.

289
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,078
I need to talk to your father.
It's best if you're there,

290
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,955
so be there.

291
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,088
Do you have a moment?

292
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,966
For a meal?
Can I order something expensive?

293
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,093
I'd like a word.

294
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,595
We'll talk after Ye-seul leaves.

295
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,271
-Aren't you heading home?
-I will.

296
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,691
You should get going.
I need to scold Ji-ho.

297
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,905
Did I make a mistake as well today?

298
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,783
I can make something up

299
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,410
if you'd prefer to stay.

300
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,828
See you.

301
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,456
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye!

302
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,590
-Did you have to make her worry?
-You're worse.

303
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,675
You're making me nervous again.

304
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,271
Jeong-in asked me to marry her.

305
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,816
Hold on. She proposed to you?

306
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:50,113
Wow, luck just rolled your way, didn't it?

307
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,907
I know.

308
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,076
I don't know what to do now though.

309
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,537
In terms of marriage?

310
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,831
Our parents.

311
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,086
What did she say? That you should
push through even without their consent?

312
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,296
That's absurd.

313
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,342
It may be disrespectful,
but there's no rule against it.

314
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,595
I know what's going on.

315
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,349
If you try powering through,
they'll think you're insolent

316
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:20,310
and your pride can't allow that.

317
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,481
However, you're worried
that Jeong-in will leave you

318
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,942
if you wait until both parents approve.

319
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,486
How's that for a summary?

320
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,366
I want to meet her parents,
but I'm worried.

321
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,076
Worst case scenario?

322
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,163
I might cause
an irreparable rift between them.

323
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,046
Instead of holding back
to protect someone,

324
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,174
wouldn't you regret it less if you showed

325
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,218
how far you're willing to go
for that someone?

326
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,227
It really won't take long.

327
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,979
Okay, I get it.

328
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,356
I thought you understood.

329
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,193
This is the last time though.

330
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,237
What do you mean?

331
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,699
This is about us.

332
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,993
We'll do it together from now on.

333
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,080
All right. Just this once then.

334
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,001
I knew I met a woman too brazen.

335
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,087
It seems like
you're already regretting it.

336
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,798
What if I get dumped soon?

337
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,967
Don't you think about running away.

338
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,720
Why would I

339
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,763
when you told me to lean on you?

340
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,683
I will cling onto you like a leech.

341
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,394
Please do.

342
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,984
I'm not as stressed out as you think.

343
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,696
I can take even more than this.

344
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,574
Me too.

345
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,288
Then why don't we bet on it?

346
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,498
We'll see who's stronger.

347
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,460
I'll probably win.

348
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,962
Now my blood's boiling.

349
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,174
The bet is on.
Loser grants the winner a wish.

350
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,135
Can I name my prize first?

351
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,347
You think you've already won.

352
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,682
What is it?

353
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,518
Until we die,

354
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,229
we'll remember each other.

355
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,224
No, don't cross.

356
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,441
I don't think it's a good idea.

357
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,596
I'm very happy that you're not
across the street right now.

358
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,600
PHARMACIST

359
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,379
Hi, come in and have a seat.

360
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,466
Tell her to make some tea.

361
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,010
There's no need.
This will only take a few minutes.

362
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,389
What is it about? I wonder why
you couldn't even tell Gi-seok.

363
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,808
He seemed to have no idea.

364
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,395
Have a seat.

365
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,007
You know what it is, right?

366
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,180
There were some things
I needed to find out.

367
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,682
And you sent it to my parents.

368
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,481
Am I wrong?

369
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,818
Yes, I did.

370
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,405
I'm sorry about that.

371
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,116
No, I should thank you.

372
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,162
I couldn't bring myself
to tell my parents,

373
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,414
but this made me feel relieved.

374
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,460
So you're saying it's true.

375
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,462
Yes, it is.

376
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,923
Hey, did you come all the way here
to say that?

377
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,132
No.

378
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,511
-I'd like the original files.
-Jeong-in.

379
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,639
It was wrong of you to take them,
and I'm uncomfortable that you have them.

380
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,683
I'd like all of them.

381
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,483
Here's my business card.

382
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,737
I know it'll be a hassle,
but please send them to my work address.

383
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,463
You should thank your father too.

384
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,466
You were hoping
my parents would find out soon.

385
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,511
They've found out everything,
as you wished.

386
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,347
I sent those photos.

387
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,393
I didn't want to suffer alone.

388
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,272
There has to be a winner,

389
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,274
no matter how messy it gets.

390
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,361
Do you think

391
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,323
this will make me go back to you?

392
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,575
Ji-ho isn't good enough for you.

393
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,829
Why did you date me?

394
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:56,873
Why?

395
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,584
Because you loved me so much?

396
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,798
Would you have dated me
even if it hadn't been for my background?

397
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,929
I didn't really care.

398
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,056
Other women are like that too.

399
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,684
I mean,
everyone prefers wealth over poverty.

400
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,064
And I can't say it's not love.

401
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,831
I'm sorry.

402
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,004
It's all my fault.

403
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,758
I betrayed you and broke your heart.

404
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,302
I'm sorry for everything.

405
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,514
I'm not asking you to forgive me.

406
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,226
Even if you curse and pester me
for the rest of my life,

407
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,647
I'll put up with it. All of it.

408
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,858
What's so great about him?

409
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,946
Why would you do all this
just to be with that prick?

410
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,910
I don't need anything else.

411
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,204
There's only one answer.

412
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,707
Just come back to me.

413
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,668
I won't be satisfied with you.

414
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,796
I've gotten greedier.

415
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,967
Jeong-in.

416
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,475
I'm sure you knew,

417
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,894
but I took it without any meaning.

418
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,814
I should've returned it earlier.

419
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,089
If it meant nothing to you,

420
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,341
it's no better than garbage. Right?

421
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,722
I'll say this again.

422
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,309
You'll never be satisfied with Ji-ho.

423
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,188
I should go.

424
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm sorry I put you in that position,

425
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,465
but you're partially responsible for this.

426
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,887
And as for Jeong-in...

427
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,476
She's just too compassionate
and tenderhearted.

428
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,520
She's doing this out of pity.

429
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,606
I warned her a few times,

430
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,859
but she kept acting like a child,

431
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,404
so I did it thinking it might be better
for her parents to know.

432
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,368
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,295
Father.

434
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,006
Don't turn out like me.

435
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,963
I'm so happy
you're just across the street from me

436
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,257
right now.

437
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,997
Again, don't cross.

438
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,834
I'll go to you.

439
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,534
-Could you help me find this book?
-Sure. Just a moment, please.

440
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,185
-Hello.
-Hello, it's been a while.

441
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,771
-Jeong-in is inside.
-It's okay.

442
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,941
I just stopped by because I was in
the neighborhood. Have a nice day.

443
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,401
You too. Bye.

444
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,954
Jeong-in, I just saw your mom.

445
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,456
I guess she had her class today.

446
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,209
-She was peeking in from outside.
-Peeking at what?

447
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,463
I'm not sure.
But the look on her face was a little...

448
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,841
How should I put this?

449
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,136
Shall I say she looked a little sad?

450
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,179
Yes, a little bit.

451
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,474
She left.

452
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,561
I was going to come in and get you,
but she told me not to bother.

453
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,606
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

454
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,150
No problem.

455
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,963
MOM, I'M SORRY

456
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:19,477
I'M REALLY SORRY

457
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,790
I know that Jae-in is staying with you,

458
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,461
but we should still apply
for a temporary restraining order first.

459
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,341
If it's issued, he won't be able
to call or even text you.

460
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,303
There are people who choose not to comply
and threaten the applicant,

461
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,889
so I can't say that it's completely safe--

462
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,932
That won't be necessary.

463
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,726
I can handle Si-hoon by myself.

464
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,562
The law is there to help us.

465
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,732
You said he'd end up behind bars
for a couple of years at the most.

466
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,110
Regardless of how it's done,
he should pay for what he did.

467
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,738
I'll get on it right away.

468
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,407
No, it's okay.

469
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,618
Thanks for this consultation.

470
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,412
I'll figure out what to do.

471
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,461
JAYURO LAW FIRM

472
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,013
Now, tell me.

473
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,015
You said you'll figure out what to do.

474
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,810
Don't tell me you'll forgive him.

475
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,645
Of course not.

476
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,315
Like you said,
taking legal action isn't enough.

477
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,112
You're not thinking of
doing something crazy, are you?

478
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,118
Let me do it in your place.

479
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,204
You're pregnant.

480
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,000
That is why I have to do it myself.
Because I'm a mom.

481
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,711
Don't be like this.
You're scaring me here.

482
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,300
Jeez, this startled me.

483
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,845
-Hi.
-Where is the pharmacy?

484
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,266
Mom, what is this about?

485
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,853
Don't tell Jeong-in.

486
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,315
Mom, Jeong-in will kill me.

487
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,025
What is it?

488
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,999
Finally.
I knew you'd get your hands on it.

489
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,210
Is this the power of love?

490
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,923
Okay! How about we have drinks
at my place this evening?

491
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,093
-I'm in, of course.
-I can't join you girls.

492
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,346
I'm going to hang out on the third floor.

493
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,600
I'm seriously going to move.

494
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,025
Come down for a minute.

495
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,348
I stopped by
to talk to you about something.

496
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,185
I have to get back quickly.

497
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,443
What do you want your father to do
after he retires?

498
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,784
My self-esteem has hit rock bottom,
so I can do anything.

499
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,953
This is nothing.

500
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,290
Did I date you
without knowing you well enough?

501
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,376
Or did I make you become like this?

502
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,962
You can beat yourself up later.

503
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,050
What kind of choice should you make

504
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,427
for the sake of you and me

505
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,471
as well as for both of our families?

506
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,224
Think about that first.

507
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:28,767
That won't be necessary.

508
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:33,480
Your father now knows
that I left you for another man.

509
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,233
He won't approve of me.

510
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,612
My dad will be too ashamed
to work for the foundation.

511
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,698
Don't give such excuses.

512
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,621
Your dad will join the foundation.
I'll make it happen.

513
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,794
Are you sure you want to win me back?

514
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,509
I even refused to attend the school
where my dad taught.

515
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,888
That's my answer.

516
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,517
I have to get back to work.

517
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,560
Drive safely.

518
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,703
-Here you go.
-Have a nice day.

519
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,288
-Thank you. You too.
-Have a nice day.

520
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,043
WOORI PHARMACY

521
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,008
Did she leave?

522
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,469
You saw the woman outside, right?

523
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,388
She made eye contact with me
a number of times.

524
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,061
Is she here to see Ms. Wang?

525
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,522
Then she would've called her.

526
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,982
By the way, who is Ms. Wang meeting?

527
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,119
One iced Americano, please.

528
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,414
People who don't know the situation

529
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,501
will say that I'm already worrying
too much,

530
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,920
but I can't help it as his mother.

531
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,507
I'm sure you understand.

532
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,387
Going through the whole thing with Eun-u
has helped Ji-ho become maturer.

533
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,765
I know that, but...

534
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,312
Have you heard anything

535
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,107
from Eun-u's mom by any chance?

536
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
No, I haven't.

537
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,865
But is it really necessary
to track her down after all these years?

538
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,828
Not knowing her whereabouts
would be best for the both of them.

539
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,373
But what if she shows up one day
and makes unreasonable demands?

540
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:00,711
Ji-ho finally pulled himself together,
and he's seeing someone now.

541
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,714
-I'm just worried.
-She's not that kind of person.

542
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,011
How could she be so heartless?

543
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:14,016
I'm not sure how this will sound,
but it's actually a good thing.

544
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,518
She doesn't deserve
to be Eun-u's mom anyway.

545
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,147
The one Ji-ho is seeing now
is not like her at all.

546
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,440
You can trust her.

547
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,317
Here's your iced Americano.

548
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,819
It seems like
Ji-ho completely trusts her as well.

549
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,030
But it's not just about those two.

550
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,326
The problem is
what her family will think about Ji-ho.

551
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,082
If Eun-u is a problem,

552
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,044
I want to tell them that I can raise him.

553
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:46,256
Ji-ho is Eun-u's dad.
He should do his duty as his parent.

554
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,552
And if they end up getting married,

555
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,971
it'll become
Jeong-in's responsibility as well.

556
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,976
Ji-ho did tell me
that she's a trustworthy person.

557
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:02,022
It sounded like she comes
from a good family as well.

558
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,900
What if they treat him disrespectfully?

559
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,487
You see,

560
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,822
I'm obviously worried about Ji-ho,

561
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,368
but Eun-u is... That poor thing
didn't even do anything wrong.

562
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,872
He doesn't even know
what his mom looks like.

563
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,209
Just thinking about that breaks my heart.

564
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,088
Ji-ho...

565
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,840
He won't suffer any more heartache.

566
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,884
I trust that he won't.

567
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,930
I can't say with 100-percent certainty,

568
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,975
but I think Jeong-in is
as mentally strong as Ji-ho is.

569
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,020
And most importantly,
the two of them are so similar.

570
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,815
They even act the same way.

571
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,151
-You think so?
-Yes.

572
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,821
I guess they're meant to be.

573
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,905
Yes, exactly.

574
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,017
Excuse me.

575
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,895
Are you Yu Ji-ho's...

576
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,149
Yes.

577
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,360
Are you...

578
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,321
Yes.

579
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,240
I'm Jeong-in's mom.

580
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,724
All right, I'll leave now.

581
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,352
Okay.

582
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,316
Was that your mom?

583
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,277
Yes, she wants me to come over.

584
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,279
What's up with the sigh?

585
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,365
I know exactly what she's going to say.

586
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,826
Jeong-in is probably on her way now.

587
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,830
I met your mom earlier today.

588
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,878
I told her that
you two will get through it together.

589
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,089
And?

590
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,967
She was just worried.

591
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,059
She asked me about Yu-mi.

592
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,440
It just shows how much she likes Jeong-in.
She wants you two to stay together.

593
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,943
When you're very happy
and excited about something,

594
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,403
you get anxious for no reason, you know.

595
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,322
You wonder, "What if things go wrong?"

596
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,700
And moms always worry about everything.

597
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,788
I don't know about others,

598
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,998
but try to understand why she's worried.

599
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,921
It's been six years, for God's sake.

600
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,006
Until when will she worry?

601
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,844
Whenever she does this,

602
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,472
all the painful things I tried so hard
to forget come rushing back.

603
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,892
I know I don't say it,
but I'm worried too.

604
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,728
I'm even terrified at times.

605
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,399
I'm scared she'll show up
and demand Eun-u back.

606
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,739
Yu-mi's married.

607
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,451
I happened to hear about her recently
at a gathering.

608
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,162
Apparently, she even has a kid.

609
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,250
Ji-ho.

610
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,674
I know, Hye-jeong.

611
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:07,178
I never resented her, and I still don't.

612
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,431
After all,

613
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,101
she gave birth to Eun-u.

614
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,939
Hating her will be like hurting Eun-u,
so I won't do that.

615
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:20,817
I won't hate her.

616
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:24,821
You are so cool, Ji-ho.

617
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,473
Let me wipe your face.

618
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,142
All done. Go on in.

619
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,694
He's busy today.
He said he'll come by tomorrow.

620
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,821
Did you tell him you met her mom?

621
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,699
I didn't want to worry him,
so I said nothing about that.

622
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,620
I wonder if something has come up.

623
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,334
Her mom probably told her already,

624
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,836
so he might have heard something.

625
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,090
Then he would've come over
to ask you what happened.

626
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,801
That's true.

627
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:32,680
Did we buy too little?
Maybe we should've bought more.

628
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,351
-You'll join us, right?
-I'll have to see.

629
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,145
Gosh, do you miss him that much?

630
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,650
-Call him and tell him to hurry home.
-He's at his parents' place.

631
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,694
Their son has a date,
so I'm sure they'll let him leave.

632
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,656
Talking about him is making me
miss him more. I'll head in first.

633
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,657
Hey.

634
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,535
What? Is she running in
to go see his empty place?

635
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,749
She's totally crazy about him.

636
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,806
It's okay.

637
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,731
I'm okay, Hye-jeong.

638
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:52,403
Yes, you should be.

639
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,673
Hey, stop it.

640
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,641
I feel...

641
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,645
I feel like my heart is breaking into
pieces whenever I think about Eun-u.

642
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,442
It hurts so much.

643
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,362
It really drives me crazy.

644
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,664
Hey.

645
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,543
-You drank a lot. I'm sorry.
-Hi, Yeong-jae.

646
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,919
Hey, Yeong-jae.

647
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:30,043
Hey, Ji-ho. I'll take you home.

648
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:33,921
No, wait. Hold on a moment, Yeong-jae.

649
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,716
-What is it? Why?
-Hang on.

650
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,217
-Let's go home.
-Wait!

651
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,136
-I have to--
-What's the matter?

652
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,181
-I have to go see Eun-u.
-You can go tomorrow.

653
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,391
-Come on. Let's go.
-No, I have to go see Eun-u.

654
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,061
-It's okay. Let's go.
-What?

655
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,938
Just keep walking.
You can see him tomorrow.

656
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,319
I'll take care of the rest.
You should call a taxi.

657
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:57,695
I'll call one when I'm outside.

658
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,948
Jeong-in, what about you?
Are you going to Ji-ho's place?

659
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,533
Hold on.

660
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,161
He hasn't read my messages yet.

661
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,580
Are you already getting dumped or what?

662
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,001
What was that sound?

663
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,546
-Could that be Ji-ho?
-What? You think so?

664
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,810
-I'll be right back.
-Hey, is it him?

665
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,354
Jeong-in!

666
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,744
Is Ji-ho all right?

667
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,372
He's quite drunk.

668
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,011
Ji-ho.

669
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,934
Why did you drink so much?

670
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,399
Did something happen?

671
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:24,532
Jeong-in.

672
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,786
Are you going to...

673
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,667
leave us too?

674
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,627
That was so unnecessary.
Why did you tell her that?

675
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,879
Why did you show it
if you wanted to hide it?

676
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,798
You went nuts.

677
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,466
What if he's still hung up on her?

678
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,803
I think I only saw
what was right in front of me.

679
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,888
Are you going to put the blame on Ji-ho
and run away?

680
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,057
I thought our love was all that mattered.

681
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,185
I cluelessly thought I should be able
to understand everything...

682
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,188
No, I didn't even think.

683
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,981
I just assumed everything would work out.

684
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,151
I think I need some time
to reflect on myself.

685
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,569
Can you really accept me back?

686
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,489
I betrayed you once. Do you think
you can still get back together with me?

687
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,949
What if I betray you again?

688
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,785
Be there for your buddy.
He already had it tough to begin with.

689
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,245
Do you think you can

690
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,080
get back together with Jeong-in
if I give up?

691
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,665
I never said I would.

692
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:58,042
You know me. My goal is taking you down.

693
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,839
