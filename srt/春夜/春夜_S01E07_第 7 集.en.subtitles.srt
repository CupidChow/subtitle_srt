1
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,017
I had a basketball game today.

2
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,270
Were you with Gi-seok?

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,357
I was.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,319
Are you still with him?

5
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,363
Yes.

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,365
Then I'll hang up.

7
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,035
Why?

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,871
Ji-ho...

9
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
Don't hang up.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,710
What's gotten into you?

11
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,546
It's nothing urgent.

12
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,590
We can talk later.

13
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,842
Gi-seok, can you drop me off somewhere?

14
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,429
Are you getting off instead of joining us?

15
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,614
What's wrong?

16
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,370
What? Did you get into an argument?

17
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,508
Jeez.

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,887
Now I feel like I should apologize.

19
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,057
For pushing you to pick up.

20
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,060
What's wrong with him?

21
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,146
Did Ji-ho say where he was going?

22
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,232
Stop calling him and let him be.

23
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,110
-Where did he go?
-To see a girl.

24
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,696
-What?
-Really?

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,406
You said he had someone.

26
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,867
Not really.
He said he was trying to end things.

27
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,912
On the contrary.
He's burning with passion for her.

28
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,165
Really?

29
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,960
I can't wait to find out about her.

30
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,328
You're going to yell, right?

31
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,415
Let's go somewhere less crowded.

32
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,070
Go ahead.

33
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,576
Should I go first?

34
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,043
"I'm sorry.

35
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,170
I was caught off guard.

36
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,216
How could we keep on talking
with Gi-seok next to you?"

37
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,761
You did it to protect me, right?

38
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,807
Why not just put him on the phone?

39
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,142
If you wanted to be bold,

40
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,686
you should've told him it was me.

41
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,773
I can't.

42
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,365
I'm a loser
who's too scared to take any risks.

43
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,452
I asked for your help.

44
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,331
I asked you to help me move on.

45
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,125
Why must I do that?

46
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,586
Who am I to care
if you're developing feelings for me?

47
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,298
I can barely contain
my own heart from exploding.

48
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,219
Why should I care
if your heart gets crushed or not?

49
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,515
I come first.

50
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,768
What I want is my priority.

51
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,313
I don't care
if you go insane in the process.

52
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,947
Wait, are you leaving?

53
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,408
My girlfriend's pissed.
Gi-seok, see you around.

54
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,951
-Bye, guys.
-Seriously?

55
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,537
-Whatever.
-Fine, get going, then.

56
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,165
His girlfriend has a short leash on him.

57
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm jealous, though.

58
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,627
I'd love to be kept on a leash too.

59
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,963
Then get yourself a girlfriend.

60
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,092
Are you really in a position
to hand out advice?

61
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,180
What do you mean?

62
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,933
You're constantly arguing
with your girlfriend these days.

63
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,245
Hey, follow me out, will you?

64
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,583
-What's wrong?
-I just want to talk.

65
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,418
-Why?
-What's wrong?

66
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,962
-What happened?
-What's going on?

67
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,592
I was going to let it slide...

68
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,597
since I'm older
and my girlfriend was mixed up in it,

69
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,558
but how could your friends be so clueless?

70
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,896
Don't they know what's appropriate or not?

71
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,981
How can they walk in
to my girlfriend's home?

72
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,692
-Her sister--
-Ji-ho's worse.

73
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,487
He's seeing someone,

74
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,156
so even though he was forced there,

75
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,910
he shouldn't have
drunk all night at their place.

76
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,329
Is he that thoughtless?

77
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,498
He's not normally like that.

78
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,668
-No?
-No, he's not.

79
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,294
Then we have a bigger problem.

80
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,632
Remember how he...

81
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,512
got wound up on the day we had drinks?

82
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,015
You're saying it meant something.

83
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,518
-Ji-ho was drunk that night--
-Does he...

84
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,688
like my girlfriend?

85
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,606
What?

86
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,859
Unbelievable.

87
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,863
How can you even say such a thing?

88
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,991
-Is that so?
-Yes.

89
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,119
You don't know about
the woman he's seeing,

90
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,413
so how can you be sure?

91
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,331
The same goes for you.

92
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,793
Did your girlfriend say
that Ji-ho likes her?

93
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,839
You know what? You're pissing me off.

94
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,384
I agree that my friends were idiots,

95
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,470
but you make them sound like dirty pigs
who hit on random women.

96
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,931
It's disturbing to hear.

97
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,821
Let's forget about it, then.

98
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,990
Jeez.

99
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,745
Damn it.

100
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,261
-Have you been drinking?
-How could I not?

101
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,766
I've been getting so much shit
because of your stupidity.

102
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,185
Is it about that night at Jae-in's house?

103
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,561
I already explained that.

104
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,896
Whatever.

105
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,107
Don't ever go near
Gi-seok's girlfriend or her sister again.

106
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,486
What's going on? Did something happen?

107
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,821
Just do as I say!

108
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,782
Tell Ji-ho too.

109
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,451
Also, shouldn't you be busy studying?

110
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,328
No wonder you never pass.

111
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,049
YEONG-JAE

112
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,384
Did something happen?

113
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,010
Hyeon-su's pissed.

114
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,068
Do you just need me to stay hidden?

115
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,826
I know your situation
and what you're going through.

116
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,205
I understand,
but I still get angry from time to time.

117
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,708
That's what happened today.

118
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,088
Even when I was getting mad at you,

119
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,341
I realized it was wrong.

120
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,312
I like you a lot.

121
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,445
I'm not in a position to fight for you,

122
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
but I'm too scared to cut you off.

123
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,407
I feel like...

124
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,993
I'm doomed...

125
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,581
because my love for you
grows bigger by the day.

126
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,627
When you told Gi-seok it was over,

127
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,672
although I said
that it wasn't what I wanted,

128
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,090
secretly...

129
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,387
I thought about not being good enough
for you.

130
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,933
I started worrying about
how you'd soon figure that out.

131
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,436
What a loser, right?

132
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,443
Even though I say you had nothing...

133
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,363
to do with my decision
to break up with Gi-seok,

134
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,408
no one will believe it.

135
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,996
They'll point fingers at you too.

136
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,415
I don't care about any of that.

137
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,463
To be honest, I'm still not sure.

138
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,549
I don't know what I want.

139
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,720
In terms of a boyfriend or a husband.

140
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,724
All I know right now

141
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,520
is that I'm not happy
with my current situation.

142
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:37,608
I know very well that no relationship
burns passionately every day.

143
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,863
And it's impossible
for couples to never hurt each other.

144
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,119
You can call me immature if you want,
but I still long for those things.

145
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,959
A relationship
where I'm not the only passionate one

146
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,838
and the kind of love

147
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,091
where I don't get hurt.

148
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,266
To be honest, I haven't even thought about

149
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,768
starting something with you.

150
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,567
-I mean--
-I'm not upset.

151
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,654
I understand it all too well.

152
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,616
You must feel stuck.

153
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,872
Overcoming the difficulties
and obstacles together?

154
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,125
That's a myth.

155
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,045
Once you become
more objective on the matter,

156
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,884
then I'll accept it all
without resentment.

157
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,552
What a liar.

158
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,722
If I tell you that it's over

159
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,558
and that we should go back
to being strangers,

160
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,810
you'll just accept that?

161
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,733
Right now I will.

162
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,239
After time passes,

163
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,287
if you still feel the same way,

164
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,208
come to me then.

165
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,553
Even if it's when...

166
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,473
I'm old and wrinkly?

167
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,311
Yes.

168
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,991
Hello?

169
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,326
Don't turn around.

170
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,790
If you do,

171
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,669
I won't let you leave me.

172
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,425
After many years,

173
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,054
if I come to you then,

174
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,933
will you really accept me?

175
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,104
You'll probably cling on until I do.

176
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,777
Don't fall in love
with anyone else until then.

177
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,333
I'm a mean person.

178
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,543
I'm selfish too.

179
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,172
Resent me all you want.

180
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,174
I can handle your resentment.

181
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,638
Just don't fall in love with anyone else.

182
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,976
You're unbelievable.

183
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,728
I said I'm mean.

184
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,024
When I...

185
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,653
finally make my way to you,

186
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,032
I promise to protect you

187
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,369
from all the criticism and judgment.

188
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,545
That's what...

189
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,880
I wanted to tell you today.

190
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,803
I won't hurt you anymore.

191
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,602
So promise you'll wait for me.

192
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,040
You can take as long as you want.

193
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,543
Just as long as you come to me.

194
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,964
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.

195
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:36,985
PHARMACIST

196
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,969
This is nice.

197
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,096
Unbelievable.

198
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,185
Thank you. Please enjoy.

199
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,275
Being jobless is the life, isn't it?

200
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,278
You wake up at noon and mooch off others.

201
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,449
Don't you feel guilty to watch your sister
go to work every morning?

202
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,618
I do all the dishes and laundry for her.

203
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,330
You should, since you're putting her out.

204
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,124
I'm just saying.

205
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,380
How's Jeong-in these days?

206
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,927
I told you to keep an eye on her.

207
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,930
I have been.

208
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,229
How is her relationship with Gi-seok?

209
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,149
He came over for wine a few days ago.

210
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,484
Really?

211
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,362
How do you think they're doing?

212
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,198
-Well, you know...
-Just tell me as it is.

213
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,374
She looked sad.

214
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,467
ARCHIVE
RESTRICTED AREA

215
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:26,613
UNEXPECTEDLY YOU

216
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,202
Are you gloating?

217
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,541
It is an ambitious project
full of your ulterior motive.

218
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,211
-Jealous much?
-As if.

219
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,172
I hate relationships
that only give you headaches.

220
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,593
He said he'll wait for me.

221
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,055
Now that's not something
you hear every day.

222
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,852
-Jealous much?
-In this case, yes.

223
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,354
Did he say he'll wait unconditionally?

224
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,399
Yes.

225
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,625
You should just say it.
I'll have indigestion at this rate.

226
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,925
What if...

227
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,556
you were about to do something that might
make everyone turn their backs on you?

228
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,559
What would you do?

229
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,604
Move forward

230
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,355
or give up?

231
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,653
The choice will vary
depending on what exactly it is.

232
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,491
However, something that is
frowned upon by everyone

233
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,367
can't be right.

234
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,870
It means that it's a reckless decision.

235
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,208
Is it the pharmacist?

236
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,085
No.

237
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,171
Why not?

238
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,048
Is there an issue with him?

239
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,760
Of course not.

240
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,267
Does he...

241
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,686
have a girlfriend?

242
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,025
Then what could be the issue?

243
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,945
I'm the one with the issue.

244
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,037
What are you going to do
about your boyfriend?

245
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,666
We're going to meet tonight.

246
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,585
Are you going to end it?

247
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,629
Yes.

248
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,299
You must feel awful.

249
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,970
I was going to do it anyway.

250
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,516
Why do relationships
always have shitty endings?

251
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,480
Hey, join us.

252
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,129
-Ji-ho.
-Hey, you just got here.

253
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,922
Eat a few bites first.

254
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,092
-Let's eat.
-How dense are you two?

255
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,679
Ji-ho, you know what I'll say, right?

256
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,768
Your suspicions are correct.

257
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,857
Why?

258
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,108
"Why?"

259
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,735
Hey.

260
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,988
Out of all the women,
why did it have to be Gi-seok's girl?

261
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,282
You think I'll lose?

262
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,703
Shut up for a second.
Have you been seeing her all this time?

263
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,751
We knew each other...

264
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,130
before Gi-seok introduced her to us.

265
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,425
I asked her out,

266
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,595
but she said she was taken,
so we remained friends.

267
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,890
Men and women can't be friends. Right?

268
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,768
Well, it's not impossible.

269
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,395
So? Are the two of you still just friends?

270
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,319
No, I like her more than just a friend.

271
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,029
What are you saying?

272
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,325
Anyway, okay. That's how you feel.
Then what about her?

273
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,287
She feels the same way.

274
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,006
Would a one-sided crush have been better?

275
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,593
No, not really. Right?

276
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,845
Yes. That is true,

277
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,973
but she's...

278
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,477
She's so weird.

279
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,605
Then what is she going to do
with her boyfriend?

280
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,315
She's taken. How can she do that?

281
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,443
Hey, I have a kid.

282
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:34,754
So what will you do now?

283
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,006
Will you steal her from Gi-seok?

284
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,427
Well, I'm just saying.

285
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,972
Ji-ho said Jeong-in likes him
more than just a friend as well.

286
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,807
Then she should break up with Gi-seok.

287
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,892
It doesn't matter to me.

288
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,520
What's this nonsense now?

289
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,024
I knew about her boyfriend
from the get-go,

290
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,776
so I should've given up back then.

291
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,321
As you guys know, it's not easy
for a woman to accept my situation.

292
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,532
It'd be selfish of me
to ask her to choose me.

293
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,537
Still, don't you think
she needs to make up her mind?

294
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,955
That's what I'm saying.

295
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,417
The fact that I'm in her life
is a lot for her to handle.

296
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,669
I don't want to make it harder.

297
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,822
Where are you?

298
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,409
Hey, I'm so sorry. It doesn't look like
the director will leave anytime soon.

299
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,288
You said you'd just have dinner.

300
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,165
That was the plan,

301
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,669
but other teams joined us,
so it's turned into a big thing now.

302
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,760
Let's just meet tomorrow instead, okay?

303
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,845
I'll treat you to a nice dinner.

304
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,765
You have a job,

305
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,143
so I don't want you to think of me
as your number-one priority.

306
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,021
But whenever anything happens,

307
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,483
you cancel or bail on me first.
How am I supposed to interpret it?

308
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,443
Because it's no big deal?

309
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,074
No, it's not that. I guess I do it because
you've always been so understanding.

310
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,871
So it's my fault?

311
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,165
Don't twist my words around, okay?

312
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,209
All right, I heard you.

313
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,963
This won't happen again. Are we good now?

314
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,091
Is this the "love" you talked about?

315
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,301
All right, I'll leave now.

316
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,348
I'm tired of going through this
over and over again.

317
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,102
You always do things reluctantly
and make such a big deal out of them.

318
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,230
Why do I always have to beg you?

319
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,443
Go home and wait for me.
I'll be there shortly, okay?

320
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,196
It won't change anything.

321
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,074
-I wanted to say--
-I've made it clear to you.

322
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,286
We can't break up.

323
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,957
That uncertainty is really the only thing
that kept us together until now.

324
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,464
I know we should talk in person.

325
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,968
Let's meet up sometime soon.
We'll end things in person.

326
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,389
I said we should start over, didn't I?

327
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,100
I told you I'll try harder.

328
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,353
Then you should at least give me some time
and see what happens.

329
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,314
If you keep saying you want to break up,

330
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,024
-what can--
-Hey, are you fighting?

331
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,484
Hey, who are you talking to?

332
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,029
Get back inside.

333
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,738
Hey.

334
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,740
Where are you? Are you at home?

335
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,575
No, I'm at the office.

336
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,371
The book club meeting is tomorrow,
so I wanted to get things ready.

337
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,750
What's up?
Did you and Gi-seok already part ways?

338
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,545
I couldn't see him today.
He's out for a team dinner.

339
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,923
Jeez, he's the worst.

340
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,758
Is he avoiding you on purpose?

341
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:50,969
I don't know.

342
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,763
I'll head out shortly.
Where are you going to be?

343
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,033
-Has she been coming over?
-No, it's not that.

344
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,330
-Hey, let's go.
-What?

345
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,583
-Come on. We should get going.
-I have to talk to Ji-ho.

346
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,627
No, you don't. Shut up. Bye.

347
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,347
I don't think your friend is home yet.

348
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,558
She'll be home shortly.

349
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,275
You don't know her door code?

350
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,235
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Yes.

351
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,113
-All right, then.
-Let's go grab some food.

352
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,365
You said you've eaten.

353
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,534
I'll watch you eat.

354
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,037
But you won't buy me dinner?

355
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,498
I don't have my wallet.

356
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,667
Even if you did, you wouldn't.

357
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,258
Here are your noodles.

358
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,429
Here you go.

359
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,389
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

360
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,059
-You can add this seasoning.
-Okay, thank you.

361
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,226
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

362
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,525
It looks so good.

363
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,279
Can you really eat both?

364
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,908
You're not getting any.

365
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,753
I said I'd watch you eat.

366
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,881
I feel like a monkey in the zoo.

367
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,725
By the way, your friends...

368
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,144
It's okay. I told them briefly.

369
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:06,979
What did they say?

370
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,526
They're probably more surprised with me.

371
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,407
Were you really
going to stay single forever?

372
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,369
I wouldn't say that,

373
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,704
but I never thought about it
or made any effort.

374
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,085
What are you thinking?

375
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,838
What? Nothing.

376
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,218
About my story...
I'll tell you everything later on.

377
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,558
You really aren't even offering.

378
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,148
Fine, I'll be generous.
Just one bite, then.

379
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,222
Stop bringing side dishes.

380
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,975
We rarely eat at home,
so we never finish them.

381
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,772
You and Si-hoon are having problems,
aren't you?

382
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,447
Shall I ask Si-hoon directly?

383
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,494
We're going to get a divorce.

384
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,292
We don't live together at the moment.

385
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,879
He refuses to sign
the divorce papers, so--

386
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,255
Why do you want a divorce?

387
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,468
Never mind.

388
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,305
I have big respect for you
for holding out this long.

389
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,976
I'm sorry.

390
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:12,855
Well...

391
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,316
What about your job?

392
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,319
Will you have to quit if people find out?

393
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,447
No, not really.
But I submitted my letter of resignation.

394
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,658
It hasn't been processed yet, though.

395
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,119
It's not like you're failing at your job.
Why would you quit?

396
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,540
I want to go back to school.

397
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,338
And I'm thinking of letting Jae-in
stay here for the time being.

398
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,174
Jae-in? Why?

399
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,525
Mom. Stay here.

400
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,663
-Si-hoon, my--
-So you are here.

401
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,373
Why didn't you pick up...

402
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,668
-You should've called me--
-Mom.

403
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,296
-Go in the room.
-Okay, I'll...

404
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,678
I heard you two don't live together.

405
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,181
That is also a promise,
but what the heck is this about?

406
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,852
I have to talk to Seo-in about something.

407
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,603
Then you should be more courteous.

408
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,482
You kept ringing the doorbell and calling
as if she deserved to be scolded.

409
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,609
Are you that ill-mannered?

410
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,989
I'm disappointed in you.

411
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,285
Are you sure you want things to work out
between the two of you?

412
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,539
If you're going to keep this up,
I don't want you two to stay together.

413
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,709
I'll make sure you two get a divorce.

414
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,551
Going down.

415
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,891
Basement, second floor.

416
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,103
The doors are closing.

417
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,089
We can get through this.

418
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,633
I love you.

419
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,500
Thanks for this.

420
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,391
I just realized

421
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,313
that you always thank me,
even for things like this.

422
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,401
This is so unlike you.

423
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,653
Just be your usual self.

424
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,157
I'm just anxious, I guess.

425
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,289
I admit that I got too comfortable.

426
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,918
I've told you many times,

427
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,590
but I never imagined us breaking up.

428
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,677
Yet you always talked about breaking up?

429
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,517
You know how I am. I have a short fuse.

430
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,480
It's no use talking about the past.

431
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,650
-Let's--
-I can't agree to it.

432
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,445
-Gi-seok.
-Let's try to make things work.

433
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,408
I'll accept it if we can't work it out.

434
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,331
My father wants to see you.

435
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,710
It wasn't me.

436
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,464
You can ask him directly.

437
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,841
He told me to bring you over.

438
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,265
I'll talk to him
if you're too uncomfortable.

439
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,516
No, it's okay.

440
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,352
I'll meet him.

441
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
Gi-seok.

442
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,990
You don't have to come
when I'm meeting your father.

443
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,867
I'd rather meet with him alone.

444
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,790
I'm only going to talk about myself.
That's why I'm asking you this.

445
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,834
Let me meet him alone.

446
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,887
All right. Go ahead and meet him
without me, then.

447
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,232
It stimulates a bowel movement,
so take it before meals.

448
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,276
-I've been taking it, so I'm aware.
-I see.

449
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,153
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you. You too.

450
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,865
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

451
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,367
-Has it been busy?
-No.

452
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,453
The new udon place at the intersection
is so good.

453
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,829
I should check it out.

454
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,123
You two should eat together
starting tomorrow.

455
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,625
No, people will gossip.

456
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,504
It's not good for Ye-seul.

457
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,047
Why is that?

458
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,217
Well... Other store owners gossip a lot,
you know.

459
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,138
Will you not even talk to us
when you get into a relationship?

460
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,348
Jeez, cut it out.

461
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,308
Are you seeing someone?

462
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,685
No, I'm not.

463
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,646
-Hello.
-Oh, it's Eun-u!

464
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,189
Eun-u is here.

465
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,774
-Hello.
-Hello.

466
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,360
Eun-u, it's so good to see you!

467
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,444
Hello.

468
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,780
You're a big boy now.

469
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:03,283
Eun-u!

470
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,704
Mom, just eat. He'll come back
if he wants more food.

471
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,209
You sound as if you've raised ten kids.

472
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:14,920
Mom, you were worse.

473
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,881
When I was little,
I thought I was a foundling.

474
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,136
I was so strict with you,

475
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,722
but I can't be like that with Eun-u.

476
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,684
Even today, we left the house
as soon as he said he wanted to see you.

477
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,062
I know it's not easy for you and Dad.

478
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,606
Don't say that.

479
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,400
If we didn't have Eun-u,

480
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,195
your dad and I would be
so bored and listless.

481
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,367
It won't take me long.
Hang in there just a little longer.

482
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,328
Stop saying that, please.

483
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,460
About the "teacher" at the library...

484
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,712
I heard it's a woman.

485
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,466
She's just someone I know.

486
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:02,968
I see.

487
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,345
Well...

488
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,558
There's someone I want to set you up with.

489
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,481
I'm bringing it up
just in case you're interested.

490
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:17,149
If not, don't worry about it.

491
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,532
There's someone I like.

492
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,995
I'm not saying I'll act on it right away.

493
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,957
My gosh.

494
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,547
What's wrong?

495
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,178
I'm just so happy to hear that.

496
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,641
Thank you.

497
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,150
Here.

498
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,913
Eun-u will wonder what's going on.

499
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,919
He always talked
as if he'd stay single forever.

500
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,796
How can I not cry?

501
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,633
If he says he's getting married,
you'll bawl your eyes out.

502
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,805
Do you think that can happen?

503
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,476
I couldn't ask him anything
because I didn't want to jinx it.

504
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,229
Do you think she has a kid too?

505
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,400
Won't it be a little challenging
if her kid isn't that young?

506
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,818
Who cares?

507
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,112
As long as the two of them
want to be together.

508
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:47,865
Grandma, I want ice cream.

509
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,243
Oh, okay. Grandpa will buy you ice cream.
Let's go.

510
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,537
Off we go.

511
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,415
Be careful.

512
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,425
I'll get going, sir.

513
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,135
Okay, thank you.

514
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:18,979
Hello?

515
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,982
Hello, this is Lee Jeong-in.

516
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,109
Lee Jeong-in?

517
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,821
Oh, you're Tae-hak's daughter, right?

518
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,615
Yes.

519
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,200
How do you do?

520
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,245
I heard you said you'd like to meet me.

521
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,664
Yes, I did.

522
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,418
Why isn't Gi-seok arranging it?

523
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,837
I'd like to meet you alone.

524
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,758
If you would allow it,
I'd like to meet you without Gi-seok.

525
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,218
Sure, let's do that.

526
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,265
Please let me know the time and location
that work best for you, and I'll be there.

527
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,104
Then I'll let you know...

528
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,899
in a few days.

529
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,985
All right, then.
I'll wait to hear from you.

530
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,279
Sounds good.

531
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,334
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM PREP COURSES

532
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,054
Hi.

533
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,560
-Where's your bag?
-It's in the study room.

534
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,896
What brings you by this late?

535
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,315
I just parted ways with my friends.
Let's hang out.

536
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,193
No, I'm just going to study.

537
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,071
Really?

538
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,615
Okay. Then we'll hang out next time.

539
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,534
Even next time, I'll have to study.

540
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:01,790
I haven't been studying much,
so I'm starting to get a little anxious.

541
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,835
And I'm being a nuisance, aren't I?

542
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,754
Why are you taking it like that?

543
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:09,214
That's what it sounds like.

544
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,465
All right, then.

545
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,884
I'll stop coming by.

546
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,556
But I'll kill you
if you don't pass the exam.

547
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,614
Put some lotion on your face.

548
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,617
Yeong-jae rejected me.

549
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,912
If he doesn't pass the exam,

550
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,789
I'm going to pull all his hair out.

551
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,791
He doesn't want to see you?

552
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,793
No, he doesn't. He said he has to study.

553
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,423
You should dump the pharmacist.

554
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,551
I can't be the only reject.

555
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,434
Jeong-in.

556
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,770
Mom is worried about you.

557
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,066
I'll assure her that I'm fine.

558
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,664
That's okay. He probably wants to focus
on studying for the exam.

559
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,585
I wonder if it's because of me.

560
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,546
Yeong-jae isn't the type
to blame others and give excuses.

561
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,298
Don't worry about it.

562
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,426
I hope Jae-in's feelings aren't too hurt.

563
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,264
Jae-in knows about you.

564
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,017
I'm sorry. It just happened.

565
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:46,978
I'm okay with it,

566
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,314
but she must've been very surprised.

567
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,858
Just for a moment.

568
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:55,654
She's very open-minded,
so she understands.

569
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,739
She probably hates me now.

570
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,450
No, she's really not like that.

571
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,788
I told my mom

572
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,707
that there's someone I like.

573
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,253
And what did she say?

574
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,383
What is it?

575
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,385
You can't tell me?

576
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,638
She cried.

577
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,725
She must've been very surprised.

578
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,231
Ji-ho.

579
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,775
It must've been very hard for you.

580
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:43,702
I told you that I'll go to you
without hurting you.

581
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,079
I'll make sure you won't have to sigh.

582
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,333
But I want to make sure
you won't have a hard time.

583
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,004
If you don't cause any trouble,
I'll be fine.

584
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,464
I'll be good to you.

585
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,925
It goes both ways.

586
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,137
We'll be good to each other.

587
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,681
This feels surreal.

588
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,058
What?

589
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,020
You and I...

590
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,440
are "we" now.

591
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,362
Come in.

592
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,534
We'll have lunch as well,

593
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,412
so pick somewhere quiet.

594
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,041
Yes, don't pick a place
that is hard to get to.

595
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,584
Okay, all right.

596
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,255
These are suggestions
from the Parents' Association.

597
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,469
By the way, your daughter is quite daring.

598
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,722
She called and asked me to meet up.

599
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,643
-Jeong-in called you?
-You didn't know?

600
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,686
No, I didn't. My apologies.

601
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,772
Why are you apologizing?

602
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,149
I mean, if it was about meeting you...

603
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,652
why didn't she say anything to me?

604
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,278
She wants to meet me alone.

605
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,951
Are you saying she requested
a one-on-one meeting with you?

606
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,369
Yes, she did.

607
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,164
I'm excited to meet her.

608
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,363
-We'll order in a few minutes.
-Sure.

609
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:10,408
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Jeong-in.

610
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,035
Nice to meet you.

611
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,662
Let's sit down.

612
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,755
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

613
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,510
Shall we eat first?

614
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,762
Whatever you prefer.

615
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,307
We're not really here to eat,
so let's talk first.

616
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,061
I'm sure you wanted to meet me alone
for a reason.

617
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,567
I thought it'd be best to come alone
as I'll predominantly be talking about

618
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,236
my personal thoughts and opinions.

619
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,656
I heard you've known Gi-seok
for quite a while.

620
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,786
We've been in a relationship
for four years.

621
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,586
I know that you don't approve of me.

622
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,882
Yes, I admit that it hurt my self-esteem,

623
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,093
and it upset me as well.

624
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,931
But it's not like we started dating
with marriage in mind,

625
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,436
so I never really showed it.

626
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,860
I'll put all this away when I'm done.

627
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,116
So, you want to read dinosaur books.
Anything else?

628
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:36,828
I want to see the teacher.

629
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,707
I told you she's not here today.

630
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,001
Then why are we here?

631
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,795
To read books.

632
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,922
Water. I want water.

633
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,175
Okay, just a second.

634
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,933
Oh, hello.

635
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,812
Jeong-in is off today.

636
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,315
I'm not here to see her.

637
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,487
You're here with your nephew.

638
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,699
Still, you should've come on a day
when Jeong-in is here.

639
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,037
-Enjoy your lunch.
-You too.

640
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:40,892
I've heard some things about you,

641
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,979
but you actually seem
a lot more upright and straightforward.

642
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,898
I apologize if I came across as rude.

643
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,274
No, not at all.

644
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,319
Being opinionated is a good thing.

645
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,906
I got a sense that even your father
is somewhat intimidated by you.

646
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,033
It's a compliment.

647
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,121
Thank you
for thinking highly of my father.

648
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,999
What are you trying to say?

649
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,002
I heard that you gave him a great offer.

650
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,882
You've been successfully leading
the foundation for years,

651
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,469
so the fact that you chose
to hire my father after his retirement

652
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,764
shows that you deeply trust him, right?

653
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,103
Regardless of Gi-seok's relationship
with me,

654
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,272
you still made such a decision.

655
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,774
I'm incredibly grateful,

656
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,529
and it taught me the importance of keeping
personal feelings separate from work.

657
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,990
Has Jeong-in called at all?

658
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,368
Take this and go somewhere else.

659
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:45,039
You keep asking me every five minutes.
Why are you so antsy?

660
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,292
You're her mom. Aren't you worried at all?

661
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,127
Why should I be worried?

662
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,087
It's not like she did something wrong.

663
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:55,133
She has a short fuse, you know.
I'm worried she might be rude to him.

664
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,509
I mean, she'll speak out.

665
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,554
But she won't be rude or discourteous.

666
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,807
If anything, you'll ruin it all.

667
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,643
If she calls, tell me right away.

668
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:32,021
UNEXPECTEDLY YOU

669
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,330
It seems like Gi-seok wants to marry you.

670
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:52,875
Have you two talked about it?

671
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,257
Yes, we have talked about it.

672
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,553
It doesn't sound like
you two are on the same page.

673
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,014
I'm sorry.

674
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,226
For what?

675
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,105
I...

676
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:16,816
don't want to get married.

677
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:56,481
We need to stop him.
He's no match for Gi-seok.

678
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,482
Who can stop him?

679
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,984
Have you seen him giving up
when he set his mind?

680
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,068
Eun-u isn't me.

681
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,196
I can put up with anything, but not Eun-u.

682
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,990
I won't forgive anyone who hurts my son.

683
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,742
I'm sorry, Gi-seok.

684
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,286
Someone's stealing his girlfriend.
Can't think rationally.

685
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,954
I bet he's lost it.

686
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,373
Gi-seok is there?
Probably there to see Ji-ho.

687
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,502
I want to be honest and tell everything.

688
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,753
Can I do that?

689
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,880
Will you keep joking?
Do you think I'm stupid?

690
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:22,965
I'm telling you the truth.
Why are you angry?

691
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,510
I've decided to stop wondering

692
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,429
whether or not
I deserve to ask you to be with me.

693
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,306
I'm just going to love you.

694
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,852
I realized Yu Ji-ho loves Lee Jeong-in.

695
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,566
