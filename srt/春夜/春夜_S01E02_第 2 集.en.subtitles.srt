1
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,140
-What do you feel like eating?
-Something good.

2
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,018
-Something good? Korean food?
-You have to do it.

3
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,811
-Korean food would be good.
-Sounds good.

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,563
-Japanese food?
-I like everything.

5
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,273
-Really? Lamb skewers too?
-Go slow.

6
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,649
-Set a screen.
-No.

7
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,822
-Let's go.
-Go for it.

8
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,242
EPISODE 2

9
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,958
Concentrate everyone!

10
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,295
Has he changed?

11
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,546
Or did I just not know?

12
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,465
Your boyfriend can be pretty assertive.

13
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,218
In what aspect?

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,386
The way he talks

15
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,848
and his overall vibe.
Has he always been like that?

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,686
He tries not to show it,
but he does have a strong sense of pride.

17
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,556
Are you okay?

18
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,058
Don't worry. That's not your boyfriend.

19
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,604
-Oh, you're right.
-I find him attractive.

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,942
Are you this smitten by Gi-seok
after that short chat?

21
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,361
Not Gi-seok.
I'm talking about that guy who fell.

22
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,865
I keep noticing him.

23
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,491
Isn't he attractive?

24
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,870
Well, I haven't gotten a good look at him.

25
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,830
There's no need. He just stands out.

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,291
Shall I hit on him?

27
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,084
I told you to behave yourself.

28
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,170
I haven't even done anything.

29
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,133
Be on your good behavior
so that you don't embarrass Gi-seok.

30
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,806
Hey, are you all right?

31
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,809
-Yes, I'm fine.
-My gosh, I'm sorry.

32
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,395
Can you play?

33
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,522
I have to. To win, that is.

34
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,788
Where should we go?
What do you want to eat?

35
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,542
I want to eat so many things, but someone
keeps hinting that I shouldn't say so.

36
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,546
You don't seem like the type
to be intimidated.

37
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,425
I'll go wash up quickly.
Decide what you two want to eat.

38
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,676
Okay.

39
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,261
-I'm excited.
-Gi-seok.

40
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,930
The team wants to go for grilled pork.

41
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,848
-I have to--
-We'll join you guys.

42
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,183
-What's with you?
-What?

43
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,310
You're more than welcome to join us.

44
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,729
Oh, would you not like the idea?

45
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,649
What are you saying?

46
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,400
So? Shall we join them?

47
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,403
They'll be uncomfortable if we come.

48
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,155
Go with them. We'll figure something out.

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,699
Gosh, not at all.
We'd really love to have you two join us.

50
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,077
Hey, Ji-ho.

51
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,246
-Let's go eat.
-What?

52
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,332
Sorry about earlier. Is your foot okay?

53
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,126
Yes, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

54
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,419
God, I feel so bad.

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,840
Oh, right. Hey, that thing
I told you about the other day.

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,300
-What?
-Remember? That thing.

57
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,886
-Get going first. We'll meet you there.
-All right.

58
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,516
Then... Wait for me in the car.

59
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,184
-Okay.
-I'll unlock the doors.

60
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,311
-What's this about?
-Jeez.

61
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,606
Are you a teenage boy or what?

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,858
Don't be so sheepish.

63
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,903
You said you'll start dating again,
didn't you?

64
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,449
Then you have to get used
to mingling with people first.

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,618
I didn't say I wasn't going.

66
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,957
Hey, Ji-ho.
You're acting so weird these days.

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,874
I thought Si-hoon would be home too.

68
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,460
He's busy, you know.

69
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,130
Was Dad okay after we left?

70
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,674
Don't even get me started.

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,053
He seemed awfully angry and upset.

72
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,472
So I pretended I didn't notice it
and left him be.

73
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,517
I made these braised short ribs just now,
so it's still warm.

74
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,519
I'm not hungry now. I'll eat it later.

75
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,899
Do you have some kind of health problem?

76
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,484
No, I told you that I'm fine.

77
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,028
You didn't need to get
this herbal medicine.

78
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh, right. You should take one now.

79
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,618
You seemed to have no energy at all,
so I--

80
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,244
Okay, I'll make sure I take them.

81
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,954
Do you want a cup of coffee?

82
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,373
Have a seat.

83
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,087
Whenever you act like this,

84
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,964
I feel like I shouldn't let
Jeong-in and Jae-in get married.

85
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,594
You were never the affectionate type,
but you used to tell me stuff.

86
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,930
Since you got married,
you've changed so much.

87
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,810
I'll go back to how I used to be.

88
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,270
It's easier said than done.

89
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,582
About Jeong-in...

90
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,709
Don't let her get married.

91
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,839
-For the rest of her life?
-Why not?

92
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,591
Do you also think
that getting married is a must?

93
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,555
I've been living with your dad
for the past 37 years.

94
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,558
I'm old fashioned like him too, you know.

95
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,479
I think it's better
than never getting married.

96
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,234
Why? Did Jeong-in complain a lot to you?

97
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,569
No, it's just what I think.

98
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,904
She's not like me.

99
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,823
She and Dad will clash a lot.

100
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,535
And you'll be so stressed out
stuck between the two of them.

101
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,289
You've had it the hardest.

102
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,003
You've had to put up with all sorts
of things and be a model for your sisters.

103
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,380
You never had your way.

104
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,008
Even with your marriage--

105
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,843
Take care of Jeong-in instead.

106
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,222
She doesn't listen to me, you know.

107
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,225
She's very opinionated.

108
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,811
She sure is a special one.

109
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,314
At least one of us is outspoken.

110
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,316
That's true.

111
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,745
Can I say a few words?

112
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,126
Thank you all for inviting me.
I had such a great time.

113
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,837
I know that you guys
are all younger than me,

114
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,841
but I'll do my best as an older member.

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,177
I'll do my very best.

116
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,386
Thank you everyone!

117
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,096
-Thank you!
-Welcome!

118
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,848
-Okay!
-Let's celebrate.

119
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,183
Everyone, well done.

120
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,101
-You did a good job too.
-Drink up.

121
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,061
I had fun playing.

122
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,987
Did I do well today?

123
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,619
I think you need a lot of practice.

124
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,121
Mind your own business.

125
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,208
Dude, I'm serious.
You need special training.

126
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,252
-You keep...
-I'm not really good at...

127
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,753
Why only me?

128
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,966
-Half an hour a day, starting tomorrow.
-Half an hour?

129
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,980
You need to eat a lot to be strong.

130
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,401
Exactly, you know very well.
Then why did you eat so little?

131
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,071
At the kindergarten?

132
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,911
Someone's inside.

133
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,915
What did you say, Eun-u?

134
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,209
Daddy couldn't hear you. Say it again.

135
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,965
Today, I can't.

136
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,009
I'll come see you in three days.

137
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,389
Okay. In two days, then.

138
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,018
Did I drink?

139
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,439
No, I didn't.

140
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,318
I really didn't.

141
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,369
I'm not lying.

142
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,749
I can't even have just a glass?

143
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,837
All right.

144
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,391
Why are you still here?

145
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,852
I just got off the phone.

146
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,072
Is your kid's name Eun-u?

147
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,076
I overheard it earlier.

148
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,789
I must say, you're a good liar.

149
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,541
You did drink.

150
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,128
He doesn't like it when I drink.
That's why I keep...

151
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,383
I really hate lying.

152
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,889
Go in first.

153
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,100
If we go back in together,
we'll have to lie.

154
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,479
Well, we just used the washroom.

155
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,067
All right, then. Do as you please.

156
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,042
-Maybe I shouldn't have come.
-You're welcome.

157
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,460
Eat up.

158
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,463
-There's more meat.
-Goodbye!

159
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,385
Yes, I had some. Eat up.

160
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,929
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, this guy called me.

161
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,891
I called this starving future civil
servant so that he can have some meat.

162
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,143
I'm glad you called him.

163
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,020
-I hope it's okay that I came.
-Gosh, don't worry.

164
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,772
Don't you worry. I tagged along too.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,150
-Should we do a toast?
-Cheers.

166
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,235
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

167
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,655
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. Welcome.

168
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,412
-You plan to take the civil service exam.
-That's right.

169
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,790
And that guy...

170
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,589
You mean, this guy? I told you earlier
that I work with Gi-seok.

171
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,340
-Oh, that's right.
-Oh, did you?

172
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,759
So, you work at a bank.
You touch money for a living.

173
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,887
-You shouldn't drink anymore.
-Why shouldn't I?

174
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,181
And you? What do you do?

175
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,933
Oh, I'm--

176
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,977
Quiz time. Here's a quiz for you.

177
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,521
What do you think his job is?

178
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,940
Everyone, be quiet. Don't say anything.

179
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,317
Take a guess.

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,652
She won't be able to guess it.
I mean, how would she know?

181
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,362
He must have an unusual job.

182
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,033
-What do you think it is?
-What could it be?

183
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,285
Jeong-in, what do you think it is?

184
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,288
How would I know?

185
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,748
Gosh.

186
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,542
-Can I get a hint?
-A hint?

187
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,380
A quack.

188
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,257
-Something is stuck here.
-Are you okay?

189
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,885
-A doctor, right?
-It's similar.

190
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,428
What's similar to a doctor?

191
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,846
-Think about what they wear.
-What?

192
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,889
The coat.

193
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:28,933
The coat?

194
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,227
What? So, you knew!

195
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,395
Right?

196
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,898
-I think I overheard it earlier.
-I knew it.

197
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,859
Yes, I mentioned earlier
that I'm a pharmacist.

198
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,402
-Jeez.
-Hey, you ruined the fun.

199
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,820
No wonder she seemed sharp-witted.

200
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,365
You're a pharmacist.

201
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,242
I never would've guessed.

202
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,118
-Really?
-Yes.

203
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,955
-By the way...
-Go ahead.

204
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,291
I've been wanting to say this
since earlier.

205
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,753
Both sisters are gorgeous.

206
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,255
-Totally.
-You've just noticed that?

207
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,550
There are three girls in our family,

208
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,468
and I'm the prettiest one.

209
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,055
I think Jeong-in is the prettiest one.

210
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,933
Jeez, come on.

211
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,060
-All right. Do you guys agree?
-My glass is empty.

212
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,436
Those of you who agree, cheers.

213
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,689
-I agree. Cheers.
-I don't agree.

214
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:18,524
Gosh, Gi-seok.

215
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,123
Do we have any fruit?

216
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,313
By the way, why have you been doing that?

217
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,190
To me, this is like meditation.

218
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,068
Why do you even need to meditate?

219
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,071
Who do you think is to blame?

220
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,075
Stop being so overbearing
toward the girls. They're all adults now.

221
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,244
But not real, functioning adults yet.

222
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,081
They're running riot
because you coddle them so much.

223
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,167
How dare they talk back to their father?

224
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,586
Forget it.

225
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,880
I shouldn't have brought it up.

226
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,257
When Jae-in comes back after graduating,

227
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,884
I'm going to marry her off right away.

228
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,094
We're having a hard time
even with Jeong-in.

229
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,846
What are you saying--

230
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,973
Let's give it some thought
before we decide.

231
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,684
That's what Jeong-in wants too.

232
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,603
What does she even know?

233
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,481
Working for a few years
doesn't teach you everything.

234
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,067
And instead of wasting time on this,

235
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,444
you should study how the world works.

236
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,238
You study all you want.

237
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,242
Mr. Principal, go ahead and study
all you want about the world.

238
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,036
Hey!

239
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,208
Is "Hey" my name? Even dogs have names.

240
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,627
Jeez, what's with you today?

241
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,672
If you do that one more time,
I won't let it slide...

242
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,884
You're pathetic.

243
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,557
What the...

244
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,868
"SOMEDAY"

245
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,290
What's going on?

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,420
-Did you two reserve the same song?
-Yes, it looks like they did.

247
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,548
-Just sing it together, then.
-Sing it together.

248
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,924
Sing it with her.

249
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,469
Excuse me for a moment.

250
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,430
Oh, okay.

251
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,433
Hello?

252
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,612
I should stop there.

253
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,363
-Why turn it off?
-It was good.

254
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,907
Just because.

255
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,203
Hey.

256
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,790
Is something going on?

257
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,126
With Ji-ho? He had to leave
because of a family matter.

258
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,881
-Is it something bad?
-No, it's nothing serious.

259
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,092
Which song should I sing?

260
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,260
Why did you stop the song?

261
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,096
I just wanted to.

262
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,515
Why aren't you singing?

263
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,018
-Me? I was going to.
-Yes.

264
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,482
Then while you're making your choice,
let's hear from our special guest singer,

265
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,485
-our future civil servant.
-Gosh.

266
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,946
He actually wanted to be a singer,

267
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,157
but he had to give up
because of his looks.

268
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,827
Can he sing that well?

269
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,205
-He's an amazing singer.
-Check out the melody, guys.

270
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,583
-Oh, I love this song!
-Prepare to be amazed.

271
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,240
I'm sorry,
but could you drive a little faster?

272
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,700
-Sure.
-I apologize.

273
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:49,396
EMERGENCY ROOM

274
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,817
PEDIATRICS

275
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,573
-Oh, you're here.
-How is he?

276
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,994
-What did the doctor say?
-They think it's gastroenteritis.

277
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,539
They said we have to wait
for the full test results.

278
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,919
I had no idea that he was sick.

279
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,547
I feel so bad
that I scolded him for not eating.

280
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,174
It's okay.

281
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,676
You said getting sick
is part of growing up.

282
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,564
Your mom shouldn't have called you.

283
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,984
I should know. It's about my kid.

284
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,821
Don't give Mom a hard time about it.

285
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,783
What about dinner? Have you eaten yet?

286
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,660
Yes.

287
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,121
-Go home. I can stay.
-Don't worry.

288
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,458
What if the two of you get sick too?
Just go home, please.

289
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,502
But you have to go to work tomorrow.

290
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,795
I'll deal with it.

291
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,673
Get going already.

292
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,123
Daddy's here.

293
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,292
Has it been two days already?

294
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,793
No.

295
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,337
I came sooner because I missed you.

296
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,548
Does it still hurt a lot?

297
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,845
When you feel pain, don't hide it.

298
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,306
You have to tell us.

299
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,184
I feel better now that you're here.

300
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,813
I'll be right by your side at all times
from now on.

301
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,526
I'll stay right next to you
so that you never get sick again.

302
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,447
I promise.

303
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,295
Wash up quickly.

304
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,049
Should I send you back to Mom's?

305
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,093
Okay, fine.

306
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,346
And tidy up the table.

307
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,977
By the way, why are you angry?

308
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,937
What are you talking about?

309
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,941
You suddenly got all quiet
at the karaoke bar and you're cranky now.

310
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,860
No, I'm not.

311
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,199
What?

312
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,076
You are cranky.

313
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,123
What's with her?

314
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,029
Are you in bed already?

315
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,826
Nothing's up. I just got out of the shower
and called you.

316
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,830
You must be tired.

317
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,131
Hello.

318
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,385
My gosh, I rarely see you even though
we work at the same broadcasting station.

319
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,762
I know.
Everything is well with you, right?

320
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,639
Well, I'm making ends meet.

321
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,433
Come in for a minute.
Your husband is here.

322
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,978
No, it's okay.

323
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,689
Give him some moral support.
The news isn't until later, right?

324
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,692
Come on.

325
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,159
Your wife is here.

326
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,243
Pardon?

327
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,039
She didn't want to come in
because she was shy, but I insisted.

328
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,836
You're like two peas in a pod.
You're both so shy.

329
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:24,921
Give each other moral support.

330
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,215
Hey, it's good to see you.

331
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,302
I hope the show goes well.

332
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,305
I have to do a good job.
I can't embarrass you, you know.

333
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:38,226
Please take good care of her.
I haven't been that attentive lately,

334
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,644
so she's a little mad at me.

335
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,647
I knew it. I wondered
why she seemed sulky for a moment.

336
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,484
Be good to her. You'll pay dearly
if you neglect a wife like her.

337
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,821
What can I do to be a better husband?

338
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,656
I'll make it up to you.

339
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,201
Will that work?

340
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,079
What time do you think we'll be done?

341
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,166
-Today's show is simple.
-Right.

342
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,709
-So we'll be done early?
-Yes.

343
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,544
-See you later, Seo-in.
-See you.

344
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,806
Hey.

345
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,479
I have to talk to you about something.
Wait for me at home.

346
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,942
What? Shall we meet somewhere outside?

347
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,860
It'd be better actually.
Where would be good?

348
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,417
When I got this job,

349
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,004
I thought librarians just sit gracefully
and read books all day long.

350
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,591
But look at this. Why must we
go through these event posters?

351
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,803
Why do they all look the same to me?

352
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,513
That's what I'm saying.

353
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,978
My gosh. Hey, we haven't even finished
going through these.

354
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,188
There's even more.

355
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,192
Let's stop researching blindly like this
and brainstorm again for the concept.

356
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,195
It's our regular book review event,
so we don't find it exciting.

357
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,283
Should we focus on the latest trends?

358
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
Jeez, I know nothing
about the latest trends.

359
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,787
I guess I'll have to surf the Internet
all night.

360
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,300
How about seasons?

361
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,471
-I like that.
-I know that winter is over,

362
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,433
but "snow" would've been a nice theme.

363
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,685
Like the first snow?

364
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,313
The last snow.

365
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,898
My gosh, that's a refreshing idea.
"The last snow."

366
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,734
-I haven't heard that before.
-Yes.

367
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,614
Jeong-in, I keep seeing
a whole new side of you these days.

368
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,116
You know?

369
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,660
The other day, you sounded like
a hopeless romantic

370
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,996
and today you're all sentimental.

371
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,749
This is how I really am. Satisfied?

372
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:08,877
Gosh, hey.

373
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,629
My brain isn't working
because I haven't eaten anything.

374
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,672
Let's go eat something.

375
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,174
-Great idea.
-I know.

376
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,633
-Shall we?
-Yes.

377
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,055
-My gosh.
-Let's go.

378
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:25,018
MUSIC, TRENDS, SEASONS, SNOW
THE NEXT TIME IT SNOWS

379
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,105
How cute!

380
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,359
-How old are you?
-I'm five.

381
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,194
You're five years old?

382
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,446
You're so adorable.

383
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,283
-Have a good day. Bye.
-Bye!

384
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,993
-Say, "Bye."
-Bye.

385
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,994
Goodbye.

386
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,498
She's so cute.

387
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,252
What's the matter?

388
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,797
What? Nothing. Let's go.

389
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,175
There's nothing I fear more than kids.

390
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,968
Why?

391
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,888
They're so innocent and pure.

392
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,264
What if I hurt them?

393
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,226
Hey, do you ever think that?

394
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,521
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

395
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,113
-What about Eun-u?
-I made sure he's asleep.

396
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,034
I made all this food for you
because you always eat out.

397
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,411
Why are you eating like a bird?

398
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,162
I'm eating, Mom.

399
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,458
Is it okay that you missed work today?

400
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,043
I've told my co-workers.

401
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,547
Eun-u needs to stay here
for another day or two,

402
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,298
so I'll stay here with him. Okay?

403
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,633
Finish your food, go home,

404
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,552
and go back to work tomorrow.

405
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,178
No, I can take a few days off.

406
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,681
Gosh, you shouldn't miss work.

407
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,183
It's not like you have no other option.

408
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,185
Why inconvenience your co-workers?

409
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,478
Don't do that.

410
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,649
Mom.

411
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,194
Shall I move back in?

412
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,199
Living far from work
won't improve the situation at all.

413
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,870
Do you think you'll actually get to see
Eun-u more in the morning and night?

414
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,663
Forget it.

415
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,126
I'm more worried about you.

416
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,086
You're still so young.

417
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,632
Being young is great. I still have
many opportunities ahead.

418
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,723
Do you date at all?

419
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,102
Occasionally.

420
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,189
Have you met anyone that you like?

421
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,358
No, not yet.

422
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,363
Your soul mate will come find you.

423
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,410
-You think so?
-Yes, of course.

424
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,370
Nothing can stop your destiny.

425
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,916
And she'd better come find you.
Will you be single forever?

426
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,128
Gosh, you're obviously not even worried.

427
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,470
Thank you.

428
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,402
Even this one can't make it.

429
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,613
What's happening this week?

430
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,491
-Someone else can't make it?
-Ji-ho can't come.

431
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,827
We might not have enough people.

432
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:34,249
He left early that day saying
something came up. Is it because of that?

433
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,709
Yes, I think so.

434
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,295
What happened?

435
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,676
-This is top secret.
-Okay.

436
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,638
Actually, he has a kid.

437
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,058
-Oh, he's married?
-No.

438
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,020
He had a girlfriend back in college
and she was quite young.

439
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,981
About 24 at the time?

440
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,233
-Ji-ho was 28 or 29 back then.
-I see.

441
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,153
She hid the fact that she was pregnant
and fell off the face of the earth.

442
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,447
Then she showed up after eight months.

443
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,491
-Out of the blue?
-Yes.

444
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,953
They talked about getting married

445
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,872
and maybe doing it after she gives birth.

446
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,332
She lived with his family
for a little while,

447
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,127
but she vanished again one day.

448
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,421
So, what happened?
Did he not look for her?

449
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,590
When that happened, Ji-ho totally lost it.

450
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,927
He even took a leave of absence
and went everywhere looking for her,

451
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,387
but he couldn't find her.

452
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,224
Later, he found out
that she had already left the country.

453
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,020
My goodness.

454
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,149
-That's crazy.
-Yes.

455
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,527
Jeez, it must have been so hard for him.

456
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,447
A lot of time has passed,
so he's okay now.

457
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,657
But back then...

458
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,201
He was utterly distraught.

459
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,623
Oh, dear. I feel bad for him.

460
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,335
If I had known,
I would've been nicer to him.

461
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,795
-Why? What do you mean?
-What?

462
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,048
I just feel bad for him.

463
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,135
Don't feel bad.
Who cares if he's a single dad?

464
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,512
He makes good money, and he's healthy.

465
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,348
Also, he has wonderful parents.

466
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,058
Everything else is fine.

467
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,226
How is that fine?

468
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,312
What woman would like that?

469
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,401
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

470
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,050
MISO PHARMACY

471
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,076
WOORI PHARMACY

472
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,930
Here you go.

473
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,184
Thank you.

474
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,957
Thank you.

475
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
What are you doing here?

476
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,465
I'm just stopping by.
I'll be here tomorrow.

477
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,759
I said it's okay. Don't kill yourself.

478
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,928
It's fine. I can work.

479
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,806
What did the doctor say? Is he okay now?

480
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,559
-Yes, he's fine now.
-Thank goodness.

481
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,938
We just brewed persimmon leaf tea.
Do you want some?

482
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,816
No, thanks. I'll be off. Take it easy.

483
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,318
-Get home safely.
-You can come in late tomorrow morning.

484
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,324
Can I help you find something?

485
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,077
Sorry? It's okay. I'm getting this.

486
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,081
Here.

487
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,751
-Your total is 2,000 won.
-Okay.

488
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,088
Here you go.

489
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,464
Thank you.

490
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,721
I'll wait for you at the corner.

491
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,394
-Here's your 8,000 won.
-Thank you.

492
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,188
-Bye.
-Bye.

493
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,741
Did you come here to see me?

494
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,121
Why would I come all the way here
just to buy this?

495
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,083
What's up?

496
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,545
What's up with you?

497
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,885
They're closing soon, so they'll be out
any minute. Let's go somewhere else.

498
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,096
Can't we just talk here?

499
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:26,100
If they see us together,
they'll start talking about you.

500
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,382
My son was a little sick.

501
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,843
How? Is it something serious?

502
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,431
He'll be fine in a few days.

503
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,267
That's good news.

504
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,106
I was worried after you left so abruptly.

505
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,321
It seemed serious judging by
how your friends kept their mouths shut.

506
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,699
I was going to forget about it,

507
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,203
but here I am.

508
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,789
You could've just texted.

509
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,875
But you rarely respond.

510
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,673
I did that on purpose,

511
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,675
and I already told you why I did that.

512
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,975
Well,

513
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,019
I've moved on,

514
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,438
so you don't have to worry so much.

515
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,200
What did you mean earlier when you said

516
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,328
that people will start talking about me?

517
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,959
I'm not the average man.

518
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,380
"Who is the woman next to such a man?"

519
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,882
"What's her story?"

520
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,385
"Is she a single parent too?"

521
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,721
People will speculate.

522
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,268
You could become the subject of gossip.

523
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,359
Is that why you turned down
my offer to be friends?

524
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,902
You know...

525
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,239
that's not why I did that.

526
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,203
You said you moved on.

527
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,497
We can be friends then.

528
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,172
Why do you want...

529
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,425
to be my friend?

530
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,095
No reason.

531
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,266
I don't need your pity.

532
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,854
You have some sort
of weird victim mentality.

533
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,024
You'd understand if you were in my shoes.

534
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,656
Are you turning me down again then?

535
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,995
Being friends isn't a big deal.

536
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,664
We can ask each other how we're doing

537
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,169
and meet from time to time if we want.

538
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,759
What would your boyfriend say?

539
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:53,265
Are you worried about me
or are you scared for yourself?

540
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,522
This doesn't really need to be said,

541
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,360
but I believe
that my life should be respected.

542
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,324
From here on out,
I'd appreciate it if you didn't

543
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,787
assume or worry about things
I don't mention.

544
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,500
It makes me uncomfortable.

545
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,759
Let's give it a shot.

546
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,764
Let's be friends.

547
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,687
Have you had a sudden change of heart?

548
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,274
You're funny.

549
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,526
Then you just gained a funny friend.

550
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,733
It's your sister.

551
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,197
What is she doing over there?

552
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,827
Who is she with?

553
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,622
It looks like Yeong-jae.

554
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,540
Who?

555
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,876
From that day?

556
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,677
It is Yeong-jae.

557
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,181
What's so funny?

558
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,975
The fact that they're together.

559
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,810
How is that funny?

560
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,691
What's wrong with her?

561
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,029
What's wrong?
They must've exchanged numbers.

562
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,114
Unbelievable.

563
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,617
Are you getting out?

564
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,377
How do you expect to carry this on
if you think that's unbelievable?

565
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,795
We're friends, so who cares?

566
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,467
I usually choose my words wisely,

567
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,761
but I don't know why I spurt things out
when I'm with you.

568
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,349
Well, that made us become friends.

569
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,742
You're home late.

570
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,582
Hey, Jae-in.

571
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,669
Where were you tonight?

572
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,170
I saw everything, so be honest.

573
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,005
Saw what?

574
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,758
I saw you hanging out
with that future civil servant out front.

575
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,385
Why didn't you say hi?

576
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,555
Why were you with him?

577
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,933
We're friends. We agreed to be friends.

578
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,186
Someone your age shouldn't be his friend.

579
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,565
Age and other aspects
don't matter with friendships.

580
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,609
It's childish of you to think so.

581
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,747
Jeong-in, about that pharmacist.

582
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,543
-What about him?
-He seems decent.

583
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:56,962
Why's that?

584
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,131
Did someone say something?

585
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,175
Yeong-jae talked about his friends,

586
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,885
and the pharmacist seemed like the best.

587
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,137
Should I make a move?

588
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:07,764
Why not?

589
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,684
One son-in-law is a doctor
and now a pharmacist can be added.

590
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,186
Dad will be thrilled.

591
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,313
Don't take it too far.

592
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,607
Just remember
they're all connected to Gi-seok.

593
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,942
That's your problem, not mine.

594
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,987
Just think about it.

595
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,072
It'll be an issue for you to date

596
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,116
anyone from that group,

597
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,659
but not me.

598
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,426
Why are you following me out?

599
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,262
Go back inside and readjust the budget.

600
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,765
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Kwon,

601
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,851
is there an issue with the budget plan?

602
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:57,272
You should've read the documents
before signing them

603
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,358
and sending them up for my approval.

604
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,445
Do you not care anymore
because you'll be leaving soon?

605
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,989
No, of course not. I'd never be like that.

606
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,575
-What happened is that--
-It's uncanny.

607
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,787
The school operates in
a similar fashion every year,

608
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,665
but the budget only increases
and never decreases.

609
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,877
This is why they say
no one can be trusted in this world.

610
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,714
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be more thorough next time.

611
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,008
You're always all talk.

612
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,010
"I'll be more thorough next time."

613
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,557
I loathe those who get by
on just their empty promises.

614
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,225
I hear you, sir.

615
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,062
That reminds me.

616
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,857
How about we grab
that lunch you mentioned last time?

617
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,820
I have plans with Assemblyman Jang.

618
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,781
He's buying to celebrate
his daughter becoming a professor.

619
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,366
I see.

620
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:51,785
Enjoy, then.

621
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,008
Gi-seok, yes. It's been a while.

622
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,471
Of course. Why haven't you been in touch?

623
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,683
We should if that's what you'd like.

624
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,352
How about today?

625
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:01,647
Where are you meeting my dad?

626
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,524
Shouldn't you know what it's about
before getting riled up?

627
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,818
It's probably about us getting married.

628
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,403
And that annoys you?

629
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,199
-That's not it.
-Of course it is.

630
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,744
You're right. I'm pissed.

631
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,954
I hate being pushed into it like this.

632
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,666
You don't want to get married, do you?

633
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:26,213
Is it marriage you hate, or just me?

634
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:30,842
What is it?

635
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,391
Why aren't you answering?

636
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,394
Gi-seok.

637
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,647
I'm listening.

638
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,443
I think that we should
respect each other more.

639
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,031
I don't want to get married just because

640
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,742
we've been dating long enough.

641
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,080
I'm sure that's how you feel too.

642
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,666
Or maybe you don't.

643
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:09,005
It's not like anything has changed
between us, so I guess--

644
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,173
Hold on.

645
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,469
You're acting strange.

646
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,014
Something's different.

647
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,226
Jeong-in.

648
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
Yes?

649
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,147
Is there something you're not telling me?

650
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,274
No.

651
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,902
Jeong-in.

652
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,531
I'm sorry, but can we talk again later?

653
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,951
Go home after work.
I'll call you on my way to you.

654
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,496
What about my dad?

655
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,915
I'll take care of that. See you later.

656
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,447
Yes, Father. It's Gi-seok.

657
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,492
I'm sorry about this,

658
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,620
but a meeting came up for this evening.

659
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,498
I'll have to take a rain check.

660
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,417
That's right.

661
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,836
-Take care.
-Bye.

662
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,591
Don't you feel bad that his son is sick?

663
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,385
More so because he's a man.

664
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,179
Exactly.

665
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,308
You should go home if you're that worried.

666
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,353
He was discharged this morning
and is playing right now.

667
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,273
It's a particularly slow day today.

668
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:55,362
Isn't it a good thing
since it means less people are sick?

669
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,365
If you open a pharmacy,
you'll go under in three months.

670
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,325
I'm taking out the trash.

671
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,286
How much will it cost to open one?

672
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,373
It depends on where the location is.

673
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,083
Are you considering it?

674
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,503
I'm thinking
about moving back in with my parents.

675
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,218
I'm a mother myself, but some might think

676
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,345
that I'm not when they hear this.

677
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,431
After my divorce, I asked my mom
to help out with the kids.

678
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,601
To be honest, I regret it.

679
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,604
The amount of help I received
was enormous,

680
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,190
but I couldn't have a life.

681
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,652
She was always watching the kids
and doing chores,

682
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,530
so I thought I shouldn't do other things
and be with my kids.

683
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,700
I wasn't even able to comfortably grab
a beer with my friends.

684
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,244
Once you move back home,

685
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:45,871
Yu Ji-ho will be gone.

686
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,374
You'll only live as a son
and the father of your child.

687
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,797
I want to tell you to be selfish.

688
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,092
You have the right to live a happy life.

689
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,118
Where's Jae-in?

690
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,288
I don't know.
She wasn't here when I got home.

691
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,334
-Can I get you anything?
-I'm good.

692
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,226
Tell me then.

693
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,812
What's the issue?

694
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,484
I told you everything on the phone

695
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:59,819
although it wasn't much.

696
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,823
I'm glad you know.

697
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,714
When the thought of marriage suddenly...

698
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,634
becomes a reality,

699
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,553
they say...

700
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,224
most get cold feet...

701
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,894
and rethink the idea as a whole.

702
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,483
But your reaction is more than that.

703
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,071
Am I wrong?

704
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,077
I don't know.

705
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,207
What exactly do you mean by that?

706
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,211
You're usually smart
and know what you want.

707
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,338
Why have you become
so vague all of a sudden?

708
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,801
Beats me.

709
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,763
Something must have triggered this.

710
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,849
No?

711
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:15,395
Only that can explain this
and help me understand.

712
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,943
Gi-seok,

713
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,451
I think we need a break.

714
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,083
Are you breaking up with me?

715
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,056
We'll end up married anyway, right?

716
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,770
-My family hasn't--
-If marriage was my only goal,

717
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,814
I wouldn't have stayed with you.

718
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,959
Is time the only thing you need?

719
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:28,468
Are you sure that
there's nothing else going on?

720
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,431
I'm sure.

721
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,147
Fine. I'll give you space then.

722
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:52,700
Are you leaving?

723
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,995
You'd prefer that.

724
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:58,915
That's cruel to hear.

725
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,510
Get some rest
and reduce some of the anxiety.

726
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,899
I want to go to the zoo.

727
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,736
It's still too cold,
so there won't be many animals outside.

728
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,948
Dinosaurs don't get cold.

729
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,409
They actually do.

730
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,917
Let me grab that for you.

731
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,132
Don't. I can do it myself.

732
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,597
All right. I'll be right over there,

733
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,057
so don't push up too high. Got it?

734
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,520
I'll be behind you.

735
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,124
LEE JEONG-IN

736
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,292
How have things been?

737
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,070
Good. How have you been?

738
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,907
It's probably your day off.
I'm actually at work today.

739
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,930
Can I ask what you do for a living?

740
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:34,445
Jeong-in, can you take a look
at my header for the library?

741
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,197
We both know you did a good job.

742
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,118
Hey.

743
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:43,371
Weren't you and Gi-seok on a break?
Are you back together?

744
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,331
It's not him.

745
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:48,418
Then that's more suspicious
considering the smile on your face.

746
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,255
-Aren't you busy?
-I am.

747
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,717
Darn.

748
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,112
Are we really off to see dinosaurs?

749
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:18,531
Yes, we are.

750
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:23,578
But you said that
the dinosaurs were too cold to come out.

751
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,290
They're not at the zoo but somewhere else.

752
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,792
Where?

753
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:33,296
Someplace warm.

754
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,687
ARCHIVE
RESTRICTED AREA

755
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,716
WERE THERE DINOSAURS THAT LIKED FLOWERS?

756
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,008
My gosh!

757
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,223
I know who you are.

758
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,477
You're Eun-u, right?

759
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,604
How do you know me?

760
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:57,774
How do I know you?

761
01:02:58,691 --> 01:02:59,525
Take a guess.

762
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,861
Dad, who is she?

763
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,489
Who do you think I am?

764
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:05,865
Go ahead and guess.

765
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,163
Mom?

766
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,291
I knew something was up.

767
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,961
-We agreed to be friends.
-Because that's all you could be?

768
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,796
No physical response means

769
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,006
that there are no feelings left.

770
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,508
Think of the opposite though.

771
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,134
The response will be involuntary.

772
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,970
-Are you getting married?
-Soon.

773
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,221
We've been dating for a while.

774
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:11,597
Ji-ho has a kid.

775
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,307
He met the mom at a young age,

776
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,101
but she left after having the baby.

777
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:16,769
He should've done better.

778
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,563
Would that have changed things?

779
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,648
Doing better or not isn't the issue here.

780
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,024
Feelings have changed.

781
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,610
Are we at a point where
we need to work on our relationship?

782
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,945
Is there someone else?

783
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,446
I'm actually not sure.

784
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,741
I don't know what's okay and
what is considered as "crossing the line."

785
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,201
That's why this is frustrating.

786
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,703
I ended it before I get crazier.

787
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:36,330
Because I know how tough
things will get for her.

788
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,252
