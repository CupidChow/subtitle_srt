1
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,183
I...

2
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,852
don't want to get married.

3
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,862
Are you saying

4
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,992
that you won't marry my son?

5
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,371
It's why I asked
to talk to you alone today.

6
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,416
It's not Gi-seok's fault.

7
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
If he were here,

8
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,924
he would've made it out to be though.

9
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,135
However, that's not the case.

10
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,555
We...

11
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,975
just failed one another.

12
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,733
EPISODE 8

13
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,330
I guess we should've talked sooner.

14
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,376
Take care, then.

15
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,735
Kid, what's wrong?

16
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,696
Why? Gosh, it's all right.

17
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,114
Where's your mom?

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,283
Do you know where your mom is?

19
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,954
Your mom will be soon. It's all right.

20
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,414
-Eun-u.
-There she is.

21
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,874
Gosh, she's here.

22
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,084
What's wrong?

23
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,919
Daddy...

24
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,130
I can't find my dad.

25
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,174
It's all right.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,677
Don't cry, Eun-u.
Your dad will be here soon.

27
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,223
It's okay. I'm here, aren't I?

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,725
Ms. Lee!

29
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,144
What a relief.

30
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,272
I think she is his teacher.

31
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,858
-It's all right.
-Take care.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,318
Thank you.

33
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,944
You're good now.

34
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,362
SEONGDONG PUBLIC LIBRARY

35
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,869
It's all right.

36
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,168
-Eun-u, your dad's here.
-What's wrong?

37
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,629
Dad!

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,672
What's going on? Were you crying?

39
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,758
It's all right.

40
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,428
He was playing with the other kids, so...

41
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,098
It's true.

42
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,519
Eun-u, you're being a baby.
I was right outside.

43
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,854
Are you blaming him again?

44
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,940
Of course not.

45
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,526
It's all right.

46
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,456
CHILDREN'S READING ROOM

47
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,925
Why did you bring him here
if you weren't going to watch him?

48
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,304
See? He was fine on his own,

49
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,348
so I just...

50
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,852
stepped out to get some fresh air.

51
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,897
It only takes seconds
for kids to get into trouble.

52
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,317
You sound like you've raised one.

53
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,654
I'm not a parent,
but even I know that it's wrong.

54
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,864
But how could you, his father,
be so reckless?

55
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,160
You're right.
I lack as a dad in many ways.

56
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,750
-Are you sulking?
-As if.

57
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,378
You are.

58
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,881
Why are you here anyway?

59
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,176
I work here, remember?

60
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,929
But it's your day off.

61
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,059
Did you choose to come today
because I wouldn't be here?

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,105
Why?

63
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,317
Isn't it obvious?

64
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,865
I was quite happy to bump into you though.

65
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,743
I guess that wasn't the case for you.

66
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,416
Anyway, don't be too considerate.

67
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,252
I'd prefer it that way.

68
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,596
What are you doing here?

69
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,431
-Why are you here?
-Your coffee.

70
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,476
I needed to vent,
but you were at work today.

71
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,397
Still, why come to the office
on your day off?

72
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,523
You're insane.

73
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,446
How did it go? Did you speak your mind?

74
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,284
I guess. There's going to be
some serious blowback though.

75
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,205
I see you set off the bomb.

76
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,710
That pharmacist is here with his nephew.

77
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,049
A young man spending time
with his nephew on his day off?

78
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,260
That's not easy for anyone to do, right?

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,640
What?

80
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,310
Nothing.

81
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,525
Are you breaking it off with Gi-seok next?

82
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,154
How did Gi-seok and I end up here?

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,116
That's how it is
with long-term relationships.

84
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,411
The process of breaking up
begins before you even know it.

85
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,457
It's not just that.

86
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,669
I didn't even know I've been going through
the process myself,

87
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,213
but I was brazen enough
to give others advice.

88
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,965
To whom?

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,227
If only you'd eat your meals this well.

90
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,274
Did you get scared
when you couldn't find me?

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,444
I thought you had abandoned me.

92
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,363
That's absurd. Why would I ever do that?

93
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,198
You were gone.

94
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,584
But the teacher came,
so I wasn't scared anymore.

95
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,755
Are you fond of her?

96
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,133
-Yes.
-Why?

97
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,846
She's nice.

98
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,557
What about you?

99
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,518
What do you mean?

100
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,687
Are you fond of her too?

101
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,024
Yes.

102
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,277
-Why?
-What?

103
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,490
Because she's nice.

104
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,372
Dig in.

105
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,600
-Are you going somewhere?
-To Jeong-in's.

106
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,353
-What?
-She's not picking up.

107
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,147
They must still be talking then.

108
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,609
They'll part ways before dinner,
so I'll go there and wait.

109
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,694
Tae-hak, please.

110
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,489
I need to know what happened.

111
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,199
I'm sure someone will call.

112
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,868
Either Jeong-in or Mr. Kwon will call us.

113
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,828
But she's not picking up.

114
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,456
What's Mr. Kwon's number?

115
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,999
Don't be like this.

116
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,168
What's there to be scared of?

117
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,462
As parents, we have the right to say

118
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,506
that he should be nice to our daughter.

119
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,715
Don't you dare.

120
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,302
This is wrong, you know.

121
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,847
I know he's your boss,
but family still comes first.

122
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,684
Your family and children
should be your priority.

123
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,811
You think I'm being a coward,

124
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,273
but that's because
you don't know how he is.

125
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,483
Once he makes up his mind,

126
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,236
there's nothing you can do to change it.

127
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,884
-Take me to Gi-seok's.
-Yes, sir.

128
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,731
Can I get you some tea?

129
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,535
Was the meeting with Jeong-in

130
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,704
uncomfortable?

131
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,086
She's a decent young woman.

132
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,923
You don't see women like her these days.

133
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,509
She's even more mature than you.

134
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,474
It won't be easy.

135
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,686
She's not the type
that you can easily contain.

136
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,524
Try to think of it long-term.

137
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,736
Like I said, she has a rare quality.

138
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,864
Those rare are harder to obtain anyway.

139
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,141
Do your best.

140
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,020
-I will.
-Let's go.

141
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:26,120
CHILDREN'S READING ROOM

142
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,292
-Hi.
-Where are you?

143
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,338
I had to stop by the office.

144
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,382
It's just that you didn't call.

145
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,302
How did it go with my father?

146
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,054
Wasn't it uncomfortable?

147
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,515
He was kind and generous.

148
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,852
My father is quite the silent type,

149
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,355
but I guess he liked you.

150
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,444
I'm not busy, but...

151
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,696
Wait, can you hold?

152
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,408
-What are you looking for?
-The restock log.

153
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,701
Oh, that.

154
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,287
-Gi-seok, can I call you back--
-Sure.

155
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,876
Isn't he pissed?

156
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,462
Actually, he's being sweeter than usual.

157
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,298
It's so like him though.

158
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,428
He's not going down without a fight.

159
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,349
He knows that you would've
spoken your mind to his father,

160
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,059
so what else can it be?

161
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,187
He's going to try and power through this.

162
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
PHARMACIST

163
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,908
We're heading out.

164
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,375
Gosh, Jeong-in.

165
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm almost at the library.

166
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,434
Take your time. I'll grab a cup of coffee.

167
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,816
Let's have something nice for dinner.

168
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,651
-Pork cutlet?
-Sure thing.

169
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,071
What about Ms. Lee?

170
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,325
She'll be down soon,
so be nice and proper.

171
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,784
Okay.

172
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,871
Ms. Lee!

173
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,839
I'll be right back.

174
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,226
What's wrong?

175
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,978
Gi-seok's here.

176
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,357
So?

177
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,945
There's another exit
at the end of the hall.

178
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:50,991
Ji-ho...

179
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,036
Are you even going to
make my son miserable?

180
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,540
I think you misunderstood me.

181
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,292
No, this one's on you.

182
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,380
You told me I don't have to be
too considerate.

183
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,633
Why is this case any different?

184
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,222
Eun-u isn't me.

185
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,059
I can put up with anything, but not Eun-u.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,438
I won't forgive anyone who hurts my son.

187
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,162
Let's go.

188
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,603
Ji-ho?

189
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,191
You should say hello.

190
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,817
Hello.

191
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:50,944
Oh, hi.

192
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:52,946
Hi, there.

193
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,158
You're quite handsome, aren't you?

194
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,205
Didn't I see you here before too?

195
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,625
You must come here often.

196
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,669
Hyeon-su said you live near the pharmacy.

197
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,172
I do.

198
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,050
My girlfriend works here.

199
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,718
Did you know that?

200
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,388
Yes, I did.

201
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,102
They have
a nice selection of children's books.

202
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,396
I see.

203
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
It's late, so...

204
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,067
Oh, sure.

205
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,319
Hold on.

206
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,282
Wait.

207
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,995
-Gi-seok, please.
-It's fine.

208
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,163
-Please don't.
-Let go.

209
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,668
Ask your dad to buy you
something delicious.

210
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,211
Okay?

211
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,427
Dad.

212
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,516
Can we buy pork cutlet with this?

213
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,227
-Yes.
-Yours too?

214
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,688
Yes.

215
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,629
SEONGDONG PUBLIC LIBRARY

216
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,313
Hey, what's wrong?

217
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,609
Why are you crying?

218
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,112
Gi-seok.

219
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,032
It's okay. Please don't cry.

220
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,743
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,705
What?

222
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,875
I'm sorry, Gi-seok.

223
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,277
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM CLASSES

224
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,656
You shouldn't be late after
asking someone to buy you a meal.

225
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,075
You're the one who offered.

226
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,952
I'm still buying though.

227
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,578
You're right.

228
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,456
Your eyes are bloated.
Did you get into an argument?

229
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,792
I ended it with Jae-in.

230
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,211
You got dumped again?

231
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,590
I'm the one who did the dumping.

232
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,301
How so?

233
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,764
You made the right choice.

234
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,893
It's best to stay away from those sisters.

235
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,023
Ji-ho might have fallen for her,
but it'll soon pass.

236
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,486
He hasn't dated in quite a while.

237
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,322
He could've mistaken kindness
for romantic feelings.

238
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,702
You're desperate, aren't you?

239
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,330
This just can't happen.

240
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,333
We need to stop him.
He's no match for Gi-seok.

241
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,293
Who can stop him?

242
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,254
Have you seen him giving up
when he set his mind to something?

243
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,506
You're right.

244
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,926
Unbelievable.

245
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,512
How can I face Gi-seok again
if this gets out?

246
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,931
I guess it could get awkward.

247
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,601
Still, it's wrong of him to blame others

248
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,187
for his girlfriend falling out of love.

249
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,521
Seriously?

250
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,815
Someone's stealing his girlfriend.

251
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,276
He can't think rationally.

252
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,029
All he'll see is red.

253
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,115
Let's call Ji-ho out.

254
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,909
He went to the library with Eun-u.

255
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,371
Shit. Are they having
family outings already?

256
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,333
He mentioned going to the library before.

257
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,336
I wonder if it was where Jeong-in works.

258
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,882
He's lost his mind.

259
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,926
Is he even thinking?

260
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,761
What's making him so bold?

261
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,058
-Jeong-in.
-Why is she being bold then?

262
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,227
Ji-ho.

263
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,772
What are you talking about?

264
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,192
Love, you idiot.

265
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,076
He was going to find out sooner or later.

266
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,121
Although, he might feel
especially betrayed

267
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,582
since it was on the day
you met his father.

268
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,754
Ji-ho was furious when he left.

269
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,215
Aren't you worried about Gi-seok?

270
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,302
And the pharmacist isn't
in a position to get mad at you.

271
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,179
He practically used

272
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,181
his nephew to find an excuse to see you.

273
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,933
That's not it.

274
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,393
Of course it is.

275
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,229
He felt awkward to come alone,
so he brought a child.

276
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,442
-It's his son.
-Yes, I saw him. He's obviously a boy.

277
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,613
Whose son?

278
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,283
His son.

279
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,995
He's Ji-ho's son.

280
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,708
Hold on.

281
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,543
Give me a second.

282
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,714
Is the pharmacist married?

283
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,549
Jeong-in!

284
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,885
He's a single father.

285
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,263
Gosh, Jeong-in.

286
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,224
It's why I said I wasn't confident enough.

287
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,226
This has nothing to do with confidence.

288
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,980
What are you going to do?

289
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,322
I'm lost right now.

290
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,908
It's giving me a headache.

291
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,578
Just wait a second.

292
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,845
Did something bad happen?

293
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,851
Mom, shall I meet the lady
you wanted to set me up with?

294
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,312
Why?

295
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,607
Just the other day,
you said there's someone you like.

296
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,027
Because you wanted to set me up.

297
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,322
You should date the one that you like.

298
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,744
There's no guarantee that the one I like
will want to date someone like me.

299
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,372
There's nothing wrong with you.

300
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,876
Everyone has scars,
so you can just call it even.

301
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,961
You don't lack anything.

302
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,255
You're smart and good-looking.

303
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,966
Plus, you have a good job.
You're a pretty good catch.

304
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,639
So I shouldn't date someone
who isn't scarred?

305
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,683
Obviously.

306
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,437
Not everyone he meets
will be in the same situation as he is.

307
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,024
Because of Eun-u?

308
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,777
That is one of the reasons.

309
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,531
But why would you want to put someone
without such a flaw through all that?

310
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,492
That's selfish. It's bad karma.

311
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,828
Don't even think that it may be possible.

312
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:35,171
That lady you like...
Has she never been married?

313
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,800
Give up immediately.

314
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,177
No, just give up.

315
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,681
Why are you jumping
to conclusions like that?

316
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,518
Honey, you'd better not encourage him.

317
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,103
It won't work out.

318
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,855
Mom.

319
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,357
No matter what it is, there is

320
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:58,027
a world of difference between those who've
experienced it and those who haven't.

321
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,196
She has no idea what it's like,

322
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,115
and you'll expect her to understand you?

323
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,618
That's so selfish. How unfair is that?

324
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,328
Enough, stop.

325
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,042
It's your life,

326
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,170
so decide wisely.

327
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,297
That's all you can do.

328
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,403
Seo-in,
did you ask Si-hoon to meet you here?

329
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,905
No, he's here for a show.

330
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,783
What are you doing here?

331
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,003
Jae-in, it's you.

332
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,672
What are you doing here?

333
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,050
And you should've called me.

334
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:02,967
Why?

335
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,887
What do you mean?
So that we can grab a meal together.

336
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,847
She hasn't changed one bit.

337
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,934
But your parents didn't mention
anything about Jae-in.

338
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,728
They said nothing about her being back
when we visited them.

339
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,230
She came back recently.

340
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,274
-Shouldn't you head in--
-Hey, when shall we hang out?

341
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,361
Anytime is fine for us,
so come over, okay?

342
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,614
Right, we're going to invite
Jeong-in and her boyfriend over soon.

343
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,366
You guys can all come over together.

344
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,202
You prefer staying in anyway.

345
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:32,580
And I have to head in for a shoot now.

346
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,458
I'm running late. Let's hang out, okay?

347
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,211
And honey, I'll see you at home.
See you later.

348
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,170
Jae-in...

349
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,714
will stay at our place.

350
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,760
Sorry to inconvenience you.

351
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,720
Jeong-in keeps pestering me.

352
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,599
I see. That's not good.
Yes, stay at our place.

353
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,561
-The shoot's about to start. I have to go.
-Okay, bye.

354
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,691
You haven't changed at all.

355
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,362
-Call me later.
-Okay.

356
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,574
What's going on?

357
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,953
We're getting a divorce.

358
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,546
I asked you to come meet me today
to tell you that you should stay

359
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,089
at my place for the time being.

360
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,218
Okay, but why?

361
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,596
What does it have to do
with you getting a divorce?

362
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,807
We're not living together.

363
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,436
But he comes by occasionally
when he's drunk and bothers me.

364
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,856
So you want me to be your gatekeeper?

365
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,318
I'll give you an allowance.

366
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,695
That's a given.

367
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,158
It won't be for long. Please do it for me.

368
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,077
By the way,

369
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,998
Si-hoon didn't seem to know about
Jeong-in wanting to break up with Gi-seok.

370
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,169
I guess Gi-seok never showed it
in front of him.

371
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,339
It'll take some time for them
to end things.

372
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,384
Both of my sisters are in such a mess.

373
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,262
What's wrong with Jeong-in?

374
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,516
She's changed.

375
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,812
I should meet up with her soon
and catch up.

376
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,980
Not now.

377
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,443
Give her some time.

378
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,863
She's so confused right now.

379
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,118
Then stay with her a little longer
and look after her.

380
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,914
What if Si-hoon comes by again?

381
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,458
Just look after Jeong-in for now.

382
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,096
Gi-seok, did you have lunch?

383
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,224
I couldn't find you
when I was going for lunch.

384
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,145
What's wrong?

385
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,151
Did something happen?

386
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,958
No, it's nothing.

387
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,570
DAD

388
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,477
Are you not confident?

389
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,648
You said you'll have regrets.

390
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,195
I have to think about Eun-u as well.

391
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,032
You still have a lot to learn
to become a real parent.

392
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,618
One of the things that people hate

393
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,787
among the comments
their parents often make is,

394
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,165
"I gave up and sacrificed everything
for you."

395
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,501
Do you think Eun-u will thank you
if you tell him when he's all grown up

396
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,420
that you gave up dating because of him?

397
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,005
That's not what I meant.

398
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,924
Then why use Eun-u as an excuse?
That's so immature and petty.

399
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,385
-Hye-jeong.
-Don't call me like that.

400
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,554
Am I wrong? You're being so immature.

401
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,933
My mom told me not to even dream
about dating someone who isn't like me.

402
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,268
Don't be ridiculous.

403
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,396
So? Are you saying you're torn
because of what your mother said?

404
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,942
You said you want to be reckless.

405
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,736
Go for it. I've got your back.

406
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,615
Just do it, or you'll have regrets.

407
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,117
If it doesn't work out,
you can give up then.

408
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,785
She's too good for that.

409
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,291
You're annoying the hell out of me.
I hope things don't work out, then.

410
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,002
Bye.

411
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,272
Hey, Gi-seok!

412
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
-My gosh, hello.
-What?

413
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,109
-Is that Gi-seok?
-Oh, my.

414
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,778
-Long time no see.
-You're here too.

415
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,030
-How have you been?
-What's gotten into you?

416
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,407
Oh, I was in the area
and thought I should stop by.

417
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,701
-I see.
-Nice to see you.

418
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,287
How's your girlfriend?
You're still together, right?

419
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,872
What was her name again?

420
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,291
-Jeong-in?
-Oh, yes. Jeong-in.

421
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,335
-You should've brought her.
-Yes.

422
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,672
Well, next time. I'll get a beer too.

423
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,839
Sure, just a second.

424
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,967
Are you not getting married?

425
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
We promised you
that we'd sing at your wedding.

426
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,346
You'll have to tell us in advance.

427
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,764
Okay, I will.

428
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,684
Then let's see if you've still got it.

429
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,978
-Yes, show us.
-Jeez, cut it out.

430
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,479
Come on. Show us!

431
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,065
-I quit playing guitar.
-That's bullshit.

432
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,858
Then pick it up again. Come on!

433
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,614
Hey, you've had this guitar for so long.

434
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,032
It's a good guitar.

435
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,127
Let's just drink.

436
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,129
-Gosh, dude.
-You're such a downer.

437
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,674
-I came here to drink.
-All right, cheers.

438
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,176
It's good to see you.

439
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,683
Why are you out here?

440
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,476
Are you already drunk?

441
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,520
No, I wanted some fresh air.

442
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,566
What's going on?

443
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,737
You obviously came

444
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,363
because something's bothering you.

445
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,282
No, nothing's going on.

446
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,702
Do you regret quitting music?

447
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Cut it out, you prick.

448
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,625
We're very proud of you
for doing so well for yourself.

449
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,213
Let's get back inside and drink more.

450
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,387
You said you told Mr. Kwon
that you don't want to get married.

451
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,974
Then how come
he's not saying anything to us?

452
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,311
Shall I make up whatever you want to hear?

453
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,773
You're getting all snappy again.
Enough is enough, okay?

454
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,901
I'm so sick and tired of having
to appease your dad all the time.

455
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,903
Must I walk on eggshells even around you?

456
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,571
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,908
You say that when you have nothing to say.

458
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,161
Hey, your dad is home. I have to go.

459
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,711
I thought you had dinner plans.

460
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,213
We called it an early night.

461
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,843
Well...

462
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,596
Jeong-in called earlier.

463
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,641
-What did she say?
-She said the talk went well.

464
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,352
Bullshit.

465
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,648
Why? Did Mr. Kwon say something to you?

466
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,527
-Did he?
-He wouldn't even look at me.

467
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,405
What the heck did she say to him?

468
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,782
Why is he treating me
like a useless mutt now?

469
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,869
How could she be so self-centered?

470
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,373
Well, she didn't say much,

471
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,626
but she told him that she doesn't want
to get married right away.

472
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,254
Then when is she going to get married?

473
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,131
When she's 50?

474
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,843
Tell her to just forget about it!

475
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,431
I don't care anymore, so let her do
whatever the hell she wants to do!

476
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,082
Are you just going to keep killing time?

477
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,793
You need to sort things out.

478
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,045
I know, I should.

479
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,716
You know what's funny though?

480
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,012
As for Ji-ho, I'm scared
that he might ignore my call.

481
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,390
And as for Gi-seok,
I'm scared that he'll answer.

482
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,560
You're not ready
to deal with him resenting you?

483
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,104
That I can totally deal with.

484
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,441
I don't know about other things,

485
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,776
but one thing that bothers me is...

486
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,239
After being together for years,

487
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,783
it's ending in a way that's too...

488
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,913
-Anyway, I don't feel good about it.
-It hasn't ended yet.

489
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:44,251
It's never really over
until you see each other at your ugliest.

490
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,755
-So we still have a long way to go?
-You sure do.

491
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,592
First, you need to sort things out
with Ji-ho.

492
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,470
I bet he was so turned off
by what you did.

493
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,224
He probably doesn't want to see me again.

494
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,353
Apologize to him in person
for hurting his feelings.

495
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,607
What if I can't see him after that?

496
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,739
Who is it?

497
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,534
It's Ji-ho.

498
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,786
Your last chance is happening so soon.

499
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,627
Hello?

500
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,612
How about the park we went to last time?

501
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,770
Did I catch you at a bad time?

502
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,567
What are you going to say?

503
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,780
I'm not really here to talk.

504
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,034
Then why are you here?

505
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,580
I wanted to see you.

506
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,002
What?

507
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,839
Just be honest with me.
Don't tease me like this.

508
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,135
I'm not following.

509
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,472
I know you're mad at me.

510
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,893
I was,

511
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,647
but I was also worried you might use that
as an excuse and run away.

512
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,944
Will you keep joking around?

513
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,322
Do you think I'm stupid?

514
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,785
I guess you really are a fool.

515
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,205
I'm telling you the truth.
Why are you angry?

516
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,292
That's really it?

517
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,212
You wanted to see me? That's all?

518
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,842
I should just date another woman.

519
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,099
How could you believe that right away?

520
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,395
You're so mean.

521
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,192
We tend to pick up mean tricks quickly.

522
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,826
I've decided to stop wondering
whether or not

523
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,495
I deserve to ask you

524
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,289
to be with me.

525
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,212
No matter when you decide to come to me,
and even if you choose not to be with me,

526
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,756
I'm just going to love you.

527
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,137
I realized Yu Ji-ho

528
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,764
loves...

529
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,435
Lee Jeong-in.

530
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,739
Will you cry again and say nothing?

531
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,040
I checked everything.

532
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,626
As for this, we were expecting it,

533
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,419
-Mr. Kwon.
-so it should be okay.

534
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,421
Someone's calling you.

535
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,090
-Who is it?
-Nam Si-hoon.

536
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,550
Just let it ring.

537
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,389
If we enter this value, it becomes--

538
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:56,433
But we e-mailed this to them,

539
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,268
-didn't we?
-Yes, we did.

540
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,607
-Hello.
-Hello.

541
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,030
Oh, hello.

542
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,956
I need to expand my clinic,
but I'm short of cash.

543
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,334
Sell the house or something
and help me out.

544
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,381
I'll pay you back, okay?

545
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,550
Once I expand the clinic,
I'll get more patients in no time,

546
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,844
-so I'll earn it back quickly.
-I have no money.

547
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,138
And why do I have to get involved in it?

548
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,765
We'll be divorced soon.

549
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,646
Hey, you'd better listen to me. Okay?

550
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:47,818
I won't divorce you even if your family
gets involved, so let's take the easy way.

551
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:49,111
Lend me some money.

552
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,365
As soon as the loan I asked Gi-seok
to look into gets approved,

553
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,325
I'll pay you back right away.

554
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,828
What's the problem?

555
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,663
You've lost your mind.

556
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,584
What's wrong?

557
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,590
Don't do anything stupid. I'm warning you.

558
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,729
Jae-in.

559
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,647
What's up?

560
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,817
I think Seo-in is pregnant.

561
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,361
What? Did she say that to you?

562
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,655
She asked me to pick up a pregnancy test.

563
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,199
I got scared,
so I came to talk to you first.

564
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,788
Can you leave now by any chance?

565
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,082
Now?

566
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,300
-Jeong-in.
-Yes.

567
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,677
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

568
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,097
-What about the manager?
-He has no idea.

569
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,517
I feel as if I'm making you guys
aid in a crime or something.

570
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,852
Come on. This is nothing.

571
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,188
It's almost time to go home anyway.

572
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,690
Oh, right. On my desk, there is--

573
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,609
Yeong-ju is already taking care of it.

574
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,361
As for the new releases,
I'll get as much done as possible.

575
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,531
You've done a lot more for me.

576
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,366
Don't make me feel bad.

577
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,453
Keep feeling bad and just get going
before the manager sees you.

578
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,538
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Thanks again.

579
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,790
All right, get going.

580
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,515
-Jeong-in, do you mind driving?
-No, not at all.

581
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,434
-Sit in the back with Seo-in.
-Okay.

582
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,732
I don't know for sure yet.

583
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,609
I wanted to check just in case.

584
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,571
What? I got so scared
that I ran to talk to Jeong-in right away.

585
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,825
-She even left work early for you.
-Seo-in, how are you feeling now?

586
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,618
I'm feeling much better.

587
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,996
I was so dizzy earlier
that I couldn't drive.

588
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,165
Could it be something else?

589
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,212
I'll take a pregnancy test first
just to check.

590
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,964
If it's not that, I'll see a doctor.

591
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,217
Don't go alone.
Make sure you take Jae-in with you.

592
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,552
All right.

593
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,762
I shouldn't have come back from France.

594
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,308
I'm being a nuisance today, aren't I?

595
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,602
You're hurting my feelings.

596
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,604
I'm just so grateful.

597
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:37,529
I think Si-hoon is trying
to take out a loan through Gi-seok.

598
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,532
Jeez, everything that guy does
irks me so much.

599
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,826
Why didn't you tell him they broke up?

600
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,412
They broke up?

601
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,373
I'm trying to end things.

602
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,500
-It'll take a while.
-Hey, Jae-in.

603
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,797
Anyway, make sure
Gi-seok doesn't get involved.

604
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,465
It'll only stress you out more.

605
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,177
I know what you're saying.

606
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,848
How about we have a nice meal together?

607
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,600
Oh, I bought the thing.

608
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,018
-Here.
-Give it to me later.

609
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,771
Sure, let's do that.
Let's just have fun today.

610
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,024
-Okay?
-Good?

611
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,318
Can we have fun? For real?

612
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,652
Yes, of course.

613
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,252
Why aren't you eating?

614
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,214
Hey, has Gi-seok figured it out?

615
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,884
-What did he say?
-I'd rather have him say something.

616
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,969
He wouldn't even talk to me.

617
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,973
What? So he still doesn't know?

618
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,101
That woman... I mean, Jeong-in
didn't say anything to you?

619
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:51,937
No, she didn't.

620
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,064
Then what could it be?

621
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,941
Is it because of Nam Si-hoon?

622
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,859
Who is that?

623
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,486
He's a dentist.

624
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,031
Oh, he must be Jeong-in's brother-in-law.

625
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,449
What are you talking about?

626
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,702
The news anchor, Lee Seo-in,
is her sister, you know.

627
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,458
You guys didn't know?

628
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,543
So... Hey.

629
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,630
The news anchor, Lee Seo-in,
is Jae-in's sister?

630
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,631
Yes.

631
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,634
What's the matter?

632
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,136
What about her?

633
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,722
I heard she married a dentist.

634
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,558
Nam Si-hoon must be that dentist.

635
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,395
Well, he applied for a loan,

636
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,146
but he doesn't qualify at all.

637
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,358
It looks like
he keeps pestering Gi-seok about it.

638
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,944
Gi-seok even ignored his call today.

639
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,448
The thing is though, if his application
for the loan can't be approved,

640
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,158
Gi-seok can just explain it to him.

641
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,078
Why would he ignore his call?

642
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,831
Are they on bad terms now?

643
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,960
Hey, what's wrong?

644
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:00,088
Don't mind me.
Hey, maybe Gi-seok has figured it out.

645
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,423
Why do you say that?

646
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,550
He's avoiding her brother-in-law,

647
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,385
so they're probably not on good terms.

648
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,054
My gosh, Yeong-jae.

649
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,725
You're so smart. I don't get
why you fail the exam every year.

650
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,060
I don't get it either. Jeez.

651
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,943
WOORI PHARMACY

652
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,952
Where is Ji-ho's place?

653
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,621
Send me his address.

654
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:45,712
Yes.

655
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,797
Gi-seok is there? What did he say?

656
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,300
He didn't come in.
He's in front of the building now.

657
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,718
Did you tell him you're here?

658
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,222
He's probably there to see Ji-ho.

659
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,141
Does he know that he lives here?

660
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,520
-I don't know.
-What do I do? Go out and talk to him?

661
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,355
What do I say to him though?

662
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,901
Yeong-ju, I'll call you right back.

663
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,041
Hi, Jeong-in.

664
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,377
-Where are you?
-I'm on my way home.

665
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,342
Is it about Gi-seok?

666
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:34,928
You already know?

667
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:36,971
Yes.

668
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,309
-I'll head over there now, so--
-Don't come.

669
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
Ji-ho.

670
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,566
We knew
I'd have to talk to him at least once.

671
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,277
Don't worry. I'll handle him.

672
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:54,781
No, that's not right. I'll go sort it out.

673
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,784
This is my problem.

674
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,745
I have a favor to ask you though.

675
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,289
What is it?

676
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,418
I want to be honest and tell everything.

677
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,712
Can I do that?

678
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,840
Yes.

679
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,843
Then it's all good. Don't worry.

680
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,763
How can I not worry?

681
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,100
Then keep worrying about it.

682
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,769
How could you crack a joke now?

683
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,564
I'm just trying to tell you it'll be fine.

684
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,108
Don't worry too much. I'll call you later.

685
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,528
I'm sorry.

686
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,613
For liking me?

687
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,241
Gosh, stop it.

688
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,787
Put your worries to rest.

689
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,417
You have to call me, okay?

690
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,294
All right.

691
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,130
Talk to you later, then.

692
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,018
You should eat more.

693
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:07,770
This is the biggest meal I've had
as of late.

694
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:11,566
What's wrong?

695
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:15,069
Gi-seok went to see Ji-ho.

696
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,238
My gosh.

697
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,657
Ji-ho?

698
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,994
It's the guy she's crazy about.

699
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,246
Why does he want to meet him?

700
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,165
Because of you?

701
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,584
It's obviously because of Jeong-in.

702
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,879
What if Gi-seok beats him up to a pulp?

703
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,717
They're adults,
so they won't behave like kids.

704
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,720
You never know. People can do anything
when they're pissed off.

705
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,057
Don't you have to go?

706
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,726
Ji-ho told me not to come.

707
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,102
Of course.

708
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,396
They won't be able to talk
if you're there.

709
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,649
I should've been more thoughtful.

710
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,360
I shouldn't have given it away like that.

711
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,196
Gi-seok was bound to find out.

712
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,948
I know, but now is not the right time.

713
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,047
They're gone.

714
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,759
Hey, what if they're fighting
in an empty lot or something?

715
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,260
This isn't about winning.

716
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,471
You're wreaking havoc on a woman's life,

717
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,848
and I'm simply trying to stop that.

718
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,143
You'd better stop acting up
when I'm warning you nicely.

719
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,437
Jeong-in and I will marry
before the year ends.

720
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,980
Oh, you'll tell him about us?

721
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:58,441
What about Ji-ho?
You'll tell him all about that too?

722
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,443
I can't let you choose the wrong path.

723
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:01,611
Damn it!

724
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,822
So what kind of man are you talking about?

725
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,575
Someone who has a warm heart.
There's someone I like.

726
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,578
You said she's never been married.
I told you to give up on her.

727
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,330
What are you thinking?

728
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,416
What do you think will happen to us?

729
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,876
I'm in trouble.

730
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,462
I love you, Ji-ho.
