EPISODE 9

2
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,095
Are you ready?

3
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,898
Do you have something to say?

4
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,484
Yes, I do.

5
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,659
All right, let's talk.

6
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,676
Hey, Yeong-ju. What's going on now?

7
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
They're gone.

8
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,764
Where did they go?

9
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,641
I have no idea.

10
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,768
Gi-seok left first in his car,

11
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,437
and Ji-ho followed him right away.

12
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,068
Hey, what if they're fighting
in an empty lot or something?

13
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,656
Where are you now?

14
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,950
Go home with Jeong-in.

15
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,577
But I'm going to your place.

16
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,495
I'm fine now.

17
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,081
Just go home and take good care
of Jeong-in

18
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,839
-Wait here. I'll go bring the car over.
-It's all right.

19
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,592
My place isn't far from here,
so I'll drop you girls off and head home.

20
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,510
But why?

21
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,762
Go look at yourself in the mirror.

22
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,598
We'll just take a cab, then.

23
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,226
Will that be better?

24
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,437
Yes, but you have to...

25
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,566
I know. I'll call you
regardless of the result.

26
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,110
Don't worry.

27
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,700
You know we're always here for you, right?

28
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,119
Yes. Jeong-in,

29
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,581
just trust your heart.
Then everything will be fine.

30
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,084
Okay?

31
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,336
What an eyesore.

32
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,008
Gosh, you get jealous so easily.
Come here.

33
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,427
There you go.

34
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,227
Hey, you should try calling her sister.

35
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,354
Jae-in?

36
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,273
I told you that we're over.

37
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,816
Is that important now?

38
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,985
Your buddy is on the battlefield now.

39
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,612
Why didn't you go with him
if you were going to be this worried?

40
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,281
Shall we go there now?

41
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,951
What if Ji-ho is getting
beaten up to a pulp?

42
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,246
No way.
Is that guy, Gi-seok, that violent?

43
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,123
You keep saying shit like that.

44
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,044
I told you that this has nothing to do
with his personality.

45
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,589
I mean, would you be polite to a prick
that stole your girlfriend?

46
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,508
But objectively speaking,

47
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,970
nothing could break them apart
if they had a strong relationship.

48
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:50,183
Wouldn't it be embarrassing
to blame it all on Ji-ho?

49
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,393
You do have a point, but...

50
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,105
It'd be weird
if he just walked away quietly.

51
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,526
Ji-ho will probably fight back, right?

52
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,989
I know he always got good grades,
but was he a good fighter back in school?

53
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,953
-What you're thinking--
-Wait, hang on.

54
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,215
It's still not too late.

55
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,054
If it's something I don't have to hear,
you don't need to tell me.

56
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,936
I should tell you.

57
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,775
She came to the pharmacy as a customer.

58
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,239
Then we ran into each other by chance
because her friend lives in my building.

59
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,576
And naturally, I learned
that she was in a relationship,

60
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,080
but I couldn't stop myself.

61
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,379
That's why I said no when she suggested
we could be friends.

62
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,506
What were you thinking?

63
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,137
Did you think our relationship was a joke?

64
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,639
If I had thought that just even once,

65
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,811
I would've deliberately gotten caught.

66
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,482
It's not like I had no idea
that something was up.

67
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,359
You could've never found out.

68
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,610
Then what?

69
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,532
Why did you give it away?

70
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,798
Because you looked down on me.

71
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,096
I wanted you to know that your attitude
and the way you treat me are wrong.

72
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,517
You said it wasn't intentional,

73
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,400
but that's no different from killing
someone and saying you didn't intend it.

74
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,363
Hey, that's...

75
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,575
That analogy is wrong.

76
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,826
So, I began thinking...

77
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,956
Jeong-in shouldn't date a guy like that.

78
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,709
That's why I showed it.

79
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,101
Jeong-in.

80
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,530
I picked up some medicine for you.

81
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,948
Are you okay?

82
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,200
Yes.

83
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,037
-Did you throw up?
-No.

84
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,916
It seems pretty bad.
Shall I take you to the hospital?

85
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,210
I'll be fine if I take some medicine.

86
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,255
-I'll bring you some water.
-Thanks.

87
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,021
Here.

88
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,245
Like you said,
I've turned into such a loser.

89
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,708
You'd be a weirdo
if you were totally fine.

90
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,795
I hope you don't feel as if
you committed a big sin.

91
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,173
It's okay to be selfish.

92
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,968
You did it to protect your true feelings.

93
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,476
So in conclusion,
you'll continue to like Jeong-in.

94
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,524
Am I right?

95
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,076
Fine, do as you wish.

96
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,251
This isn't about winning.

97
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,048
You're wreaking havoc on a woman's life,

98
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,593
and I'm simply trying to stop that.

99
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,180
Do you understand?

100
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,811
No, but I'm worried.

101
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,651
Because I can see which one of us
will cause more trouble for her.

102
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,987
Are you saying that's me?

103
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm certain that it won't be me.

104
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:03,913
Hey.

105
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,126
You'd better stop acting up

106
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,420
when I'm warning you nicely.

107
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,348
If I had planned
to start disrespecting you,

108
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,185
I wouldn't have let you
belittle me like that.

109
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,938
So? You went easy on me?

110
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,440
-Let's say I held myself back.
-What if you hadn't?

111
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,275
What, then?

112
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,737
You would've punched me?

113
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,200
That wouldn't have been enough.

114
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,538
I would've made you get on your knees.

115
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:51,919
To tell you the truth,

116
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,631
I'm not here just to talk about Jeong-in.

117
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,886
Maybe this is more about me.

118
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
That's right.

119
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,226
I have a kid.

120
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,022
I'm well aware of how people judge me
because of that.

121
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,316
But you see,

122
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,321
my son gives me the strength
not to be afraid of anything in the world.

123
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,744
So don't you dare belittle me again.

124
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,376
If you do that again,
I won't hold myself back.

125
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,717
Got anything else to say?

126
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,361
GI-SEOK

127
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,568
Get in.

128
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,948
Let's talk inside.

129
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,997
I met up with Ji-ho.

130
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,082
I know.

131
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,631
First, let me explain what happened.

132
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,800
That's not necessary.

133
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,264
Nothing will change between the two of us.

134
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,018
That's what I wanted to say.

135
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,695
Everyone makes mistakes.

136
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,201
You've put up with so much
and have overlooked many of my mistakes,

137
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,162
so it's my turn now.

138
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,251
I will forget all about it,
so you should do the same.

139
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,342
It wasn't a mistake.

140
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,930
I truly have feelings for Ji-ho.

141
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,601
Gi-seok.

142
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,647
I said nothing will change.

143
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
I will forget all about it,
and so should you.

144
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,657
I'm sorry if this sounds cruel,

145
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:57,826
but I really do have feelings for him.

146
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,744
No, it's pity.

147
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,247
It's sympathy.

148
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,124
Okay?

149
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,335
Yu Ji-ho, of all people?

150
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,253
This is simply wrong.

151
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,839
You really shouldn't be doing this.

152
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,094
Regardless of him,
I was going to break up with you anyway.

153
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,346
Exactly.

154
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,642
I might've agreed to breaking up
if this had never happened.

155
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:27,606
I mean, talking about making things work
over and over again could've tired me out,

156
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,944
and I could've said
we should just call it quits.

157
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,696
But of all people,

158
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,657
Yu Ji-ho?

159
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,202
I can't let that happen.

160
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:44,915
You're about to jump into a fire pit.
I'm not going to let you do that.

161
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,460
I won't let that happen.

162
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,587
Now that I've found out,

163
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
I can't break up with you for your sake.

164
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,760
I'm already done with you.

165
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,471
If you truly care about me,

166
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,057
you shouldn't ignore me
when I say I'm done.

167
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,978
You're dismissing my feelings
just because you can't accept it.

168
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,940
You keep saying you can't break up
and that we're still together.

169
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,984
Aren't you being unreasonable?

170
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:12,985
Listen!

171
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:15,571
I'm trying, okay?

172
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,073
I'm trying to save our relationship.

173
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,033
Why bother trying now?

174
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,372
You admitted that you got too comfortable.

175
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
You never imagined us breaking up.

176
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,543
I'll tell you what.

177
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
That's because you looked down on me.

178
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,007
"Even if she gets angry today,

179
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,593
she'll forgive me
if I coax her a little tomorrow."

180
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,262
Even though I knew that,
I thought letting it slide

181
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,432
and just going along with it was love,

182
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,559
and I feel like a moron for thinking
that way.

183
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,812
That's why I'm not putting the blame
on you.

184
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,231
We're equally responsible

185
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,609
for this mess.

186
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,738
We were both big-headed.

187
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,659
-So, your solution is Ji-ho?
-It's my life.

188
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,703
-It's none of your business.
-It's pity, not love!

189
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,542
Hey, Jeong-in.

190
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,087
Come to your senses, okay?

191
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,966
Give yourself a reality check, please!

192
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,854
I owe you an apology

193
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,065
for just one thing.

194
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,236
I acted like I loved you
when my feelings were long gone.

195
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,365
For that, I'm really sorry.

196
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,762
Just go home.

197
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,182
Go home

198
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
and sleep it off.

199
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,603
I'll do the same.

200
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,482
Nothing happened to us, okay?

201
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,487
We're not "us" anymore.

202
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,591
-Hey, Jeong-in.
-You said you'd call me.

203
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,888
I figured you'd call me when you can talk.

204
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,393
Did you know that Gi-seok came to see me?

205
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,563
I thought he'd probably go there.

206
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,776
What are you drinking?

207
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,570
Coffee.

208
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,073
Are you putting on an act?
Or is this for real?

209
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,117
You sound so calm and relaxed.

210
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,495
This matters a lot to me,

211
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,748
but getting worked up
won't solve anything.

212
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,709
And it takes a lot for me
to lose my composure.

213
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,587
You're a real adult.

214
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,923
I've experienced something
more shocking, haven't I?

215
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,677
You were much younger back then.

216
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,221
How did you get through
something like that?

217
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,268
I think time took care of it.

218
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,856
Was everything okay?

219
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,816
Yes, I was mentally prepared.

220
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,194
What about you?

221
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,531
Were your feelings hurt at all
while talking to him face-to-face?

222
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,574
No.

223
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,953
But Gi-seok was probably really flustered.

224
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,293
And that being said,

225
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,128
I think...

226
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,799
we need more time.

227
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,259
What do you mean?

228
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,261
Since the two of you

229
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,641
were together for so long, you'll probably
need time to fully end things.

230
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,269
A breakup is like a scar
regardless of who's at fault,

231
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,271
and it'll be painful.

232
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,317
How can you be so thoughtful?

233
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,070
Because I've been in that pain.

234
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,114
Remember what I said?

235
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,159
You can take your time.
I won't go anywhere.

236
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,074
I'm not saying I won't buy that clinic,
you know?

237
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,496
Something's come up, so I'm just
asking you to delay it a little.

238
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,207
What's the problem, Dr. Sin?

239
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,251
Right, so how much is the offer?

240
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,502
Aren't you trying to...

241
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,340
I'll call you back in a bit.
If you keep this up, I'll change my mind.

242
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,889
Thank you.

243
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,975
How about a drink?

244
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,437
That's good. Thank you.

245
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,652
I thought...

246
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,657
you were in a good mood
because you asked me to meet up.

247
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,120
Do you still want to expand the clinic?

248
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,371
Yes, and it's going well.

249
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,790
So you got a loan through Gi-seok?

250
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,834
That, too, is going well.

251
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,876
Don't do it.

252
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,088
Then Jeong-in will have to get involved.

253
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,259
I don't want to get her involved
in our problem.

254
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,264
I would be causing nuisance
if it was his money.

255
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,018
But I'm going through the proper steps
to take a loan out with his help.

256
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,603
Is that illegal?

257
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,283
It's for the apartment.
I'll give you my share.

258
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,827
I have just under 100 million won.

259
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,455
-You can take it all.
-Seriously?

260
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,505
I won't ask for anything else.

261
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,382
Just agree to the divorce.

262
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,936
I'll put everything behind

263
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,481
and won't expect anything from you,

264
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,524
so just agree to the divorce.

265
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,490
Do you have to do this?

266
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,243
Can't we try to work things out?

267
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,579
You know that we can't.

268
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,874
-We've come too far.
-No, we can still fix things.

269
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,212
I'll make you happy.
You won't have to wait long.

270
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,178
Seo-in, you see...

271
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,767
I'll make you the happiest woman
in the world. Believe me.

272
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,561
Please do this for me.

273
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,357
I don't want to hate you anymore.

274
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,411
Please agree to it.

275
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,855
Hey, I can't believe
her friend lives in your building.

276
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,692
You're always so lucky with women.

277
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,778
Should you be saying that to me?

278
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,781
This is good even when it's uncooked.

279
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,874
Your class isn't actually canceled, is it?

280
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,629
To tell you the truth,
I can't study these days.

281
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,176
Then why didn't you go see Jae-in?
She's the reason you're like this.

282
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:26,806
Hey.

283
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,977
Whether you have a girlfriend or not
shouldn't affect your studies.

284
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,521
I'm not as smart as you are.

285
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,899
Don't give such an excuse.

286
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,777
Did she distract you from studying?

287
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,780
No, not at all. She was so good to me.

288
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,408
She bought me food
and even got me vitamins.

289
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,703
-Vitamins?
-Yes.

290
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,956
The same one that you give me
from time to time.

291
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,127
She bought it?

292
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,840
Not sure. She said it was lying around
at her place, but who knows?

293
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,675
Anyway, she was so good to me.

294
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,762
So, it ended up in your hands.

295
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,474
-What?
-Nothing. Remember to take it every day.

296
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,145
I'm not that young anymore.

297
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,565
And we've been together
for a long time, you know.

298
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,485
And she agreed?

299
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,658
I sprang it on her,
so she was a little surprised.

300
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,284
But she'll say yes soon.

301
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,996
Times have changed.

302
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,332
You can't force her into marrying you.

303
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,088
I'm not sure what Jeong-in told you,

304
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,925
but I know her better
than anybody else does.

305
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,428
She has a strong opinion about everything,

306
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,390
so she just needs some time
to get on board.

307
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,267
Once she does, all will be fine.

308
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,603
All will be fine?

309
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,105
Yes, of course.

310
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,444
So, there will be no problems?

311
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,739
What kind of problem would there be?

312
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,283
I mean, we love each other.

313
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,207
Anyway, I'll take care of everything,
so just let me marry her.

314
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,544
Have you not proposed to her yet
because of me?

315
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,630
No, I'm not trying to blame you here.

316
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,761
I'm telling you that I've really made up
my mind now,

317
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,638
so please trust my decision.

318
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,146
I won't let you down.

319
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,941
You should sit in the meetings
once in a while and warn them.

320
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,820
Kids these days are highly aware
and opinionated.

321
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,906
Things have changed so much.

322
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,741
Yes, of course.

323
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,702
Even just seeing my children makes me
realize how much things have changed.

324
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,912
Yes, I bet.

325
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,956
Your daughter is really something.

326
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:02,462
Actually, I wanted to ask you
what you thought of her,

327
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,298
but I wasn't sure how to bring it up.

328
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,300
I've been curious.

329
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,510
I guess you heard nothing from her.

330
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,388
She just said it went well,

331
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,850
so I assumed
you probably enjoyed meeting her.

332
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,354
That's an understatement.
She left a strong impression on me.

333
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,650
My gosh, I apologize.
Was she disrespectful in any way?

334
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,696
I don't think she's right for Gi-seok.

335
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,407
She's too good for him.

336
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,745
She's a bright young lady.

337
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,665
And on that note,
I want to ask you for a favor.

338
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,044
Just give them some time.

339
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,506
I think the two of them
will figure things out.

340
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,550
And the time isn't important.

341
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,762
What matters is whether
we can attain the result we want.

342
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,806
That's what I think. Am I wrong?

343
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,060
No, of course not.
You're absolutely right.

344
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,107
-Mom.
-Hey.

345
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,612
Hey, did your dad call you by any chance?

346
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,531
No. Why do you ask?

347
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,243
He wants you to come over this weekend
even if you're busy.

348
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,036
He sounded so chipper though.

349
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,625
He was mad at you for a while
for meeting Mr. Kwon alone.

350
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,210
I wonder what it's about.

351
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,671
Same here.

352
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,384
Is everything okay
between you and Gi-seok?

353
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,553
I thought things were a bit rocky.

354
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,055
Well, we're all right.

355
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,224
Why?

356
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,934
Just because.

357
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,645
Because of what your dad said,

358
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,232
I was just wondering if the two of them
met and talked or something.

359
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,193
Then I would've heard about it.

360
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,822
So, are you two back on good terms?

361
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,075
No.

362
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,121
-Mom.
-Yes?

363
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,710
You may be disappointed in me.

364
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,087
What are you talking about?

365
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,506
I'm just warning you.

366
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,219
Just act on your beliefs,
and I'll never be disappointed in you.

367
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,014
-Really?
-Goodness.

368
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,517
I guess you're determined
to cause some big trouble.

369
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,732
You see, I don't expect anything
from you girls.

370
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,111
Just don't give up on your life.
That will be enough.

371
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm off.

372
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,459
WOORI PHARMACY

373
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,004
You seem so surprised.

374
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,924
You said you'd wait at the cafe.

375
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,760
-Why are you here?
-I came so everyone can see us together.

376
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,436
Well... You ran out in such a rush,

377
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,064
so I was worried if something happened
with your family.

378
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,024
What? What could possibly happen?

379
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,865
-This is--
-Hello.

380
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,951
I'm Wang Hye-jeong.

381
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,454
Hello, I'm Lee Jeong-in.

382
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,414
We've met before.

383
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,917
I've been to your pharmacy a few times.

384
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,128
You should've said hello.

385
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,047
I have so many things to tell you
about this guy.

386
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,676
You should wrap it up and head home.

387
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,470
-See you again soon.
-Yes, have a good evening.

388
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,264
-Get back inside.
-Bye.

389
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,863
This totally came as a surprise.

390
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,781
What's gotten into you?

391
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,783
The spring breeze got to me.

392
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,916
I thought of you on my way home.

393
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,628
I'm tired,
but I didn't want to go straight home.

394
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,548
But then it's not like I want to party.

395
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,675
Don't you have days like that too?

396
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,013
So, you called me by default?

397
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,140
Because I'm comfortable with you.

398
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,099
Whatever.

399
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,184
It's true.

400
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,477
I find you comfortable

401
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,397
like a perfect pillow.

402
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,946
You must be very worried.

403
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,786
I can't ask you

404
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,122
to blindly believe in me.

405
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,250
However,

406
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,669
whenever you're happy or sad,

407
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,756
come to me like you did today.

408
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,135
Do you make visits too?

409
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,473
That depends on you.

410
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,476
You pick up mean tricks quickly.

411
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,483
I want to see you every day.

412
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,528
You have no idea how much I just want to

413
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,989
follow my heart.

414
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,742
But?

415
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,163
What if I push my luck
and end up losing you?

416
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,707
You won't come around twice.

417
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,505
What if you're disappointed?

418
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,384
You don't know everything about me.

419
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,595
Is there more to know?

420
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:45,805
Of course.

421
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
Like what?

422
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,894
Actually,

423
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,858
I'm in trouble.

424
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,195
Why?

425
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,369
Come on. You can tell me.

426
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,042
I...

427
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,130
love you, Ji-ho.

428
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,875
Ji-ho.

429
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,761
What?

430
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,098
Are you crying?

431
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,643
You're crying.

432
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,979
Yu Ji-ho's crying.

433
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,148
-I'm not.
-You are.

434
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,275
Something's just stuck in my eye.

435
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,902
Yeah, right.

436
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,906
You are crying.

437
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,534
See you tomorrow.

438
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,954
That level of overtime
should be rewarded with drinks.

439
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,248
Of course. Are you coming?

440
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,673
Sure thing. I'm buying.

441
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,176
Sure.

442
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,429
Hyeon-su, we're grabbing dinner.

443
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,348
Actually, I...

444
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,059
Do you have other plans?

445
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,144
I kind of do.

446
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,564
It's not as fun without you.

447
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,817
Stay for a bite.

448
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,985
-Come on.
-Come on.

449
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,781
-Hold on. I'm just going to make a call.
-Sure.

450
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,242
-Hyeon-su.
-Yes?

451
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,368
Welcome!

452
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,754
You seem uncomfortable around me.

453
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,632
It's not that...

454
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,052
You know I'm in a tough spot.

455
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:31,929
Why?

456
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,858
It's nothing serious.

457
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,196
We'll be laughing it off
before you know it,

458
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,991
so be yourself around me, all right?

459
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
Right.

460
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,121
This changes nothing between us.

461
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,374
The same goes for Ji-ho.

462
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,880
Friends are important,

463
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,717
but if I mean a lot to you too,

464
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,429
you'll know what to do
in order to show respect.

465
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,808
You're smart enough to know, right?

466
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:19,518
Yes.

467
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,275
Let's be respectful.

468
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:27,985
Of course.

469
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,582
How's the relocation coming along?

470
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,127
It's on its way and will happen soon.

471
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:46,879
I'm glad to hear that.

472
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:51,217
Work is important and all,
but so is expanding your family.

473
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,971
Oh, right. Of course.

474
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,643
Seo-in seems cold on the outside,
but she has a gentle soul.

475
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,188
I know that all too well.
There's nothing to...

476
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,900
Father, we're on the best of terms lately.

477
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,610
I don't doubt that.

478
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,572
If only Jeong-in would marry
that easily too.

479
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,324
Her life will be nothing but golden.

480
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,952
Where does she get her stubbornness from?

481
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:23,457
Come to think of it,
I've yet to hear about any wedding bells.

482
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,417
I have no idea what's going on.

483
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,962
At this rate,
Jae-in might get married first.

484
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,841
Even though I haven't seen her in a while,

485
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,345
she's exactly how I remember her.

486
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,932
When did you see her?

487
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,269
Didn't you know that she's in Korea?

488
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,272
I actually saw her a while back.

489
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,233
What?

490
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,735
Every time I ask RSVP for the book club,

491
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,821
I feel like a clingy girlfriend.

492
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,323
I know that feeling all too well.

493
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,993
As if I doubt you've ever had to cling.

494
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,162
Of course, I have.
I've done all sorts of things.

495
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,455
When?

496
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,333
Is what I heard true?

497
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,044
Are you seeing another man?

498
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,629
Oh, well...

499
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,673
-Mom?
-Hey.

500
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,508
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

501
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,804
-I'll take that for you.
-Sure, thanks.

502
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,353
Your father found out that Jae-in's back
and is spitting fire.

503
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,730
How did he know?

504
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,275
Beats me, but he's been yelling
to bring her home at once.

505
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,818
My ears almost came off.

506
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,989
I'll bring Jae-in with me.
I was going there on the weekend anyway.

507
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,908
Your dad was thrilled
about your situation,

508
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,244
but this might ruin it all.

509
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,538
I broke up with Gi-seok.

510
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:46,248
What?

511
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,461
My dear gosh. I don't care if you're busy,
we need to talk.

512
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,588
Wait, follow me inside.

513
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,674
SEONGDONG PUBLIC LIBRARY

514
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,343
Just tell me.

515
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,595
I had my suspicions

516
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:03,265
when you went on about disappointing me.

517
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,018
Why?

518
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,188
Surely, that's not
the only reason you broke up.

519
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,525
-I like someone else.
-What?

520
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,447
That's all I can say right now.

521
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,534
What on earth are you saying?

522
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,497
Is that why you two broke up?

523
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,625
I was already thinking about it

524
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,669
when he came into the picture.

525
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,173
You can say that I cheated.

526
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,300
I won't make any excuses.

527
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,260
That part isn't my business anyway.

528
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,263
Who is he?

529
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,849
Who is this new guy?

530
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,271
I can't tell you yet.

531
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,232
Mom,

532
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,861
I'll do what I can
and tell you when I'm ready.

533
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,490
Please believe in me and be patient.

534
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,666
Here. These are masks for your father.

535
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,168
I could've gotten them myself.

536
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,920
You'll only piss her off.

537
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,798
My parents keep scolding me
for letting you spoil us.

538
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,636
What did I tell you?

539
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,181
You should buy dinner sometime.

540
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,016
You can ask that anytime.

541
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,477
We're good then. I'll let her know that.

542
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,168
I was hoping to drink
since I'm getting a lift home,

543
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,254
but my kids are insisting
I come home early.

544
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,340
I'll come by your house sometime.

545
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,509
I'm off to my mom's today anyway.

546
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,180
I don't think it's to drop off
the masks though.

547
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,933
I had other things on my mind too.

548
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,395
She hasn't called since that day.

549
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,564
Because of Jeong-in?

550
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,695
Your mom isn't entirely wrong though.

551
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
I know,

552
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,950
but I can't respect her wishes.

553
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,372
You told me to go for it.

554
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:35,250
It's more like
she's the one shaking your world.

555
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,128
I knew after looking at her once.

556
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,089
She had what it took
to crumble your walls down.

557
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,179
How far are you willing to go?

558
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,640
Just dating for now?

559
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,103
The endgame.

560
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,860
She'll be the last woman in my life.

561
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,113
You should never assume that.

562
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,408
Just wait and see what happens then.

563
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,341
What now?

564
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,511
Isn't it your day off today?

565
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:28,971
Are you home?

566
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,140
What's this about?

567
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,852
We should grab some dinner.

568
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,439
I was too busy earlier to call in advance.

569
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,069
What are you doing?

570
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,116
Let's talk in person.

571
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,536
Talk about what?

572
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,622
Let's meet first.

573
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,583
I'm on my way to my mom's.

574
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,128
Is something up?

575
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,215
To tell my parents about us.

576
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,220
I'm with Jae-in, so I can't talk for long.

577
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,514
Hold on.

578
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,109
Oh, you'll tell him about us?

579
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,030
What about Ji-ho?

580
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,366
You'll tell him all about that too?

581
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,871
Are you threatening me?

582
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,082
Call it a threat if you want.

583
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,586
I told you I can't let you
choose the wrong path.

584
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,674
Go ahead. Do your best and try to stop me.

585
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,260
Hey. You...

586
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,017
Damn it!

587
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,826
Jeong-in, I can head to Mom's myself.

588
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,536
It's all right.

589
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,289
I'm worried that
you'll tell Dad everything.

590
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,083
Now's not the time.

591
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,086
If you do, he might actually murder you.

592
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,088
I'll behave.

593
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,549
Promise?

594
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,259
Now's not the time.

595
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,178
All right.

596
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,974
You should keep quiet
even if Dad crosses the line.

597
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,518
I know that much.

598
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,064
You always say you've got it

599
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,233
and that I should respect your boundaries.

600
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,110
You were fooling us instead.

601
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,613
How dare you cook up such a devious plan?

602
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,952
It's not Jeong-in's fault.
I begged her not to tell you.

603
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,870
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

604
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,500
The same goes for your talk with Mr. Kwon.

605
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:06,795
You should've kept quiet for my sake!

606
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,215
You don't intend to get married
anytime soon, is that it?

607
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,052
We should be grateful
that he's understanding.

608
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,680
What would we have done
if he were offended?

609
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,266
That's not what I said.

610
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,393
I told him that I have no thoughts
of marrying Gi-seok.

611
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,816
Well, it's true that she's not
getting married anytime soon.

612
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,942
Dad.

613
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,612
I know.

614
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,242
I told Gi-seok that I want to end things.

615
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,954
It wasn't an easy decision on my part.

616
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,166
I just don't see a future with him.

617
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,460
I won't be satisfied.

618
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:51,214
If Gi-seok isn't good enough, then who is?

619
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,759
Have you always been aiming up high?

620
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,344
Did I not know my own daughter?

621
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,055
Gi-seok's a decent man.

622
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,974
In paper, he's even too good for me.

623
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,393
But I realize now that

624
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,022
he isn't the kind of man I truly want.

625
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,275
So what kind of man are you talking about?

626
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,446
Someone who has a warm heart.

627
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,535
What the hell did she just say?

628
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,205
She wants to be with someone warmhearted.

629
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,541
What?

630
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,752
Unbelievable.

631
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,714
Being surrounded by novels all day

632
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,424
has done a number on you.

633
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,344
You've been living your life
in the clouds.

634
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,057
Why are you close to tears?

635
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,477
No one marries with that state of mind!

636
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,354
Ask anyone on the street.

637
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,856
Not even one person would understand you.

638
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:51,942
What if there is?

639
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,240
Will you approve
if at least one person understands me?

640
00:51:59,074 --> 00:51:59,908
Jeong-in.

641
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:05,622
Honey, please.
I'm sure you got through to them.

642
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,124
You've said enough.

643
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,462
Wait, do you perhaps...

644
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,882
There's someone I like.

645
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,719
I doubt you buy yourself fruits.

646
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,304
Eat some even if you're full.

647
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,182
You too, honey.

648
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,310
I'm feeling too full from dinner.

649
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,774
You know the young lady
I was talking about.

650
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,485
Her parents run the grocery.

651
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,279
That ship has sailed.

652
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,033
I'm going to get married.

653
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,331
Yes, of course.

654
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,793
That's why I've been trying to set you up.

655
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,337
With the woman I told you about.

656
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,840
It won't happen soon,

657
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,552
but I won't change
my mind about her either.

658
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,346
You said she's never been married.

659
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,849
I told you to give up on her.

660
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,809
I'm sorry.

661
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,311
You...

662
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:13,023
You don't know
because he's your flesh and blood.

663
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,692
It's not easy to raise a kid
who's not your own!

664
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,652
Eun-u will hear you.

665
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,489
Do you think...

666
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,785
this was easy for me then?

667
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:28,038
Why...

668
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,373
Why can't you understand?

669
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,668
Ji-ho.

670
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,428
I see you woke up.

671
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,805
Let's get you back to bed.

672
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,098
There you go.

673
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,810
Why did you wake up?

674
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,122
I still have some left
from the last batch.

675
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,124
It's from Ms. Wang.

676
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,127
Clothes are dusty, so swap them out often.

677
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,880
Please tell her I'm grateful.

678
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,261
Do you have to leave right away?

679
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,611
Let me.

680
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,262
I hope you're not too upset with us.

681
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,098
Of course, we're happy for you.

682
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,599
However, we can't be

683
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,978
if we put Eun-u's interest first.

684
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,856
Would I have not thought of him too?

685
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,067
I tried a great deal to stop this,
but I couldn't,

686
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,403
and that's how it got so far.

687
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,283
I feel guilty if not anything.

688
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,036
She keeps looking my way,

689
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,246
but...

690
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,623
all I do is hesitate.

691
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,384
After having Eun-u,

692
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,555
I promised to never cause you
any trouble again.

693
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,644
I was ready to live my life
the way you wanted me to.

694
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,729
But...

695
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,441
I won't give up on her.

696
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,153
I know it's a difficult path,

697
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,822
but I'm taking it.

698
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,618
That's how desperate I am.

699
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,714
You've been like a needle on thin ice
this whole time.

700
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,219
I'm sure there's a reason

701
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,597
behind this determination.

702
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:38,645
I'm fully aware of

703
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,523
the thought you put in.

704
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,195
What is she like?

705
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,826
She's the first person

706
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,038
to see me as just Yu Ji-ho.

707
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,338
Thank you.

708
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,784
What are you thinking?

709
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:26,878
I was wondering why
I didn't hold your hand sooner.

710
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,716
What do you think

711
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,385
will happen to us?

712
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,850
What do you want us to be?

713
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,353
I'll make it turn out that way.

714
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,397
In every way?

715
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,651
Yes.

716
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,490
I like how we are right now.

717
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,245
Not me.

718
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,599
I hug you and you reply
by holding hands and kissing me?

719
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,810
You're a funny one.

720
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,854
Serves you right.

721
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,253
-Unbelievable.
-What?

722
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,302
Right?

723
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:40,970
You're hilarious.

724
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:52,268
What did I do wrong?

725
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,438
I did everything right by her
while we were dating.

726
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,064
In what way is Ji-ho better than me?

727
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,733
He's nothing compared to me.

728
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,902
Why is Jeong-in being this way?

729
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,320
There's something going on, right?

730
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,572
Will you disapprove if he's not up to par?

731
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,283
I can't let my daughter
make the wrong choice.

732
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:09,035
Do you believe this can be remedied?

733
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,453
Does it seem impossible?

734
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,288
What if he's a single father?

735
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,041
The man she's seeing has a son.

736
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,960
She's not in her right mind.
I can't let her be.

737
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,671
I met Father. He seemed worried about you.

738
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,465
About your marriage, of course.

739
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,383
I probably should talk to him soon.

740
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,135
Will he seek out both Mom and Dad?

741
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,179
I didn't think Gi-seok
would stoop this low.

742
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,140
You shouldn't let it slide.
Tell him to stop or something.

743
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:33,434
I should tell Mom and Dad
before it gets to that.

744
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,024
