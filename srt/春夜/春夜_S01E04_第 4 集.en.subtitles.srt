1
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,255
Why are you so surprised?

2
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,925
Oh, it's nothing.

3
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,387
Can you wait for me outside?

4
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,556
Let me wrap things up here.

5
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,642
Sure.

6
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,205
EPISODE 4

7
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,215
I'm surprised.
What brings you here?

8
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,093
I thought I'd return the favor.

9
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,847
Is there a lot left to do?

10
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,224
I'll pack up my bag and be right down.

11
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,059
I'll bring the car around.

12
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,519
Sure.

13
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,618
Hello?

14
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,705
Where are you?

15
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,540
I left the library.

16
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,000
Didn't you see my text?

17
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,377
Why didn't you reply?
Is this a habit of yours?

18
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,174
Did you...

19
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,800
I saw him.

20
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,891
So what? Why did you hide?

21
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,394
We didn't even do anything.

22
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,063
Would you if I asked you to?

23
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,236
Would you be willing to do it?

24
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,947
Ji-ho.

25
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,741
I said from the start

26
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,577
that I couldn't be just friends with you.

27
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,329
You said you moved on,

28
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,414
so we agreed to be friends.

29
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,252
Then tell Gi-seok that we're friends.

30
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,006
Tell him not to worry when he sees
us together, or should I tell him?

31
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,717
Where are you?

32
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,181
Where?

33
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,975
Let's talk in person.

34
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,813
Where are you?

35
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,149
If you come to me now,

36
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,861
there's no going back.

37
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,973
Isn't that Ji-ho?

38
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,642
Ji-ho!

39
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,859
Hey.

40
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,406
Go ahead.

41
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,081
Unbelievable.

42
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,792
That was unexpected.

43
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,179
Did I mention where you worked
when we met him?

44
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,391
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

45
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,188
I should tell him when we meet again...

46
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,192
and ask him to bring you some snacks.

47
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,028
What if it brings us closer?

48
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,697
He's a friend, so that'd be great.

49
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,662
Are you okay with me spending time
with another guy?

50
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,292
-As a man?
-As a friend.

51
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,920
Just a guy friend.

52
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,466
Would that be okay with you?

53
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,469
Do you even care?

54
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,766
You hate it when people
invade your personal space.

55
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,395
I'm selfish, aren't I?

56
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,773
We wouldn't have dated if you were.

57
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,236
You have a strong personality...

58
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,364
and it's why I fell for you.

59
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,329
Have you ever regretted... dating me?

60
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,498
I nearly did just now...

61
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,334
because of these silly questions.

62
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,214
Gi-seok.

63
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,674
Yes?

64
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,137
Shall we just get married?

65
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,017
I'd like a proper proposal
and not a reluctant one.

66
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,818
I told you not to stress out about it.

67
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,072
We'll get married eventually,
so what's the rush?

68
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,033
Right?

69
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:54,260
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM CLASSES
CONSULTATIONS WELCOME

70
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,595
Hi.

71
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,973
Yes? I mean, hi.

72
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,601
Did you forget that we're friends?

73
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,317
You appeared out of the blue,
so of course I was flustered.

74
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,985
Did you study a lot today?

75
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,945
I'm not done for the day.

76
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,823
What's with the bag then?
I thought we were going out.

77
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,242
It's a force of habit.

78
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:20,620
So are we going out or what?

79
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,247
What are we going to do?

80
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,543
We'll think about it over a meal.

81
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,254
-Come on. I'll treat you to barbecue.
-But--

82
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,756
-Let's go!
-Sure.

83
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,472
PREMIUM VITAMIN

84
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,474
Hold on.

85
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,894
Did you really buy all these for me?

86
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:45,895
No...

87
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,272
They were around the house.

88
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,858
Besides, a hardworking student
needs vitamins more.

89
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,526
No one in my house needs them.

90
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,906
My pharmacist friend
sometimes brings me some,

91
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,616
but never this much.

92
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,620
You won't run out then.
Now, will you dig in?

93
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,372
Oh, right. Thank you.

94
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,290
Thanks for this.

95
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,084
Gosh.

96
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,090
-So...
-Yes?

97
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,801
-How many times did you flunk?
-The exam?

98
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,803
Well, maybe...

99
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,600
So five times?

100
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,897
You're adorable.

101
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,235
A greater number of people
fail the test anyway,

102
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,153
so why be embarrassed about it?

103
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,030
It's not something to be proud of.

104
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,200
So...

105
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,204
It's nothing.

106
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,581
-Why do I keep coming by?
-Yes.

107
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,874
Because I want to see you.

108
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,671
You constantly miss those you're fond of.

109
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,009
How do you know
if I'm a decent person or not?

110
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,469
I'm just drawn to you.

111
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,477
We can take our time
getting to know each other anyway.

112
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,729
Simple, right?

113
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,063
Now eat up.

114
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,191
Are you always this bold?

115
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm a bit influenced by Jeong-in.

116
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,285
-Remember my sister?
-Yes.

117
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:28,080
Well, she always has to
see matters through till the end.

118
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,415
Ma'am, can I get some more?

119
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,917
When she's set on something
that she really wants,

120
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,753
no one in our family can stop her.

121
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,963
She doesn't seem like the type.

122
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,134
She's gotten boring.
That's why her love life sucks, too.

123
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,095
She and Gi-seok look nice together.

124
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,515
What about us?

125
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,562
Unbelievable.

126
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,357
-Eat up. I'll get you some more.
-Right.

127
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,275
Dig in.

128
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,069
-Grill these for me.
-Sure.

129
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,824
"What if I can never take this off?

130
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,076
Will I be stuck like this forever?

131
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,455
Thankfully,
I can somewhat see through this,

132
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,540
so it's not so bad."

133
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,801
He just fell asleep.

134
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,123
-Mom didn't call?
-She did.

135
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,043
They moved to a nearby karaoke room.

136
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,713
You know how the neighbors like to party.

137
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,549
Go before it gets darker.

138
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,718
Want to grab a drink with me?

139
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,946
-You should open a new bottle.
-It's fine.

140
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,977
There's nothing going on.

141
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,001
Should I go up with you?

142
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,670
I thought you had a meeting to prep for.

143
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,547
I do, but...

144
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,258
Come inside if you want.

145
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,886
Where's Jae-in?

146
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,722
She texted that she just got home.

147
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,185
I'm good then.

148
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,400
Jae-in's home, so...

149
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,404
What?

150
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,785
Am I just a regular sexual partner to you?

151
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,288
Did you have to say it like that?

152
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,250
-When have I ever treated you that way?
-Just now.

153
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,754
What's up with you again?

154
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,423
Are you picking fights on purpose?

155
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,137
Besides, couples don't need
to seek permission for sex.

156
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,849
You still need to ask though.

157
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,018
Just say you don't want to

158
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,354
instead of making ridiculous excuses.

159
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,148
I don't want to. Satisfied?

160
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,488
Unbelievable.

161
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,244
Drive home safely.

162
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,239
While raising you,

163
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,286
we got scared every time

164
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,204
a call came from...

165
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,541
your teachers at school.

166
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,962
"Ji-ho...

167
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,674
is at the top of the class again."

168
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,470
"Ji-ho should compete
in an academic competition."

169
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,601
"How about
a foreign language high school?"

170
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,190
"He could get into a university
on a full scholarship."

171
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,910
Your mom and I aren't highly educated,

172
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,248
and we were focused on just getting by.

173
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,668
Why are you suddenly saying this?

174
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,423
We couldn't give you anything,

175
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,474
so I wonder if that's why your life
turned out this way.

176
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,102
What about Eun-u?

177
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,318
For whatever reason, he was sent to me.

178
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,073
I wouldn't change him even if I could.

179
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,336
Dad.

180
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,509
I'm doing fine.

181
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,137
You and Mom raised me well.

182
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,182
So don't worry about me or Eun-u.

183
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,060
I...

184
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,565
I'll raise him well, too.

185
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,226
Hi, Jeong-in.

186
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,895
Seo-in.

187
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,648
What's with your voice? Are you all right?

188
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,066
I'm good.

189
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,861
How are things with you?

190
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,906
I'm fine, but you don't seem that way.

191
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,949
What's going on?

192
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,994
Seo-in.

193
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,288
Yes?

194
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,666
I shouldn't betray...

195
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,628
Gi-seok, right?

196
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,716
I can't turn my back on him now...

197
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,093
right?

198
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,598
If you do,
I'm sure you'd have a good reason.

199
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,725
One that is solid.

200
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,606
Jeong-in.

201
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,737
Yes?

202
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,617
I only want you to think about one thing.

203
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,328
Your happiness.

204
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,336
I want you to be happy too.

205
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,716
There's another man, isn't there?

206
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,099
Jeong-in.

207
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,396
No, that's not it.

208
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,941
I called because
I wanted to hear your voice.

209
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,152
But I'm just talking nonsense...

210
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,701
You're pretending to be all right again.

211
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,870
Look who's talking.

212
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm your copycat, remember?

213
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,670
We can get through this.

214
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,101
The file you told me to review

215
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,520
keeps getting classified
as a high-risk loan.

216
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,481
How so?

217
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,110
There isn't a proper file
regarding proof of income

218
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,696
and he's taken out many other loans.

219
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,573
He's in a pile of debt.

220
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,035
I see that he's a dentist.

221
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,413
I don't know how you know this guy,

222
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,291
but you shouldn't approve this loan
even if he's family.

223
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,501
Got it.

224
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,170
Thanks for this.

225
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,590
By the way,

226
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,258
don't miss next week's game.

227
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,594
We need to crush Ji-ho this time.

228
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,514
I thought you'd bring us victory,
but we lost again.

229
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,724
It was humiliating.

230
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,310
I only went soft
because it was my first game.

231
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,395
Just wait. I'll crush him next time.

232
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,239
Unbelievable.

233
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,741
-Su-jin.
-Yes?

234
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,451
This is for a book review event.

235
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,411
Put it at waist-level
so the kids see it.

236
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,580
Sure. Should I put one up
at the annex, too,

237
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,790
where they take classes?

238
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes. Make sure
it doesn't overlap other notices.

239
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,001
Right.

240
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,213
Hold on.

241
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,007
Ha-rin and I will cover
the main reference library.

242
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,385
You can manage
the children's library alone, right?

243
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,345
-Ha-rin. Let's do this together.
-Sure.

244
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,516
I'll go with Ha-rin. Come on.

245
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,363
Is something going on?

246
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,324
Well...

247
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,660
you've seemed down
these past few days.

248
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,996
I'm fine. Why do you ask?

249
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,415
You're not fine.

250
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,001
I told you before...

251
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,713
that I'm not the adventurous type.

252
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,010
I thought you meant
you don't like taking risks.

253
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,472
Just how far...

254
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,809
should one go, though?

255
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,440
Should you take risks in life...

256
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,025
or shouldn't you?

257
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,279
It's no big deal,

258
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,491
but Eun-u wanted to go
to the library after kindergarten

259
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,327
and we went to one in the neighborhood.

260
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,371
Apparently, it's not where you took him.

261
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,622
Just a second.

262
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,584
Eun-u, your dad's on the phone.

263
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,918
Hello?

264
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,505
That library has books you like as well.

265
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,257
No!

266
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,468
What do you mean?

267
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,678
This isn't it.

268
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,559
I'll take you to that library next time.

269
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,936
I want to go today.

270
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,648
I told you not to make a fuss
when I'm at work.

271
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,193
I hate you.

272
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,113
You only upset him more.

273
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,115
Where exactly is that library?

274
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,619
It's all right. Just please take him home.

275
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,331
We're already outside,
so tell me where it is.

276
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,917
Just don't.

277
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,920
But Eun-u's throwing a tantrum.

278
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,464
He can't always get what he wants.

279
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,883
Just be strict with him.
I need to go back to work.

280
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,676
I'll call you later.

281
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,127
WOORI PHARMACY

282
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,035
-Hope you enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

283
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,414
Good work today.
That's it for today's class.

284
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,916
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

285
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,924
You're getting better by the day.

286
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,220
If I hadn't gotten married
at such a young age,

287
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,306
I would've pursued an artistic career.

288
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,141
You can still do it.

289
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,727
It's too late for this lifetime.

290
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,400
Why is he calling me?

291
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,821
Hi, Si-hoon. Yes, what's up?

292
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,034
Everything is fine with us, of course.

293
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,202
Why did you call?

294
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:48,995
Oh, really?

295
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,415
Sure, by all means. What about Seo-in?

296
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,629
Right. Anyway, okay.

297
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,422
I'll give her a call as well.

298
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,842
All right. Take it easy.

299
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,470
What's gotten into him?

300
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:06,971
Your son-in-law?

301
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,058
Yes. He wants to come over for dinner
in a few days.

302
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,358
Third floor.

303
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,903
The door is opening.

304
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,073
Going up.

305
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,246
The door is closing.

306
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,546
Why haven't I heard anything?

307
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,550
I'm still thinking about it.

308
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,510
What's there to think about?

309
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,555
You know that
it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

310
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,643
I'll be hosting it alone,
so there will be a lot of pressure.

311
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:59,524
Isn't a little bit of pressure essential
when it comes to work?

312
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,110
-The door is opening.
-Don't think too hard.

313
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,280
-Okay. I'll let you know my decision soon.
-Going up.

314
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,241
The decision has already been made
by the higher-ups.

315
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,617
Just make up your mind.

316
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,456
-This opportunity...
-The door is closing.

317
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,001
...will help you generate
a career breakthrough.

318
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,633
The door is closing.

319
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,224
-Is Mr. Kwon--
-Oh, he went to the dentist.

320
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,977
-The dentist?
-That's what he said.

321
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,562
I see.

322
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,898
Okay.

323
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,141
I'm Dr. Nam's father-in-law.
Can I speak to him?

324
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,770
I'll keep it short, so tell him
to step out for a second.

325
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,146
Tell him it's me.

326
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,314
Yes.

327
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,366
Hey, Si-hoon. It's me. You must be busy.

328
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,746
Well, I called because it looks like

329
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,500
the chief director
has an appointment with you today.

330
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,670
Oh, he's not there yet?

331
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:50,259
Well, could you take
extra good care of him?

332
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,347
All right, sounds good.

333
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,809
It sure is nice to have a son-in-law
who is a dentist.

334
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,936
Yes, get back to work.

335
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,855
One more thing. You see,

336
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:08,027
you don't need to tell him that I called.

337
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,445
Don't worry.

338
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,032
Yes, we'll take good care of him.
Speak to you soon. Bye.

339
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,537
I told you I can't take any calls
when I'm with patients.

340
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,621
Got it.

341
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,501
A patient named Kwon Yeong-guk
has an appointment today.

342
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,878
-Here.
-He's here.

343
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,717
-Hello.
-Mr. Kwon, how have you been?

344
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,219
-It's been a while.
-I know. Come on in.

345
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,555
I'm a little early.

346
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:39,058
It's okay. It's for a quick checkup,
so you can come in now.

347
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,188
Have you eaten yet?

348
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,441
-I'm going to eat after this.
-I see.

349
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,569
I actually met up with Gi-seok
for a drink recently.

350
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,112
-Really?
-Yes.

351
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,450
He's been saying he's too busy to see me
since the transfer.

352
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,871
I guess he wanted my advice
on the marriage issue.

353
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,831
What issue?

354
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,293
Well, I'm not saying
they're having problems.

355
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,171
He asked me how he can build
a happy marriage.

356
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,048
We're practically family, you know.

357
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,051
You're a funny man.

358
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,179
What do you mean you're family?

359
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,684
We will be in the near future.
That's what I meant.

360
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,729
Please have a seat.

361
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,779
I'll lower the chair.

362
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,371
Please cover his face.

363
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,757
Something must be up with Ji-ho.

364
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,510
-Is he feeling unwell?
-He's doing that again?

365
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,439
I can see you in the reflection.

366
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,483
And I'm fine.

367
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,030
Do something productive instead of
standing around being all fidgety.

368
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,200
Goodness.
Ye-seul, what's the matter with her?

369
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,661
We're just worried about you.

370
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,123
You've been skipping lunch,
and all you do is look out the window.

371
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,085
I don't have much of an appetite,
and I have a lot on my mind these days.

372
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,130
-It's because of a woman, right?
-Seriously?

373
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,714
No, obviously.

374
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,882
-Why not?
-Why not?

375
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,302
The fact that we said
the same thing simultaneously

376
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,138
proves that you're wrong.

377
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,182
There's no right answer.
People come from all walks of life.

378
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,269
Giving up without even trying
is also a habit.

379
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,032
I've told you
that your life is important too.

380
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,452
I'm telling you
as someone who's been through it.

381
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,248
It's a disservice to yourself
to do something you'd regret.

382
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,381
Get going soon.

383
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,386
-Are you closed?
-No, we're still open.

384
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,512
-Thank you.
-No problem.

385
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,560
I got a deep paper cut.
I put on a bandage for now.

386
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,979
What about ointment--

387
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,024
We also have hydrocolloid bandages
that you can put on the skin.

388
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,609
I'll get the bandage.

389
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,986
There are different sizes.
Just pick what you need.

390
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,029
Okay, thank you.

391
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,449
I heard you and Jeong-in know each other.

392
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,955
I work with her.

393
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,415
-I see.
-Oh, no.

394
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,500
Here you go.

395
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,718
Is Jeong-in...

396
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,262
doing well?

397
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,681
So?

398
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,059
Hey, what do you want to hear?

399
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,102
Is there something going on?

400
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,938
Hey, Yeong-ju.

401
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,981
You'd better be honest with me.

402
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,652
Even last time you talked about him,
I thought it was so odd.

403
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,363
Stop talking nonsense.

404
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,158
By the way, did he say anything else?

405
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,661
Anything else? Like what?

406
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,830
Oh, he asked if you're doing well.
I said you're doing fine.

407
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,249
I asked him why he asked--

408
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,459
Shit! Hold on. Just a second.

409
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,586
What happened?

410
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,130
Hello?

411
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,883
Yeong-ju.

412
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,343
Hello?

413
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,890
Mom, you know...
When you're sending me side dishes...

414
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,060
Yes. The other kind of kimchi...

415
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,605
-and other things--
-Hey, what's happening?

416
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,816
Yes, send me some kimchi.

417
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,531
I forgot for a moment
that he's my neighbor.

418
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,952
I thought he followed me
to the convenience store to ask about you.

419
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,956
Hello?

420
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,417
Finish what you were saying earlier.

421
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,671
What did he say when you asked him
why he was asking about me?

422
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,592
He said, "I was just wondering
if all is well with her."

423
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,846
Why are you all quiet?

424
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,807
Jeong-in.

425
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,101
It's nothing.

426
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,687
By the way, what did he buy?

427
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,731
What did I buy? I picked up--

428
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,399
No, him.

429
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,112
I think he bought some food.
It must've been for dinner.

430
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,827
Hey, what's up with these questions?

431
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,749
Hey, Yeong-ju. Let's talk later.
I have to do something.

432
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,417
All of a sudden?

433
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,544
Okay, fine.

434
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,354
Did you hang out
with Jeong-in's brother-in-law recently?

435
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,606
He told me at his clinic today.

436
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,695
Yes, I met up with him briefly
a little while ago.

437
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,074
You should keep your distance.

438
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,661
Getting too close won't do you any good.

439
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,207
I'll figure it out.

440
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,668
You say that all the time.

441
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,880
What are your interests anyway?

442
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,300
Working to earn enough money to spend

443
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,554
and playing sports with your buddies?
That's all?

444
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,978
Thank you.

445
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,941
-You may leave for the day.
-Yes, sir.

446
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,360
Thank you.

447
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,202
I haven't said anything
and let you date Jeong-in until now,

448
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,373
but it wasn't because I like her.

449
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:22,253
You stopped talking about
wanting to get back into music

450
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,672
after you started dating her,
so I just let you be.

451
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,883
You seem to have finally gotten
yourself together,

452
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,762
so I think you should end
your relationship with her.

453
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,642
But you've never formally met her.

454
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,352
I don't need to meet her to know.

455
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,814
I told you that marriage is a business.

456
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,400
Try to look at the big picture.

457
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:49,280
Whatever you say,
I won't break up with her right now.

458
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,492
Don't get too serious with her.

459
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,412
I might marry her.

460
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,832
You fool.

461
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,920
Do you love her to death?

462
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,008
You need the basketball court?

463
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:13,762
Yes.

464
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,308
I'll let the administration know,
so you can just call them.

465
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,692
-Number One!
-Hey, here!

466
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,236
-Hey!
-Mark him.

467
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,739
-No!
-Hey.

468
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,159
-Move!
-Go, guys! Let's win!

469
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,952
You got this!

470
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,174
One more time!

471
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,766
-You got this!
-Go!

472
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,895
Go for it!

473
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,984
Hey!

474
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,424
Let's go.

475
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,844
Should we have gone
to a proper grocery store?

476
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,053
That way, we can cook.

477
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,930
I'm a better cook than you are.

478
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,724
I don't care who cooks.

479
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,685
I should ask Mom
to bring us some side dishes.

480
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,062
She's probably still mad at me.

481
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,732
Does Mom know you're here?

482
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,567
She found out a while ago.

483
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,194
Right. I told Seo-in, not you.

484
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,073
No wonder I haven't heard from Mom.

485
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,200
You're such a troublemaker!

486
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,036
-"You're such a troublemaker."
-Hey!

487
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,454
I'm sorry.

488
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,255
Seo-in.

489
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,634
Seo-in.

490
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,802
Seo-in?

491
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,808
You said you'd nap for just a few minutes,
but it's been over an hour.

492
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,685
Are you that tired these days?

493
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,855
I haven't been sleeping well.

494
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,274
Is Si-hoon here?

495
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,985
Yes, he rang the buzzer
from the parking lot.

496
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,904
That's why I came in to wake you up.

497
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,700
By the way, where did he have to go
on his day off?

498
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,453
Oh, he said
he had to take care of something.

499
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,334
Why do you ask?

500
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,544
Well, just because.

501
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,755
You could've come together.

502
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,508
You two can't go home together
because you came separately.

503
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,595
-I'll be out in a minute.
-Okay.

504
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,702
You didn't have to get anything.
Why did you buy so many things?

505
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,829
It's nothing, just some
red ginseng and honey.

506
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:10,124
Take them regularly.
I heard they're good for you.

507
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,336
You didn't have to make all this food.
Thank you, Mother.

508
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,880
No problem at all. Dig in.

509
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,298
Okay, thank you.

510
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,847
How's your clinic doing?

511
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,932
I hear most clinics
aren't doing well lately.

512
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,977
I'm actually thinking of
expanding the clinic.

513
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,188
Do it if you need more space.
How much bigger?

514
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,024
Nothing is concrete yet.
I should start planning.

515
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:40,446
Location is everything.
Pick an area where rich people live.

516
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,823
The problem
is that those areas are expensive.

517
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,117
Gosh, it shouldn't be
a factor in deciding.

518
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,119
The more you invest, the more you'll earn.

519
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,747
Don't look far for an example.
We have one right here.

520
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,499
She met Si-hoon
after becoming a news anchor, you know.

521
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,420
I could only meet her
because I chose to become a dentist.

522
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,506
I wouldn't have been able to meet
this successful woman otherwise.

523
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,681
Oh, right.
I met up with Gi-seok the other day.

524
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,766
-Really?
-Yes.

525
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:12,311
He seemed quite stressed out
because of Jeong-in.

526
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,730
Is that right? What did he say?

527
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,152
Why do you keep making him uncomfortable?

528
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,781
I think he wants to marry her
as soon as possible.

529
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,574
He asked me for advice.

530
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,743
And that being said,

531
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,790
I think we should help him out.

532
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,751
You should've told him
to take control.

533
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,670
Jeong-in doesn't really mean
what she says.

534
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,672
He should just take the lead.

535
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,549
Is Jeong-in an obedient dog or what?

536
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,802
I won't ask for a lot.

537
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,597
Can you please be mindful
of the basic manners at least?

538
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,352
Keep this in mind.

539
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,563
If you do to Jeong-in
what you did to me,

540
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,191
you'll lose her for good.

541
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,322
Shouldn't you call her first?

542
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,325
Do you think Mom will answer my call now?

543
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,494
She's mad at me, not you.

544
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,705
She must be so upset with me
for totally fooling her.

545
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,253
What should I get for Mom?
What can make her anger go away?

546
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,797
Whatever you buy,
only Dad will get excited.

547
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,763
Did you take
what was in these?

548
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,267
The vitamins? I gave them to someone.

549
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,603
Who? All of it?

550
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,981
You weren't taking them.

551
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,691
Were you taking them?

552
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,402
Jae-in, should I teach you a lesson?

553
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,825
Is your body feeling okay?

554
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,786
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

555
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,538
Thank you.

556
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,957
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

557
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,792
Here, this one is yours.

558
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,420
-Pass them around.
-Let's drink until we drop.

559
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,757
-Thank you.
-This one is yours.

560
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,137
-Shall we clink our glasses?
-Is the pharmacy open today?

561
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,140
Don't keep me waiting.

562
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,601
-Good work today.
-Well done, everyone.

563
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,908
Yes, we're open.

564
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,640
You should eat though.

565
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,892
-What's going on?
-It sounds like an emergency.

566
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,686
I'll eat when I get home.

567
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,647
Get home safely.

568
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,690
Guys, let's drink.

569
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,443
-Bye.
-Bye.

570
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,587
Why didn't you just say
we're about to get a divorce?

571
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,548
Right. I'm sure you're afraid.

572
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,551
It'll bring disgrace to your perfect life.

573
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,598
You can try to ruin my life all you want.

574
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,725
Just leave my sisters alone.

575
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,646
Hey, what did I do to Jae-in and Jeong-in?

576
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,357
I haven't even spoken to them
for the past year and a half.

577
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,651
Don't act like you don't get
what I'm saying.

578
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,362
Jeong-in can decide
whether she'll get married.

579
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,116
Don't stick your nose into her business
and tell her what to do.

580
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,325
Jeez.

581
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,246
You're acting up like this
because I've been easy on you.

582
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,123
-Come here.
-Let go.

583
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,666
-I said come here.
-Why?

584
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,876
Come here! Jeez.

585
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,358
Gosh.

586
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,820
WOORI PHARMACY

587
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,830
Security deactivated.

588
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,812
Crap. Darn it.

589
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,376
You're off today, right?
What are you up to?

590
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,026
WOORI PHARMACY

591
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,402
You're here.

592
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,989
I guess you couldn't leave because of me.

593
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,908
A customer left just now.

594
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,829
By the way, where's your lab coat?

595
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,623
I was just about to leave.

596
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:16,174
Those vitamins...
I want to buy them again.

597
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,593
Why? You didn't like them?

598
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:22,597
It's not that. I misplaced them,
so I need to buy them again.

599
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,184
Which ones specifically?

600
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,562
What was in those bags?

601
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,565
You didn't take any?

602
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,943
I don't like taking pills.

603
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,405
I feel bad saying that to a pharmacist.

604
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,533
I don't like reading books.

605
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,870
You must lack in culture.

606
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,622
You must be nutrient deficient.

607
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,833
I see that you can boast.

608
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,627
I'm better at playing dumb
after scolding people.

609
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,130
You call that "scolding"?

610
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,591
Scolding isn't just spanking.

611
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,224
-Spill.
-It will happen.

612
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,809
-Then it is happening.
-Finally.

613
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:11,146
Guys, Gi-seok is finally getting hitched.

614
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,523
-Finally!
-Congratulations!

615
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,360
Gi-seok! You did it!

616
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,030
-Don't leave us.
-Not now. We're just planning.

617
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,158
-It's not set in stone yet.
-Either way, you are getting married.

618
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,410
Right, I will. I mean, eventually.

619
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,828
You're living the life.

620
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,955
Don't hog all the good things
for yourself.

621
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,291
-Help us out here. Right, guys?
-Yes, totally.

622
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,169
-Definitely.
-Yes, please. Help us out.

623
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,922
Help us out.

624
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,841
-Help us out, Gi-seok.
-Hey, wait.

625
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,427
Let's put it into action today.

626
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,595
What do you mean?

627
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,639
Tell your girlfriend to join us,

628
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,600
but she has to bring a friend
who's single.

629
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:50,560
-Good idea, right?
-Great idea.

630
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,395
-Good idea.
-Nice one.

631
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,272
Where did you guys learn these tricks?

632
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,733
Gi-seok, take your phone out.

633
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,401
It's late. I can't call her now.

634
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,986
-Come on.
-It's not...

635
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,073
She's resting at home.
Why bother her at this late hour?

636
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,199
Come on. Help us out.

637
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,076
-Don't you pity us?
-Drink and go home.

638
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:12,123
Construction rarely happens here.
It's so noisy, right?

639
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,292
I'm leaving soon, so it's okay.

640
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:44,698
You can go to the back.

641
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,075
Take the call inside.

642
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:26,990
Hey, were you sleeping?

643
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,118
No. What's up?

644
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,913
Well, I'm out having drinks with the guys,

645
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,665
but they kept asking me to call you.

646
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,294
Jeong-in, come and join us!

647
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,464
-No.
-We're waiting for you.

648
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,591
It sounds like you drank a lot. Go home.

649
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,009
Yes, I should go home soon.

650
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,806
Jeong-in, do you want to join us briefly?

651
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,309
-You're saying it, too?
-Okay, all right.

652
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,937
Then just stay home.
I'll come by in a bit.

653
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,105
No...

654
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,358
don't come.

655
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,778
Hey, let me see you. We need to make up.

656
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,654
Wait for me.

657
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,366
I said, don't come.

658
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,921
It's a hassle for you.

659
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:27,592
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME NOW,
SO TELL HIM TO COME

660
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,845
No, I'm listening.

661
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,959
You asked me.

662
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,380
What do you want me to do?

663
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,966
I never asked.

664
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,510
I'll just take a taxi home.

665
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,804
That's not what I'm asking.

666
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,725
You know what I'm talking about.

667
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,187
Do you want me to stop you?

668
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,615
You tell me. What do you want from me?

669
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,993
What do you want me to do?

670
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,080
Should I tell you not to worry
about the fact that I'm taken?

671
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,835
Do you want me to be the only bad one?

672
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,172
Then why did you even come to the library?

673
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,799
I wanted to see you.

674
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,808
I'm...

675
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,405
I'm--

676
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,306
What I want to say is...

677
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,860
First off, I'm sorry.

678
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,655
You're right.

679
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,826
I went there to see you on a whim,
without a plan,

680
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,371
and I dumped it all on you,
asking you to make a choice,

681
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,000
so that if anyone asked me,

682
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,003
I could say, "I didn't do anything.

683
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,214
I wasn't even interested...

684
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,593
but Lee Jeong-in seduced me."

685
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,847
I was looking for such lame excuses.

686
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,564
In that sense, I'm not any better.

687
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,318
I pestered you to be my friend,

688
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,112
and called you when I didn't need to.

689
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:03,951
And like today, I came up
with plausible excuses to come see you.

690
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,704
At this late hour.

691
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,918
I guess I was lamer after all.

692
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,922
I'm sorry, too.

693
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,304
There's nothing I can do for you.

694
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:25,973
That's not true.

695
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,478
I'm so glad...

696
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,314
I got to know you.

697
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,237
You're a good person.

698
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,458
No, I'm not.

699
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,045
I'm getting bad desires now.

700
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,884
I won't expect anything from you,

701
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,012
so just let me see you.

702
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,474
I promise I won't get caught.

703
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,396
No, that's not right.

704
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,191
I understand how you feel, but--

705
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,401
I'm talking about you.

706
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,615
I won't get caught by you.

707
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,536
If we just let ourselves
follow these feelings,

708
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,080
it'll be much harder for me to stop.

709
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,750
And things will be a lot harder for you.

710
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,044
Help me. I need your help, Jeong-in.

711
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,588
You don't want to get married?
We won't get married.

712
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,048
I won't bring it up. Happy?

713
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,382
Do you think I'm an idiot

714
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,134
because I haven't brought it up?

715
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:28,346
Do you really think I wouldn't know
what your parents think about me?

716
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,764
I'm breaking up with Gi-seok.

717
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:33,184
Do you like the pharmacist that much?
Enough to end your relationship?

718
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:36,687
The nasty war has begun.

719
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,147
Your boyfriend won't let you.

720
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,565
I want to talk. Let's meet.

721
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,276
-What did you want to talk about?
-Let's break up.

722
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,319
Did something happen?

723
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,863
Am I the only one having a hard time?

724
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,199
-I guess you're fine.
-You shouldn't have come.

725
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,535
What do you expect me to do
if you show up now...

726
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,997
