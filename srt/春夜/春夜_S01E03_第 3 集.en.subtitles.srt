1
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,516
I know who you are.

2
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,977
You're Eun-u, right?

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,104
How do you know me?

4
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,483
How do I know you?

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,359
Take a guess.

6
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,695
Dad, who is she?

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,906
Who do you think I am?

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,074
Go ahead and guess.

9
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,413
Mom?

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,376
Why did you say that?

11
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,215
I'm not scolding you.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,093
I said I'm not scolding you.

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:34,844
Eun-u!

14
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,263
There's no need for that.

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,394
Eun-u, you like dinosaurs, right?

16
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,690
That's what I heard. Am I wrong?

17
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,901
I do like them.

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,071
Ta-da.

19
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,908
I have more.

20
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,162
Let's see.

21
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,249
Gosh,
look at all these different dinosaurs.

22
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,753
Take a look. Here.

23
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,891
Wow, how cool are those?

24
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,853
-Excuse me.
-What's this one?

25
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,646
It's a Spinosaurus.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,940
A Spinosaurus?

27
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,776
-Ji-ho?
-What about this one?

28
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,028
A Velociraptor.

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,864
A Velociraptor?

30
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:41,369
EPISODE 3

31
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,127
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,838
About what?

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,634
He's never said that before.
I'm sure you were taken aback.

34
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,973
I was. A lot, actually.

35
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,020
I didn't know you were a mean dad.

36
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,399
He made a mistake, so...

37
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,819
Actually, you did.
It was nothing to get angry over.

38
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,030
What do you...

39
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,741
Not just spanking
is considered scolding.

40
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,660
Do you normally get worked up
over small things?

41
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,706
I knew you'd be flustered,
so I tried to remedy the situation.

42
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,083
You thought I'd be grateful for that?

43
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,756
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

44
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,052
Even when I was a kid,
I thought it was unfair

45
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,596
when adults interpreted
situations in their own way.

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,891
When my parents did so,
I wanted to run away from home.

47
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,312
Oh, no.
What if my son runs away from home?

48
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,690
Apologize to him.

49
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,360
He's fine now though.

50
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,238
You think kids forget about
those hurtful comments?

51
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,864
They remember everything.

52
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,618
You don't want that pain
to turn him into a juvenile delinquent.

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,120
Like someone I know?

54
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,417
All right, fine. I'll apologize.

55
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,589
I'd like to grab a cup of coffee with you.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,094
It's okay. You should stay with your son.

57
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,096
I should get back to work, too.

58
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,391
All right, then. Thank you for your time.

59
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,601
It was no big deal.

60
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,620
CHILDREN'S READING ROOM

61
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,380
Where were you at?

62
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,549
The stationery store out front.
What about you?

63
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
Me? I just had a visitor.

64
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,012
Right. Who was he again?

65
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,681
I know him from somewhere.

66
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,809
-He's the pharmacist.
-That's right!

67
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,979
How do you know him, though?

68
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:15,690
He's an alumnus of Gi-seok's university.

69
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,068
I see. I was wondering
who the new guy was.

70
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,905
You and your imagination.

71
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,034
You haven't been
your usual self these days.

72
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,993
Of course I have.

73
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,371
No, something's definitely up.

74
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,582
-What?
-You're acting strange.

75
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,208
Eun-u.

76
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,337
Yes?

77
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,132
Can you look at me?

78
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm sorry about before.

79
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,388
Why are you sorry?

80
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,938
I got angry with you
even though you did nothing wrong.

81
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,192
That's why I'm very sorry.

82
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,943
All right.

83
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,780
Are you forgiving me?

84
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,823
Of course.

85
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,159
Why is that?

86
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,952
Because you're my dad.

87
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,466
RECIPIENT: NAM SI-HOON

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,176
FINAL NOTICE

89
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:38,231
The alumni committee manager has skills.
How did you book a hotel for the reunion?

90
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:41,234
It's the first one I'm planning,
and it's for the entire alumni.

91
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,987
Dong-jun is letting me
host the party at his hotel as a donation.

92
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,282
That was generous for a scrooge.

93
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,536
Your brother and brother-in-law
donated five million won.

94
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,622
Both their hospitals must be doing well.

95
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,252
You should make a contribution, too--

96
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,295
-How about ten million won?
-What?

97
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,131
Really?

98
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,176
There's no need to go all out, you know.

99
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,554
It's not that much,
so shut up and take your shot.

100
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,847
Are you sure about this?

101
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,558
A manager of the alumni committee
should know how to party.

102
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,559
It's my wife.

103
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,854
-I'll go and answer this.
-Sure.

104
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,105
-Take your shot.
-Got it.

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,779
It's no big deal, so rip the damn thing.

106
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,531
Change your address.

107
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,743
I told you that I'm not going
to stay separated for long.

108
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,872
Switch it back to your father's place.
Should I do it for you?

109
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,834
I see that your brain has been busy.

110
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,879
Are you using my parents as leverage?
Fine, go for it.

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,839
I'd like to see what you tell them--

112
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,091
-I'm selling the house.
-What did you just say?

113
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,553
Sure.

114
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,889
Try that, too.

115
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,725
Let's see how long
you can stay hidden from me.

116
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,269
-Gi-seok.
-Yes?

117
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,231
When do you actually go on dates?

118
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,863
My girlfriend works at a library,
so she doesn't always get weekends off.

119
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,491
She works late hours during the week, too.

120
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,621
The lack of time spent together
is why you've been dating for so long.

121
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,707
It's not bad, though.

122
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,127
A passionate relationship
can easily dwindle away.

123
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,922
You shouldn't date someone for too long.

124
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,465
Why not?

125
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,634
There's nothing good about it.

126
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:35,723
You and your girlfriend
already look like a married couple anyway.

127
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,437
You aren't one of those
cringe-worthy couples.

128
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,815
Did you expect us to show public displays
of affection in front of you?

129
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,192
Do you do so in private?

130
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,904
Unbelievable.

131
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,032
It's weird to still be like that anyway.

132
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,494
How's that weird?
All couples in love are like that.

133
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:03,543
Yes, exactly. That is quite important.

134
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,548
No physical response means
that there are no feelings left.

135
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,842
Think of the opposite, though.

136
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,596
The response will be involuntary.

137
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,873
Hello.

138
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,839
CHILDREN'S READING ROOM

139
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,022
Eun-u.

140
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,901
-Yu Eun-u?
-Yes?

141
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,197
Back at the library...

142
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,785
Can you look at me?

143
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,205
Why did you...

144
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,208
ask if she was your mom?

145
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,880
Can you tell me why you said that?

146
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,965
I won't anymore.

147
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,888
I'm not saying you did anything wrong.

148
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,641
You've never mentioned your mom before,

149
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,643
so I'm just curious.

150
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,952
Did he already fall asleep?

151
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,205
He must've been exhausted.

152
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,962
Why did you buy him more books when
there are still many he hasn't read yet?

153
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,756
-Someone gave them to him.
-Who?

154
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,387
Don't you want anything to eat, then?

155
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,681
We ate before leaving the library.

156
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,184
Leave your stuff and join us.

157
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,422
No, a bit lower.

158
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,596
Is it acting up again?

159
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,557
This is common for people our age.

160
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,978
If you're not going to stay the night,
go before it gets too late.

161
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,818
Has Eun-u...

162
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,446
ever mentioned his mom?

163
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,572
What mom?

164
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,074
His mom?

165
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,453
Why? Did he say something?

166
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,623
I'm just asking. Did he say anything?

167
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,168
He's never been the type
to ask such questions.

168
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,795
What's going on?

169
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,798
It's just that he'll ask someday.

170
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,675
There's nothing to hide or sugarcoat.

171
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,429
When he's a little older,
tell him the full story.

172
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,932
Still, we can't...

173
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,226
It's better than making something up.

174
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,357
The same goes for you, too.
Be honest with whomever you date.

175
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,317
My life isn't that important.

176
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,778
How is it not just as important?

177
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,239
You can't stay single all your life.

178
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,243
Some parents even abandon their kids,

179
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,036
so you're admirable compared to them.

180
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,622
-Mom, please don't.
-You love your boy, right?

181
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,291
Well, I love mine just as much.

182
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
Enough with the nonsense.

183
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,046
You should get going.

184
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,052
Whenever it may be,
I'd like to tell him about his mom, so--

185
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,887
Of course. There's no need to worry.

186
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
-I'll get going, then.
-What did Eun-u say?

187
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,271
Just let the boy go home.

188
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,148
Get going, Ji-ho.

189
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,958
I'll be back on the weekend.

190
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,003
Do what you have to do.
Don't be obliged to always come.

191
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,381
I've got nothing going on.
Call me if something comes up.

192
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,217
Your mom and I aren't that old yet.

193
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,887
Anyway, don't skip your meals.

194
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,181
I won't.

195
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,183
Good night.

196
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,216
You're the pharmacist, right?

197
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,219
Do you live in this building?

198
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,055
Yes, on the third floor.

199
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,726
Oh, I see.

200
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,478
How interesting.

201
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,358
-Good night, then.
-Bye.

202
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,776
Bye.

203
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,079
Lee Jeong-in, you're dead meat.

204
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,001
Let's see.

205
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,105
Not even celebrities wear those indoors.

206
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,649
What's with the illustrations?

207
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,445
It's for children.
I guess I bought the wrong kind.

208
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,489
But you don't even like kids.

209
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,324
Why don't I like kids?

210
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,952
Is it Seo-in who hates them?

211
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,454
She knows you're in Korea.

212
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,376
You two always talked behind my back.

213
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,005
Just be glad that
we haven't told Mom and Dad.

214
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,090
When do you want to see her?

215
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,344
When Si-hoon isn't around.

216
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,265
You've never really liked him. Why?

217
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,100
No reason.

218
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,145
That's how some people are.

219
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,314
Some you just hate,
while some you're fond of for no reason.

220
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,826
Thank you for the book

221
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,245
and also for being a friend.

222
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,956
You must really love Gi-seok.

223
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,125
Want to see how you smiled just now?

224
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,340
It's not a big deal.

225
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,422
-You do it.
-I can't. I'm too scared.

226
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,590
I did it last time.

227
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,759
Good morning, sir.

228
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,929
Any appointments today?

229
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,473
There's one in the afternoon.

230
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,059
Sir.

231
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,814
There's a letter of notice
regarding this month's overdue rent.

232
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,354
-Hello?
-Hi, it's me.

233
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,397
Hi.

234
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,774
-How--
-How have you been?

235
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,569
You know me.
I'm always busy with patients.

236
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,323
So what's up with you?
I haven't seen you around much.

237
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,076
I've been busy helping
people get divorced.

238
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,913
Is that so? Are there that many couples
that take their divorce to court?

239
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,500
Divorce attorneys
must be hitting the jackpot.

240
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,795
-So what's the occasion?
-Oh, well...

241
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,800
I was just wondering about
what I could do with my house.

242
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,053
The property is under her name, too.
Would it be harder to sell?

243
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,514
It's not that complicated.
Are you getting a divorce?

244
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:48,353
Seriously? If I were,
would you give me a discount?

245
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,026
Actually, I'm thinking about
moving to a bigger house.

246
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,655
Take your cues from me, my friend.
If only all husbands were like me.

247
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,033
I'm trying to sell it myself
since my wife is busy.

248
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,168
Hey, that was quick.

249
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,794
Have a seat.

250
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,886
It's a new show
that'll be airing next month.

251
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,184
Just think of it as a news magazine on TV.

252
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,562
You'll be the sole host.

253
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,023
Me?

254
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,985
It airs at 6:00 p.m., so we will be
targeting middle-aged men and women.

255
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,613
You have a gentle and clean image.

256
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,661
A chance like this doesn't come by easily.

257
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,414
-I'm aware.
-Then why the sour face?

258
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,791
That's not the case.

259
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,751
It's just sudden, that's all.

260
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,879
That's the nature of opportunities.

261
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,632
Although it's only for those prepared.

262
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,036
-Hello?
-This is Golden Real Estate.

263
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,333
Your apartment unit is being held
as collateral for your bank debt.

264
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,751
That's right.

265
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:39,256
I called to ask you about how you want
to sell the place.

266
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:46,013
I'll discuss it with my husband
and call you back.

267
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,683
Sure thing.
Let me know what you decide, then.

268
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,976
Thank you.

269
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,309
I can do this by myself.

270
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,522
What now?

271
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,483
The pharmacist.

272
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,235
What are you talking about?

273
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,196
Third floor.

274
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,033
Why did you lie about him?

275
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,826
I didn't lie.

276
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:54,915
What are you doing?

277
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,170
I should ask him myself
on my way home today.

278
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,922
Hey!

279
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,800
Wait...

280
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,468
Hold up. Hey!

281
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,970
My gosh.

282
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,098
What now?

283
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,641
What?

284
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,228
He's just an alumnus
of Gi-seok's university.

285
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,897
Why are you being so cautious, though?

286
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,525
I don't want you to make a big deal
out of it.

287
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,652
You're the one who's making a fuss here.

288
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,986
What are you talking about?

289
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,614
I knew something was up.

290
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,950
It's not what you think.

291
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,119
And what is it that I think?

292
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,541
We agreed to be friends.

293
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,918
Just friends.

294
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,005
There's no harm in that.

295
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,428
Because that's all you could be?

296
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,099
Jeong-in, you...

297
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,477
This is some big trouble you're in.

298
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,480
This is bad.

299
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,651
Forget that I know anything.

300
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,572
What...

301
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,676
I'll take that off your hands.
You have a visitor.

302
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,767
Hey.

303
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,230
What brings you here?

304
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,192
To get medicine.
Why else would I be at a pharmacy?

305
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,819
You'd treat me well
since I'm a familiar face.

306
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,530
How can I help you?

307
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,701
Do you have anything that relieves stress?

308
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,747
My girlfriend's been on edge these days.

309
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,669
Can you recommend me some vitamins?

310
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,256
Do you also have anything for elders?

311
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,716
I'd like that, as well.

312
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,551
Hold on a second.

313
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,558
Why don't you take a seat?

314
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,809
Sure thing.

315
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,022
Ji-ho.

316
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,484
Price isn't an issue, so recommend away.

317
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,834
Why don't you stay for a meal?

318
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:49,047
The sooner I kiss up to her, the better.
Things are that cold between us.

319
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,465
Why's that?

320
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,927
I'm not even sure.

321
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,013
Maybe it's because
we're talking about marriage.

322
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,307
Are you getting married?

323
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,436
Soon. We've been dating for a while.

324
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,232
-Congratulations.
-Not yet.

325
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,652
It's too soon for that, though.
The idea is fairly new.

326
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,072
Anyway, thank you for these

327
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,200
and giving me the discount.
Are you sure it's not a loss for you?

328
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,285
It's fine.

329
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,082
We should get together
either on the basketball court

330
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,626
or maybe for some drinks with Hyeon-su.
It'll be on me.

331
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,045
Sure.

332
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,215
You should head inside. Thanks again.

333
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,927
You should get going.

334
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,627
Good night, guys.

335
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,129
See you tomorrow.

336
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,932
They graduated the same university, right?

337
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,227
Yes. He hasn't really been himself
since that man stopped by, right?

338
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,312
Yes, totally.

339
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,648
He gave him a discount, though.
They seemed close.

340
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,692
I know all his close friends,
but I've never seen that man before.

341
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,778
-It's odd.
-What's odd?

342
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,365
Ji-ho never gets mood swings like that.

343
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,164
Oh, another picture.

344
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,625
This little pumpkin is bringing
so much joy into my life these days.

345
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,295
She's three,
but she can read pretty much everything.

346
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,839
It sounds like she's a genius.

347
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,551
What kid isn't a genius?

348
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,095
My granddaughter is different.

349
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,431
Tae-hak, please believe me.

350
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,308
-Goodness.
-Of course, I believe you.

351
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,188
By the way, when are you two
going to become in-laws?

352
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,398
Why haven't we heard any updates yet?

353
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,567
We have no updates to give you.

354
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,488
Did they break up, by any chance?

355
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,156
What are you talking about?

356
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,159
They're very happy in their relationship.
Don't say such a thing.

357
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,998
Young people these days
are just on the ball.

358
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:55,126
Leave it to them,
and they'll figure out everything.

359
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,420
Yes, exactly.

360
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,509
I wouldn't believe that.

361
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,260
They'll just keep getting old.

362
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,262
I've seen it many times.

363
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,098
Right, they should end it
before that happens.

364
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,018
They shouldn't be a roadblock
in each other's lives.

365
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,395
-Let me--
-No, it's all right.

366
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,196
You went all the way there to buy this?

367
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,449
Do you think I went there to see Ji-ho?

368
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,870
But he gave me so much discount.
I guess he felt like he had to.

369
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,915
Why did you go there?

370
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,875
Because of you.

371
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,048
You've been overly sensitive,
so I thought those vitamins might help.

372
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,302
I asked him for stress relievers.

373
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,347
I hope they work.

374
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,642
Gosh.

375
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,646
By the way, Ji-ho has a kid.

376
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,984
-He told you that?
-No, Hyeon-su told me.

377
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,698
He met the mom at a young age,
but she left after having the baby.

378
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,285
What do you mean?

379
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,829
Just as you heard.

380
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,791
He can't even find her
because she left the country.

381
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,715
I guess he can meet someone
in a similar situation.

382
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,012
He shouldn't limit himself.
Having a kid isn't a crime.

383
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,556
Right. But it'll be best,
even for his own sake.

384
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,641
Why be the only flawed one?

385
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,438
He should've done better.

386
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,315
What did he do to make her leave?

387
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,026
Would that have changed things?

388
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,654
What's the matter now?

389
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,698
Well...

390
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,701
Doing better or not isn't the issue here.

391
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,912
Feelings have changed.

392
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,460
What's with that stare?

393
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,757
Nothing.

394
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,929
You should go in.

395
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,931
Jae-in must be waiting.

396
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,893
Make sure you take this
even if it feels like a hassle.

397
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,938
And give this to your parents, okay?

398
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,400
Thanks. I'll make sure to take it.

399
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,568
All right.

400
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,445
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

401
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,033
-Get some rest.
-All right.

402
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,673
The door is opening.

403
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,260
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm going out for some good food.

404
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,221
-With who?
-With a friend. See you later.

405
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,431
-Which friend?
-Stop acting like you're my mom.

406
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,392
Don't stay out too late.

407
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,518
Hey.

408
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,562
Should we have had a cup of coffee?

409
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,398
No, it's getting late.

410
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,191
Who cares?

411
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,235
Shall I come by now?

412
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,948
Not today. Jae-in is here, you know.

413
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,037
-Gi-seok.
-Right.

414
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:01,998
Okay. Get some rest, then.

415
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,566
Hello?

416
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:53,901
It's me, Lee Jeong-in.

417
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,653
Yes.

418
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,614
I got the vitamins.

419
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,331
Hello?

420
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,918
So, this is what your voice sounds like
on the phone.

421
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,548
Hello?

422
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,676
Go ahead.

423
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,636
I shouldn't have said that.

424
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,807
So, should I forget it? Like last time?

425
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,811
Well, you told me that's not possible.

426
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,814
I said it
since it's our first phone conversation.

427
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,443
So? How does my voice sound?

428
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,656
It sounds all right.

429
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,658
Your voice isn't that nice, either.

430
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,661
I guess I dug my own grave.

431
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,040
I see you can crack jokes.

432
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,459
I didn't think you could.

433
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,962
I'm actually pretty funny.

434
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,131
How so?

435
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,634
People used to tell me that a lot.

436
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,014
So, you're not like that anymore?

437
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,142
Or did you intentionally change
your personality?

438
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,229
I'm not sure...

439
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,065
whether it was intentional or not.

440
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,609
Or do I just not have the chance?

441
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,070
I'll listen to your jokes.

442
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,197
We're friends, you know.

443
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,117
Can you afford to do that?

444
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,620
Aren't you under a lot of stress?

445
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,791
I'm just a little tired these days.

446
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,093
Are you getting another call?

447
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,930
Yes. I'm sorry.

448
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,683
It's all right.

449
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,686
Goodbye, then.

450
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,351
Hello.

451
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,023
Well, I'm just here to drop off
some side dishes.

452
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,275
-I see.
-When my daughter gets in, tell her...

453
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,234
Sure.

454
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,281
Jae-in?

455
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,245
What are you doing here?

456
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,248
Hey.

457
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,793
I asked you why you're here.

458
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,925
I dropped out of the program
and moved back.

459
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,930
-Mom! I'm sorry!
-Have you gone mad?

460
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,349
-Are you nuts?
-Mom, it hurts!

461
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,351
-I said it hurts!
-Have you lost your mind?

462
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,228
-Mom, please.
-This is crazy. How could you do that?

463
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,192
You should never open your own pharmacy
because you're too generous.

464
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,526
The same goes for marriage!

465
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,029
You always do things
that women would absolutely hate.

466
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,907
Ye-seul, would women be turned off
by a man like me--

467
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,325
Yes, totally. Big time!

468
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,204
Goodness, he's still smiling.

469
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,791
-We're off.
-All right. Get home safely.

470
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,420
-Bye.
-Bye.

471
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,506
-Hello.
-Oh, hello. Have a nice dinner.

472
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,840
-We will. Thank you.
-Bye.

473
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,346
-Hey, you're here.
-Yes.

474
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,348
Give me a minute.

475
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:55,976
How do you...

476
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,482
-This...
-Yes.

477
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,067
...can be sent just like this.

478
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,945
Oh, that thing.
Hey, how much do I owe you?

479
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,864
How much? Hey, don't do this.

480
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,534
My mom will yell at me
for never paying for these things.

481
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,244
Who says it's free?

482
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,621
I'll mooch off you
when you become a civil servant.

483
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,748
Gosh, seriously.

484
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,376
Oh, right.
I saw that person on my way here.

485
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,878
The guy who went
to the same university as you...

486
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,506
-You mean, Gi-seok?
-His girlfriend.

487
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,885
-Where did you see her?
-Near the bus stop.

488
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,346
She was with a group of people,
so I didn't say hi.

489
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,023
Has Jae-in called you recently?

490
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,818
I think she's doing well.

491
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,737
What kind of answer is that? Call her now.

492
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,991
Gosh, she's probably studying.
Let's not bother her.

493
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,326
You said I should call her more often.

494
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,995
Just call her!

495
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,957
I scolded her earlier.
I told her to focus and study harder,

496
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,417
so she's mad at me now.

497
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,794
You baby them when they need a scolding.

498
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,964
I'm afraid Jeong-in's wedding
may turn out like Seo-in's.

499
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,967
What about Seo-in's wedding?

500
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,386
You didn't even let either of us speak up.

501
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,430
You coddled her.

502
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,099
And that's why she's still mad at me.

503
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,521
If you were going to miss
having them around,

504
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,107
you should've been
more affectionate with them.

505
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,525
Why regret now?

506
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,028
Have some shame.

507
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,071
You said you were leaving work
when I texted you. Did you just get in?

508
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,533
No, I fell asleep for a few minutes.

509
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,161
Shouldn't you be all ready
to greet your baby sister?

510
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,915
Look at that brazen attitude.

511
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,501
I won't cry over spilled milk.

512
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,003
Mom knows I'm in Korea now.

513
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,714
Well done.

514
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,300
So? What's your plan now?

515
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,722
Are you going to get me a job
if I tell you my plan?

516
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,184
Does the company pay well?

517
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,827
Spend mindfully.

518
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,454
Thank you!

519
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,710
-By the way, where's Si-hoon?
-He'll be home late.

520
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,631
I should leave before he gets home.

521
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,884
Why do you hate him so much?

522
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,556
He doesn't know how to love you.

523
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,564
I'm going to make myself some coffee.

524
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,783
I'm sorry, Si-hoon.
I feel like I never call you first.

525
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,577
Gosh, who cares?

526
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,749
You and Jeong-in are good, right?

527
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,627
Yes.
We're obviously still together, but...

528
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,588
Are you guys having problems?

529
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,008
Well...

530
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,595
I guess getting married
takes a lot of work.

531
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,432
Did you feel the same way?

532
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,313
Every daughter in that family
can be quite a handful.

533
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,946
We should all get together.
I'll give her a little push.

534
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,161
The thing is, it's not easy
to find a time that works for Jeong-in,

535
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,081
and I've been busier
since I transferred to the new department.

536
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,209
The evaluation team, right?
Are you that busy?

537
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,837
We just have to take care
of a lot of paperwork.

538
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,215
The regulations have changed,

539
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,801
so there are now more things to look at
to grant loans.

540
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:43,555
Jeez. Had I known,
I would've taken out a loan ahead of time.

541
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,475
Do you need to take out a loan?

542
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,895
Well,
I'm thinking of expanding the clinic.

543
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,438
We keep getting more patients,

544
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,149
and because I want to provide
better service, I'm torn.

545
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,944
What do you think?

546
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,158
Well, I'm not sure.
I don't know much about the industry.

547
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,330
You know how I am.
I hate having to take out a loan.

548
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,504
Even if it's stressful,
you will marry Jeong-in, right?

549
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,924
Yes, we should get married.

550
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,638
Tell me whenever it gets stressful.
I'll help in any way I can.

551
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,889
Okay, thank you.

552
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,351
Here, let me do it.

553
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,441
I won't need all those things, right?

554
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:41,280
Come on. We're practically family, right?

555
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,284
It'd be nice if you could simplify
the evaluation process for me, you know.

556
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,246
-Cheers.
-Yes.

557
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,750
Text me a list of documents
that are imperative.

558
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,336
-Drink up.
-Okay.

559
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:57,838
This is on me.

560
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,391
I'll be right back.

561
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,270
We'd like to settle up.

562
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:16,482
Oh, sure. For the two bowls of noodles,
your total is 13,500 won.

563
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,319
-Here you go.
-Perfect.

564
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,695
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

565
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,910
You're not buying me a drink?

566
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,704
Do you want a drink?
We can go somewhere else--

567
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,165
It's all right.
Just go home and study, dude.

568
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,923
Are you seeing anyone these days?

569
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,968
Do you want to be punched in the face?
You know I can't afford to date now.

570
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,305
It's not like I can.

571
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
Like Hyeon-su said,

572
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,146
you should start dating again.

573
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,065
I don't want to do anything.

574
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,902
You need to think about Eun-u as well.

575
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,448
I don't want to find a nanny.

576
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,535
And I shouldn't.

577
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,787
-Well, that's not what I meant--
-In any case...

578
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:18,085
If I ever meet someone who I can see
myself getting romantically involved with,

579
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,712
then I'll think about it.

580
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,476
Actually,
there was someone I wanted to date.

581
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,771
Who? Who was it?

582
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,650
You... Hey, dude.
Was it someone Hyeon-su and I know?

583
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,822
What happened? Why didn't you date her?

584
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,954
Her voice didn't sound that nice
on the phone.

585
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,873
Oh, really?

586
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,583
Cut the crap.

587
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,168
Just eat your food, dude.

588
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,716
What was that about?

589
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:11,305
Hey, are you listening to me right now?

590
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:15,517
Stop eating and focus on my story, please!
You've been stuffing your face...

591
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,394
-Hello.
-It's delicious.

592
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,604
You can take that table.

593
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,871
-Hello?
-Are you out drinking?

594
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,843
Why are you standing there?

595
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,180
I'm just on my way home.

596
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,810
Did you just leave work?

597
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,562
No, I was with a friend.

598
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,941
I guess you guys called it an early night.

599
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,275
Good boy.

600
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,240
By the way, why did you call me?

601
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,871
I happened to see you on my way home,

602
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,166
and I wanted to hear your voice.

603
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,005
Ji-ho.

604
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,843
-You see, we should--
-I know we're just friends.

605
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,016
Don't worry. I won't cross the line.

606
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,191
If things like this make you
uncomfortable, I won't do it anymore.

607
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,865
I'm not sure.

608
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,246
I don't know what's okay

609
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,499
and what is considered
"crossing the line."

610
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,253
That's why

611
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,422
this is frustrating.

612
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,926
Then what do you want me to do?

613
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,265
What can you do for me?

614
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,893
No, don't cross.

615
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,985
I don't think it's a good idea.

616
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,426
-What took you so long?
-Hey.

617
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,471
-Cheers, ladies.
-Cheers.

618
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,934
-Let's order more.
-Excuse me.

619
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,311
-We'll get two more.
-Sure.

620
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:14,112
-Just get it over with.
-You think I don't want that?

621
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,791
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

622
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,211
Did you call him? Shall I go get him?

623
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,046
-He knows that I'm here.
-I see.

624
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,925
How's your funny sister?
She's doing well, right?

625
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,011
Yes.

626
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,848
How are things with your friends? Good?

627
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,141
Oh, yes. Of course.

628
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,270
-There he is.
-Yes.

629
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,522
Why didn't you wait inside?

630
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,568
-Are you headed home?
-No, I'm meeting up with Ji-ho.

631
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,904
For what?
Did something else happen to him?

632
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,530
No, I don't think so.

633
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,534
But I think he's going through stuff,
so I should check on him.

634
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,330
I think we should find a nice lady
for him.

635
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,251
You know what? My gut is telling me
that he has someone.

636
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,794
Oh, you think so?

637
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,963
That's great.

638
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,257
Who's this girl he's seeing?

639
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,093
That I don't know yet.
I shall interrogate him today.

640
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,722
-All right, have fun.
-Will do.

641
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,266
-Bye.
-Bye.

642
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,605
Well...

643
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:57,234
What's up?
Why did you come all the way here?

644
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,319
No reason.

645
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,863
Why? You don't like that I'm here?

646
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,742
Look at you, all prickly again.

647
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,663
All right. Where to?

648
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,666
What's going on?

649
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,293
Who is it?

650
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,295
Just tell me who it is.

651
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,215
It's a woman.

652
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,301
Right, so who is this woman?

653
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,891
She's just... A nice lady.

654
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:31,935
Hey, seriously.

655
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,146
Okay, fine.

656
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,023
So, you like her.

657
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,067
What do you like about her?

658
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,406
It can't be explained in words.

659
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,075
Look at you.

660
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,329
I've never seen you this crazy before.

661
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,499
I ended it before I get crazier.

662
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,210
Already?

663
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,629
Why?

664
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,173
Then what? Should I go on?

665
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,304
Jeez, you're so full of shit.

666
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,472
It's obviously still ongoing.

667
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,684
Right, I am working on ending it.

668
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,690
What's the reason, though?

669
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,694
Because I know how tough things will get.

670
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:25,822
For you?

671
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,745
For her.

672
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,216
You really enjoyed it last time.

673
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,552
I guess it's not as good today.

674
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,221
It's good.

675
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,852
Have you been taking the vitamins?

676
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,688
Yes.

677
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,903
How's Seo-in? Is she doing well?

678
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,655
What do you mean?

679
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,449
I'm just wondering

680
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,077
if all is well between Si-hoon and her.

681
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,581
All married couples have issues, you know.

682
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,588
Is that why the idea of getting married
doesn't excite you?

683
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,052
We decided to take some time
and think about it.

684
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,846
I thought you had a change of heart.

685
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,519
I'll try my best.

686
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:41,856
Are we at a point where...

687
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,692
we need to work on our relationship?

688
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,081
Is there someone else?

689
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,433
No, there isn't.

690
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,066
No one?

691
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,485
That's right.

692
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,571
Are you sure?

693
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,199
How can I prove it to you?

694
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,759
Lies.

695
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,971
What?

696
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,432
Someone says...

697
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,353
that she really hates lying,

698
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,649
but she keeps lying to me.

699
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,320
Hey, she sounds like a fraud.

700
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:15,325
Hey, don't believe a word she says.

701
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,626
Hyeon-su.

702
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,003
What?

703
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,215
Just once...

704
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,010
Really, just one time...

705
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,224
If I do whatever I want...

706
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,147
I mean, if I follow my heart...

707
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,486
will I be punished for it?

708
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,144
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

709
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,021
It's been a while.

710
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,231
Are you here to see Jeong-in?

711
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,359
Yes, I am.

712
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,153
But I didn't tell her.
I was just about to text her.

713
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,656
You should surprise her. She's over there.

714
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:02,367
Should I?

715
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,314
Hey.

716
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,737
Why are you so surprised?

717
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,317
I'm so glad I got to know you.

718
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,526
You're a good person.

719
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,986
Remember my sister?

720
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:04,113
When she sets her mind
on something she wants,

721
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,782
no one in our family can stop her.

722
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,242
Last time you talked about him,
I thought it was odd.

723
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,494
Is something going on?

724
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,746
You okay with me spending time
with another guy?

725
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:12,997
Just a guy friend.

726
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,625
I shouldn't betray Gi-seok, right?

727
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,752
Gi-seok, shall we just get married?

728
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,087
Gi-seok is finally getting hitched.

729
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,464
What do you want me to do?

730
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,550
-Do you want me to stop you?
-Why did you even come to the library?

731
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,593
I wanted to see you.

732
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,386
I won't expect anything from you,

733
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,847
so just let me see you.
I promise I won't get caught.

734
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,641
I understand how you feel, but--

735
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,392
I won't get caught by you.

736
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,603
Why are you avoiding me?
We didn't do anything.

737
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,771
Let's talk in person.

738
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,524
If you come to me now,
there's no going back.

739
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:44,278
