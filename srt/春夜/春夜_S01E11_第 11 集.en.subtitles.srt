1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,598
I think you're right.

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,850
See? I told you.

3
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,089
When did you get here?
You should have called me.

4
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,052
Let me introduce you to him.

5
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,097
This is my dad.

6
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,016
This is the man I told you about.

7
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,687
It's nice to meet you, sir. I'm Yu Ji-ho.

8
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,191
I see.

9
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,445
Let's go in.

10
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,032
Open the door.

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,326
Well...

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,039
This was totally unexpected,
so you're probably uncomfortable.

13
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,543
But I'd like the chance to formally
introduce myself some other time.

14
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,966
-Dad.
-Come on. Open the door!

15
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,138
Then I'll get going, sir.

16
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,105
I said, open the door.

17
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,924
Come and have a seat.

18
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,636
I said, have a seat.

19
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:03,975
Give me a moment.

20
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,560
Hey.

21
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,063
Jeong-in!

22
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,443
For God's sake.

23
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,899
Level One.

24
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,921
Well, what does he do?

25
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,259
He wants to formally introduce himself
to you, so ask him directly.

26
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,844
When can you meet him?

27
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,638
Stop being so reckless
and save yourself the humiliation.

28
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,931
Just end it.

29
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,850
What's there to end?

30
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,185
We haven't even started yet.

31
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,854
Is that why everyone already knows?

32
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,024
How have you been behaving yourself?
Word has already spread.

33
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,483
What do you mean?

34
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,235
What have you heard?

35
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,696
Am I married or what?

36
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,990
It's not like I cheated on my husband.

37
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,034
What have I done wrong?

38
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,870
Who's talking about me behind my back?

39
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,914
First, come and have a seat.

40
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,047
What's with that attitude?

41
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,882
Then what's with your attitude?

42
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,425
Does being older give you power?

43
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,470
Do you think young people
have no feelings or self-esteem?

44
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,681
What if someone treated
your child that way?

45
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,849
How would you feel?

46
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,893
Stop talking such nonsense.

47
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,066
That's how Mr. Kwon...

48
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,651
treated me for four years.

49
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,457
I hope you didn't take out the ones
that would upset me.

50
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,751
No, sir.

51
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,587
He hasn't really been meeting
anyone recently.

52
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,964
Not even that girl, Jeong-in?

53
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,258
No, sir.

54
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,015
You can stop tailing Gi-seok,
but I'd like you to keep an eye on her.

55
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,394
You know that she works
at the library, right?

56
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
Yes, sir. I'm aware.

57
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,819
It's the same every day.

58
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,238
I go to work and come home.
That's pretty much it.

59
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,490
What about you?

60
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,742
Living in the US isn't any different.

61
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,745
I go to work, come home,
and look after my kids. That's all I do.

62
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,581
By the way, my wife called Father

63
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,042
-and told him to visit us,
-Right.

64
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,420
but he told her it'd have to be
after your wedding.

65
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,797
So you finally got his permission?

66
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,595
You should settle down and get married.
You've had enough fun.

67
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,435
Hey, how did you get married?

68
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,520
Father was against it, wasn't he?

69
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,149
That was before Mom passed away,

70
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
so I counted on Mom
and just fled to the US.

71
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,904
I see.

72
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,365
I should be there for you
and help you out.

73
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,619
-I'm sorry I can't be a better brother.
-No, don't say that.

74
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,831
Don't drag it out.
You should just marry her.

75
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,083
What if some guy
snatches her away from you?

76
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,419
Even if you're getting tired of her,

77
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,922
other guys are bound
to find her attractive.

78
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,217
You're right.

79
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,814
-Where are you coming from?
-I was in the area.

80
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,401
-Where's Eun-u?
-He's in bed.

81
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,654
-Are you going to sleep here tonight?
-I'll see.

82
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,948
Where's Dad?

83
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,451
He's probably grabbing a drink somewhere.

84
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,912
I'll be in Eun-u's room.

85
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,456
Ji-ho.

86
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,583
Mom, let's talk later.

87
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,927
Anyway, it's stuff
you didn't need to know.

88
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,221
I guess I shouldn't have said it.

89
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,724
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,186
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

91
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,146
Okay, fine.

92
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,148
It's all cool.

93
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,110
Then what do you plan to do
with Gi-seok now?

94
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,489
I told you. We broke up.

95
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,366
Who says you can do that?

96
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,327
Has Gi-seok agreed?

97
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,747
You unilaterally broke up with him.

98
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,040
Dad.

99
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,626
He still loves you.

100
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,630
So I have to stay with him because of that
and act like I still love him too?

101
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,050
Can't you do that?

102
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,972
Can't you do that
and try to maintain the relationship?

103
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,182
Dad.

104
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,477
It's completely natural to get tired
of each other in a relationship,

105
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,438
but making a conscious effort
to understand each other

106
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,232
can help you bring the spark back.

107
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,067
That's what I think.

108
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,654
Besides, you two were together for years.

109
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,782
How could you call it quits
and go cold turkey?

110
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,367
That's so ruthless.

111
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,454
And everyone, including your mom and me,
wanted you guys to get married.

112
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,916
You can't let everyone down like this.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,712
Also, Mr. Kwon may have disapproved of you
before he met you,

114
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,047
but he's very fond of you
now that he has met you.

115
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,633
Hey, he's not perfect either.

116
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,719
He can misjudge others.

117
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,015
Dad, I'm your daughter.

118
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,392
I told you he mistreated me.

119
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
Jeong-in.

120
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,521
Change your mind,

121
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,441
even if it's just for my sake. Please?

122
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,863
I can still work, you know.

123
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,533
So this is about after your retirement?

124
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,287
I'm embarrassed to admit it, but yes.
Help me out, please.

125
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,706
I'll prove it to you.

126
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,958
I'll show you what I can do.

127
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,346
Did you tell Dad?

128
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,564
Hi, Dad.

129
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,402
I know you'll make a wise decision.

130
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,363
I know you well enough.

131
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,827
-Don't stay out late.
-I have something else to tell you...

132
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,997
Why are you leaving already?

133
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,516
Ji-ho. Hey, Ji-ho.

134
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,646
Someone keeps calling you.

135
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,320
Here.

136
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:42,595
You didn't pick up, so I kept calling,
thinking you might be mad at me.

137
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,639
Is your father still there?

138
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,933
No, he left.

139
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,227
Then why are you talking so quietly?

140
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,190
Just because.

141
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,778
-Where are you?
-In front of the building.

142
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,238
The building?

143
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,742
You mean my place?

144
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,122
Yes.

145
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,875
Why didn't you tell me?

146
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,004
You said you were at your parents' place.

147
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,174
What about Yeong-ju? Is she not home?

148
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,344
It looks like she's asleep.

149
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,679
It's okay. I called a taxi.

150
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,680
Wait inside.

151
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,974
The door code is 140719.

152
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,706
Can I cook myself a bowl of ramen?

153
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:48,984
Who is it?

154
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,780
I said, who is it?

155
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,366
I'm Lee Jeong-in's boyfriend.

156
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,660
You came to the wrong place.

157
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,830
I do have a lover, but not a boyfriend.

158
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,127
You're upset again, aren't you?

159
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,047
You're too easy.

160
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,316
Go ahead and poke me.
I'm still going to do it.

161
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,359
Do what?

162
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,160
-You actually poked me.
-Sorry.

163
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,605
I already saw everything.

164
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,341
Thank you.

165
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,263
Yeong-ju isn't asleep.

166
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,142
I'm happy you're here.

167
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,522
I have this book too.

168
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,357
Did you buy this?

169
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,236
No. Hye-jeong got one for me and Ye-seul
because she enjoyed it so much.

170
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,489
There are many memorable lines
in this book.

171
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,701
Well, let's see...

172
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,249
Here, this part is nice too.

173
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,877
Read it aloud in your lovely voice.

174
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,509
"When we fall in love,

175
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,471
must we get into it knowing
whether it will be fruitful or not?

176
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,307
Can we approach love in that manner?

177
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,643
We mustn't.

178
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,354
We cannot be calculating in any aspect...

179
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,816
because, after all, we love who we love.

180
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,906
When one falls in love, it just happens.

181
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:42,991
That's all there is to it.

182
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,578
Hence, let's not wallow in despair,

183
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,538
restrain our feelings,

184
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,791
or smother the light.

185
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,627
Instead, let's try to keep a clear head.

186
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,464
-And--"
-"And simply say, 'Thank you, God.

187
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,843
I'm in love.'"

188
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,613
I didn't even have a chance
to tell him anything about you.

189
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,991
Good.

190
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,534
What's good?

191
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,995
I mean, it's fine. Take your time.

192
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,250
Are you saying that to be considerate,

193
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,751
or is it because you're scared?

194
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,131
I'm scared that you may end up
putting up with the stress all alone.

195
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,343
I'm already losing confidence.

196
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,478
I know I said I won't let you get hurt,

197
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,230
but let me rephrase it.

198
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,444
It'll be hard.

199
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,947
You will be hurt,

200
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,576
and you may end up hating me.

201
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
And?

202
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,708
I may end up becoming the person...

203
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,502
who hurts you the most.

204
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,175
Just don't use any of these
as an excuse later on.

205
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,802
An excuse for what?

206
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,722
Don't give me that as an excuse
for leaving me,

207
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,766
saying that you're doing it for my sake.

208
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,313
What? Was that your plan?

209
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,191
Yes, it was.

210
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,153
Don't storm off again.

211
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,407
You know me too well.

212
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,791
I think we're quite compatible.

213
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,044
Is it because we're so different?

214
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,380
Are you saying I'm ill-tempered?

215
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,800
-I never said that.
-Whatever. It's too late.

216
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,719
But don't you think...

217
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,098
we'll be able to get through
everything together?

218
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,061
Say yes, Ji-ho!

219
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,064
Come on!

220
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,358
Say yes!

221
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,694
You won't say it?

222
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,825
-Hey.
-Hello.

223
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,035
What did you do at the weekend?

224
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,873
Well, I did a bunch of things.

225
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,378
"A bunch of things"? That sounds so free.

226
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,131
You probably prefer working.

227
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,050
Well, I can't really admit that.

228
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,178
By the way, when are you getting married?

229
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,473
Hey, Hyeon-su.
What did you do at the weekend?

230
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,559
-Did you play basketball again?
-Well, obviously.

231
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,312
Why didn't you tell me?

232
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,568
Oh, I went on my own to get some practice.

233
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,902
Not with the guys we play with.

234
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,821
Let's go.

235
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,995
Go ahead. I'll take the next one.

236
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,625
Crap.

237
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,596
Come to the meeting room.

238
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,955
It looks like you already know.

239
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,837
Don't jump to your own conclusions though.

240
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,467
I don't want to ruin
my relationships with others

241
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,636
just because of a personal issue.

242
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,889
So don't walk on eggshells around me.

243
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,099
Well, I was just worried about you--

244
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,643
I'm sure you did it out of concern.

245
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
But it actually offends me,

246
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,773
so don't do it.

247
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,947
And I'll never avoid running into Ji-ho.

248
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,326
You must know what it means.

249
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,931
This is driving me nuts.

250
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:02,477
It'd be nice to have lunch together,
but I have a lunch meeting.

251
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,855
That's okay. I'm just here to have
a quick talk with you about something.

252
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,903
It's about my daughter, Jeong-in.

253
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,117
Like I told you the other day,
it's not true at all.

254
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,952
Is that what your daughter said?

255
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,373
Who else, then?
I heard it from her, of course.

256
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,333
So it's not true at all?

257
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,797
Well, to be more precise, not exactly.

258
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,383
What? You keep changing your word.

259
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,552
No, let me explain.

260
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:41,349
I'm sure her guy friends occasionally join
her college reunions and gatherings,

261
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,227
where many people are gathered.

262
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:47,772
It's possible that someone saw it
and got the wrong idea.

263
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,568
You mentioned that you're suspecting it
"based on the circumstances."

264
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,362
It was probably
due to something like that.

265
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,532
That is my guess.

266
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,701
So you're saying it's a groundless rumor.

267
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,495
Okay. I'm sure the two of them
will figure it out.

268
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:07,083
But do you think it's okay
to leave it completely up to them?

269
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,173
I mean, misunderstandings like this
can happen again.

270
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:17,218
And all the talks
can get exhausting for both families.

271
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,430
If things drag out,
even the two of them might get sick of it.

272
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,934
As they say,
"Strike while the iron is hot."

273
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,687
I'd like to ask for your opinion.

274
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,356
Well, you know.

275
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,359
What are you thinking?

276
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,071
Let's just nail down a date
for their wedding.

277
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,929
I said you could take your time.
Have a seat.

278
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,723
Come on, sit.

279
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,642
No.

280
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,853
-It's such a gorgeous day out.
-What?

281
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,322
What's good about having a weekday off

282
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,950
is that you can enjoy
a quiet afternoon like this.

283
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,581
What are you thinking?

284
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,796
I used to think this on my way back
to work from my lunch break.

285
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,384
It'd be nice to chat and laugh
with the person I love

286
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,387
while having lunch together in a park
on a beautiful day.

287
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,682
Will that day ever come?

288
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,269
It's nothing special,
but I've wanted to do it.

289
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,646
So it was like...

290
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,565
your little wish?

291
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,359
There are things that I never got to do,

292
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,695
even though they're nothing hard.

293
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,989
For me,

294
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,660
I've always wanted to walk along
an old alleyway

295
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,913
after a heavy rain,
but I've never gotten around to it.

296
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,709
It'd be nice to go
for a nice cup of coffee after the stroll.

297
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,836
-Let's go together.
-If you behave yourself.

298
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,715
Fine. I won't go, even if you ask me to.

299
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,091
Sure. Try to resist.

300
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,010
You're such a thug.

301
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,490
It's a nice photo of you.
I'll send it to you.

302
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,214
I guess you think you're very pretty.

303
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,009
You are pretty.

304
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,144
Don't say "no" or "it's okay."
You have to say "yes."

305
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,815
-Let me hear it first.
-Just say yes.

306
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,526
You really are a thug.
All right. What is it?

307
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,862
Let's...

308
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,241
go somewhere fun with Eun-u.

309
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,541
I see that you're upset again.

310
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,960
You're seriously too easy.

311
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,012
I told you I won't date a guy
who loses his confidence easily.

312
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,994
-You're already here.
-I just got here.

313
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,078
Thanks.

314
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,832
How much is the rent here?

315
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,042
Why? Do you want to move out?

316
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,378
No. My sister and I
might get kicked out soon.

317
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,466
-Do your parents know about Ji-ho?
-They'll kick us out, right?

318
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,178
How would I know?
I don't know what your parents are like.

319
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,057
What are Ji-ho's parents like?

320
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,976
Ji-ho's parents?

321
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,270
Both of them are nice.

322
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,772
They've been running a dry cleaner's
for a long time.

323
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,483
What is it, Jae-in?

324
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,904
It's nothing. Let's go.

325
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,833
That night...

326
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,502
I drank way too much.

327
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:08,968
Do you think she's seeing someone else?

328
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,643
If it's nothing serious, just let it go.

329
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,355
You shouldn't nag her
about something like that.

330
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,106
It makes you look petty.

331
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,945
Her father wants to nail down a date.

332
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,240
You two should discuss
and decide on the date.

333
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,912
Okay.

334
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,047
Why are you still here?

335
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
Well...

336
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,553
About your question earlier...

337
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,017
Jeong-in is not seeing anyone else.

338
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,147
She said the relationship with you failed.

339
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,779
I was supportive
even after hearing that...

340
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,408
because I was hoping you could
completely turn things around.

341
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,370
Only admit failure...

342
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,082
when you can call it quits
without any hesitation or regrets.

343
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,337
Until then, no one really knows
who the winner is.

344
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,841
Do you understand?

345
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,930
There.

346
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,519
Now you can set your passcode.

347
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,438
Okay.

348
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,073
Don't forget your passcode.

349
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,163
It's all set now. Here, you should try it.

350
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,959
-Press this first, right?
-Yes.

351

ONLINE BANKING

352
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,920
ENTER YOUR PASSCODE

353
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,088
Enter the passcode.

354
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,969
-There.
-Yes, it's done now.

355
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,304
BALANCE

356
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,016
I can view the account details here.

357
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,311
I don't have to go to the bank every time.

358
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,980
When did you send me this money?

359
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,899
Oh, it's for the booze.

360
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,860
You didn't have to.

361
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,614
Anyway, thanks. I'll put it to good use.

362
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,203
Hey, give me a heads-up from now on.
I'll prepare snacks for us.

363
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,537
Gosh, stop it.

364
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,085
-I'll take them.
-What are you two chuckling about?

365
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,045
-Nothing.
-What is it?

366
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,089
-Dad, your phone is buzzing.
-What?

367
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,924
-Lee Jeong-in is calling.
-Okay.

368
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,056
-Where are you going?
-What?

369
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,100
To check on the machine.

370
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,152
SEONGDONG PUBLIC LIBRARY

371
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,079
Ms. Lee!

372
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,457
Hi, Eun-u. How have you been?

373
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,711
Ms. Lee, you should come over
and hang out with us at our place.

374
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,171
What?

375
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,965
Oh, okay.

376
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,467
-Don't say that.
-Why not?

377
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,847
-What?
-Your daddy doesn't want me to come over.

378
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,560
No, I was just kidding.
He thinks you're being serious.

379
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,314
Ms. Lee.

380
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,191
Yes?

381
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,152
At the kindergarten,

382
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,988
we made pinwheels.

383
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,324
I made two.

384
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,869
Oh, my. You made pinwheels?

385
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,623
Why did you make two, Eun-u?

386
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,126
One is for me,

387
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,129
-and the other one is--
-It's for me, right?

388
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,589
You made it for me, right?

389
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,257
Yes, it's yours.

390
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,218
Eun-u, you're a traitor.

391
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,345
Eun-u, next time we meet,

392
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,514
don't forget to bring the pinwheel
you made for me.

393
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,725
Okay.

394
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,563
Eun-u, do you want to meet my sister?

395
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,647
Yes.

396
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,858
Where is your sister?

397
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,985
-Ta-da.
-Hi!

398
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,112
You're so cute.

399
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,490
Wow. Your sister is huge.

400
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,748
Eun-u, gosh.

401
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,416
You should sit back.

402
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,335
Hi!

403
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,091
A MOM'S VOICE 5 MINUTES A DAY

404
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,196
Mom,

405
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,199
I can do this.

406
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,244
What makes you so confident?

407
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
You said the reporters
will write about this.

408
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,500
What if rumors
of your separation start spreading?

409
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,254
It will anyway,
once the divorce process begins.

410
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,048
Are you going to get one?

411
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,591
What about the baby?

412
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,970
I'll raise it myself
without his involvement.

413
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,014
That's because you don't know better.

414
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,893
Raising a child alone isn't easy.
It takes manual labor, not knowledge.

415
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,645
Being smart won't help you one bit.

416
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,815
I won't be able to raise the baby
as long as he's around.

417
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,941
I won't be able to take it.

418
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,527
Seo-in,

419
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,573
you know very well that there are things
about Si-hoon I'm not happy about.

420
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,661
Still, how things are happening for you...

421
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,206
proves that you're meant to be with him.

422
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,252
Marriage is a union of two strangers,
so of course personalities will clash.

423
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,212
Spouses can be your worst enemy at times.

424
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,424
But if you hold out
and endure the hardship,

425
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,175
time will surely pass.

426
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:28,639
Forget about everything else
and do what's best for the baby.

427
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,977
Do what's right for the baby
and give Si-hoon another chance.

428
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,228
If I do that, I'll die.

429
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,984
I will if I have to be
in the same space with him.

430
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,740
I understand that
you've fallen out of love, but...

431
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,784
No, I'll really die.

432
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,246
Seo-in...

433
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,665
I need to live.

434
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,085
I must live for the baby's sake.

435
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,882
Is there something...

436
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,969
you're not telling me?

437
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:01,982
Since when?

438
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,612
When did this begin?

439
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,450
I'm sorry, Mom.

440
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,203
I'm sorry.

441
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,038
Nam Si-hoon...

442
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,916
Where is this bastard?

443
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,335
Mom, no. Please.

444
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,254
-Let go.
-Mom.

445
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,759
Why are you stopping me?

446
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,846
You expect me to do nothing
after what he's done to you?

447
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,722
You...

448
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,891
You can stay put.

449
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,478
I'm your mother.

450
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,981
It's why I can't let this slide.

451
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,732
Mom, please don't.

452
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,068
I'll handle this,

453
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,404
so just be by my side, all right?

454
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,496
Mom...

455
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,958
Mom, I'm sorry.

456
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,669
I'm so sorry.

457
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,683
Oh, dear.

458
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,769
My poor baby.

459
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,814
My poor sweet baby.

460
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,316
That one, please.

461
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,785
Yeong-ju.

462
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,787
Hey, you're right on time.

463
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,915
We have 30 minutes to talk.

464
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,250
I thought about it,

465
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,213
and I think I should've told my dad
when I bumped into him.

466
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,757
If you had, you wouldn't
have been able to come to work.

467
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,675
You would've been hospitalized.

468
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,469
Then when do I tell him?

469
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,223
Seo-in, Jae-in, and even you
are telling me not to.

470
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,100
Can you really handle this?

471
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,896
I know very well
that Ji-ho is a decent man,

472
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,607
but being a single father...

473
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,904
I can never make up my mind.
I really don't know.

474
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,830
I do though.

475
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,545
I think I know what will happen to me.

476
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:32,716
Don't tell me you're already
thinking about marrying him.

477
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,135
What kind of question is that?

478
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,722
You'll automatically become a mom.

479
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,474
Are you even taking this seriously?

480
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,291
Yes, sir.

481
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,586
No, it's fine. What is this about?

482
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,675
Really? Oh, I'd love that.

483
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,095
It's been a while since we met anyway.

484
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,018
When would be best?

485
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,110
-Jeong-in.
-Yes?

486
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,613
-You've been getting texts.
-Oh, thanks.

487
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,920
-Hey, Jeong-in.
-What do you mean?

488
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,590
Gi-seok is meeting my dad?

489
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,011
I'm not 100 percent sure,
but that's what Hyeon-su thinks.

490
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,221
Unbelievable.

491
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,060
I didn't know if I should call you,

492
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,937
-but if they talk about me--
-I'm glad you did.

493
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,274
Ji-ho, don't worry about this anymore.

494
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,777
-I'll handle it.
-Until when?

495
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,321
What?

496
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,491
When do I have to hide behind you until?

497
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,090
Ha-rin, who was that?

498
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,635
I didn't see the name,
but whatever the text was, she...

499
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,806
It seems serious, right?

500
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,976
So it seems. What is it about this time?

501
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:00,406
What's going on?

502
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,158
My dad's meeting Gi-seok.

503
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,536
Ji-ho's the one who told me.

504
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,496
Is he angry?

505
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,331
He's uncomfortable.

506
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,085
All this time, he was patient
and suggested we take it slow.

507
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,296
Why wouldn't he be annoyed?

508
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,342
Even I agreed that you should
take your time, but I think...

509
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,263
neither Gi-seok nor your father
will back down easily.

510
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,849
So telling him is the right move.

511
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,017
There is no right or wrong in this matter.

512
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,602
It'll be painful for you,

513
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:35,023
but I can't imagine the hardship
Ji-ho will have to face.

514
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,694
I'll think of that when it gets to it.

515
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,697
But that could be today.

516
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,866
Gi-seok won't stay quiet.

517
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,872
I don't care what you do.
Just stop it from happening today.

518
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,832
Jeong-in?

519
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,959
I'll let them be.

520
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,383
-Yes, Ji-ho.
-Oh, boy.

521
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,469
I wanted to apologize.

522
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,638
I shouldn't have held you responsible
for this.

523
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,058
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

524
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,145
I feel bad for making you worry like this.

525
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,522
I think I should meet Gi-seok.

526
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,608
No, don't.

527
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,195
He'll only say things that'll hurt you.

528
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:26,116
I'm worried that he'll tell your father
and make things worse for you.

529
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,953
I actually want it out in the open.

530
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,663
He'll know it sooner or later.

531
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,500
I don't.

532
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,502
What do you mean?

533
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,506
It's about me,
so I want to be the one who says it.

534
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,886
I'm not pressuring you
into introducing me to your parents.

535
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,180
I'm just saying...

536
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,225
that I'm not scared
to show people who I am.

537
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,811
I like that confidence of yours.

538
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,231
You know me.
I'm a sucker when it comes to your words.

539
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,691
Well, I'm proud.

540
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,444
I don't plan to let Gi-seok...

541
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,780
have his way indefinitely.

542
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,617
Being understanding and patient
isn't working.

543
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,037
I'll meet him or call him--

544
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,331
-It's not you.
-What?

545
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,376
It's me.

546
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,171
His goal is to take me down.

547
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,007
He's not moving the clinic.

548
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,677
How can he
when he can barely pay the rent?

549
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,970
There's his wife.

550
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,596
They're not on good terms.

551
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,726
Is it your first time here?

552
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,229
Is Dr. Nam here?

553
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,523
May I ask who you are?

554
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,568
I'm his mother-in-law.

555
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,363
-Just a second, ma'am.
-I only need to know if he's inside.

556
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,489
Thank you.

557
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,960
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

558
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,631
Come in.

559
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,804
Mother, this is a surprise.

560
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,306
Are you in pain or something?

561
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,349
I can take a look--

562
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,979
Mother?

563
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,862
Report me to the police.
Should I do it for you?

564
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,161
Please hear me out first.

565
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,580
If you lay even a finger...

566
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,833
on my daughter ever again,

567
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,418
I'll kill you.

568
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,424
Are you smiling?

569
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,510
Are you seriously smiling?

570
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,430
How dare you smile!

571
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,349
How dare you!

572
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,479
How dare you...

573
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,492
That's as far as I'll go today...

574
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,498
because I'm too humiliated by the fact
that I let my daughter marry a bastard.

575
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,627
Your delicious rice is ready.

576
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:32,709
YOU'RE ALREADY A TREMENDOUS MOTHER,
FROM LEE SEO-IN'S MOM, SIN HYEONG-SEON

577
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,933
And here are the dreaded children's books.

578
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,186
I took a swift look,
and they're mostly damaged.

579
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,443
Are kids this meticulous?

580
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,570
They are by grown-ups.

581
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:05,533
For this damaged books exhibition,
we should write a strong message.

582
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,370
"The pain you inflicted
will someday be returned."

583
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:10,956
It's the same with relationships.

584
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,043
You don't realize that you've hurt
someone, but you regret it later.

585
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,421
You can also regret it
without even realizing you were hurt.

586
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,216
Who is more to blame?

587
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,134
They're both guilty.

588
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,973
I'm not saying
you're as bad as Gi-seok though.

589
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,684
Thanks for clarifying that.

590
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,896
I'm sorry, but I have other plans today.

591
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,023
-What?
-Thanks in advance.

592
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,233
What plans?

593
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:42,946
Gosh.

594
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,118
Jeong-in, where are you?

595
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,869
Why are you asking me that?

596
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,664
You've never asked me that before.

597
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,042
To check if you're causing any trouble.

598
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,420
Will you join me then?

599
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,422
Of course.

600
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,632
Ji-ho.

601
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,342
Yes?

602
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,886
I don't easily back down
from things I put my mind to,

603
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,556
so don't worry.

604
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,765
Where are you though?

605
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,809
I'll come to you.

606
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:14,936
No.

607
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,813
You stay where you are.

608
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,524
I'll be the one going to you.

609
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,862
As long as I stay single, right?

610
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,239
Date others if you want.

611
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,742
I'll get in between you two
and take you for myself.

612
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,919
Whatever happens,

613
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,880
call me if you need me.

614
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,008
I know that you're always an option.

615
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,177
You never let me help though.

616
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,055
That's how much I trust you.

617
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,474
I'll call you.

618
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,186
Are you going to where
your dad's meeting Gi-seok?

619
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:58,855
I said I'll call you.

620
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,274
All right.

621
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,901
Be careful then.

622
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,195
Sure thing. Bye.

623
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,295
Let me.

624
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:28,218
We talked about meeting up,
but it took us this long to finally do so.

625
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,847
I should have called you first, Father.
I apologize.

626
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,683
You're right. I was a bit upset, you know.

627
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,852
Here.

628
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:47,320
I thought about inviting your father, too,
but didn't.

629
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:53,743
I also thought about inviting Jeong-in,
but didn't.

630
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,872
It's fine. All we need
is a representative from each family.

631
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:58,998
Right.

632
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,383
I hear that Jeong-in's cheating on you.

633
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,186
Why aren't you drinking any beer?

634
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,189
I don't feel like it.

635
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,191
Who drinks because they feel like it?

636
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,487
Whether you drink or not,
I'm going to let you treat me good.

637
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,074
Are you going to tell on me to my sister?

638
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,785
I can distinguish my allies and enemies.

639
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,416
But I'll be your enemy.

640
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,794
It's only a joke.

641
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,881
I'm not one to be loyal.

642
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,884
I'll turn my back on you
if you don't do well.

643
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,845
She'd do that and then some.

644
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,433
You say that
like you've dated me for a long time.

645
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,771
Give me a few pointers then.

646
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,402
Is Gi-seok out of the picture now?

647
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,325
If you're worried, don't be.

648
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,369
What about my dad?

649
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,207
I heard you met him.

650
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,834
Did he even meet your eyes?

651
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,006
Even though I'm his daughter,

652
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,634
he treats me as if I'm invisible
ever since I messed up.

653
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,052
That says a lot, right?

654
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,973
I'm not trying to scare you.

655
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,976
I'm telling you that he's difficult.

656
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,863
Father, has Jeong-in...

657
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,535
told you the whole story?

658
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,496
Hold on.

659
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,623
Is there something I should know?

660
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:05,792
Is that the case?

661
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,171
Well, it's just that...

662
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,091
your father spoke about it first,

663
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,594
so I thought you had said something.

664
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,138
It's just...

665
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,103
I think my father misunderstood me.

666
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,149
A misunderstanding?

667
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,234
Yes.

668
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,323
You see, I got drunk recently
and rambled over the phone.

669
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,246
I tried to correct him,
but he still got the wrong idea.

670
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,874
He should've told me about that too then!

671
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,668
Unbelievable.

672
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,963
I didn't know about that,

673
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:56,259
so I actually called you here
to apologize.

674
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,680
You two have been dating for a while,

675
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,934
so I understand
if you're in some sort of rut.

676
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,438
But having another man in the picture?
That's just an absurd thing!

677
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,524
Even on my way here,
I thought about it many times over

678
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,192
because I knew it couldn't be true.

679
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,571
I'm her parent after all.
How could I not know her?

680
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:18,906
Of course.

681
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:25,163
Then there's nothing more
to talk about, right?

682
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,331
That's right.

683
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,832
Good then.

684
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,377
We just need to settle on a date.

685
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,467
You guys haven't been moving forward.

686
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,137
Mr. Kwon and I
had to get off our butts for you.

687
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,682
I'm sorry. I promise to do better.

688
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,810
Let's just get it over with
while we're on the subject.

689
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,524
We should hear what Jeong-in wants first.

690
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,526
What's there to talk about?

691
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,905
It's already been decided.
All we need is a date.

692
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,574
Just pick one that works for you.

693
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,204
Has the food here always been this tasty?

694
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,458
I think you should decide...

695
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,461
on the date for us.

696
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,425
Parents are better
at these sort of things, right?

697
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,262
-I see.
-What do you think?

698
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,392
You are...

699
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,769
a lot like your father.

700
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,023
You really are.

701
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,686
I think it's her.

702
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,522
All right.

703
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,216
Gi-seok, don't you worry about a thing.

704
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,134
I'll clear the path for you.

705
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,720
This is where we first met.
Let's get married.

706
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,263
I'm choosing this for your sake.

707
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,475
Why did you even receive this?
You should've thrown it in his face.

708
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,060
Gi-seok proposed to her.

709
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,063
He must be bragging because it went well.

710
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,148
Can we meet?
Don't tell me you're avoiding me.

711
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,525
Sure, let's meet today.

712
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,611
Hyeon-su, that blabbermouth,
probably told you what happened.

713
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,364
How much harder
will you make it for Jeong-in?

714
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,532
You're an obnoxious prick.

715
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,283
You're doing this

716
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,953
not because you want Jeong-in
but because you can't lose to me.

717
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:54,163
-Just stop it already.
-I will when you do.

718
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,541
I'm done being considerate to you.

719
01:03:56,624 --> 01:04:00,586
-Would you like to meet my parents?
-What if they're not fond of me?

720
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,505
-Then we'll have to break up.
-Hey!

721
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,008
-"Hey"?
-You know I didn't mean it like that.

722
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,596
