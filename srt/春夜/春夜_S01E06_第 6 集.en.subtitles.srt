1
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,392
Hello?

2
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,770
What did you want to talk about?

3
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,608
You said you wanted to talk.

4
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,865
Let's break up.

5
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,917
Why are you being like this, seriously?

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,251
You saw it coming.

7
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,339
Let's break up.

8
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,391
EPISODE 6

9
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,399
You really want to end things?

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,360
Yes, I do.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,696
You actually want to break up?

12
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,199
How many times must I say it?

13
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,079
Can you actually do it?

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,998
What do you take me for?

15
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,378
What is the reason?

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,340
Why are you doing this?

17
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,136
Are you mad that
I'm the one breaking it off?

18
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,306
I've heard you say it
so many times over the years.

19
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,809
Don't worry.

20
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,729
If anyone ever asks,
I'll say that you dumped me.

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,150
Right. You've heard it many times
but never took it to heart. So why now?

22
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,361
Don't even think of using my parents
as an excuse.

23
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,991
As you said, it's not like
we started dating with marriage in mind.

24
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,286
The topic was brought up naturally
with time.

25
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,289
Whether they disapprove of you or not

26
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,417
can't really be the reason.

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,586
Then let's break up without any reason.

28
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,214
Jeong-in.

29
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,884
I have nothing else to say to you.

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,011
Jeong-in.

31
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,846
I have nothing to say,

32
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,056
and I can't really talk now. I have to go.

33
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,349
Hey.

34
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,862
Damn it.

35
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,208
You're still here.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,002
I didn't want to be yelled at.

37
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,469
Couldn't you just play dumb?

38
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,154
When Yeong-jae comes back,
I'll list some excuses and leave.

39
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,573
You don't have to leave.

40
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,745
But you have a lot on your mind,
and so do I.

41
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,542
I'm bringing this up just in case.

42
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,548
This has nothing to do with you.

43
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,098
How should I put this?

44
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,270
The woman I'm attracted to
is breaking up with her boyfriend,

45
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,355
but I can't be happy about it.

46
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,528
I don't know how to describe this feeling.

47
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,617
Are you afraid that I might pester you
even more from now on?

48
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,506
I know you think I'm quite random

49
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,427
and that I make you flustered at times.

50
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,015
There must've been times
you thought I was going overboard.

51
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,686
Thinking back,

52
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,983
I don't know when this confusion began.

53
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,404
But instead of trying
to sort it out quickly,

54
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,035
I just wanted to avoid dealing with it.

55
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,372
And I was your punching bag every time.

56
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,002
Right, so thank you for that.

57
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,978
I keep thinking that this may be
too much of a hassle for your sister.

58
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,564
No, I told you it's fine.
She's very straightforward.

59
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,566
She would've said no
if she didn't want it.

60
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,445
She doesn't seem like the type to do that.

61
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,366
Then what about me?

62
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,910
Come on, what now?

63
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,497
You've been observing Jeong-in,
but not so much me?

64
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,957
I should just go hit on the pharmacist.

65
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,835
You said he likes someone.

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,505
Hey, don't bring that up.

67
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,048
Why not?

68
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,008
Just because. Don't bring it up, please.

69
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,346
-But why?
-Just don't. Seriously.

70
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,847
Please don't, okay?

71
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,350
I heard you're head over heels
for someone.

72
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,061
Who told you that?

73
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,270
This guy here.

74
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,647
Hey, Jae-in.

75
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,733
You can scold her.
She's much younger than you.

76
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,735
No, it's all right.

77
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,362
What's wrong with it?

78
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,948
We shouldn't be ashamed of such feelings.

79
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,865
Right?

80
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,951
Yes, you're right.

81
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,371
What's she like?
Why are you so attracted to her?

82
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,580
Jae-in.

83
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,290
I'm not asking you.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,127
What's her charm?

85
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,006
She's such a fool.

86
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,136
What do you mean?

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,264
Do you like girls who are stupid?

88
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,807
Are you stupid?

89
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,726
-Goodness.
-Hey, Jae-in. You're drunk.

90
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,020
She talks in French sometimes
when she's drunk.

91
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,899
Mr. Pharmacist
spoke gibberish to begin with.

92
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,572
This is already empty.

93
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,658
Let's drink until we drop!

94
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,618
Hey, you're drunk.

95
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,704
Stop acting like you're my mom.

96
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,591
Yes.

97
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,346
Why are you still awake?

98
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,184
Yes, right.

99
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,978
-Over there.
-Yes.

100
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,608
Really? Yes.

101
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,528
Yes.

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,368
Gosh, it's not good
that you keep waking up.

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,746
Daddy, were you asleep too?

104
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,333
-No, I'm not in bed yet.
-Why not?

105
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,419
What?

106
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,046
Daddy, why aren't you talking?

107
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,465
Well, I'm...

108
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,384
I'm at my friend's place now.

109
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,261
Are you at the teacher's place?

110
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,722
No.

111
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,934
Eun-u, you should go back to sleep.

112
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,812
Let me talk to her.

113
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,689
For what?

114
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,275
Why do you want to talk to her?

115
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,656
Eun-u, you should go back to sleep
so that you can...

116
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:58,913
Hello?

117
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,624
Hi, Eun-u.

118
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,934
Yes.

119
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,066
A quail's egg.

120
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,527
Yes.

121
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,156
Yes.

122
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,495
Eun-u, you need to go to bed early
so that you can grow taller.

123
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,293
You'll outgrow your dad?

124
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,045
Then you should go back to sleep now.

125
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,468
You were reading a book about dinosaurs?

126
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,767
Okay, Eun-u.

127
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,395
I'll see you in your dream.

128
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,192
All right. You can have
a good night's sleep, right?

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,571
Pull up your blanket.

130
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,365
Yes.

131
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,784
Okay, see you soon.

132
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,122
Yes, your daddy will go home soon.

133
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,021
Give me that. I'll do it.

134
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,814
I can do that.

135
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,609
-No, I'll do it. I like doing this.
-Really?

136
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,568
I got this.

137
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,363
-Don't put too much on the grill.
-All right, I'll stop now.

138
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,281
-Hey, pour me another one.
-Sure.

139
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,912
It's so good.

140
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,668
Don't eat that. It's not cooked.

141
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,463
I can never tell what's ready to be eaten
and what's not fully cooked.

142
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,881
This isn't fully cooked yet.

143
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,426
Who's here at this hour?

144
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,553
Who could it be?

145
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,104
Isn't that Gi-seok?

146
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,028
Well...

147
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,739
Don't come out. Stay here with them, okay?

148
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,076
Jeong-in.

149
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,429
Did you drink?

150
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,014
Why are you here?

151
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,647
It's Jeong-in's boyfriend.

152
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,693
Don't mind them. Let's drink.

153
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,740
-What are you thinking?
-Nothing.

154
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,210
Pass me the booze.

155
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,381
I understand
that you've made up your mind,

156
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,303
but you need to at least keep
the basic manners.

157
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,472
Is this really it?

158
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,728
We have no respect for each other,
so who cares how our relationship ends?

159
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,064
I said I know that your feelings are hurt,
didn't I?

160
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,692
Then we should try to make things work.

161
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,820
How could you want to end things
right away?

162
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,033
Are you going to keep
raising your voice at me?

163
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,869
Shall I make all my neighbors come out?

164
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

165
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,955
I have nothing to say to you.

166
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,332
Hey.

167
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,793
Don't do that.

168
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,294
What's going on?

169
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,048
We should probably leave, right?

170
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,343
If we go now, things will get awkward.

171
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,512
I said, let go!

172
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,477
I'm coming back in.

173
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,104
Our neighbors might complain, you know.

174
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,649
We have guests over now,

175
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,819
but why don't you come in
and get your relationship evaluated?

176
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,782
-Come on in.
-Jae-in.

177
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,700
You said they're my guests.

178
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,120
Earlier, you said

179
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,414
I can treat your place as if it's my own.

180
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,292
Who's here?

181
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,419
They're my guests.

182
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,047
-Come on in and see for yourself.
-Go back inside.

183
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,882
I said, go back in.

184
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,176
Your guests are waiting.

185
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,446
I let you have time to think.

186
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,782
Didn't I?

187
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,536
It's my turn now. Give me some time.

188
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,831
Breaking up like this...

189
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,166
It doesn't make any sense.

190
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,892
Let's go.

191
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,730
What's up with Gi-seok?

192
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,232
Why show up unannounced and ruin the fun?

193
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,860
No, Jae-in. We were going to leave anyway.

194
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,362
Come on. Let's go.

195
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,325
This is so annoying.

196
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,243
Have fun with your friends.

197
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,079
-Okay.
-Good.

198
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,417
Gosh, tell me already.

199
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,253
What did you and your daddy
talk about secretly?

200
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,424
I talked with the teacher.

201
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,553
Your daddy was with the teacher?

202
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,721
Yes.

203
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,683
I see. Then what did you
and the teacher talk about?

204
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,814
She told me that I need to go to bed early
to grow taller.

205
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,113
Eun-u, is the teacher a woman?

206
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,281
It's not a guy?

207
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,701
All teachers are women.

208
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,294
MIYANG KINDERGARTEN

209
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,217
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,969
Hello.

211
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,180
Eun-u, let's bow to each other. Hello.

212
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,683
-Come on, let's bow. Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,477
-We'll be off, then.
-All right.

214
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
Have a nice day, Eun-u.

215
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,899
Eun-u, say bye to your grandma.

216
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,612
Let's go.

217
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,297
What's the matter?

218
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,341
I think Ji-ho is seeing someone.

219
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:39,678
Did you hear me?

220
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,763
Just pretend you don't know about it.

221
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,808
I don't even know anything
about this lady.

222
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,394
It sounds like she's a teacher.

223
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:52,191
I guess she works at the library
he took Eun-u to a while back.

224
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,486
He'll tell us when the time comes.

225
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,117
I was going to ask him about meeting
the daughter of the corner store owner.

226
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,786
He always takes care of things
on his own, you know.

227
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,678
Where are you coming from?

228
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,225
I had to attend a meeting
with the Principals' Council.

229
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,559
What was the meeting about?

230
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,187
We discussed how we shouldn't accept
every request

231
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,897
made by the Parents' Association.

232
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,150
In other words, don't be a pushover?

233
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,195
Right. Unilateral abuse of power
is unacceptable

234
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,863
in this day and age, you know.

235
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,575
I'll submit a report regarding it.

236
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,494
Wait, let's go for a walk.

237
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,996
I should hurry back to write the report.

238
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,874
Why are you in a sulky mood?

239
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,838
What do you plan to do
after you retire next year?

240
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,508
I don't really have a plan yet.

241
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,927
How would you feel
about working for the foundation?

242
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,056
Wait. Do you mean...

243
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,809
Wouldn't it be better for you
to stay in the same industry?

244
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,520
Yes, of course.

245
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,105
No matter what it is,

246
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:16,817
being able to work, in and of itself, is
something we all should be grateful for.

247
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,237
And about our kids...

248
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
Yes.

249
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,366
It's the same
for my son and your daughter.

250
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,411
We never know
whom they'll end up marrying.

251
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,873
Marriage is a major life event,
so we should really think it through.

252
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,919
If we aren't careful,
it can end badly for both families.

253
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,296
Understood.

254
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,465
Let's not make a rash decision.

255
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,550
Okay.

256
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,019
It won't rip like that.

257
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm losing it.
There are some books that are missing.

258
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,649
Maybe they haven't been returned yet.

259
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,360
No, brand new books are missing.

260
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,279
The Dinosaur Expedition, Dinosaur World.

261
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,906
I took them.

262
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,538
I meant to expense them,
but I totally forgot about it.

263
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,958
They're all children's books.

264
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,169
I took them for my nephew.

265
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,712
You don't have a nephew, though.

266
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,256
It's my cousin's son.

267
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,385
I'm off to the reference library.

268
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,559
-She was flustered, right?
-Yes, very much so.

269
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,315
You saw the photo of my friend's cousin.
You really don't want to meet her?

270
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,027
Leave him alone. He thinks too much,
so it won't go anywhere.

271
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,945
I'll be off, then.

272
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,740
-See you tomorrow.
-See you!

273
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,200
-Get home safely.
-Bye.

274
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,413
What?

275
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,304
I keep forgetting the old Ji-ho.

276
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,934
You used to be high-spirited
back in college.

277
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,687
You were fun, smart, and competitive.

278
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,065
But back then...

279
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,317
Because you didn't have Eun-u?

280
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,321
No one's life goes as planned.

281
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,657
Sometimes, it takes an unexpected turn,

282
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,451
and things you never thought would happen
may happen to you.

283
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,622
Your life did change significantly
because of Eun-u,

284
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,582
but you shouldn't be pessimistic.

285
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,753
-I never was.
-And that's why I'm impressed by you.

286
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,548
I wasn't asking you to flatter me.

287
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,092
Since I'm a parent myself,

288
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,094
there's one thing I can tell you for sure.

289
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,388
You are raising Eun-u,

290
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,349
but he has actually helped you grow up.

291
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:02,149
But why do I feel like you're going back
to your immature self these days?

292
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,071
If I'm mistaken, just forget what I said.

293
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,664
There's someone I like.

294
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,212
Her situation is different from mine.

295
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,218
Plus, things that feel like obstacles
keep happening.

296
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,181
"Is it a sign
that I shouldn't pursue this further?"

297
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,099
I keep thinking that.

298
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,896
Are you sure you won't have any regrets
even if you let her go?

299
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,741
I can endure it all,

300
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,411
but she'll obviously have a hard time
because of me.

301
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,039
Don't kid yourself.

302
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,208
Is love some kind of charity work?

303
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,835
Sacrificing all alone
is a foolishly selfish act.

304
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,045
It's not love.

305
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,801
You've suffered enough.

306
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,013
You've punished yourself enough.

307
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,560
Ji-ho.

308
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,022
I'm asking you this as your friend.

309
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,317
Can I see
that high-spirited version of you again?

310
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,739
-Shall I really get myself in trouble?
-My gosh, how scary.

311
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,847
Let me say this one more time.

312
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,893
You can't get out of this marriage, okay?

313
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,566
Also,

314
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,736
the divorce will only work against you.

315
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,242
You're the successful,
elegant news anchor, Lee Seo-in.

316
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,036
What will you do
if that image is tarnished?

317
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,208
I didn't know you cared about me
this much.

318
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,753
Of course I care about you.
You'll be my wife forever.

319
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,471
I'll be back soon,
so pull yourself together.

320
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,682
Also...

321
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,810
I invited Jeong-in and Gi-seok over.

322
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,354
Call me when you have the date.

323
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,608
If you ever mess with my sisters,

324
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,360
I will kill you.

325
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,987
My, I'll be looking forward to it.

326
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,241
You got me all excited.

327
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,971
I hope all goes well.

328
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,390
SI-HOON

329
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,142
Pick the date to invite them over.

330
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,689
The rumors are rampant.

331
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,525
Will I lose this spot?

332
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,321
No way. You're good at your job.

333
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,491
Is something really going on?
I heard it's a scandal.

334
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,702
It won't let you down.

335
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,836
Do you really have to do this?

336
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,840
Word has already spread
throughout the company.

337
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,343
Who's the jerk that's spreading rumors?

338
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,471
Please accept it.

339
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,974
I don't want to cause more trouble
for the company.

340
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,393
Tell me what the problem is.

341
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,144
The company is here for you.

342
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,188
If it's something we can stop,
we'll do it.

343
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,151
You can't even silence a couple of people.

344
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,070
Well, that's...

345
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,532
You turned down the offer
for the single-host show,

346
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,617
so to find out what was going on with you,

347
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,286
I just wanted to discuss... Damn it.

348
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,582
Fine, whatever. So what's your plan now?

349
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,502
If you keep denying it like this

350
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,963
but end up joining
another network later on, I'll...

351
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,965
I already told you that will never happen.

352
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,343
I want to study.

353
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,345
Study? Are you planning to study abroad?

354
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,681
It can be anywhere.

355
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,059
Okay. If that's the case,
the company offers a training program--

356
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,686
I want to keep it personal.

357
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,439
I'm sorry.

358
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,775
Please go ahead and process
my letter of resignation.

359
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,034
Don't you think
you're too proud of your work?

360
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,495
I certainly have a natural talent in this.

361
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,414
Don't you think so?

362
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,168
When I said you should learn it,
you kept saying no.

363
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,713
I've never missed a single class
because this was your idea.

364
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,592
Do you still have the side dishes left?

365
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,676
Yes.

366
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,345
The stir-fried anchovies
turned out quite bland this time.

367
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,181
Shall I make some jangjorim?

368
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,852
I had to hang all the clean laundry,

369
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,979
so I didn't have time for coffee
this morning.

370
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,567
What is it?

371
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,196
Just tell me. You know I can't be away
from my desk for too long.

372
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,745
I'm not trying to take his side,

373
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,916
but I found out
that your dad had his reasons.

374
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,003
It sounds like Mr. Kwon
will create a position for your dad

375
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,506
at the foundation when he retires.

376
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,299
So?

377
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,886
Are you saying
I should make sacrifices for Dad?

378
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,096
You're getting all riled up again.

379
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,099
I'm telling you this
so that you can understand him better.

380
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,435
This is what happened with Seo-in as well.

381
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,563
That's why I don't want to understand him
even though I can.

382
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,526
But in your case,
not everything is your dad's fault.

383
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,487
Is it your dad's fault
that your relationship is rocky?

384
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
Did Gi-seok cheat on you?

385
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,542
Gosh, please.

386
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,878
Right.

387
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,047
He has a temper,

388
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,925
but he'd never cheat on you.

389
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,722
You don't need to see me out.
Go back inside.

390
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,432
-Mom.
-Yes.

391
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,726
Just a second.

392
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,813
For the side dishes.

393
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,817
I'm actually bribing you.

394
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,697
Don't betray me like you did with Seo-in.

395
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,950
Hey, let's be honest.

396
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,493
When she was getting married--

397
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,787
What I'm saying is,
be on my side no matter what.

398
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,456
What do you mean?

399
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,251
Are you about to cause
big trouble or something?

400
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,212
Well, just in case.

401
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,549
If anything happens,

402
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,051
try to understand me.

403
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,810
What are you doing?

404
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,772
You shouldn't betray me either.

405
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,568
Don't pretend everything is okay
and hide problems from me

406
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,069
like Seo-in is doing.

407
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,781
I can't do that.

408
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,825
Worrying you is my specialty, you know.

409
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,870
At least you know. Go back inside
and get back to work.

410
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,997
-Bye.
-Bye.

411
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,436
-Leave me out.
-Come on.

412
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,855
-You have a date, don't you?
-Gosh, no.

413
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,315
-Join us.
-Jeez, no. Have fun.

414
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,650
-We're off.
-Bye.

415
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,278
Give me that.

416
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,949
What's so hard about dropping this off?
Stop grumbling.

417
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,159
Who expects a pharmacist
to deliver supplements?

418
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,786
Hey, what are you doing here?

419
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,746
I asked him to bring this.

420
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,917
Look what you have to put up with
because of your needy friend.

421
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,045
We're going to grab a drink.

422
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,923
I have to go see my girlfriend.

423
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,132
-Have fun.
-Okay.

424
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,595
-Let's go.
-Okay.

425
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,146
What's up, Gi-seok?

426
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,278
Hey, I'll join you guys.

427
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,836
About the pharmacist...

428
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,964
If you're actually interested in him,
just tell me now.

429
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,048
What will you do then?

430
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,470
You really don't know the woman he likes?

431
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,977
When he and my sister
were in the room together,

432
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,312
you told me not to go in.

433
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,232
Don't get the wrong idea.

434
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,527
Look, Ji-ho was on the phone.

435
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,448
And you said your sister went in
to tidy up the room.

436
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,283
They could've explained that.

437
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,702
You did tell me not to go in.

438
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,041
Is he married?

439
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,418
What are you talking about?

440
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,045
Then why so secretive?

441
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,299
Hey, it's rude to talk on the phone
in front of everyone.

442
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,428
I can't believe you don't know that
when you've lived abroad for years.

443
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,183
If he were married,

444
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,518
he wouldn't talk in front of your sister.

445
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,732
-What?
-Well, you know.

446
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,612
Those two seem fishy, right?

447
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,572
Yes. I mean, no.

448
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,533
It can't be. She has a boyfriend.

449
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,661
I know, but...

450
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,248
Jeong-in!

451
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,668
Are you off to end it for good?

452
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,754
He canceled on me.

453
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,382
Could Gi-seok know about the pharmacist?

454
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,595
Don't think you're out of the woods yet.

455
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,599
I've said this before, but don't get
riled up and spill the beans.

456
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,728
The pharmacist isn't the only reason
behind the breakup,

457
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,355
so he really doesn't need to know.

458
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,732
But what if I get caught?

459
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,068
Will things get harder?

460
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,238
Hey, do you want the three of you
to pull each other's hair out?

461
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,545
By the way,

462
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,172
why did you suddenly cancel your date?

463
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:44,934
What's the matter?

464
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,816
Well, I want to

465
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,527
ask you something just in case.

466
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,655
I'm really asking just in case.

467
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,365
Sure, go ahead.

468
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,788
-A few days ago--
-Yes, I was at the apartment.

469
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,502
I knew you came by,

470
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,381
but I couldn't come out and say hi
because it got quite tense.

471
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,342
-By yourself?
-No, with Yeong-jae.

472
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,845
Yeong-jae and Jae-in are--

473
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,854
Right, whatever.

474
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,523
So you were at her house that day?

475
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,317
Is that it?

476
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,071
Unbelievable.

477
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,034
I'm sorry.

478
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,953
Why are you apologizing?

479
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,623
Hold on.

480
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,251
What's this about?
Where were you and Yeong-jae?

481
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,586
Maybe later.

482
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:58,549
Yeong-jae and Ji-ho
were at my girlfriend's house.

483
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,884
Why?

484
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,179
She has a sister, remember?

485
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:07,141
Anyway, she and Yeong-jae
have gotten close.

486
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,809
Seriously?

487
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,311
Are you guys leaving me out?

488
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,064
I said I'll tell you about it later.

489
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,568
Gi-seok,

490
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,905
both of them have always been friendly.

491
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,283
They just wanted to be
comfortable around her.

492
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,078
I doubt they'd cause any trouble.

493
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,081
Why the heck are you overreacting?

494
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,833
I just find it funny, that's all.

495
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,256
The more I think about it,
the more baffled I am.

496
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,510
You said you sensed it, right?

497
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,470
Well,

498
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:49,016
things aren't great between us
so I went to her house.

499
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,103
She said she had guests, though.

500
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,772
I had already seen the shoes,

501
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,693
and she said they were Jae-in's friends...

502
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,195
but I could tell she had men over.

503
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,033
I got pissed because...

504
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,996
it seemed like she had someone else.

505
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,499
Wouldn't anyone think that?

506
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,962
Her guests turned out
to be Ji-ho and Yeong-jae.

507
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,591
It's hilarious, right?

508
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,970
Unbelievable.

509
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,348
If I had known it was you,

510
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,935
I would've gone in
and buried the hatchet with Jeong-in.

511
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,105
I guess I blew a good opportunity.

512
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,652
Why didn't you tell me it was you?

513
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,280
You're right.
I should've told you everything.

514
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,990
Exactly.

515
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,285
Wait. Tell me what?

516
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:55,041
Whatever it may be,
I should've told you the truth.

517
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,425
And?

518
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,389
Hyeon-su, just make sure
he understands, okay?

519
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,310
We didn't plan on going there
and nothing happened.

520
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,397
Of course. It's why I didn't tell you.

521
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,526
All right. Tell Ji-ho too.

522
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,780
Sure thing. Got it.

523
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,199
Okay, bye.

524
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,828
What is it?

525
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,498
Your sister's boyfriend
found out that we were there.

526
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,417
That was fast.

527
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,420
If things get more awkward,

528
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,672
I'll explain everything again
face to face.

529
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,102
-We're seeing each other a lot.
-Right.

530
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,729
I'm heading inside.

531
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
Jeong-in.

532
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,942
Your boyfriend is with the pharmacist.

533
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,283
What is it with you and the pharmacist?

534
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,161
Be honest with me. What's going on?

535
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,914
-What?
-You're the woman he likes, right?

536
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,003
Damn it.

537
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,388
Do you like him, too?

538
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,271
Jae-in.

539
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,151
I like him.

540
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,866
So the two men pining over you
are currently together.

541
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,206
-Gi-seok has no idea.
-He'll figure it out today.

542
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,876
He already could have.

543
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,298
Who are you calling?

544
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:51,467
Ji-ho.

545
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,345
No wonder he said you're a fool.

546
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,679
What are you going to say?

547
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,681
"Don't get close to him. Deny everything."

548
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,934
Are you trying to mess with him?

549
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,229
Call your boyfriend.

550
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,190
And what?

551
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,694
Why have you suddenly gotten so clueless?

552
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,572
Test the waters.

553
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:15,991
Just call him already.

554
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,494
Come on!

555
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,212
Unbelievable.

556
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,682
The sudden invitation caught me off guard.

557
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,563
When have you ever asked me to rush over?

558
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,857
Okay, I'll be there soon.

559
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,279
All right. Bye.

560
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,992
Are you off to see Jeong-in?

561
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,995
Yes, she's calling me over to her house.

562
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,371
Then you should go.

563
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,750
Remember what I said
about us going through a rough patch?

564
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,003
I think she's trying to make up.

565
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,965
Anyway, I'm sorry.

566
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,593
Gosh, don't be.
Your girlfriend's more important.

567
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,013
I'll pay for drinks today.

568
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,306
Can't you stay?

569
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,933
Are you nuts?

570
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,977
He already agreed to come over.

571
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:31,734
You talked about telling me something.
Were you serious about that?

572
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,072
Can't she come here instead?

573
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,325
Ji-ho, dude, are you drunk?

574
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,619
Let me look at you.

575
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,874
He's a goner.

576
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,084
He's completely wasted.

577
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,381
Wrap it up soon then, all right?

578
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,758
He seems to have had a lot.

579
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,619
What is it?

580
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,621
What's going on?

581
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
It's nothing.

582
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,107
Cheers.

583
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,239
It was my doing,
so no more misunderstandings.

584
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,743
It's not like I got the wrong idea.

585
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,247
I laughed hysterically
because it was so funny.

586
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,293
If I had known it were Ji-ho,
I wouldn't have felt threatened.

587
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,296
I doubted Jeong-in for no reason.

588
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,632
Hold on. Why aren't you threatened by him?

589
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,384
Well, that's because--

590
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,677
Gi-seok.

591
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,639
Jae-in will know sooner or later.

592
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,559
Ji-ho has a son.

593
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
He's a single father.

594
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,112
Actually, Ji-ho tried to
stop me from coming over here.

595
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,324
He told me to call you
to where we were instead.

596
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,160
Isn't he hilarious?

597
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,162
He must be drunk.

598
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,039
Right?

599
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:17,960
It'd be weird if he weren't.

600
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,968
Anyway, let's agree
to forget about that day.

601
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,761
It's like I said.

602
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,347
You said it was Ji-ho
so there's nothing to consider.

603
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,224
That's not right.

604
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,268
What?

605
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,021
You can't judge someone
just because he's a single father.

606
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,277
It's out of line to say that
he's not even worth considering.

607
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,991
I didn't mean it like that.

608
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,785
Unbelievable.

609
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,329
It's just that...

610
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,416
I almost got the wrong idea,

611
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,668
but since I know Ji-ho,

612
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:03,422
there's nothing more to talk about
regarding this incident.

613
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,090
So that's what you meant.

614
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,176
I guess I overreacted.

615
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,928
Darn.

616
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,100
If only you had reconciled with me sooner.

617
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,102
I ended up as the bad guy.

618
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,865
We're thinking about getting married.

619
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,910
Can I count on your help?

620
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,393
What will become of us?

621
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,899
It's late.

622
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,195
Are you referring to us?

623
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,059
I didn't realize it until now.

624
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,022
I now know how to love you.

625
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,154
Let's be more in love.

626
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,829
I'll do better.

627
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,623
Okay?

628
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:06,795
I'll do better.

629
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,196
Are you disappointed?

630
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,452
Yes...

631
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,580
with your boyfriend.

632
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,918
I feel bad for Ji-ho.

633
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,047
You should try to comfort him.

634
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,177
All this time,

635
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,679
he comforted me, though.

636
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,934
Have you made up your mind?

637
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,026
Just know...

638
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,820
that I have your back no matter what.

639
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,997
How about a hug?

640
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,565
WOORI PHARMACY

641
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,942
What are you doing out here?

642
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,736
-Isn't the weather incredible?
-It is.

643
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,696
Have you had coffee?

644
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,073
Would you like to get some?

645
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,658
Isn't Ji-ho at work yet?

646
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,910
He is, but I don't think
we should go inside.

647
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,412
-Why not?
-He's taking a serious phone call.

648
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,747
And with a woman, I think.

649
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,084
-That's all the more reason to--
-No, please!

650
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,087
All right, fine.

651
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,802
Honestly, I'm good.

652
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,721
That's the fourth time you said it.

653
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,474
Because it's true.

654
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,062
I was a bit pissed,

655
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,398
but I came to the conclusion

656
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,734
that you probably acted that way
to protect me,

657
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,570
so I'm all good now.

658
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,281
You could've yelled over the phone.

659
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,367
Why do something I'd regret?

660
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,245
Ji-ho.

661
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,331
Yes?

662
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,459
I'm sorry for liking you.

663
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,465
What a pleasant morning.

664
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,485
I was just going to
leave this at the front desk.

665
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,070
My meeting just ended.

666
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,072
What's all that anyway?

667
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,910
It's for your health. You drink too often.

668
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,370
You even did so yesterday.

669
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,414
How about we grab some coffee?

670
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,042
-You should get back to work.
-No, I have time.

671
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,128
We'll be back in about 30 minutes.

672
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,298
Let's go.

673
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:50,393
Aren't all those buildings being erected
with money loaned from the bank?

674
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,231
Yes, mostly.

675
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,944
You should cut ties with those
who cling onto you

676
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,695
just because you work at a bank.

677
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,614
You know me, right?

678
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,367
I never took out a loan with this bank

679
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,035
even though you work here.

680
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:11,873
You must be objective
with those closer to you.

681
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,416
Sure.

682
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,212
Blindly believing in them
will drive you off a cliff.

683
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,841
Got it.

684
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,641
Once Principal Lee retires,
I thought I'd have him work

685
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,560
for the foundation.

686
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,523
Why are you surprised?

687
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,363
I didn't know you believed in
Jeong-in's father that much.

688
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,158
Don't be absurd.

689
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,245
It's only because he already knows
how the foundation operates.

690
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,873
You're still dating her, aren't you?

691
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,542
Bring her over sometime.

692
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,507
What's with the constant wide eyes?

693
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,677
You once sulked about
how I didn't seem interested.

694
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:06,970
Unbelievable.

695
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,223
If you were going to eventually warm up,

696
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,476
why couldn't you have done it sooner?

697
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:16,938
Did you two break up?

698
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,816
No, I'm going to marry her.

699
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,362
I'll do it even if you're against it.

700
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,159
I never said I was against it.

701
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,119
I just told you to keep it casual.

702
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,747
Right, whatever.

703
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,333
Anyway, bring her over sometime.

704
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:42,714
Darn it.

705
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,387
Where did you park your car?

706
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,723
A car was parked in front of mine
in the parking lot so I took a taxi.

707
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,142
It's better since we're having drinks.

708
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,894
I'd rather just head home.

709
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,771
Okay, then.

710
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,982
Why won't you come and
at least have dinner?

711
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,693
Oh, well...

712
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,529
What kind of a response is that?

713
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,449
I'll join you guys then.

714
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,911
Hyeon-su, where are we headed?

715
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,372
Hold on a second.

716
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,875
You can ride with me, then.

717
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,294
I'll take Gi-seok's car.

718
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,132
Sure. Get in.

719
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,759
See you there.

720
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,063
You doing anything fun lately?

721
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,025
I'm cooped up at the pharmacy mostly.

722
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,612
Of course.

723
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,202
I hear you're seeing someone.

724
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,124
Even Hyeon-su doesn't know, though.

725
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,586
What's with all the secrecy?

726
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:46,921
Well...

727
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,471
Those are the good times.

728
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,182
She must seem like the world.

729
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,729
Not for you anymore?

730
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,524
It'd be weird if it still was.

731
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,113
There's no need to stare.

732
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,285
The honeymoon phase
is over in about a month anyway.

733
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,456
Once that ends,

734
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,042
you just keep dating each other

735
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,419
unless something happens.

736
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,428
You've been with her for a while.

737
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:37,931
Exactly.

738
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,559
That's how relationships are normally.

739
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:46,231
Things go smoothly
with only a few ups and downs.

740
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,570
But then you could fall out of love.

741
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,532
What do you mean?

742
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,825
One could cheat?

743
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,578
That could be an option.

744
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,166
I'd never cheat,

745
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,628
but I'd break up
with my girlfriend if she did.

746
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,217
How can I not when she likes another man?

747
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,014
You'll just let her go?

748
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,645
I wouldn't let go so easily
with my bruised ego.

749
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,940
I wouldn't get revenge,

750
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,693
but I guess I'd make a scene.

751
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:53,524
Is it her?

752
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,653
Answer it.

753
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,698
Go on.

754
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,455
How do you expect

755
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,999
to win her over like this?

756
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,924
Hello?

757
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,301
I was just about to hang up.

758
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,053
Can you talk?

759
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,180
Yes.

760
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,266
Is the pharmacy open today?

761
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,187
Yes.

762
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,273
You must be at work then.

763
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,276
Are you going to stop by?

764
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:39,737
I have something to say.

765
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,614
What time do you get off?

766
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,619
I had a basketball game today.

767
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,123
Were you with Gi-seok?

768
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,918
I was.

769
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:57,296
Are you still with him?

770
01:01:58,881 --> 01:01:59,882
Yes.

771
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,843
Then I'll hang up.

772
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,554
Why?

773
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,889
Ji-ho...

774
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,017
Don't hang up.

775
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:53,519
I've told you many times,
but I never imagined us breaking up.

776
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,646
My father wants to see you.
He really does.

777
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:57,607
I'd rather meet with him alone.

778
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,484
I asked you to help me move on.

779
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,610
Why must I do that?

780
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,904
Why should I care
if your heart gets crushed?

781
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:04,572
What I want is my priority.

782
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:07,658
Remember how you got wound up
on the day we had drinks?

783
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,951
Do you like my girlfriend?

784
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:12,205
I feel like I'm doomed
because my love for you

785
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,539
grows bigger by the day.

786
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,250
After time passes,

787
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,463
if you still feel the same way,
come to me then.

788
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,548
Just don't fall in love with anyone else.

789
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,301
When I finally make my way to you,

790
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,011
I promise to protect you

791
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,138
from all the criticism and judgment.

792
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,225
You can take as long as you want.
Just as long as you come to me.

793
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,936
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.

794
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,357
