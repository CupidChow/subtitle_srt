EPISODE 15

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,977
Jeong-in.

3
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,148
Are you going to...

4
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,112
leave us too?

5
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,038
If that's the case,
it's still not too late.

6
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,501
It's okay.

7
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,838
What...

8
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,382
What do you mean?

9
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,221
Hey.

10
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,681
What are you trying to say?

11
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,018
Why are you being like this?

12
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,479
Can I trust...

13
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,735
how you feel about me?

14
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,950
Tell me.

15
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,911
Will you never...

16
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,207
Are you sure

17
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,835
your feelings for me will never change?

18
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,091
Are you saying

19
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,927
you can't trust me?

20
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,517
I'm asking if I can trust you.

21
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,813
Do you think I'll change?

22
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,607
I don't know.

23
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,778
I have no way of knowing.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,327
You're too drunk now.
Let's just talk tomorrow.

25
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,000
You can't answer my question.

26
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,089
I see.

27
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,362
Jeong-in.

28
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,537
He just drank way too much today.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,790
Please try to understand.

30
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,710
Just today?

31
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,004
Or will this happen again?

32
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,341
What else does he do when he's drunk?

33
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,301
Any other drinking behaviors?

34
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,974
Has Ji-ho been hiding complaints about me?

35
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,059
No, not at all.

36
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,145
Then isn't it even more odd
that he's being like that suddenly?

37
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,772
It's...

38
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,859
To tell you the truth, Yu-mi...

39
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,612
Who is that?

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,576
Is she

41
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,662
Eun-u's mom?

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,670
-I don't know if I should tell you, but--
-Don't.

43
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,298
I don't want to hear it.

44
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,842
I'll get going.

45
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,190
Jeong-in, what happened?

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,067
-I'll call you.
-Hey.

47
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,819
What's going on?

48
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,238
-I said, I'll call you.
-What happened?

49
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,531
Jeong-in.

50
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,826
-Jeong-in, hey.
-I'm really okay.

51
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,786
I'll call you. I'm sorry.

54
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,649
I drank a little at home.

55
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,195
While I was drinking...

56
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,739
What is this about?

57
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,078
I just came to see you.

58
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,916
You thought of me because you drank?

59
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,628
Well, that can be a reason too.

60
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,341
Where have you been?

61
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,510
You know the answer.

62
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,600
Can you really accept me back?

63
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,397
I betrayed you once.

64
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,899
Do you think you can still
get back together with me?

65
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,444
What if I betray you again?

66
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,324
What do you mean?

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,617
Just as you heard.

68
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,080
My feelings might change again, you know.

69
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,585
I've done it once,
so the second time should be easier.

70
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,214
What do you think?

71
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,552
Can you trust me?

72
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,693
Yes, I can.

73
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,811
Why isn't Mr. Yu here yet?

74
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,980
Shall I try calling him?

75
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,525
Don't bother him. He said he'll be late.

76
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

77
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,367
Oh, no problem.

78
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,167
YEONG-JAE

79
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,462
-Hey.
-Are you at work?

80
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,424
No, not yet.

81
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,509
You drank so much last night.

82
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
Last night...

83
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,016
How did Jeong-in get home?

84
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:02,768
You don't remember anything?

85
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,981
Not everything, but...

86
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,776
I didn't say anything weird to her, right?

87
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,486
Have you lost your mind?

88
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,072
You told her that you can't trust her

89
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,992
and asked her
if she'll leave you and Eun-u.

90
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
I did? I said that to Jeong-in?

91
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,497
Then what? Would you have said that to me?

92
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,502
She seemed to have misunderstood you,
so I actually mentioned Yu-mi--

93
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,880
That was so unnecessary.
Why did you tell her that?

94
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,299
I couldn't tell her
because she didn't let me.

95
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,634
She didn't want to hear it.

96
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,139
Why did you show it
if you wanted to hide it?

97
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,974
You went nuts.

98
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,615
Your phone is buzzing.

99
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,409
-I guess the person hung up.
-Oh, thanks.

100
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,508
You know what? The team manager
didn't like my report again.

101
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,051
It really pissed me off,

102
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,804
so I just tweaked a few things
and took it back to him.

103
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,725
-He raved about it, didn't he?
-He sure did!

104
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,687
He always does that.

105
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,357
He caught me doing that once.

106
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,567
Do you know what he said?

107
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,277
"As they say,

108
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,114
the first is always the best.

109
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,242
The first choice you make
is always the right choice."

110
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,996
You know him better than we do.

111
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,085
I dealt with that many times.

112
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,685
What? Did you think it'd be Ji-ho?

113
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,698
You stayed up all night but came to work

114
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,450
and even skipped lunch.

115
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,744
So, what's the conclusion?

116
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,956
I can't come to a conclusion.

117
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,793
What is bothering you the most?

118
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,920
The boy's mom?

119
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,839
What if he's still hung up on her?

120
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,967
That's nonsense.

121
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,720
If he has even an ounce of feelings left,

122
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:47,057
Ji-ho is... Gosh, I'd say he's so foolish.
Does he have no self-esteem?

123
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,519
Then what about Gi-seok?

124
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,563
That's just obsession.

125
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,235
Ji-ho said he can't trust me,

126
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,279
but Gi-seok said he can.

127
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,449
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

128
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,077
Maybe it's meant to be
the other way around.

129
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,662
Now, you're going too far.

130
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,208
Are you going to put the blame on Ji-ho
and run away?

131
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,877
I'll consider that option.

132
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,547
This one thing is clear to me.

133
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,345
I think I only saw
what was right in front of me.

134
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,555
But you see,

135
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,226
knowing everything about the person's past

136
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,895
isn't always a good thing.

137
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,774
Sometimes, it's better to just play dumb
and let bygones be bygones.

138
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,110
While being suspicious of each other?

139
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,156
Ji-ho may be okay with that.

140
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,076
But obviously not you,
knowing your personality.

-Thank you. You too.

-Here you go.
-Thanks.

This is...

-Please take them with food.
-Okay.

Hey.

-Let's talk somewhere else.
-What's it about?

149
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,737
Hello?

150
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,822
Hey, Jeong-in.

151
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,824
Hey.

152
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,495
I was busy, so I couldn't call you back
until now.

153
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,080
That's okay.

154
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,250
You got home safely last night, right?

155
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,674
Well...

156
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,386
For some reason, I got drunk...

157
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,932
You're mad at me, right?

158
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,643
I drank quite a bit last night.

159
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,981
I know I made a mistake.
I know what I said.

160
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,774
Well...

161
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,568
I'm never like that though.
But yesterday...

162
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,822
Anyway, let's meet. Let's talk in person.

163
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,073
I can come over now.

164
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,743
Or do you want to come over?

165
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,955
No, let's just meet at the cafe.

166
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,683
Hi, Mom.

167
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,395
I told you to either come by
or call me so that I can visit you.

168
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,481
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

169
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,234
What's up? Did something happen?

170
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,446
-Did Dad say something again?
-He made such a fuss.

171
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,325
By the way, why do you sound so down?

172
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,202
No, I'm fine.

173
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,580
I'll see you after your class.

174
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,666
That class ended a while ago.

175
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,084
Oh, right.

176
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,379
I called you to talk about...

177
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,466
that guy.

178
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,842
Let's talk another time.

179
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,595
I'll come by on my day off.
We can talk then.

180
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,222
Why wait until--

181
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,225
Mom, I can't really talk on the phone now.

182
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,728
I'll call you when I visit you.
I have to go.

183
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,241
I said something foolish to Jeong-in.

184
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
What did you say?

185
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,873
Apparently, I asked her
if she's going to leave me and Eun-u.

186
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,876
You were thinking that she might?

187
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,004
-No, of course not.
-Then why did you talk such nonsense?

188
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,175
You know how drunk I was last night.

189
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,135
It's driving me nuts.

190
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,639
You seem human for a change. Well done.

191
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,641
What do you mean?

192
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,685
You've been living like a robot
as though your world will be turned

193
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,938
upside down if you let loose a little.

194
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,649
It does make you look trustworthy,
but not human.

195
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,821
-So that's wrong?
-It's not a good thing.

196
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,740
What you've been showing her
isn't your bare face.

197
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,827
Try and refute it.

198
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,666
Well, before that...
What do I do about Jeong-in now?

199
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,671
Even you are burdened by your past,

200
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,924
so it must be a lot worse for Jeong-in.

201
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,472
Don't expect her to understand everything.
That'd be the worst kind of selfishness.

202
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,212
Do you have nothing to say?
Or is there nothing that you can say?

203
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,386
Shall I rephrase my question?

204
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,848
I'm asking if you have no excuse

205
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,685
or if you can't even come up with one
because you don't remember anything.

206
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,441
I'd say it's both.

207
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,156
Isn't it impossible to have

208
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,242
no recollection of anything
even if you were very drunk?

209
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,081
I know this will sound like an excuse,

210
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,376
but I said what I said
because I was too drunk.

211
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,253
Do you think
I actually thought that of you?

212
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,380
Then what did you think of me?

213
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,594
I'm sorry.

214
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,722
I'm truly sorry.

215
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,851
But I've never once thought
you'd do such a thing.

216
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,311
I'm serious.

217
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,898
Leaving me and Eun-u...

218
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,610
I'm too embarrassed to even bring it up.

219
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,280
I've never even imagined
doing such a thing.

220
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,200
See?

221
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,244
But the thing is,

222
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,873
you asked if I, too, would leave you.

223
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:55,295
"Are you going to leave us too?"
That was your question.

224
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,968
I know that I'm nitpicking.

225
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,303
I may be reading too much into it.

226
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,683
But to be honest,
the impression I got from it was...

227
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,896
"Aren't you just like her?"
That's what it sounded like.

228
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,195
I know you didn't mean it that way.

229
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,948
Like I said,
it's just the impression I got.

230
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,247
I never thought

231
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,458
your wound must've completely healed

232
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,087
just because some time has passed.

233
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,092
Even so, I can't just put it behind me
thinking that it is

234
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,262
something you said unwittingly
because you were drunk.

235
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,434
I don't know how I can...

236
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,105
This is so...

237
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,234
This is so frustrating for me
because I don't remember everything.

238
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,529
That's why I can't even give an excuse,

239
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,240
try to refute it, or apologize properly.

240
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,327
I don't even know where to begin
to apologize to you.

241
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,205
What if it leads
to more misunderstandings?

242
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,501
It's seriously driving me nuts.

243
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,671
I don't want an apology.

244
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,882
Hold on.

245
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,594
Like you said,

246
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,475
no matter how hard I try not to be
bogged down by my past and scars,

247
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,643
I can't help feeling insecure.

248
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,606
The anxiety that I didn't even know I had
came out. That's all.

249
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,982
There's nothing more to it.

250
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,403
That's how I am too.

251
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,823
I betrayed my boyfriend,

252
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,493
and you witnessed the whole thing.

253
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,039
-Now, you're going too far.
-I feel insecure, just like you do.

254
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,416
I know

255
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:00,295
that you don't completely distrust me.
I know that,

256
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,256
but even though I know that...

257
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,510
I can't help feeling uneasy.

258
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,479
I wish I could open up my heart
and show you.

259
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,484
I tried to push you away
thinking you're too good for me.

260
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,696
And that woman went through
all that trouble just to be with me.

261
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,574
How could I have doubted
your feelings for me?

262
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,664
Not you.

263
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,959
I'm doubting myself.

264
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,171
I told you

265
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,007
that I coveted you.

266
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,011
I know you thought about pushing me away,

267
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,014
but I only thought I couldn't let you go.

268
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,518
Perhaps I jumped into this

269
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,605
way too quickly because of my greed.

270
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,165
Hi.

271
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,376
Assemblyman Jang
wants to have dinner with us.

272
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,050
Hey, it's not like she's the only woman
in the world.

273
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,596
Move on already. Don't be a clingy loser.

274
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,222
I need to redeem myself,

275
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,808
so I'm not ready yet.

276
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,852
"Yet"?

277
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,313
I guess you've decided to move on.

278
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,192
It won't take long.

279
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,237
As for the dinner with Assemblyman Jang,
try to postpone it a little.

280
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,033
Are you open to meeting his daughter?

281
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,787
Why not?

282
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,666
It'll depend on how things
get sorted out though.

283
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,840
What can I do to make you forgive me?

284
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,678
I told you. The problem is me, not you.

285
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,475
I'm not just saying it
to make you feel worse.

286
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,854
I love you.

287
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,984
I thought our love was all that mattered.

288
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,239
I cluelessly thought I should be able
to understand everything...

289
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,699
No.

290
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,579
I didn't even think.
I just assumed everything would work out.

291
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,711
But...

292
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,881
even though you brought up your past

293
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,885
only for a short moment,

294
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,179
my heart sank.

295
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,225
As if I encountered
what I've been trying to avoid.

296
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,812
That's why I realized...

297
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,774
my feelings

298
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,527
may not be there yet.

299
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,408
Regardless of the situation,

300
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,411
whenever you catch your own shortcoming,

301
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,621
you want to run from it at first.

302
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,041
That's how I feel now.

303
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,801
I think I need some time
to reflect on myself.

304
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,055
I know I could let it slide,

305
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,558
and you may resent me
for not being understanding,

306
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,436
but I'm sorry.

307
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,024
I know I can lie,
but I can't even do that now.

308
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
I don't want to act cool

309
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,988
or act like I'm okay.

310
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,907
I don't want you to do that either.

311
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,704
You're right.

312
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,750
I've been fooling myself and others,

313
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,296
not because I'm still hung up on my past,

314
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,341
but because of my fear.

315
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,928
It's a fact that I can't deny.

316
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,599
Still, I can't--

317
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,768
I'm not saying
I don't understand how you feel.

318
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,106
Then you probably know how I feel now.

319
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
You must also know what I want to say.

320
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,158
Lee Jeong-in.

321
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,205
I'll say it again
now that I'm completely sober.

322
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:48,708
Don't...

323
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,211
leave us.

324
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,255
Hello?

325
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,006
Dad.

326
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,759
Yes.

327
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,136
When are you coming, Dad?

328
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,600
When will you come home?

329
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,938
Come soon.

330
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,985
Okay, I'll come now.

331
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,017
I was surprised too.

332
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,103
She actually consoled me.

333
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,233
"Would I be able to do that
if I were her?"

334
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,570
That was all I could think
on my way back home.

335
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,074
Your dad didn't even believe me
when I told him.

336
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,036
How could anyone believe that?

337
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,415
I never talked about it,
but I was very worried as well.

338
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,419
How could she be so understanding
and kind?

339
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,924
You have to thank her.

340
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,346
At a time like this, you should really try
to be more confident.

341
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,348
She chose to be with you
because she trusts you.

342
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,682
You have to look dependable.

343
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,648
What's with that reaction?

344
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,233
It's nothing.

345
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,029
I'm sure he's more surprised than we were.

346
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,666
Dad.

347
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,044
-Yes?
-Ms. Lee.

348
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:45,880
You should go to sleep.

349
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,801
Can we go out with Ms. Lee again?

350
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,639
Okay. Go to sleep now.

351
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,719
-You can take this.
-It's okay. You drink that.

352
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,434
By the way, how's Ji-ho doing?

353
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,103
He's doing pretty well.

354
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,522
He's doing well?

355
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,316
Yes.

356
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,319
I see.

357
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,156
You knew about it?

358
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,205
Sort of.

359
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,292
Who told you?

360
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,252
Did Jeong-in tell you?

361
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,026
Be there for your buddy.
He already had it tough to begin with.

362
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,152
Mom.

363
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:20,243
Why do you look so weary?

364
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,536
Nothing. I'm fine.

365
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,789
I'm sorry. I was going to come by,
but work's been busy.

366
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,875
I'm not here
because I got tired of waiting.

367
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,963
Are you feeling sick or something?

368
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,506
No, I'm fine.

369
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,592
Wait here. I'll go get some coffee for us.

370
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,890
I don't know
if this is the right thing to do.

371
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,895
To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure.

372
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,864
But you say
that you can't be happy without him,

373
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,324
so nothing else should matter.

374
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,623
I haven't been properly
introduced to him yet,

375
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,085
but meeting his mom
told me a lot about him.

376
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,260
You still have to jump over many hurdles.

377
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,139
Marriage won't be the end.

378
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:30,271
It'll be harder
than what you're expecting.

379
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,612
There may come a time
when you'll regret your decision.

380
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,076
Gosh, my goodness.

381
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,372
Someone might think
you're crying because you're upset.

382
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,509
I know this whole ordeal
hasn't been easy for you.

383
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,014
But you'll still need to go through hoops.

384
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,561
My approval alone is only the beginning.

385
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,523
I know.

386
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
Hold on.

387
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,906
There's...

388
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,700
something wrong, isn't there?

389
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,416
I'm just happy, that's all.

390
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,585
I'm happy, Mom.

391
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,062
Thank you.

392
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,024
Your dad

393
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,236
never listens to me anyway,

394
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,155
so you two should
talk this through yourselves.

395
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,825
Don't be mean to him though.

396
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,660
What?

397
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,413
Because of his situation,

398
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,498
he won't be able to speak confidently.

399
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,292
That's not the case.

400
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,168
Of course, it is.

401
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,130
You're no better than him.

402
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,132
Between you two, you lack more.

403
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,758
How so?

404
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,053
Do you know what it's like to be a parent?

405
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,598
The biggest lesson in life

406
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,809
is taught when you raise kids.

407
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,062
He's maturer than you are.

408
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,026
What was that?

409
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,737
Nothing.

410
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
Goodness.

411
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,518
You can head home if you have plans.

412
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,194
I don't.

413
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,740
I really don't.

414
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,288
He's back to his old self again.

415
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,000
Don't.

416
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,216
I knew you'd give me that look.

417
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,345
My sister called it quits first?

418
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,015
It's better to say they're on a break.

419
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:58,437
Ji-ho's insecurity that he wasn't aware of
came bursting out,

420
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:02,316
and Jeong-in took it the wrong way.

421
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,403
So? What did Ji-ho say?

422
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,239
Nothing. He's just depressed.

423
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,990
He feels ashamed.

424
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,284
And he's going to stay that way?

425
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,788
What can he do?
It's all up to Jeong-in now.

426
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,042
Jeez, they're one and the same.

427
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,669
What do you mean?

428
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,005
My sister has experienced
enough trauma herself.

429
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,468
What do you think will happen?

430
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,556
I, of course, understand Ji-ho,

431
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,684
but I get why Jeong-in is upset too.

432
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,650
We should call it quits too.

433
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,239
You're his friend, remember?

434
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,325
I can't be disloyal to my sister.

435
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,161
What?

436
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,830
It's our family motto.
You have a problem with that?

437
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,207
Why do they dictate our relationship?

438
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,375
It does in my book.

439
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,338
This is totally absurd.

440
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,302
Why is that though?

441
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:28,861
Hold on.

442
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,865
I thought the sudden invite
would entail backup.

443
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,200
Not even Jae-in's home.

444
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,577
What's going on?

445
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,247
I didn't want her to hear us,

446
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,041
so I told her to give us space.

447
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,548
My mouth hurts from repeating this.

448
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,761
I won't divorce you.

449
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,556
Our divorce...

450
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,267
is inevitable.

451
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,938
All that's left is whether
you'll just end up a divorcé

452
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,523
who gave up his paternal rights

453
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,317
or be charged with assault--

454
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,069
-Hey.
-I'm not finished.

455
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,780
On top of that,

456
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,244
I can charge you
with sexual assault as well.

457
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,206
The choice is yours.

458
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,006
Must I patronize you again?

459
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,719
Think about after the baby is born.

460
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,639
Would it like a criminal for a dad?

461
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,224
Could you say it shamelessly?

462
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,101
Waver my paternal rights?

463
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,936
You're basically asking us
to deny each other.

464
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,063
Tell me if that's even possible.

465
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:49,692
It can be from the heart.

466
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,029
Once the kid grows up
to tell what's right from wrong,

467
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,074
it'll deny your existence.

468
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,414
This is your last chance.

469
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,252
Fill out the divorce papers
and bring them to me.

470
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,797
Leave. Leave already!

471
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,469
Must I call the cops?

472
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,848
Okay, fine. Let's get a divorce.

473
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,100
I'll agree to it.

474
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,854
I'm the one divorcing you, you prick.

475
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,815
Right, whatever.

476
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,776
But not until the baby is born.

477
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,113
Haven't you...

478
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,367
heard of prenatal education?

479
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,037
I'm only looking out for you.

480
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,372
Cut the bullshit.

481
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,210
You have no right to see this baby.
Now, let go.

482
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,110
8 P.M. TIME OF LOVE

483
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,123
Tell Seo-in I'll be over next week.

484
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,127
Shouldn't Ji-ho be a priority?

485
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,384
Your acting has gotten better.

486
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,554
I need time to think.

487
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,223
You're better at lying too.

488
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,642
Why think
when he's taken over your thoughts?

489
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,186
You should get going.

490
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,190
This is why those who've been hurt
can be harsher.

491
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,567
What are you babbling on about?

492
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,986
When Gi-seok's father disapproved of you,

493
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,655
your pride was wounded deeply.

494
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,949
Ji-ho's in a tougher spot,

495
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,368
but you're turning your back on him
as well.

496
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,080
I was just as wounded by him too.

497
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,790
I'm self-reflecting as it is,

498
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,376
but how could I not
be annoyed by those words?

499
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,086
I'm not spineless, you know.

500
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,842
All right, fine.
Continue to be like that then.

501
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,232
Why not just resign?

502
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,195
For the first time,
I've started to hate my job.

503
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,659
People always ask me twice
to confirm what my job is,

504
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,538
and I can't afford to make any mistakes.

505
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,043
It's not like I can
break free from that routine.

506
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,044
It's...

507
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,464
It's just what my life is like.

508
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,971
The thought just came to me that's all.

509
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,850
No one's stopping you, but yourself.

510
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,894
I didn't mean it like that.

511
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,444
What?

512
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,906
Are you and Jeong-in over?
As in completely?

513
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,243
-What now?
-Even Gi-seok knows.

514
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,831
I can't believe her.
Did she already tell him?

515
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,542
Are they getting back together?

516
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,380
I'm heading out for a moment.

517
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,050
No.

518
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,388
I said you can't.

519
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,022
Ji-ho.

520
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,419
This is a surprise.

521
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,923
I'd like to talk. Can we meet?

522
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,639
I'm afraid I have plans tonight.

523
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,395
Maybe next time.
I'll call you when I have the time.

524
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,230
I'm downstairs. It won't take long.

525
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,753
Hey.

526
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:03,839
Why are you here at this hour?

527
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,968
I'm not here for you, so get back to work.

528
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,553
Gi-seok then?

529
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,388
Is it because I called?

530
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,894
I was only rambling.
I don't even know if it's true or not.

531
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,858
Don't cause any trouble, all right?

532
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,418
-Hello.
-Jeez.

533
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,299
You must be quite desperate

534
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,092
to seek me out like this.

535
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,101
Well, go on and talk.

536
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,528
I told you before

537
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,323
to let Jeong-in be.

538
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,368
Who says I did anything?

539
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,620
Did Hyeon-su say so?

540
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,834
What can I do
to cut you out from her life?

541
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,214
You know,

542
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,716
you should watch what you say.

543
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,011
I said before that
I will only let it slide once.

544
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,347
Have you forgotten that?

545
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:40,143
You sure have a bad memory
for someone who's smart.

546
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,520
I told you...

547
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,606
that I'd give up if you do as well.

548
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:48,777
Do you think you can

549
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,364
get back together with Jeong-in
if I give up?

550
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,618
I never said I would.

551
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,438
Yu Ji-ho, you bastard.

552
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,698
What?

553
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,992
Why do you seem startled?

554
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,703
You know me.

555
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,414
My goal is taking you down.

556
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,584
Still,

557
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,504
I'd likely take Jeong-in
if she came back to me.

558
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,673
I was going to marry her after all.

559
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,553
It's a way of giving back to our parents

560
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,180
who still want us to marry.

561
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:02,017
There'd be nothing bad about any of it.

562
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,440
You don't know her.

563
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,609
She isn't the type

564
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,695
to be satisfied with just love.

565
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,283
Look who she dated for all this time.

566
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,785
Doesn't it tell you anything?

567
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,789
You won't be able to handle her.

568
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,044
Your crappy romance

569
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,255
isn't anywhere up to her level.

570
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,973
Do I seem like a bastard?

571
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,977
I became this way because of her.

572
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,777
This is how I turned out to be,
but for you...

573
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,657
I feel terrible for you.

574
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,368
Your future is already drawn.

575
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,050
If you're truly concerned about me,
then thanks.

576
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,971
What I'll say now isn't a warning.

577
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,223
It's a threat.

578
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,731
You're just as smart,
so I'm sure you'll remember.

579
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,277
I said I would let other things slide,

580
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,279
but not when it concerns my son.

581
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,576
This again?

582
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,328
Don't you realize

583
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,584
that your son
is one of your worst weaknesses?

584
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,087
When put to good use,
it can be my biggest weapon.

585
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,132
The photos you illegally took

586
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,676
of me and my son.

587
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,929
How should I utilize that?

588
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,811
From what I hear,
your father had them taken.

589
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:16,568
I let it slide at the time
because of Jeong-in's sake.

590
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,570
It's not because I'm spineless.

591
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,241
Are you challenging

592
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,077
my father of all people?

593
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,330
Like I said, I'm not scared of anything.

594
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,416
I'm never scared when it comes to my boy.

595
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,166
HOW TO PREPARE FOR HAPPY LATER YEARS

596
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,551
Oh, hi, Gi-seok.

597
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,389
Hi, it's me.
I'm sorry for not being in touch.

598
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,100
It's fine. I know you're just as busy.

599
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,104
Could you perhaps
spare me some time tonight?

600
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,231
Why is that?

601
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,525
Is there something to talk about?

602
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,068
Of course.

603
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,155
You said you'd settle on a date
for me and Jeong-in.

604
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,534
Sir?

605
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,078
Oh, right.

606
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,206
A wedding date, of course.
I should settle on one.

607
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,418
All right.
When and where should we meet today?

608
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,920
-Take care.
-Bye.

609
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,341
WOORI PHARMACY

610
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,509
Welcome.

611
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,971
Excuse me.

612
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,349
What can I get you?

613
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,436
-Hello.
-Hi, it's been a while.

614
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,063
Ji-ho isn't in at the moment.

615
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,400
I see.

616
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,361
-Goodbye then.
-Would you like a cup of tea?

617
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,363
No, I'm good, but thanks for the offer.

618
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,865
Take care then.

619
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,678
Right. Well, I'm heading out as we speak,

620
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:54,351
so you can leave in about 20 minutes.

621
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,853
The timing would be right.

622
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,774
Sure thing. I'll see you later.

623
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,553
Is Mr. Kwon still here?

624
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,056
Yes, he had some business to take care of.

625
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:34,849
I see.

626
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,811
There he comes.

627
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,984
-What are you still doing here?
-I'm on my way out too.

628
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,070
How's the injury?

629
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,739
I'm fine. It's only a sprain.

630
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,199
You should get going then.

631
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,868
Do you have any plans today?

632
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,329
I'm sorry, but I'm meeting someone.

633
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,873
Did you have something to tell me?

634
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,000
Is it just me who have things to say?

635
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,462
-All right. You can get going.
-Sure.

636
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,737
What do you want for dinner?

637
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,907
They have everything here, just name it.

638
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,120
What's wrong?

639
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,831
I'll take a rain check.

640
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,791
But you came all the way here.

641
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,086
All right, fine.
I won't ask you what happened.

642
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,590
That's not it.
I should hurry back to the pharmacy.

643
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,385
It's close to closing time anyway.

644
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,763
Still. Besides, I'm not even hungry.

645
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,808
I'll see you around.

646
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,398
Are you that hungry?

647
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,901
This is more than what two people can eat.

648
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,696
I thought it'd help you recover faster.

649
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,783
Then don't cause me any problems.

650
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,537
I wanted to apologize too.

651
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:27,420
Anyway, Jeong-in's done with wandering.

652
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,052
What did I tell you?
She just pitied him, that's all.

653
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,764
Is she coming back to you then?

654
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,475
That's up to you.

655
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,771
Decide on a position for her father.

656
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,980
Are you serious?

657
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,820
Sir, you're here.

658
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,911
What's going on?

659
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,663
Well...

660
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,083
I didn't realize that
I'd set an appointment on the same day.

661
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,127
I only figured it out once I arrived here.

662
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:12,257
I was going to call,
but you'd probably be on your way so...

663
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,801
Please have a seat first.

664
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,511
Right.

665
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,513
Here you go.

666
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,518
Will you excuse me for a moment?

667
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,540
Was this your plan for tonight?

668
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,335
Why didn't you tell me
you were meeting my son?

669
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:56,593
All these years,
I've learned what to talk about and not.

670
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,772
Ye-seul, I'm sorry I'm late.

671
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,983
-Was it busy today?
-Yes.

672
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:14,736
I see. I'm sorry.

673
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,072
It's fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

674
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,543
-I'm sorry. I met Ye-seul outside and--
-This is a place of work, you know.

675
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,254
I apologize.

676
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,798
I can only be understanding to a point.

677
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,051
Don't you think this was selfish?

678
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,429
Hye-jeong...

679
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,724
Do better, all right?

680
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,226
Lock up well.

681
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,906
We did it!

682
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,089
What are you doing here?

683
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:19,550
Where were you today?

684
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,189
Where were you?

685
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,403
I had somewhere to be.

686
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,739
You must be at ease

687
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,200
to run errands like this.

688
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,873
Let's go. We'll talk somewhere else.

689
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,709
About what?

690
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,586
Aren't you here to talk?

691
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,422
I'm not.

692
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:00,758
Then why are you here?

693
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,054
To buy medicine.

694
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,515
What kind?

695
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,730
What is it?

696
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,692
A medicine that can cure

697
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,153
the need to smack someone

698
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,364
and a truly worried and upset heart.

699
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,580
Forget it if you've got none.

700
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,388
Gi-seok probably has
skeletons in his closet too.

701
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,767
If I had known about this,
I would've taken photos too.

702
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,644
Are you challenging me?

703
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,687
-I'm done serving you!
-Are you insane?

704
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,942
What do you mean
Yu Ji-ho isn't a decent man?

705
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,528
He threatened me
with the photos that were taken.

706
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,238
He could be after money.

707
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,615
My mom wants to meet you, Ji-ho.

708
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,283
I'd like to bring Eun-u, too.

709
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,078
I should've thought of that first.
Sure, let's do that.

710
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,372
I like it that you think
this is our decision.

711
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,624
What do you say
to being a director after retirement?

712
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,334
I appreciate the offer,

713
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,461
but I'd like some time to think about it.

714
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:01,838
Are you still sulking?

715
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,006
Is there no chance
for you and Gi-seok anymore?

716
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,758
Just be patient with me, Dad.

717
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,468
You'll soon see me live a happy life.

718
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,554
Please believe in me.

719
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,392
