EPISODE 13

2
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,528
Gosh, you scared me.

3
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,739
Why are you sleeping here?

4
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,743
Wait, did I snore?

5
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,163
You even snore?

6
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,212
Do you know how many times
I nearly fell off the bed?

7
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,842
I can't even share a bed with Jae-in
because we push each other.

8
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,220
Don't even dream of
sleeping over here again.

9
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,473
-I'm going to sleep here if I want to.
-No. No way. You absolutely can't.

10
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,812
End of discussion.

11
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,692
Then let's do this.

12
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,571
-Here.
-What are you doing?

13
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,533
-Hey, what is this? What are you doing?
-Stay put.

14
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,784
Like this.

15
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,455
We can hold each other tight and go
to sleep so that I can't even budge.

16
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,500
Okay, let's go back to sleep.

17
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,713
Gosh, seriously?

18
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,673
-Oh, no.
-Hold onto me.

19
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,637
That hurt.

20
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,430
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

21
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,140
Actually, no. I'm not okay.

22
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,611
I told you to come early and help me
make dumplings, not just to eat.

23
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,988
Maybe I should just live with Dad.

24
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,784
Hey, where's Jeong-in?

25
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,994
She didn't come home last night.

26
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,705
-Hi, Seo-in.
-Hi.

27
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,873
Where did she sleep?

28
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,210
At Yeong-ju's place.

29
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,088
Call Yeong-ju.

30
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,673
Mom.

31
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,133
It's just...

32
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,554
My daughter didn't come home last night.
Can't I even ask?

33
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,236
Hey, that should be good enough.

34
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,993
Are you upset with me
because I slept at Ji-ho's place?

35
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,373
You seem upset.

36
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,043
Gi-seok is on his way here.

37
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,589
I lied to him that I'm not feeling well,

38
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,633
but he insisted,
saying it won't take long.

39
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,510
Why is he so bullheaded?

40
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,431
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

41
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,727
Will you go wait for him outside,
advertising that you slept with Ji-ho?

42
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,520
I can do that.

43
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,943
A guy, who he used to look down on,
took away what had belonged to him.

44
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,570
I'm sure he's livid.

45
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,489
-Am I an object or what?
-Do you think this is about love?

46
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,868
He wants you back
only because you were his.

47
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,123
Do you know what really worries me?

48
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,584
Whether Gi-seok's strategy is lame or not,

49
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,669
what if it works in the end?

50
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,839
I do believe in you.

51
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,967
But most people
won't approve of your relationship.

52
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,887
Is Ji-ho dangerous or something?

53
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,389
He'd be the perfect target for gossip.

54
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,684
And in others' eyes,
you're just someone who cheated

55
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,852
on her decent boyfriend.

56
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,980
Even if people talk shit about me,

57
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,441
I won't regret meeting Ji-ho.

58
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,996
Hey.

59
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,123
Yeong-ju won't be meeting with you.

60
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,626
And I'll tell my parents about Ji-ho.

61
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,838
Come again?

62
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,132
Isn't that what you want?

63
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,261
You're trying to suffocate me
by meeting people around me one by one.

64
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,931
Your strategy is working.
It's driving me nuts.

65
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,017
I'd rather just tell everyone
and get it over with.

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,894
This is driving me up the wall.

67
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,900
My patience is wearing thin as well.

68
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,534
If you stop here,

69
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,786
I'll just put it behind us, okay?

70
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,248
Don't act as if you suddenly realized
that you were so in love.

71
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,584
You just can't accept the fact
that I'm dumping you.

72
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,794
Be honest, please.

73
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,548
Yes, you are right about that.

74
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,761
There are so many reasons
I can't help but do this.

75
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,432
Do whatever you want. I'll do the same.

76
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,704
Did you get yelled at by Yeong-ju?

77
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,540
She didn't have all the ingredients.

78
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,219
I'm calling it quits.

79
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,347
I wanted to be like you,
but I just can't do it.

80
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,682
I can't take this anymore.

81
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,441
What's the matter?

82
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,234
I'm so pissed off.

83
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,904
I held myself back because of you.

84
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,740
Why must I be patient?
Did we commit a crime or what?

85
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,702
I'll tell them everything.
He can't keep doing this.

86
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,206
Who do you mean by "he"?

87
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,751
Gi-seok?

88
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,132
Would telling your parents
change anything?

89
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:29,926
No.

90
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,136
But still...

91
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,892
It'll only make things
more difficult for you. He won't change.

92
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,115
Hi, Mom.

93
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,579
I just called to check in.
I hung up because I had to do something.

94
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,794
I slept at Yeong-ju's place.

95
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,591
No, I didn't drink.

96
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,428
No, we just hung out.

97
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,808
I'm serious.

98
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,270
She'd never call me for no reason.

99
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
Are you sure she's at Yeong-ju's place?

100
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,442
You can go there and find out.

101
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,611
Why are you all annoyed?

102
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,656
I have my fair share of stress.

103
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,700
Because you got nothing to do?

104
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,415
Has Jeong-in really told you nothing
about that guy?

105
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,627
I met him once.

106
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,337
You met him?

107
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,342
Is their relationship already serious
enough for her to introduce him to you?

108
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,887
No, I ran into them by chance.
We just said hello, and that was it.

109
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,683
I heard he's a pharmacist who's her age.
That's what you told me.

110
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,812
Yes. That's all you know
about him as well, right?

111
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,772
Right.

112
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,736
He has some sort of flaw, right?

113
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,532
Jeong-in will tell you about it.

114
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,992
So, he does have a flaw.

115
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,330
It's her relationship,
so you should hear it directly from her.

116
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,998
Just give her some time.

117
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,210
Should I prepare myself mentally?

118
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,921
It's very hard to get this.

119
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,591
-I've only heard about this.
-You work for the country.

120
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,967
I'll work around your schedule.

121
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,053
Yes, anytime is good for me.

122
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,096
Let's do that. Okay.

123
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,519
That was Assemblyman Jang.
He pesters me to meet up constantly.

124
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,023
I heard his youngest daughter
is a professor now.

125
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,358
I bet he wants to brag about it.

126
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,068
He already told me about that.

127
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,112
His daughter is around the same age
as my son.

128
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,239
He wants to set her up with him?

129
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,617
Need I say more?
Obviously, that's what he wants.

130
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,579
That's great.
This is like a pre-celebration, then.

131
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,791
Take us all out for a fancy dinner.

132
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,545
Is that why
you didn't invite Mr. Lee today?

133
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,052
You're right. Mr. Lee isn't here.
You guys didn't call him?

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,641
I assumed you'd bring him along.

135
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,104
Wouldn't it upset him
if I call and invite him now?

136
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,567
You guys should've thought of this.
This puts me in an awkward position.

137
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,530
Gosh, he'll get the wrong idea.

138
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,115
What should I do now?

139
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,246
I shouldn't have left it up to you all.
It's all my fault.

140
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,915
I called him too late.

141
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,043
My apologies.
I'll clear up the misunderstanding.

142
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:55,172
Mr. Park, you're always so organized
and thorough. Why today of all days...

143
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,967
Gosh, you totally let me down.

144
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,093
Unbelievable.

145
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,371
I only came back because at least
I shouldn't stress you out as your wife.

146
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,916
What has Seo-in decided to do?

147
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,712
What kind of question is that? She already
made up her mind to divorce him.

148
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,130
You couldn't even

149
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,674
talk her out of it
when you stayed with her for days?

150
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,427
Think about why she made
such a decision despite being pregnant.

151
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,140
As her parents,
we should respect her decision.

152
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,851
About Jeong-in...

153
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,563
What about her?

154
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,691
Jeong-in said there's a guy she likes.

155
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,360
Tell her I'd meet him.

156
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,362
Why all of a sudden?

157
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,699
What about Gi-seok,
who you're absolutely fond of?

158
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,495
You said we, as parents,
should respect our children's opinion.

159
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:05,761
YU JI-HO

160
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,113
KWON GI-SEOK

161
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,027
WOORI PHARMACY

162
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,647
Gi-seok.

163
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,565
What brings you by?

164
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,946
Is Ji-ho not home?

165
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,074
I have to talk to him about something,
but I can't get a hold of him.

166
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,412
-You're here too.
-He's not here now.

167
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,707
Where did he go?

168
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,584
We don't know. Yeong-jae and I stopped by,

169
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,671
but he wasn't home when we got here.
We're just eating some fried chicken now.

170
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,090
-Come in and join us.
-No, it's all right.

171
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,761
All right, then. I'll see you guys around.

172
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,558
-Bye.
-Bye.

173
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,312
Why did you invite him in?

174
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,065
Because I was baffled.

175
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,692
By what?

176
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,163
What baffled you so much?

177
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,457
Talk to Ji-ho about what?

178
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,044
-He obviously came looking for Jeong-in.
-No way.

179
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,463
Why else would he come here?

180
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,717
He must be so embarrassed right now
because we saw him here.

181
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,552
You think so?

182
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,057
Why did Jeong-in accept the ring
to begin with?

183
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,769
Gi-seok seems to think
that she accepted his marriage proposal.

184
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,604
Give me a break.

185
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:48,609
He proposed to her
fully knowing that she wouldn't accept it.

186
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,863
This is more than just being clingy.
I'd say it's an obsession.

187
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,408
If we look at it positively,

188
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,745
it could also mean
that he loves Jeong-in that much.

189
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,039
If that's love,

190
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,541
having a crush on someone
would count as a dating experience.

191
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,588
By that logic,
you've dated about 15 girls.

192
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,965
That's right.

193
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,981
I already had lunch.

194
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:32,194
I can have lunch at home.
Are you having a busy day?

195
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,113
Why would you ask when I'm already here?

196
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,823
What's up? Do you need something?

197
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,866
Well...

198
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,036
It's about the guy you mentioned.

199
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,122
Your dad wants to meet him.

200
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,334
Why?

201
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,169
I was surprised too.

202
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,506
He said he wants to respect your opinion.

203
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,261
Did he...

204
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,222
hear something from Gi-seok?

205
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,933
No, it didn't seem to be the case.

206
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,645
Hear about what though?

207
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,075
Seo-in and Jae-in

208
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,828
hinted at me
that I should mentally prepare myself.

209
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,747
Let's hear it now.

210
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,042
What is it?
Why are you scaring me like this?

211
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,755
Whatever it is, I'm prepared to handle it.
Just tell me.

212
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,560
Actually...

213
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
He...

214
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,407
He has a kid.

215
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,411
Who?

216
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,371
The guy I'm seeing.

217
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,293
Mom.

218
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,713
I'm sorry.

219
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,011
Mom.

220
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,056
You see,

221
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:25,724
Jeong-in.

222
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,061
-This is--
-I tried not to fall for him.

223
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,065
I, too,

224
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,193
thought it was wrong,

225
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,657
but...

226
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,409
I like him so much.

227
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,038
I like him a lot, Mom.

228
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,958
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,293
Well...

230
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,797
This isn't about you apologizing.

231
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,132
Gosh, this is...

232
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,927
I don't even know what to say.

233
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,347
I can't be without him, Mom.

234
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,975
I can't live without him.

235
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,603
My goodness.

236
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,982
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,234
I'm sorry, Mom.

238
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,736
But...

239
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,073
help me, please.

240
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,701
Gosh, Jeong-in...

241
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,829
What should we do?

242
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,082
Mom...

243
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,502
My gosh...

244
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,466
Jeong-in.

245
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,761
What should we do about this situation?

246
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,308
I'm sorry.

247
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,280
You should get back to work.

248
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,952
I'll call you.

249
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,787
Mom, wait.

250
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,587
I have a favor to ask.

251
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,301
Why do you keep crying?

252
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,432
I'd like you to meet Ji-ho.

253
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,686
He's a good person.

254
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,566
I'm sure.

255
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,153
You must've fallen for him
because he's a good person.

256
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,822
But...

257
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,575
why should I meet him?

258
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,918
Are you thinking...

259
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,429
Hye-jeong.

260
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,515
Why are you calling me so fondly?

261
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,226
I need to step out.

262
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,812
Why? Did something happen to Eun-u?

263
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,648
No.

264
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,323
I don't want to be blamed
if your relationship doesn't work out.

265
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,700
I'll be quick.

266
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,703
Don't bother coming back.

267
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,039
Just be the first one to arrive tomorrow.

268
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,591
If you want coffee, you can have this.

269
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,553
No problem.

270
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,097
You don't want coffee?

271
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,933
I'm all right.
I have to finish a report quickly.

272
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,768
Hey, actually...

273
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,689
Does Ji-ho know that I came by his place?

274
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,151
Yes, I told him you wanted
to talk to him about something.

275
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,362
I had to talk to him about something.

276
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,989
Yes, that's what I told him.

277
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,241
-Right, you said that.
-Yes.

278
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,164
-Don't you have to finish a report?
-Oh, right.

279
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:28,884
Shit.

280
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,097
God damn it.

281
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,228
What the hell.

282
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,202
Damn it.

283
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,166
Jeez...

284
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,340
-Where are you coming from?
-I had to go to the admin office.

285
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,301
By the way--

286
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,678
I'm sorry about last weekend.

287
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,264
My wife and I had to go somewhere,

288
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:18,600
so I couldn't attend the get-together.

289
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,561
Is that right?
I wondered why you didn't come.

290
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,982
If it happens again, I'll make sure
I let you know beforehand.

291
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,818
-All right.
-Have a nice day.

292
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,118
PRINCIPAL LEE TAE-HAK

293
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,547
Yes, sir.

294
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,425
I'm just calling to see if you'd be up
for grabbing dinner

295
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,219
since you couldn't join us on the weekend.

296
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,055
I'm sorry. I have plans this evening.

297
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,766
Really? Then shall we
grab dinner tomorrow?

298
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,478
No, it's all right. It's my fault
that I couldn't attend the get-together.

299
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,648
-It would only make me feel more guilty.
-Oh, please.

300
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,652
Anyway, all right.
Let's find another time, then.

301
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,028
Sure.

302
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,155
-I won't keep you from your work.
-Okay.

303
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,451
Do you think I'm a pushover?

304
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,549
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

305
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,509
What brings you by?

306
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,555
I'm here to see Jeong-in.
I can't get a hold of her.

307
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,391
Oh, really? Hold on.

308
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,311
What is she up to now?

309
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,982
Hey, Ha-rin. Is Jeong-in in the office?

310
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,485
No, she isn't. By the way,
did something happen to Jeong-in?

311
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,195
Why do you ask?

312
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,239
She was crying earlier.

313
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,450
Where is she now?

314
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,370
-In the viewing room.
-It's on B1.

315
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,290
-I see. Thank you. See you around.
-See you.

316
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,465
Who is he?

317
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,800
Is he that guy?

318
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,054
-Who else would it be?
-I see.

319
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,389
Hey, what's going on with Jeong-in?

320
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,266
Who knows?

321
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,520
I'd walk around with a huge smile on
my face if I had a boyfriend like that.

322
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,330
What are you doing here?

323
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:54,422
I just broke into tears
while talking to my mom.

324
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,300
You didn't have to ditch work
to come here.

325
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,762
Hye-jeong will speak ill of me.

326
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,192
She let me leave, saying I may blame her
if things go wrong between us.

327
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,286
It's nice to cry sometimes.

328
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,164
I get to see you at this hour.

329
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,917
You have to be stronger.

330
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,214
I'm not crying because I got scolded.

331
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,800
I just...

332
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,428
For some strange reason...

333
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,390
Why can't I cry?

334
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,144
Yes, you can. But the thing is,

335
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,148
I don't want you to cry alone

336
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
especially when I'm not around.

337
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,868
But you're here now.

338
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,997
Okay, cry. Cry all you want.

339
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,546
My mom...

340
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,633
left without giving me her answer.

341
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,065
I always tell you

342
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,026
that everything will be okay

343
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,820
and that we can take it slow...

344
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,117
because there's this faith,
which only you and I know of.

345
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,665
The "Us" you always talk about?

346
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,753
Yes, us.

347
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,596
By the way, what is this place?

348
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,391
Where people kiss secretly.

349
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,779
What else?

350
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,698
His parents run a dry cleaner's.
That's all I heard.

351
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,201
What about you?

352
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,080
There's no need to hide anything now.

353
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,082
I'm not hiding anything.

354
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,584
We just said hello. That's all.

355
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,797
He seemed like a nice guy.
He was polite as well.

356
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,926
I can't believe this.

357
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,304
I've never even imagined
that I'd be in this situation.

358
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,515
What about Seo-in?

359
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,227
She has a point.

360
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,897
So what are you going to do, Mom?

361
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,150
I have no idea.

362
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,278
I can't even help you
sort out your situation.

363
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,200
With Jeong-in's situation,
I feel even more clueless.

364
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:19,789
Mom, Jeong-in wants to show you
that you don't need to worry.

365
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,917
She wants you to know
that she's dating a decent guy

366
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,254
and that you don't need
to sigh nonstop like this.

367
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,965
I've never seen her
with those eyes before.

368
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,343
I think she's thinking of marrying him.

369
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,429
Already?

370
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,891
You should meet him.

371
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,854
I'm sure you don't want any regrets.

372
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,482
You said you'll regret for the rest of
your life that you didn't dissuade me

373
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,234
from marrying him hard enough.

374
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,112
So don't be like that to Jeong-in.

375
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,323
Mom, are you going to be against it?

376
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,080
I don't know who this is,
but he's in deep trouble.

377
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,251
Even just a slap in the face
can get you in serious trouble.

378
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,172
Even if it's sex between a married couple,
it can be prosecuted

379
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,591
if coercion or threats were involved.

380
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,428
Even at our law firm, we get
many inquiries regarding marital rape.

381
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,639
Hey, but they're married.

382
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,184
It doesn't work that way.

383
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,854
Legally, it's considered
violation of self-determination.

384
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
By the way, who's this guy?

385
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,695
Oh, my friend asked me to look into it
for his acquaintance.

386
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,700
By the sound of it,
I don't think he's a nice guy.

387
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,786
Don't befriend him.

388
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,249
Let's play one more round
and go for drinks.

389
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,375
-Sure.
-All right.

390
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,799
Hey, then...

391
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,385
If it's considered assault,
will he lose his parental rights as well?

392
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
-In the case of child abuse...
-Yes.

393
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,017
By any chance,
is this what you're going through now?

394
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,853
Gosh, what are you talking about?
Of course not.

395
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,438
-Right?
-Yes.

396
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,941
You kept asking about it,
so I was curious.

397
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,195
Even if this is your case,
don't ask me to represent you.

398
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,989
There's no way he'll win the case.
He'll lose.

399
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,867
-I have to make a quick phone call.
-Okay.

400
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,997
What should we order?

401
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,586
What are you up for?

402
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,673
You eat more, so the choice is yours.

403
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,511
I'll order a lot then.

404
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,309
Let's see...

405
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,021
I'll park the car. You head up first.

406
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,172
Isn't this enough confirmation?

407
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,342
It's like I said.

408
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,928
I'm not you.

409
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,139
This much I can take.

410
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,352
You can date Jeong-in again...

411
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,064
after we break up.

412
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:02,983
Hey.

413
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,736
I'm telling you this because

414
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,614
it's your least pathetic
and realistic option.

415
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,035
She'll open the window soon.

416
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,164
You think I'm scared?

417
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,707
I am.

418
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,378
I worry about her finding out the truth of

419
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,380
the man she once dated.

420
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,924
Stop acting so high and mighty

421
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,885
and ask Jeong-in to come down.

422
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,681
Try taking her if you can.

423
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,850
Is that a challenge?

424
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,310
Show some respect first and then talk.

425
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,075
All right, fine.
Do whatever you want. I'll let you.

426
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,788
You can meet my family,
my friends, and those around me.

427
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,749
Call me anytime and anywhere.

428
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,918
Ask me to meet up and visit me.

429
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,087
I'll put up with anything.

430
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:06,922
What are you doing?

431
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,591
So bug me all you want.

432
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,012
I'll think
that I'm paying for hurting you,

433
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,556
so until you're done,

434
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,017
I won't resent you in any way.

435
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,145
Do whatever you want until you get bored.

436
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,983
-Go inside, Jeong-in.
-But don't bother Ji-ho.

437
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,529
If you do, I'll do anything to stop you.

438
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,491
I don't care who I have to go after.

439
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,008
It took you half a day to open this door.

440
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,968
What the hell took you so long?

441
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,600
-It's been a while.
-Oh, hi.

442
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,978
We'll talk later.

443
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,939
Seo-in, follow me.

444
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,444
We'll talk in here.

445
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,639
You seriously asked Jae-in to stay here?

446
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,019
Don't act naive.

447
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,897
I know you saw this coming.

448
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,068
I said there won't be a divorce.

449
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,404
Leave if that's all you have to say.

450
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,210
Give up my paternal rights?

451
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,754
You're telling me
to stop being a human being.

452
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,551
You proved yourself as an animal
when you kicked me.

453
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,264
It's in the past and I already apologized.

454
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,808
And that makes it go away?

455
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,728
Just have your lawyer ready.

456
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,772
What will you tell our baby then?

457
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,066
Will you tell I don't exist?

458
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,777
Why when you're perfectly alive?

459
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,238
I'll say you're in prison.

460
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,288
Jae-in, it's nothing.

461
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,667
What was that? Were you about to hit her?

462
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,463
Has he been hitting you?

463
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,132
-Jae-in--
-Seo-in!

464
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,052
Come on. Let's talk outside.

465
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,387
Who the hell are you?

466
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,848
Who are you to hit my sister?

467
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,059
-Jae-in--
-Who are you to hit her?

468
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,810
Who the fuck are you?

469
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,607
-Jae-in, that's enough--
-Let go.

470
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,734
Hit me too. Go on.

471
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,278
-Jae-in, come on.
-Why aren't you hitting me?

472
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,989
Hit me!

473
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,824
You piece of shit!

474
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,579
You come with me. Now!

475
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,873
Jae-in...

476
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,420
-Please stop.
-Let go. Get out of the way!

477
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,172
I'm going to kill him.

478
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,716
Get back here!

479
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,510
Let go of me!

480
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,222
Are you kidding me right now?

481
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,349
You acted like your life was put together,

482
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,810
but this is how it's been?

483
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,396
Just look at yourself!

484
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,942
I'm sorry, Jae-in.

485
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,782
Seo-in...

486
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,793
I thought you were too mad to see me.

487
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,338
Are you here to vent again?

488
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,509
If I do, will you hear me out?

489
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,141
Are you worried that
I'll start up music again?

490
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,936
Forget about a music career.

491
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,147
I'm worried
you'll do something even worse.

492
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,484
Those few photos showed a dynamic story.

493
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,403
It's nothing.

494
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,491
He's an alumnus
of the college I graduated.

495
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,952
Then you know him?

496
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,787
He's a few years my junior.

497
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,458
I introduced the two
and now they're friends.

498
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,001
There's nothing more to it.

499
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:58,464
You are one understanding friend.

500
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,343
What job will you offer
Jeong-in's dad after his retirement?

501
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,681
Get him a good one while you're at it.

502
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,727
Why? Aren't you competent enough
to get the girl by yourself?

503
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,816
Who cares about a shoddy deal
when it gets you what you want?

504
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,777
It's your specialty, isn't it?

505
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,993
You admitted it too after meeting her.

506
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,370
Right.

507
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,457
Well, she's not an easy fish to catch.

508
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,544
I'm willing to go this far
because it's her.

509
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:42,674
Just so you know, I don't lag behind
other men that are out there.

510
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,052
It's why I can't let this go.

511
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,096
I can't become a pathetic loser.

512
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,770
Do you think that I led a dirty life?

513
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,650
You hated that I was like Mom, right?

514
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,405
Well, I'll live like you from now on.

515
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,036
Give her dad a decent position,

516
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,789
and I'll do the rest.

517
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,568
Don't break up with Ji-ho.

518
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:50,242
Enjoy a long and happy life
with the man you love.

519
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,808
You should grab some lunch first.

520
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,311
My classes are in the afternoon,
so I have time.

521
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,062
I hope you pass this time.

522
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,356
It might just encourage Ye-seul.

523
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,068
I'm thinking about
studying for the test too.

524
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,070
Anyway, I wish you luck.

525
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,697
Right, we should...

526
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,076
I'm not here for supplements.

527
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,495
Pride isn't a luxury
you can afford right now.

528
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,081
-We'll get going.
-Enjoy your lunch.

529
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,207
Sure thing.

530
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,503
Seriously. I'm just here to talk.

531
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,590
Then talk.
What was that about telling me to run?

532
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,258
That was just a joke.

533
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,178
Because Jae-in is
seriously rooting for you guys.

534
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,265
It doesn't seem like one.
Tell her I'll consider it.

535
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,018
As if. Run away? You?

536
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,519
You're too decent for that.

537
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,105
I'll try the bad boy thing.

538
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,920
SUYEONG FOUNDATION ORGANIZATION CHART

539
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,922
CHIEF DIRECTOR KWON YEONG-GUK

540
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,150
There. Lean back.

541
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,485
-Is that comfortable?
-Yes.

542
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,489
-Have fun with your dad.
-And Ms. Lee.

543
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,992
What? Oh, yes. Of course.

544
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,080
Don't let him eat anything too cold.

545
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,457
I packed some barley tea.

546
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,001
This isn't my first time,
so what's with all the fuss?

547
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,669
She must want to come with.

548
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,838
Eun-u, let's get going.

549
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,173
We won't be late.

550
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:54,426
If he gets fussy, head back and--

551
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:57,262
He'll be heading out tomorrow
at this rate. Get yourself going.

552
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,847
-We'll get going then.
-Bye.

553
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,309
Eun-u, have a good time.

554
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:05,145
-Eun-u!
-Have fun.

555
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,688
-Have a safe trip.
-Sure.

556
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,148
-Be careful out there.
-Sure.

557
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,571
Maybe we should've
told him to leave Eun-u.

558
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,616
She's the one who wanted Eun-u to come.

559
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,076
She's just saying that.

560
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,662
What if she gets annoyed that he's there?

561
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,416
Words can become reality if you keep
saying it, so stop thinking so negatively.

562
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,972
Hi, Eun-u!

563
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,811
Hey, you didn't forget. Thanks.

564
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,363
Why aren't you saying hi?

565
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,406
Hi.

566
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,992
Are you upset about something?

567
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,412
Of course not.
You should put on your seat belt.

568
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:10,168
Eun-u, it seems like
your dad's sulking for no reason.

569
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,629
That's stupid.

570
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,054
You'll burn a hole in my face.

571
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,682
"You'll burn a hole in my face."

572
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:27,936
I'm already worried about today.

573
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,483
It's okay to be a bit late for weddings.

574
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,069
I've left the house.

575
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,990
All right. I'll see you soon.

576
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,131
One, two, three!

577
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,926
Eun-u!

578
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,975
All right. Eun-u, wait for us.

579
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,520
Eun-u.

580
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,397
Okay, good.

581
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,693
Let's go.

582
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,313
Good job.

583
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,622
Do you think Eun-u will remember this day?

584
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,378
He will. I'm sure of it.

585
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,891
Eun-u.

586
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,060
Here you go.

587
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,083
Change the photo you have by your bed
to this one.

588
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,300
My first attempt failed.

589
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,655
-Dad.
-Yes?

590
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,576
Ms. Lee asked if I'd like her

591
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,620
as my mom.

592
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,798
So...

593
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,884
-what did you say?
-"Yes."

594
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,893
Good job. That's a good answer.

595
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,812
Can you stay here for a while?

596
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,915
I'm not one with high self-esteem.

597
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,087
I'm not embarrassed about
being rejected once.

598
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,383
Jeong-in.

599
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,802
You know I'm quite mean,

600
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,181
and I toss and turn in bed.

601
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,101
What else?

602
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,187
Are you...

603
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,649
really...

604
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,694
coming to us?

605
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,572
Yes.

606
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,700
I can't wait until I have gray hair.

607
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,886
Just so you know,
I'm going to be a tough wife.

608
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:56,306
I already know that.

609
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,355
The door is opening.

610
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,632
First floor.

611
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,345
Going up.

612
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,332
You should give him a call this time.

613
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,293
He said he'll be heading back
after dinner.

614
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,587
Then what's taking him so long?

615
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,965
Eun-u's with his dad,
so why are you worried?

616
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,717
Well, she's with them too.

617
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,428
It's nice that
she's spending more time with Eun-u.

618
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,682
Will she marry him?

619
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:47,268
If she does,

620
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,437
I couldn't be any happier.

621
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,189
You don't even know what she's like.

622
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,193
I wonder if she'll come here later.

623
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,154
Maybe I'll ask her to come inside.

624
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,909
Wouldn't it be too sudden?

625
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,827
You're just as curious, aren't you?

626
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,329
Of course, I am.

627
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,998
He's never been this close
with anyone before.

628
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,042
It's why I'm more worried.

629
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:16,297
What if he gives her his heart
only to have it broken again?

630
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,799
How will we stitch it back up?

631
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,635
Eun-u will be affected this time too.

632
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,471
Do you know why I was fussy this morning?

633
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,723
It's because of that reason.

634
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,695
Do you not know anything about this?

635
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,824
Of course, I don't. How would I know?

636
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:44,492
Damn it.

637
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,290
No, let me.

638
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,628
-Get her over here immediately.
-Sure.

639
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:57,880
She had better show up!

640
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,595
I didn't offer to drive because of Eun-u.

641
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,016
Would I even be tired?
I doubt I'll even sleep at night.

642
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,310
I'm the one who won't be sleeping.

643
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,604
My first proposal was rejected, remember?

644
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,650
I told you I got the gist of it.

645
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,820
Whatever. I'd still be single
if it weren't for Eun-u.

646
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,657
I'm proud of you, son.

647
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:35,793
-Yes?
-Your dad found out.

648
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,545
You should run away.

649
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,877
If it wasn't Gi-seok,
who could've done such a thing?

650
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,086
Gi-seok's father.

651
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,340
I need to talk to your father. It's best
if you're there too, so be there.

652
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,008
I took it without any meaning.

653
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,511
-I should've returned it earlier.
-What's so great about him?

654
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,763
I don't need anything else.
Just come back to me.

655
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:30,598
-Bring him home.
-No.

656
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,141
But you said you'll marry him.

657
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,684
I know you're planning to

658
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,311
humiliate him and drive him away.

659
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,480
You don't have to date Gi-seok.

660
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,690
I'll give up the job at the foundation
after I retire.

661
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:40,817
I can't give him up.

662
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,946
Please tell Seo-in
to persuade Jeong-in for me.

663
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:48,115
I'll make it worth your while.
I sincerely mean it.

664
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,618
I know I don't say it,
but I'm worried too.

665
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,245
I'm even terrified at times.

666
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,163
I'm scared she'll show up
and demand Eun-u back.

667
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,207
Yu-mi's married.
