1
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,141
Talk about finding joy in the mundane.

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,143
Having a drink with a friend after work.

3
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,270
Isn't it just perfect?

4
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,731
It'd be even better
if it was with a boyfriend.

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,149
I don't agree.

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,485
Then give me your boyfriend.

7
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,820
I'll give you this in exchange.

8
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,031
Hey, Yeong-ju. Seriously!

9
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
Hey!

10
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,080
EPISODE 1

11
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:36,012
Hey, do you still have
the kimchi you gave me last time?

12
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,722
I'm bringing it now.

13
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,225
I hear a phone vibrating. It's yours.

14
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,476
-Mine?
-Yes.

15
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,027
-Hi, Gi-seok.
-Hey, are you still there?

16
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,489
No, I'm at Yeong-ju's place
for another round.

17
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,783
I see. When are you going home, then?

18
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,745
In a bit, I guess? I'll just sleep here
if I end up staying late.

19
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,207
Do you have an afternoon shift tomorrow?

20
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,502
Yes. But it's Saturday,
so I have to be there before lunchtime.

21
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,129
-Okay.
-Is your team dinner over?

22
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,714
They want to go elsewhere for more drinks,

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,008
but I'm playing basketball tomorrow,
so I'm going home.

24
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,762
I got invited to the basketball club
started by my fellow college alumni.

25
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,682
Oh, really? You should go, then.

26
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,268
All right. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

27
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,145
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

28
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,069
What?

29
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,614
You guys are in a relationship.
Don't all couples say things like

30
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,159
"I love you" to each other
before hanging up?

31
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,577
Cut it out.

32
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,746
This is why
long-term relationships are bad.

33
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,583
Hey, it depends on the person.

34
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,794
We were never lovey-dovey
even at the beginning. You know that.

35
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,214
Right, you two have always been
like a middle-aged couple.

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,966
We're not that bad.

37
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,635
I've never envied your relationship.

38
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,929
You told me to hand him over.

39
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,348
You can keep him.

40
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,392
-Jeez.
-Cheers.

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,436
Cheers.

42
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,852
-Good. That was great.
-Great job.

43
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,230
You guys did well. Okay.

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,023
-Good job.
-Well done. Good shot!

45
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,276
-That was good. Great job.
-Thank you.

46
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,611
Oh, boy.

47
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,698
-Keep it up. For just a few more minutes.
-You did well.

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,241
You're doing great. Keep it up.

49
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,742
You're playing man-to-man defense?

50
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,952
Slow down, okay?

51
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,246
Remember to set a solid off-ball screen
and move faster.

52
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,290
-That pass was good.
-Yes, okay.

53
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,085
Guys. The defenders keep moving, you know.

54
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,712
-Yes.
-You need to keep up with them.

55
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,547
-I have to go.
-You're leaving?

56
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,840
-Good job.
-Get going, then.

57
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,717
-I'm off.
-See you. Great job today.

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,135
-Bye.
-Good job, guys.

59
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,554
-See you all next week.
-Focus on the game, okay?

60
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,763
I'm off, guys.

61
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,098
-Bye.
-See you next week.

62
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,142
-Come next week.
-Hey, I'm leaving.

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,270
Hey, wait. This is Gi-seok.
I've told you about him before.

64
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,688
He helped us rent this gym today.

65
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,691
-This is the friend I told you about.
-I see.

66
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,359
You probably don't remember him.

67
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,780
I feel like I've seen him before,
but why don't I remember him?

68
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,616
Did you also start your undergrad in 2004?

69
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,869
Yes, that's right. I'm Yu Ji-ho.

70
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,787
Nice to meet you. I'm Kwon Gi-seok.

71
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,250
Jeez, look at you. He's younger than you.

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,879
Don't be so polite during the games.
Just crush them down.

73
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,672
Especially this dude.

74
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,258
When it comes to basketball,
he's such a snob.

75
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,718
You are no match for me.

76
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,054
Look at that.

77
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,474
This is exciting.
Let's play together next time.

78
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,851
Yes, of course.
I won't go easy on you though.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,853
You shouldn't.

80
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,565
-I'll be off, then. Bye.
-Bye.

81
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,026
Let's go, Gi-seok.

82
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,204
WOORI PHARMACY

83
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,664
-Hello.
-Hello.

84
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,042
Do you have any medicine for hangovers?

85
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,212
I need something strong.

86
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,427
This will help too. You can have a sip.

87
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,554
Okay, thank you.

88
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,987
If you have any rubber bands
lying around, could I please get one?

89
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,368
-This is all I have.
-That's exactly what I need.

90
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,037
Thank you.

91
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,921
Oh, here.

92
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,978
What's my total?

93
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,605
-It's 6,000 won.
-Okay.

94
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,569
Where's my wallet?

95
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,492
Where did it go?

96
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,787
-Did you lose your wallet?
-No. This is so weird.

97
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,830
Last night, I...

98
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,208
Never mind. Just a second, please.

99
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,185
Well, it looks like I left it
at my friend's place. What should I do?

100
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,812
Where is your friend's place?

101
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,523
She lives over there.

102
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,985
-Are you sure your wallet is there?
-I'm pretty sure...

103
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,113
No, I know that it's there.

104
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,532
Just a moment, please.

105
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,921
-What's my total again?
-It's 6,000 won.

106
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,717
Gosh, why isn't she picking up?

107
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,096
I'm in a rush now.
So I'll come back in the evening and...

108
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,473
Actually, my friend is still asleep.

109
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,351
-As soon as she wakes up, I'll tell her--
-You can just go.

110
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,396
No, I need to settle up.

111
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,692
Give me your account number.
Then I can send it to you right away.

112
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,194
No, just go. You said
you'll settle up next time. Just do that.

113
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,032
I'm sorry.

114
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,909
I promise I'll come back and settle up.

115
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,879
Actually, excuse me.

116
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,673
It's not like I opened it.

117
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,926
-Pardon?
-You opened that new bottle.

118
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,012
I never said I wanted to drink it.

119
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,849
You asked for a hangover remedy.

120
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,434
Right, I did.

121
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,979
But I never asked you
to open the bottle and mix it for me.

122
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,441
Right, I made a mistake.

123
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,903
You said you're in a rush.

124
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,115
Shall I give you my number?

125
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,661
I mean, just in case.

126
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,539
I'll definitely come back and settle up,

127
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,792
but just in case you don't trust me.

128
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,296
It's hard to trust people these days,
so I understand.

129
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,427
Zero, one, zero.

130
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,098
Four, five, nine, three...

131
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,111
Hey.

132
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,870
Oh, you don't have to do this.

133
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,164
Do you need more?

134
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm not giving you this money.

135
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,045
Pay me back.

136
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,298
What is your name?

137
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,387
I'm Yu Ji-ho.

138
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm Lee Jeong-in.

139
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,228
Be safe, Ms. Lee Jeong-in.

140
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,495
It's in the bag
from the convenience store.

141
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,915
You bought the beer last night.
I guess that's when you put it there.

142
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,919
Hey, I'll either pick it up after work
or if I get off too late...

143
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,963
Anyway, hold on to it.

144
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,757
How will you pay for the taxi ride?

145
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,721
I'll call Ha-rin and ask her to come down.

146
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,018
Hey, if you pass by the pharmacy...

147
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,978
Never mind.

148
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,939
Pharmacy? Why? Are you feeling sick?

149
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,776
No, I'm fine.
Anyway, hold on to my wallet, okay?

150
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,069
Bye.

151
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,957
ADD NEW CONTACT

152
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,381
I memorized it.

153
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,348
The elevated levels
of fine particulate matter have dropped,

154
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,517
so you can enjoy being outdoors
this weekend.

155
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,101
However, you should still wear a mask

156
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,562
when you go outside
for your health's sake.

157
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,023
That's it for the 12 p.m. news update.

158
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,067
Thank you all for watching.

159
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,197
-Good work.
-Thank you.

160
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,534
-Great job!
-Good work, everyone.

161
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,663
-Great job.
-Well done, everyone.

162
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,752
Don't touch any of my stuff.

163
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,221
What a cheeky...

164
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,698
This is getting rid of my hangover.

165
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,456
It's not getting rid of mine.
I think I drank way too much last night.

166
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,124
Really?

167
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,547
I wish meeting people
could be like this too.

168
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,509
I want to meet people who continue to grow
on me even though I had no expectations.

169
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,806
The first encounter could be all you need
to be smitten by someone, like destiny.

170
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,308
My goodness.

171
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,353
You don't even believe in horoscopes.
What's gotten into you?

172
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,397
Well, that makes me feel
as if I'm being brainwashed.

173
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,025
"Don't do this. Don't go there."
I don't like it.

174
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,110
But it's not like you enjoy adventure.

175
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,073
Hey, who even gets a chance
to be adventurous?

176
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,575
You go to school, get your degree,
and get a job.

177
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,285
After that, all you do is work

178
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,954
and hang out with friends here and there.

179
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,372
Why leave out dating?

180
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,540
It's the cause of all sorts of problems.

181
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,838
Thankfully,
even that aspect of my life has been

182
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,174
relatively problem-free.

183
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,177
I don't like to be in a relationship
that is too boring.

184
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,098
-"Boring"?
-Yes.

185
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,266
I don't like it.

186
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,020
Just a second.

187
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,024
-Hey.
-What account number?

188
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,276
What?

189
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,279
Your message.
You asked for my account number.

190
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,200
Oh, that. It was for someone else.

191
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,160
I guess I sent it to you by mistake.
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,997
-For whom?
-What?

193
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,124
Who was it for?

194
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,045
One of my clients. A publishing firm.

195
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,390
Thank you.

196
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,970
PHARMACIST
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER!

197
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,447
Hurry up.

198
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,500
-This is...
-What?

199
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,587
-I'm like this too though.
-What did you say?

200
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,631
Don't worry. It looks fine.

201
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,801
Security activated.

202
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,978
How's the new department?

203
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,107
It's the evaluation team,
so the workload is high.

204
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,942
And I'll be away
from the office quite often.

205
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,613
I thought you worked at your desk all day
since you work for a bank.

206
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,409
Anyway, that means you'll be even busier
from now on.

207
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,371
That being said...

208
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
Yes?

209
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,793
Shouldn't we start talking
about getting married?

210
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,216
-Why are you surprised?
-I'm not surprised.

211
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,427
I mean, we should get married.

212
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,933
Why are you all quiet?

213
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,269
What do you want to hear?

214
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,314
What now?

215
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,191
What do you mean, "What now?"

216
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,823
Did you tell Yeong-ju to come out?

217
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,367
I texted her just now.

218
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,828
You two can have dinner together.

219
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,497
What about you?

220
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,460
I was going to go home
and get some work done if she's free.

221
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,712
I need to get the hang of my new tasks.

222
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,466
Then just go home.
I don't have much of an appetite anyway.

223
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,302
I'm not saying I don't have time
to have dinner with you.

224
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,595
Let's grab a bite together.

225
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,348
-It's okay.
-What is okay?

226
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,225
I said it's okay.

227
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,645
Jeez, forget it.

228
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,022
What?

229
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,025
Why are you sulking over nothing?

230
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,693
Who's sulking?

231
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,904
I know you well enough, okay?

232
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,201
Seriously.

233
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,414
WOORI PHARMACY

234
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,719
-Hello.
-Hello.

235
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,807
-Thanks.
-You seem a little down.

236
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,601
It'd be nice to grab dinner together.

237
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,312
I already got food
from the convenience store.

238
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:14,940
Why are you downcast?

239
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,901
-Did you two fight?
-Should we fight?

240
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:19,820
I hope you win.

241
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm off.

242
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,787
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

243
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,795
Hey, what are you doing?

244
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
I'm coming.

245
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,018
You're so slow.

246
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,396
Dude, you always lose
when we play basketball together.

247
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,941
He's boasting
after winning just a few times.

248
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,943
Hey, you've met Gi-seok.

249
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,863
If he joins my team, you'll be done for.
Game over.

250
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,489
Who is he?

251
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,867
I told you one of my co-workers
is our fellow alumnus.

252
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,785
He helped us rent the school gym today.

253
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,663
His father is the chairman
of the foundation.

254
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,041
-I envy him.
-Oh, right.

255
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,961
His girlfriend's dad is the principal
of that school. I heard she's hot.

256
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,967
Hey, seriously. How can life be so unfair?

257
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,595
-It pisses me off.
-You've never seen her?

258
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,263
No, never.

259
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,392
But I want to arrange something soon.

260
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,730
After that, I'll set you two up
with girls. That's the plan.

261
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,442
Hey, I have to study.

262
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,444
Oh, right.

263
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,030
As for you, we'll wait
until you pass the civil service exam.

264
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,532
But you're on board, right?

265
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,659
I'll figure it out myself.

266
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,495
What?

267
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,331
You're so busted. You'd better tell us.

268
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,793
Tell us already.
You're seeing someone, aren't you?

269
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,836
No, not at all.

270
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,797
I should go bring some beer.

271
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,843
Hey, you're stuck in the pharmacy all day.

272
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,971
And all you do on weekends is play
basketball. What is wrong with you?

273
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,933
You should meet girls
whenever you get a chance. Date anyone--

274
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,935
Gosh, he said he'll figure it out himself.

275
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,062
I'd love to see him figuring it out.

276
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,855
I mean,
it's not like he committed a crime.

277
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,858
Hey, please.

278
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,112
What? We're friends.

279
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,614
Hey, did I offend you?

280
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,241
Whatever.

281
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,410
Hey, the meat will burn.
There's more beer, so drink up.

282
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,079
Here.

283
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,218
I said we should have dinner together.
How stubborn.

284
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,137
Don't put the blame on me.

285
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,267
We should move in together soon.

286
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,981
This won't happen if we live together.

287
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,859
We'd eat, sleep,

288
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,027
go home, and go to work together.
It'll be convenient.

289
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,698
So, you want to marry me to avoid hassles?

290
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,410
Why do you keep putting words in my mouth?

291
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,495
Then what is it?

292
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,166
What can I do?

293
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,792
How can I make you feel better?

294
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,086
You said you know me well.

295
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,213
What can I do?

296
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
Get out of my sight at once.

297
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,013
I will if you get out.

298
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,766
All right.

299
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
Okay, I heard you.

300
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,565
I'll make it up to you next weekend.

301
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,193
Think of what you want to do.

302
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,904
Just go.

303
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,617
Sweet dreams.

304
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,103
My gosh.

305
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,526
Is that you, Jae-in?

306
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,322
-Jeong-in.
-What's going on?

307
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,157
When did you get here?

308
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,909
What's up with this...

309
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,827
Does Mom know you're here?

310
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,747
Can we talk inside?
Gosh, I'm so cold and hungry.

311
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,124
You're unbelievable.

312
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,086
-Let's talk inside.
-Okay.

313
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,485
I was such a great photographer
even back then.

314
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,070
Both of you look amazing in this photo.

315
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,905
Come here and eat this.

316
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,573
Okay!

317
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,951
Thank you.

318
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,840
It's so good.

319
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,719
First, tell me what happened.

320
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,430
Hold on. Let me have some kimchi first.

321
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,350
What? It's not Mom's kimchi.

322
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,769
Come on. Tell me.

323
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,896
Not much happened.

324
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,899
I had chased a guy for a while,

325
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,820
but he reported me
to the police as a stalker,

326
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,238
so I got a restraining order.

327
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,033
-You?
-Yes, me.

328
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,120
Stalking is considered a serious crime
in France.

329
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,498
I was afraid I'd keep
going there to see him.

330
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,917
So I thought, "I should go back to Korea

331
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,086
to avoid becoming a criminal."
That's why I'm here.

332
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,630
So, you actually stalked him?

333
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,051
I just asked him to marry me
a few times, and he overreacted.

334
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,720
Marry you?
Jae-in, have you lost your mind?

335
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,473
Love incapacitates your logical brain.

336
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,184
You call that love?
You're seriously crazy.

337
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,477
Love makes you crazy.

338
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,991
How's your relationship?

339
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,827
Not bad.

340
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,998
What?

341
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,213
This is delicious.

-Drive safely.
-Thank you. Take care.

351
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,999
-You're still up.
-Yes.

352
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,003
-What brings you here this late?
-I was in the area.

353
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,797
-Have you eaten?
-Yes, I have.

354
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,632
You'll sleep here, right?

355
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,552
I have to leave early in the morning,
so don't mind me and go to bed.

356
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,962
Daddy.

357
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,841
What are you doing here?

358
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,012
I came to see you
because I suddenly started missing you.

359
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,807
-Did you not miss me?
-I missed you.

360
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,561
Oh, boy! Gosh, you'll beat me soon.

361
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,066
-I'm stronger than you are.
-You are?

362
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:24,817
Really?

363
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,904
Why are you so strong?

364
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,492
Here's your ox bone soup.

365
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,417
-Enjoy.
-Hey.

366
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,587
I went ahead and ordered to save time.

367
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,506
Good call.

368
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,466
Why did you have to go there?

369
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,386
It's about the same thing
every single time.

370
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,889
"Transparent management"
of the foundation and so on.

371
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,564
So, how's the new department?

372
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,234
Well...

373
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,319
Not bad.

374
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,447
Some at the executive level
used to work in the evaluation team.

375
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,076
Start thinking about getting married.

376
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,206
It'd be nice to focus on work
with your wife's support.

377
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:28,172
Word has it that Assemblyman Jang
will be appointed Director of the FSS.

378
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,342
His youngest daughter

379
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,720
is so successful.

380
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,557
It's not easy to become a professor
at such a young age.

381
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,892
She's very impressive.

382
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,815
Cut out people that you don't need.

383
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,611
Jeong-in is a good girl.

384
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,574
She's not the only "good girl."

385
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,910
It's just not easy to find
the right one to marry.

386
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,372
Don't leave it to the last minute.

387
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,042
You should end it now.

388
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,254
I'll figure out what to do.

389
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,759
You'd better make the right decision.

390
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,312
I'll arrange something
with Assemblyman Jang's family.

391
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,355
Maybe later on.

392
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,193
I told you that I'll figure it out.

393
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,781
-I'll think hard about it.
-About what?

394
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,950
Well, it's about my marriage.
I need to do some thinking.

395
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:41,621
Marriage isn't some kids' role-play game.
It's a part of the business.

396
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,581
Just remember that.

400
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,245
Come in.

401
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,251
Mr. Kwon.

402
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,212
I'm just stopping by on my way back.
Have a seat.

403
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,675
-All right. Did you have to step out?
-Yes, to the Teachers' Pension Office.

404
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,844
And I saw Gi-seok too.

405
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,345
He works in that area, you know.

406
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,431
Right. Come to think of it,
I haven't seen him in quite a while.

407
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,183
Is he doing well?

408
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,644
-He's well.
-Good.

409
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,314
Gi-seok is a guy, so we're not in a rush,

410
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,483
but shouldn't you rush
your daughter a little?

411
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,694
Well, frankly...

412
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,363
We are getting anxious.

413
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,868
I think it's high time for us
to start discussing the topic.

414
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,036
Does she want to get married?

415
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,498
Yes, of course she does. They've been
together for a while, you know.

416
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,792
They must be quite attached to each other.

417
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,295
I don't think it's that serious.

418
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,797
I wouldn't say they're "attached."

419
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,802
Your eldest daughter married
a great guy. Jeong-in will do the same.

420
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,970
I heard she's a great catch.

421
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,347
Well, yes.

422
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,228
Let's go for lunch tomorrow
or the day after.

423
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,483
-Do you not want to?
-I do, of course.

424
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,361
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

425
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,304
WIFE

426
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,348
You don't know what it's about?

427
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,518
No, I'm not annoyed. Why does he
want me to come by out of the blue?

428
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,522
Mom, tell Seo-in to come as well
so that she can join us for the meal.

429
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,776
No, you do it. I'm busy now.

430
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,402
Okay, bye.

431
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,120
You look like you're going
to fight someone today.

432
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,414
Hey, you're going home
right after work, right?

433
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,042
Why? Shall I get booze ready
and wait for you again?

434
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,418
Get a lot of booze.

435
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,630
Gosh, I'm already scared.

436
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,132
I should stop by the pharmacy
and get something for my liver.

437
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,135
Do you go there often?

438
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,137
The pharmacy? Which one?

439
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,181
The one in your area, on your way home.

440
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,141
Right, there is a pharmacy.

441
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,144
You sound as if you're a regular there.

442
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,655
It was a slip of the tongue.

443
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,907
It didn't sound like that.

444
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,833
What do you want?

445
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,127
Did you run home to tell your mommy?

446
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,088
Your mother asked me to come over.

447
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,923
Then come.

448
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,051
And be dragged to hell with you?

449
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,138
Seo-in, what are you
trying to achieve by being cheeky?

450
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,015
You seem scared.

451
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,102
That smart brain of yours
must be on the fritz,

452
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,604
but you're the one
with everything to lose here.

453
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,691
-Whether you come or not is your choice.
-But...

454
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,614
What am I going to do with her cheeky ass?

455
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,214
-You're here.
-How could I not come when you asked?

456
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,091
You're the best. Why weren't you inside?

457
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,135
I had to take a call.

458
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,513
-What do you think Dad wants?
-Who knows?

459
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,308
Still, I can probably guess.

460
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,692
Just being with you girls only
makes me miss Jae-in more.

461
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,697
Seo-in, dig in already.

462
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,367
You seem gaunt on TV these days.

463
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,701
Are you on a diet again?

464
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,078
No.

465
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
Are you sick then?

466
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,749
We should see a doctor tomorrow.

467
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,502
Her husband's a doctor
and her in-laws own a hospital.

468
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,878
You're overstepping.

469
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,673
I'm not sick, Mom,
so please don't overstep.

470
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,344
Is your husband busy?
He hasn't been over lately.

471
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,262
He just started his night shifts.

472
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,515
I heard he couldn't make time.

473
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,268
He's back at 11 p.m. at the earliest
and I should be home by then.

474
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,895
Should I tell him to come?

475
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,775
So how's it going with Gi-seok?

476
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,237
It's pretty much the same.

477
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,364
So you'll just stick to dating him?

478
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,117
Maybe, or I could even end it. Who knows?

479
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,786
Are you kidding me?

480
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,996
Why date someone you'll break up with?

481
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,290
Should I call it quits then?

482
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,376
Why are you being this way?

483
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,378
Aren't you going to marry him?

484
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,922
Who knows what will happen?

485
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,260
What's going on?
Did you say something to her?

486
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,096
I threatened her to stay unmarried.

487
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,893
I don't care. Talk with Gi-seok
and set a date for this year.

488
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,191
Stalling will only
make you lose out in the end.

489
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,904
Seo-in, sorry about this.

490
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,491
I won't be pushed into it like her.

491
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,494
I want to weigh my options

492
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,122
and get married on my own terms
when I'm ready.

493
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,416
I don't know when it'll be though.

494
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,835
Pushed? By whom?

495
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:04,962
Seo-in, you tell me.

496
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,298
Did I force you into this marriage?

497
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,549
Did I?

498
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,218
Yes.

499
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,389
I'm not blaming you for it all.

500
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,808
It's partly my fault as well.

501
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,563
Are you two kidding me?

502
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,940
Is marriage a joke to you?

503
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,486
It seems to be to you.

504
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,404
I'm an adult, Dad.

505
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:34,283
Please respect my wishes
when it comes to my marriage.

506
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,303
I'm sorry.

507
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,934
It's true that your marriage
gave me clarity though.

508
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,895
I know.

509
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,689
Thanks for understanding.

510
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,781
There's something I want you
to understand too.

511
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,952
I'm...

512
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,621
getting a divorce.

513
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,707
Not any time soon,

514
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,001
but we're no longer living together.

515
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,549
Will you be all right though?

516
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,927
Rumors spread fast these days

517
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,887
and this will hurt your image.

518
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,432
That's been holding me back all this time.

519
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,936
The divorce...

520
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,188
Did Si-hoon agree to it?

521
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,359
I'll have to make sure that he does.

522
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,822
Are you all right?

523
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,283
Yes, for now at least.

524
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,036
Can I help in any way?

525
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,083
Just take my side when the time comes.

526
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,752
I've always been on your side.

527
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,131
Are you really all right though?

528
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,761
Call me whenever you need to.

529
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,805
I'll always be on standby.

530
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,558
-You know that, right?
-Of course.

531
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,856
We're all in such a mess.

532
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,111
Jae-in is at my house.

533
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,824
No news is never good news with her.

534
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,534
Tell me about it.

535
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,620
Let's get together soon.

536
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,496
Unbelievable.

537
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,166
Just so you know, we're in this together.

538
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,461
It must be a sister thing.

539
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,004
Goodness.

540
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,385
Seo-in, you've got this.

541
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,393
Thanks.

542
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,192
Unbelievable.

543
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,198
It's snowing!

544
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,785
If only I had a date tonight. Damn it.

545
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,704
-Why are you upset?
-Because it's snowing.

546
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,040
I'm not going home early
on a day like this.

547
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,585
-Is that a rule?
-When it's snowing, yes.

548
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,337
Good night then.

549
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,590
-Have you already made plans?
-I will on my way home.

550
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,550
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

551
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,347
You're here.

552
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,692
Why didn't you text me
your account number?

553
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,489
I asked you a question.

554
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,035
So I can see you one more time like this.

555
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,999
Can I get my change?

556
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,086
Have you had dinner?

557
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,547
If not, we could grab a bite with this.

558
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,052
I don't like eating with strangers.

559
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,309
What is it?

560
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,146
You memorized my number,

561
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,065
so how am I a stranger now?

562
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,404
I have good memory, that's all.

563
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,740
You're getting ahead of yourself

564
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,452
if you thought it meant something more.

565
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,912
It's not like we'll cross paths again.

566
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,500
Take care then.

567
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,850
So both your parents and his parents

568
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,978
are starting to talk about you guys
getting married?

569
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,147
I want to marry because I want to,

570
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,316
not because I'm at that age.

571
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,738
For you, logic always wins
but not when it comes to love.

572
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,949
Charming, aren't I?

573
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,535
That must be our chicken.

574
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,453
-I'll get it.
-Thank you.

575
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,595
How did you know I was here?

576
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,638
Did you follow me?

577
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,642
I don't need the change.

578
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,394
Up here.

579
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,732
Leave already!

580
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,442
I'll call the cops.

581
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,737
Thank you.

582
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,781
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

583
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,267
What took you so long?

584
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,770
It's nothing.

585
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,441
I can smell the chicken. Hurry up.

586
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:06,777
-I can't wait.
-Hey.

587
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,488
Do you know your neighbor upstairs?

588
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:10,739
In which unit?

589
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,491
The one above.

590
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,162
A woman around my age
and a married couple.

591
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,830
A married couple?

592
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,584
Or they could just be living together.

593
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,503
And...

594
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,383
I don't know.
I don't cross paths with them.

595
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,177
And I only moved here recently.

596
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:34,930
Why do you ask?

597
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,015
I just saw someone heading upstairs.

598
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,394
It was a young guy.

599
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,979
Not bad looking.

600
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,273
How handsome is he?

601
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,526
I only got a glimpse of him.

602
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,030
Have you seen the guy
who lives with his girlfriend

603
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,782
in the unit above?

604
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,202
Was he that handsome?

605
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,371
Do you want me to go and check?

606
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,210
You know,

607
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,672
being curious about someone
is an important sign.

608
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,675
Your mind keeps wandering back to him.

609
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,969
It means you're interested.

610
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,345
If you weren't,

611
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,889
you wouldn't care about his whereabouts.

612
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,685
Just know this though.

613
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,107
That qualifies as cheating too.

614
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,359
LEE JEONG-IN

615
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,612
I apologize for the misunderstanding.

616
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,383
Get in.

617
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,179
-Go back in. It's cold. See you!
-Bye.

618
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,588
It's snowing heavily.
Have a safe trip home.

619
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,188
Thank you for the concern.

620
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,910
The next time it snows,

621
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,371
we should meet outside the pharmacy.

622
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,539
We?

623
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,873
WOORI PHARMACY

624
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,721
You didn't have to run.

625
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:47,140
You must be cold.

626
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,270
This is probably the best place.

627
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,274
It won't take long.
I just have something to say.

628
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,318
But it's cold out here.

629
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,155
Security deactivated.

630
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:11,331
Please have a seat.

631
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,240
Thank you.

632
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,250
I should have stuck to texting.

633
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,377
I feel like this is a mistake.

634
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,546
I have something to say too,

635
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,840
Jeong-in.

636
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,342
I have a boyfriend
who I'm planning to marry.

637
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:05,427
I have a kid.

638
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:13,810
You're married?

639
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,190
Then so what?

640
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,197
It doesn't make you
less decent or anything.

641
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,913
Is that what you wanted to say?

642
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,457
Of course not.

643
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,835
Well, I guess I would have told you that
at some point.

644
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,134
What I actually wanted to say is this.

645
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,721
I've been curious

646
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,641
about what kind of person you are.

647
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,811
I have been thinking about you
since I first saw you here.

648
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,484
I even thought of the possibility
of you being taken.

649
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,779
Still, just once...

650
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,990
Just once more...

651
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:12,118
Well, it led me here today.

652
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,915
It wasn't my intention,

653
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,252
but I did make it confusing for you.

654
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,256
-I apologize.
-Why would you?

655
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,218
It didn't last long, but I was happy.

656
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,477
That's probably burdening to hear.
Forget I said it.

657
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,230
As if that's possible.

658
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,907
I must have put you in a tough spot.

659
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,743
Not really.

660
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,833
Anyway,

661
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,085
let's be friends.

662
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,257
You don't meet people like this every day,

663
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,093
so we can be acquaintances from now on.

664
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,687
I'm sorry,

665
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,860
but I won't be comfortable with that.

666
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,509
Come on, let's go.

667
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,346
I've been cooped up inside
ever since I got back to Korea.

668
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,348
You're the one who secretly came back.

669
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,852
But I'm bored, Jeong-in.

670
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:51,522
It's my day off and I'd rather rest.

671
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,485
Your boyfriend will treat me
to a welcome back dinner anyway.

672
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,029
You've gotten more shameless.

673
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,490
Besides, why would we go there?

674
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:01,991
For fun.

675
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,244
Fun is something you find,
not wait around for.

676
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,790
Just don't tell people
that you're my sister.

677
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,339
Are you really not going?

678
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,257
I'm not.

679
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,885
I'm holding you to that.

680
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,056
Wait, it's snowing.

681
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,476
It was sunny this morning though.

682
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,188
It'll be the last snow this winter.

683
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,317
I should find someone to hang out with

684
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,237
since you're not interested.

685
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,699
Let's go out.

686
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,576
Just like that?

687
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,662
Why the sudden change of heart?

688
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:48,996
What is it?

689
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,255
-Jae-in.
-Yes?

690
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,217
What is it?

691
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,011
Can you hang out with a friend?

692
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,848
Hold on. Seriously?

693
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,308
Are you ditching me? For whom?

694
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,644
Well, suddenly...

695
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,940
Forget it. It's nothing.

696
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,734
Here comes a taxi.

697
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,708
You sure are fearless.
This is Dad's school you're at.

698
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,209
If you're caught, he'll kill me too.

699
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,044
But it's a Sunday. Come on.

700
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,339
Hey. Behave and
don't run your mouth, all right?

701
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,508
Are you Mom? Goodness.

702
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,473
Jeong-in, let's go over there.
There are no seats here.

703
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,700
Jeong-in,

704
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,787
isn't that Gi-seok?

705
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,628
-Come on.
-Pass.

706
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,256
-Shoot.
-Nice.

707
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,887
-Okay.
-Here we go!

708
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,680
Take your positions.

709
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:32,308
Stop him.

710
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,976
Get him!

711
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,187
All right, nice!

712
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,273
Keep it up!

713
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,609
Defense!

714
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,251
Watch it. Referee!

715
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,432
Defense!

716
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,092
-Hi.
-Gosh, it's been a while.

717
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,637
You look happy and well.

718
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,014
I was born to live in the wild.

719
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,682
You're quite good at basketball.

720
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,310
I haven't shown all of my skills yet.

721
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,279
I find him attractive.
Isn't he attractive?

722
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:53,282
You said you'll start dating again,
didn't you? Don't be so sheepish.

723
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,493
Both sisters are gorgeous.

724
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,495
I think Jeong-in is the prettiest one.

725
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:58,996
Take care of Jeong-in instead.

726
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,790
She's very opinionated.

727
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,625
It's probably about us getting married.

728
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,251
Is it marriage you hate, or just me?

729
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:07,046
They say most get cold feet
when the idea is presented.

730
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,756
But your reaction is more than that.

731
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,342
Gi-seok, I think we need a break.

732
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:12,885
I want to tell you to be selfish.

733
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,845
You have the right to live a happy life.

734
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,931
This is top secret.
Actually, he has a kid.

735
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,724
If I had known,
I would've been nicer to him.

736
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,644
Everything else is fine.
Who cares if he's a single dad?

737
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,437
How is that fine?
What woman would like that?

738
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:26,315
I've moved on,
so you don't have to worry so much.

739
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,942
We can be friends then.

740
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,777
What would your boyfriend say?

741
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,445
Let's give it a shot.

742
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,698
Let's be friends.

743
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,328
