EPISODE 12

2
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,685
Come on in.

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,230
I brought some tea.

4
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,776
Thank you. Could you brew some for us?

5
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,237
Over here.

6
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:13,740
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

7
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,457
I know the request was out of the blue,
so I appreciate you agreeing to it.

8
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,002
There's no need to feel that way.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,296
I'm just sorry if asking you here
was an inconvenience.

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,547
Not at all.

11
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,094
To see you here

12
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,223
makes me wish again
that I had met you sooner.

13
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,269
Please don't worry about that.
It's all in the past.

14
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,275
The past? Is that how it'll be?

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:56,407
I still feel the same way as I did before.

16
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:02,956
I'm not one to be taken aback that easily,

17
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,500
but you always manage to do so.

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,089
Why did you want to see me today then?

19
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,177
I was hoping you'd disapprove
of me even stronger.

20
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,643
Your cab will be here soon.

21
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:27,147
My cab? That's not what's important here.

22
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,400
Your marriage.
Keep your eyes on the prize.

23
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,444
Aren't the stars aligning?

24
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,406
It's not just me who's fond of you.

25
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,910
Your father is quite satisfied
with my daughter, too.

26
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,622
Could it be any better?

27
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,083
-Gi-seok.
-Yes.

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,836
-Gi-seok.
-Yes, sir.

29
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,381
You have always been my second son-in-law.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,800
I knew it since
the first time I saw you.

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,636
Thank you.

32
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,182
I'm the one who's grateful.

33
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,310
How can I not be
when I'm gaining a son-in-law like you?

34
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,272
Don't you worry about a thing.

35
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,816
I'll clear the path for you.

36
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,613
So in other words,

37
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,284
it's to make your father give up.

38
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,997
My father can't seem
to give up on Gi-seok.

39
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,919
My parents' opinions do matter,

40
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,007
but what I want should come first
when it comes to my personal life.

41
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,845
That's why I came here
despite it being disrespectful.

42
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,472
I see no disrespect.

43
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,933
Humans are all selfish beings anyway.

44
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,187
In that case though,

45
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,983
I can't let someone
purposely break my son's heart.

46
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:02,367
There is no future for me and Gi-seok.
I don't want there to be one.

47
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,121
Because there's someone else?

48
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,710
I won't hold it against you.

49
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,841
Still,
you never know what'll happen, right?

50
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,886
I advise you
not to make any rash decisions.

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,350
I don't care about the frivolous things

52
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,061
and am a man of patience.

53
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,064
That's why
I fully understand your position

54
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,693
and can give you all the time you need.

55
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,783
You know that I no longer
have feelings for Gi-seok.

56
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,369
No one's sure of their feelings.

57
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,538
They can always change.

58
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,833
I may be like this now, but who knows?

59
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,335
Just like you said earlier,

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,380
I might disapprove of you even stronger.

61
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,974
I'm too exhausted,
so I'll be hitting the sack.

62
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,518
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

63
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:25,653
My gosh.

64
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,408
What brings you by?

65
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,828
Your father wanted me to deliver this.

66
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,372
What is it?

67
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,000
It's not like I'd know.

68
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,169
Anyway, I'll see you around.

69
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,962
Sure.

70
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,881
Take care.

71
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,590
What would you like for lunch?

72
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,926
Didn't anyone call?

73
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,179
I didn't hear a ring.
Should I get your phone?

74
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,766
It's fine.
As for lunch, let's keep it light.

75
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
Yes, sir.

76
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,872
-Here.
-Right.

77
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,626
Did Jeong-in say anything?

78
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,795
Didn't Gi-seok meet her father?

79
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,922
Is it already over between you two?

80
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,632
Give me back my shoes.

81
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,717
I'm off.

82
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,427
-Don't miss it next week.
-See you.

83
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,595
-Right.
-Bye.

84
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,370
Hi, Ji-ho.

85
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,581
Did I wake you?

86
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
No.

87
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,501
What were you up to?

88
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,587
Thinking about causing trouble.

89
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,964
You already did that yesterday.

90
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,968
So you really did.

91
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,845
Where were you yesterday?

92
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,890
I'd rather not say.

93
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,102
Then don't.

94
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,481
I'm not trying
to keep it a secret or anything.

95
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,401
It'll do no one good,

96
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,736
so I don't want to say it.

97
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,698
Got it.

98
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,411
You're at it again.

99
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,788
Only you seem mature.

100
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,499
Even though I try not to be,

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,669
I keep getting anxious
because I'm too impatient.

102
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,213
Maybe I haven't given you certainty.

103
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,801
Would you like to meet my parents?

104
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,930
If only I could see your reaction.

105
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,684
I'm unfazed.

106
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,063
As if.

107
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,151
What if they're not fond of me?

108
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,571
Then we'll have to break up.

109
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,907
-Hey!
-"Hey"?

110
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,453
You know I didn't mean it like that.

111
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,373
I meant it in an endearing way.

112
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,377
You and your excuses.

113
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,380
I'm really worried, though.

114
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,301
My parents are nice people

115
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,012
and will know that you are, too.

116
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,765
I'm jealous of you.

117
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,896
Looking at you, I can tell
that your parents are nice people, too.

118
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,482
But you already met my dad.

119
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,653
All parents get greedy
when it comes to their kids.

120
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,739
I somewhat understand
where he's coming from.

121
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:42,076
I hear that Jae-in gave you advice.

122
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,329
I've already been bracing myself.

123
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,583
Besides, I'm too happy right now

124
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,044
to rush into anything in a hurry.

125
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,756
I even think that

126
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,758
this is more than enough.

127
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,469
Not me.

128
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,266
I want you badly.

129
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,773
What a sweet life.

130
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,866
Why didn't you call in advance?

131
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,826
-Have a seat.
-Right.

132
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,206
-Where's Seo-in?
-She's home.

133
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,083
Why didn't you come together?

134
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,835
Well...

135
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,299
Honey, we have a guest,
so don't just stand there.

136
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,633
Get him something to drink.

137
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,136
What do you want? What do you need?

138
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,345
It's fine, Mother.

139
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,014
What...

140
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,976
Unbelievable.

141
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,483
Si-hoon, what are you doing?

142
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,318
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,820
It's all my fault.

144
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,530
What do you mean?

145
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,366
Honey, why is he acting this way?

146
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,369
-Honey, actually--
-I won't divorce Seo-in.

147
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,164
A divorce?

148
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,125
All I wanted was to give her a good life,

149
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,628
but it didn't go as I wanted.

150
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,130
That's why I acted like a complete fool.

151
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,052
I must've been stressed out
about moving the clinic.

152
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,763
I wasn't as attentive as I could be

153
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,016
-and lashed out at her for no reason.
-Excuse me.

154
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,144
Did I hear you correctly?
Is that all you did?

155
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,146
So?

156
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,565
Is she now demanding a divorce?

157
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,151
-Honey, listen to me--
-I was wasted that day.

158
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,779
The argument got heated,
and I ended up hitting her.

159
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,657
You hit her?

160
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,117
I really shouldn't have, but I did.

161
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,120
I was completely wasted that day.

162
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,956
Father, Mother,

163
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,834
please forgive me this once.

164
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,882
I won't complain

165
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,387
even if you decide
to beat me to a pulp right now,

166
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,222
so please stop this divorce.

167
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,766
I can't live without Seo-in.

168
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,436
I...

169
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,856
I'll stay by her side

170
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,193
and not mistreat her ever again,

171
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,361
so, please...

172
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,615
So please help me this once.

173
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,660
I can't live without her. Please.

174
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,335
Father, please forgive me.
I'm truly sorry.

175
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,421
Stand up.

176
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,757
Stand up!

177
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,345
Lead the way.

178
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,974
-Head home.
-Why would you go there?

179
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,684
A divorce is just absurd!

180
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,278
What?

181
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,947
You're annoying, that's why.

182
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,117
Is that something to say
to a friend who came by on a day off?

183
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,453
Don't you think I know
you're just stopping by

184
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,080
even though you want to head up
straight to the third floor?

185
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,207
Nothing gets past you.

186
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,084
Aren't I decent, though?

187
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,544
I'm meeting him tonight,

188
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,129
but I came by to see you early.

189
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,049
-Why are you outside though?
-There's nothing to eat.

190
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,593
I figured we could
grab something to eat outside.

191
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,094
I see. I'll buy then.

192
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,180
Of course, you should. Thanks in advance.

193
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,767
Ms. Lee!

194
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,644
Hi, Eun-u.

195
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,396
Have you been well?

196
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,693
How do you know Eun-u?

197
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,282
It's nice to meet you. I'm Lee Jeong-in.

198
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,159
I see.

199
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,578
Well,

200
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,124
-Ji-ho and I--
-The library...

201
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,876
Yes, that's right.

202
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,129
I'm a librarian.

203
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,089
I see.

204
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,966
Well, what brings you here...

205
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,510
I'm her friend,

206
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,304
and I coincidentally happen to live
on the second floor.

207
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,597
I see.

208
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,641
Grandma, let's go.

209
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,103
Bye then.

210
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,271
Bye.

211
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,040
There you go.

212
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,042
-I'll take that.
-Sure.

213
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,967
Why isn't Ms. Lee coming?

214
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,803
Why do you suddenly ask?

215
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,763
We ran into her outside.

216
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
She's a librarian, so I hear.

217
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,896
Did you see her? Did you meet Ms. Lee?

218
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,528
"Eun-u, have you been well?"
That's what she said.

219
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,031
Even I was surprised.

220
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,241
Who knew that I'd meet her here?

221
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,494
Her friend lives downstairs.

222
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,414
I heard that, too.
She said it's a coincidence.

223
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,876
It is. Even I was surprised
when I found out.

224
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,173
-Mom.
-I didn't say anything,

225
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,426
so stop acting like
you got caught doing something bad.

226
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,471
I was going to introduce her to you.

227
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,640
-What did you think of her?
-The meeting was brief.

228
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,350
Still.

229
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,937
Maybe it was too brief,

230
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,025
but she did seem smart and meticulous.
She's pretty, too.

231
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, I should sort these out.

232
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,413
Gosh, I look depressing today.

233
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,624
I should've put on some makeup.

234
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,877
There's only so much makeup can do
to hide our flaws at our age.

235
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,758
I'm thinking that I should move.

236
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,427
I'm done getting caught up
in your messes.

237
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,097
I wouldn't have met Ji-ho
if you hadn't lived there.

238
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,225
Are you going to blame me
if things go wrong?

239
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,851
I'm saying you'll be rewarded someday.

240
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,524
What do you think
Ji-ho's mom thought of me?

241
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,359
Did I come off rude?

242
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,196
What's on your mind, though?
Are you even thinking at all?

243
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,531
What now?

244
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,616
That boy...

245
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,202
Eun-u, was it?

246
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,746
Are you sure you can be a mother?

247
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,792
This again?
I'm not saying it'll happen soon.

248
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,922
Are you just dating Ji-ho then?
Are you keeping your options open?

249
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,886
Do you also believe that
feelings always change?

250
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,888
Well...

251
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,099
You're living proof of it.

252
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,351
Why did you break up with Gi-seok?

253
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,770
-Here's your dish.
-Thank you.

254
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,195
You can add in some sauce if you like.

255
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,738
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

256
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,205
A person never changes.

257
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,709
Feelings can shift depending
on the moment,

258
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,460
but not human nature.

259
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,510
It's Gi-seok.

260
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,387
See?

261
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,056
People never change. They never do.

262
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,146
What?

263
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,024
I'd like to talk. Are you at the library?

264
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,069
I'll go to where you are.

265
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,324
I want to talk.

266
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,579
Then I'll wait at your house
until you come home.

267
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,714
Married life doesn't always go as planned.

268
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,384
How can you call it a marriage
when you bring up divorce all the time?

269
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,889
Being patient and understanding
is how you mature as a couple.

270
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,475
You can't act on your feelings
every single time.

271
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,438
Your mom and I also
endured all the difficulties

272
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,648
and that's how we got here.

273
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:42,199
What should I do?
Should I beat him up in front of you?

274
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,161
Will you forgive him then?

275
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,625
I knew how this would affect my life,
but I still made this decision.

276
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,878
Do not think that it was out of anger.

277
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,339
I never said it was a rash decision.

278
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,468
I'd love nothing more
than to beat the daylights out of him.

279
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,222
I don't care if you were drunk.

280
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,058
How could you make such a mistake?

281
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,520
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,733
Did he tell you
that it was a drunken mistake?

283
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
Of course, it was a mistake.

284
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,407
He wouldn't have done it on purpose.
You're unbelievable.

285
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,497
Say what you want.

286
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm getting a divorce.

287
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,584
Sure. Divorce is the easy route.

288
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,130
However, you're not like most couples.

289
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,551
Especially you can kiss
your good girl image goodbye.

290
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,928
Must I say that myself?

291
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,140
Forgive him this once.

292
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,519
After you get back on track,
you might get pregnant and--

293
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,603
I'm already pregnant.

294
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,361
I'm pregnant,
which is why I must divorce him.

295
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,365
I can't raise this baby
with him in the picture.

296
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,576
-Seo-in...
-You listen to me.

297
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,330
This is my baby.
It has nothing to do with you.

298
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,374
-Honey.
-Seo-in,

299
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,211
you should've told us about this sooner.

300
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,088
Divorce isn't an option in this situation.

301
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,381
My goodness.

302
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,176
How can you be this immature and reckless?

303
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,886
Your daughter was assaulted!

304
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:27,888
How can you be this way?

305
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,641
Aren't you hurt by this at all?

306
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,978
Shouldn't your heart be ripped
into pieces?

307
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,440
How can you be so cruel?

308
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,402
What have I done that is so wrong?

309
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,864
How much more must I endure
for you to understand me?

310
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,699
Seo-in, please.

311
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,409
Mom, I...

312
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,536
It's all right.

313
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,940
I mostly...

314
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,025
want to apologize to you.

315
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,113
Just look at your father.

316
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,242
I'm the one who should apologize to you.

317
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,080
It wasn't like I got my hopes up.

318
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,791
Still, how could he...

319
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,548
How could I have lived
with a man like that all these years?

320
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,676
It's pathetic.

321
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,387
It's humiliating.

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,660
I'd like to talk to Seo-in for a moment.

323
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,412
About what?

324
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,081
Shouldn't you be too mortified
to even open your mouth?

325
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,710
Mom, leave it.

326
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,881
It's all right.

327
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,871
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,457
It's all my fault.

329
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,292
I'm a bastard.

330
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:09,007
I'll devote my life to you and our baby
for the rest of my life.

331
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,550
So please forgive me this once.

332
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,221
You think you hit the jackpot, don't you?

333
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,723
I'm pregnant now,

334
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,850
so you think I'm out of options.

335
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,311
Seo-in, please.

336
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,068
I'll file for divorce right away.
I have enough evidence.

337
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,990
It won't just ruin me, though.

338
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,495
Revealing that you're a son of a bitch

339
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,498
will also let people know

340
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,584
that I'm a pathetic woman
who only married for money.

341
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,464
Just this once.

342
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,217
Can't you overlook it just this once?

343
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,302
This won't happen again. I promise.

344
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:58,974
If I ever hurt you in any way again,

345
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,017
be it even a single word,

346
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,145
I'll be the first to suggest
that we get a divorce.

347
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,814
I'll leave you be.

348
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,024
Please?

349
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,985
Give up your paternal rights.

350
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,529
Then I won't press assault charges.

351
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,450
Either that or live
as an ex-con your whole life.

352
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,956
I already asked you this,

353
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,334
but must you go this far?

354
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,670
Thank the baby for my leniency.

355
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,855
Then I choose to be an ex-con.

356
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,319
How can I give up my paternal rights?

357
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,697
I am the father, after all.

358
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,975
Is he already asleep?

359
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,227
Well, it's past his nap time.

360
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,146
It's okay. I'll do it later.

361
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,939
Don't let the laundry pile up.

362
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,692
It's quite warm these days,
so it'll stink quickly.

363
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,238
I guess you liked Jeong-in.

364
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,286
I just don't want your place to stink.

365
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,747
Where's that coming from?

366
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,125
Goodness.

367
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,091
I'll be right back.

368
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,258
What?

369
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,696
I didn't expect you here.

370
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,657
I ran into your mother.

371
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,659
I heard.

372
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,453
What did she say?
Did she say anything about me?

373
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,873
-She said you're pretty.
-Be honest.

374
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,960
Actually, she said you're ugly.

375
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,839
-Goodness, you actually look ugly now.
-What?

376
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,050
-Do you like that I'm ugly?
-You're a hard puncher.

377
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,262
Good for you. You have an ugly girlfriend.

378
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,472
-Go away.
-That tickles.

379
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,933
That really tickles.

380
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,144
-Why you!
-Okay, fine.

381
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,985
You were aiming for a headbutt,
weren't you?

382
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,696
You're much taller,
so I have to jump this much.

383
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,710
I said it's fine.

384
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,300
How can you be fine with it?

385
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,968
You should be upset.

386
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
I would be upset if you hid it

387
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,973
or met him but lied to me about it.

388
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,518
Also, seeing that your father hasn't
said much even after meeting Gi-seok,

389
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,145
I'm thinking he probably tried his best.

390
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,733
He may still not deserve a compliment,
but you can at least listen.

391
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,988
In the past, you talked as if
you'd never see Gi-seok again.

392
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,532
This I can let go.

393
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,285
Now, you're all lenient.

394
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,621
Are you just incredibly patient?

395
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,748
Or are you full of confidence?

396
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,334
I trust you. That's all.

397
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,421
They say that feelings change.

398
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,799
And I've experienced that.

399
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,344
It didn't happen because you met me.

400
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,388
Now, you're being arrogant.

401
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,016
Everyone needs this kind of arrogance.

402
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,314
-What was that about?
-Nothing.

403
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,170
Why did you bring me here?

404
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,382
It's been so long, hasn't it?

405
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,177
Are we meeting your father?

406
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,138
Or my dad?

407
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,810
I didn't think of that.

408
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,897
Let's get out.

409
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,605
This is where we first met.

410
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,483
You remember, right?

411
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,953
You were with your father.
The moment I saw you,

412
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,082
I was totally smitten by you.

413
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,129
I hesitated for a few days,

414
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,424
then pestered him to introduce me to you.

415
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,928
That was already four years ago.

416
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,605
I know I took too long.

417
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,706
It's what you think it is.

418
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,543
Let's get married.

419
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,133
What you think doesn't matter.

420
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,637
I'm choosing this for your sake.

421
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,309
There you go. Done!

422
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,838
I saw the girl Ji-ho told us about.

423
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,007
-Where?
-In front of his place.

424
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,093
Her friend lives in the same building.

425
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,181
They were already holding hands.

426
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,267
He seemed so happy to see her.

427
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,147
I didn't know my son
could look that happy and excited.

428
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,526
-She's pretty, isn't she?
-Yes, she is.

429
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,490
Wait, how do you know?

430
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,785
All women are pretty when they're young.

431
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,455
You were absolutely gorgeous
back in the day. Eun-u!

432
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,707
Let's have some fruit.

433
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,460
Go tell your dad to join us.

434
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,653
Why are you sulking?

435
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,657
Even just hearing about
a complete stranger

436
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,618
going through what Seo-in experienced

437
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,121
should make you shake with rage.

438
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,916
Do you realize
how much you disappointed me today?

439
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,419
How could you be so despicable?

440
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,879
Give me a break.

441
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,131
She's pregnant with his child.

442
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,008
Should I have encouraged her
to get a divorce?

443
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,720
You went there to tell her
that divorce is simply not an option.

444
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,598
Your daughter was hit by her husband.

445
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,810
She's a victim of domestic violence,

446
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,729
but you want her to bury it

447
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,523
because you don't want people to find out.
I can read you like a book.

448
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,318
Divorce is nothing to be ashamed of.

449
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,822
You should be ashamed
that you're a shallow-minded father

450
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,824
who's more concerned
with what other people think.

451
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,168
Let's hurry Jeong-in's wedding.

452
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,005
Who knows what will happen with Seo-in?

453
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,176
No family would want a daughter-in-law
with a divorced sister.

454
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,929
We should marry her off
before that happens.

455
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
Hey.

456
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,808
Lee Tae-hak.

457
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,270
Do you even have a heart?

458
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,157
Why did you even receive this?

459
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,828
He said I can keep it or throw it out

460
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,914
because he bought it for me.

461
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,833
And you fell for that old-school trick?

462
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,253
You should've thrown it in his face.

463
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,964
I obviously thought of doing that.

464
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,928
But it's not like we're enemies.
There's no reason to be that mean to him.

465
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,015
Do you still have feelings left
for Gi-seok?

466
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,064
It just felt so futile.

467
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,609
I was surprised to realize

468
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,071
that I already have
no feelings left at all for him.

469
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,325
Today, I didn't even get angry with him.

470
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,707
I was surprised by
how cunning my mind can be.

471
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,587
Good morning.

472
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,631
Jeong-in's sister is pregnant.

473
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,468
Look, it says...

474
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,095
What are you guys reading?

475
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,015
-Hey.
-Congratulations. You're an aunt now.

476
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,315
Jeong-in.

477
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,650
Hello!

478
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,110
Did she not know about it?

479
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,613
I'm sure she knew.
She and her sister are like best friends.

480
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,533
But she seems so surprised.

481
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,039
-Hi.
-Hi.

482
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,251
-Did you read the article?
-What article?

483
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,046
Lee Seo-in is Jeong-in's sister, right?

484
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,881
She quit her job because she's pregnant.

485
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,633
-Really?
-I guess you didn't know.

486
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,679
Her family will be over the moon
when Jeong-in gets married on top of that.

487
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,099
Are you happy just hearing it?

488
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,143
Yes, I am.

489
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,188
I know exactly what you'll turn into.

490
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,231
An extremely devoted husband.

491
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,422
A colleague of mine just told me.

492
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,341
Gi-seok proposed to her.

493
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,093
Are you sure?

494
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:52,556
Well...
Initially, I didn't believe it at all.

495
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:58,354
But Gi-seok is smiling from ear to ear,

496
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:04,068
almost as if he's getting married
the day after tomorrow or something.

497
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,368
He must be bragging

498
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,371
because it went well.

499
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
Wait, so what does this mean?

500
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,543
Is she dumping you, then?

501
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,212
Let's talk later.

502
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:24,922
Hey.

503
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,392
Mr. Yu.

504
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,310
What? Yes.

505
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,689
-Are you feeling sick?
-No.

506
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:04,211
There are too many overlaps
in the part about the review process.

507
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,422
See the check marks?

508
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,507
Revise these parts.

509
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,970
And overall, it's too long.
It'll take up the entire meeting.

510
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:14,763
I'll fix it.

511
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,771
Hey, did you pass on the news to Ji-ho?

512
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:24,982
What do you mean?

513
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,078
-Congratulations.
-Why didn't you tell us?

514
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,499
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

515
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,418
Thank you. Well, I'm not sure
if I should be saying that.

516
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,505
-I'm so sad that you're leaving.
-I know, I'm sad, too.

517
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,090
Breaking news. Dr. Nam's wife is pregnant.

518
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,926
What will happen to him now?

519
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,179
Who knows? Last time, his mother-in-law
looked as if she wanted to kill him.

520
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,305
What's this now?

521
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,683
Gosh, cut it out.

522
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,352
Good morning.

523
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,396
By the way, what do men do these days
when their wives are pregnant?

524
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,691
I'm old now, so I don't even know
what I should be doing.

525
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,610
Tell me.

526
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,278
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you. You too.

527
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,446
-Have a nice day.
-Bye.

528
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,411
What's the matter with you?

529
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,664
Nothing.

530
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,460
Don't give me that.
Something's clearly bothering you.

531
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,303
See? I told you.

532
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,057
I don't think he's sick, though.

533
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,269
-Then maybe it's heartache.
-What?

534
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,647
You're too hard-hearted.

535
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,773
What the...

536
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,215
Hello?

537
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,426
Can we meet?

538
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,513
I don't care even if it's late.

539
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,932
I'll go to wherever works best for you.

540
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,436
What is this about?

541
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,146
You already know.

542
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,401
What do you want to do?

543
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,072
I don't think I can meet today.

544
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,241
I'll let you know.

545
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't tell me you're avoiding me.

546
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,169
Sure, let's meet today.

547
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:52,963
What is this?

548
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,007
Is Si-hoon moving back in?

549
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,925
No, it's mine.

550
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,261
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

551
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,641
You won't try
to talk Seo-in out of it, right?

552
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,893
She can't live with Si-hoon.

553
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,522
Are you that excited about
your sister getting a divorce?

554
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:11,607
You think I'm excited?

555
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,070
Living with someone who has a completely
different mindset is no better than death.

556
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,657
I'm going to get a divorce.

557
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:22,618
I'm talking about Seo-in, not you.

558
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,453
I've decided to divorce your dad.

559
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,039
What?

560
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,001
-Is Dad having an affair?
-Hey.

561
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,504
Then what's the problem?

562
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,507
You've been putting up with him
all these years. Why now?

563
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,552
You said one shouldn't live with someone
who has a completely different mindset.

564
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,181
Hey, get me another glass of water.
With ice cubes.

565
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,018
-Is divorce the latest trend?
-Go get me some water!

566
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,648
By the way, Mom...

567
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,317
If you and Dad get a divorce,

568
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,403
whom should I choose?

569
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,863
Don't say such silly things!

570
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,871
Whether Seo-in gets a divorce or I do,

571
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,499
you and Jeong-in shouldn't say anything
for now.

572
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,251
Okay?

573
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
Yes, I heard you.

574
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,806
The total number of freshmen
will continue to go down every year.

575
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,058
So we'll utilize empty classrooms?

576
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:33,439
Yes. I gathered some ideas
and came up with that solution to prepare

577
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,482
for what may happen in the near future.

578
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,903
I appreciate that you're still working
so hard when you'll be retiring soon.

579
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,741
I'll go through this.
You should get back to your office.

580
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,867
Okay.

581
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,619
By the way,
I met up with Gi-seok the other day.

582
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,620
Did he tell you?

583
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,835
Why don't we let them get married
when they want to do it?

584
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,713
Why are you changing your mind?

585
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,549
Did Jeong-in irk you again in any way?

586
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,802
You're hurting my feelings here.

587
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,183
Have you ever seen me going back
on my word after making a decision?

588
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,559
Did you think I was like that?

589
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,604
Gosh, of course not.

590
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,733
Then why are you talking such nonsense?

591
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,612
All children are like that.

592
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,198
Whenever they're told by their parents

593
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,033
to do something, they do the opposite.

594
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,037
If we keep pressuring them,

595
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:33,916
they may decide to go against us.
I'm just worried. That's all.

596
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,295
Right.

597
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,632
Children are like that, indeed.

598
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,426
I heard you'll be a grandfather soon.

599
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,345
Just enjoy that for now.

600
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,057
I have to head out now.

601
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,232
Well, Mr. Kwon.

602
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,277
Since it's been brought up anyway,
we should keep the momentum going.

603
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,781
Pressuring them is no way to do that.

604
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,075
Well, what I mean is...

605
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:12,079
I'm just concerned that it may drag out
indefinitely if we leave it up to them.

606
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,164
Then maybe they're not meant to be.

607
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,626
Anyway, that's what I think,

608
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,629
so you make your own judgment.
Take it easy.

609
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,749
Are you super busy today?

610
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,328
-One iced Americano, please.
-For here?

611
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,121
Would that be all?

612
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,030
Ji-ho found out about
Gi-seok proposing to you.

613
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,740
Yeong-jae told me.

614
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,092
Yeong-jae is mad at me for telling you.

615
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,679
-What?
-Talk to her.

616
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,266
Jeong-in, he doesn't want to talk to you
because he thinks you're obnoxious.

617
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,018
No, I never said that. Yes.

618
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,396
I can't get a hold of Ji-ho.

619
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,982
Did he tell you that he's meeting up
with Gi-seok?

620
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:50,070
Yes, I called him earlier to ask him
if he wants to grab dinner together.

621
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,365
By any chance, did he tell you
where they're meeting?

622
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,201
No, I didn't ask.

623
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,830
Jeong-in, the thing is...

624
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,542
It may not be my place to say this,

625
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,046
but Ji-ho is such a tough cookie.

626
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,757
Yeong-jae.

627
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,388
I'm sorry. I'm not exactly sure
what you mean by that.

628
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,099
I'm sure you've figured out
this much about Ji-ho by now,

629
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,895
but you can definitely trust him.
He'll never let you down.

630
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:28,650
He has such a strong sense
of responsibility.

631
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,694
I get what you're trying to say.

632
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,487
That was random, wasn't it?

633
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,908
I guess I wanted to brag about my buddy.

634
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:38,952
That was sweet of you.

635
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,038
I'll remember that.

636
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,127
Your cappuccino is ready.

637
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:59,389
Hyeon-su that blabbermouth
probably told you what happened.

638
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,641
What more do you want to know?

639
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,649
How much more
will you make it hard for Jeong-in?

640
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,653
You're an obnoxious prick.

641
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,447
Shall I provoke you more?

642
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,493
Including Jeong-in's and my parents,

643
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,121
I plan on telling everyone around us.

644
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,584
You're one gutsy guy.

645
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,088
And you're too much of a coward.

646
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,924
What do you even know about me?

647
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,009
I know this one thing for sure.

648
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,804
You're doing this

649
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,307
not because you want Jeong-in,
but because you can't lose to me.

650
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,310
What do you gain from beating me?

651
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,688
Like you said,

652
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:53,026
I'm a mediocre man who's nothing special.

653
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:58,156
And that's why you're the first to know
that I plan on telling our families.

654
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,788
Wouldn't you be embarrassed that you tried
to compete against me?

655
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,461
You seem to firmly believe that
her family will accept you with open arms.

656
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:15,132
Doesn't the fact that
Jeong-in accepted me matter more?

657
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,261
Gi-seok.

658
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,767
Don't think of this as a word of advice
from some mediocre dude.

659
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:30,939
Keeping this up will make both
of us look childish.

660
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:33,942
Just stop it already.

661
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,697
I will when you do.

662
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,952
Why tell me to do something
that you can't do yourself?

663
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,166
You plan on telling her parents? Go ahead.

664
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,211
I can just picture
the embarrassment that awaits you,

665
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,464
but I'm excited at the same time.

666
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,472
I'll give up, then.

667
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,141
What?

668
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,853
You're giving up too easily.

669
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,064
I'm giving up on you.

670
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,946
I came here thinking I'd stop trying
if I couldn't get through to you today.

671
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,450
I've been trying to be respectful,

672
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,870
but I won't anymore.

673
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,042
I'm done being considerate to you.

674
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,266
I said, you can go when you hear him
coming up the stairs.

675
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,811
What's taking him so long?
What if they actually fight this time?

676
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,982
You must be thrilled
that two men are fighting over you.

677
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,904
What did I say?
I told you not to get caught.

678
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,199
I had no idea
that egotistical guy would do this.

679
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,369
To Gi-seok, this is love.

680
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,705
Jeez.

681
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,835
Hey, do you know
what's even more ridiculous?

682
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,382
In others' eyes,
Gi-seok is the victim no matter what.

683
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,717
Everyone will feel so bad for him.

684
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,803
Yes, I'm such a bitch.

685
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,347
I mean, after saying he wants to...

686
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,266
That must be him.

687
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:31,476
Are you sure?

688
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,396
I did hear someone walking up the stairs.

689
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,314
What should I say to him?

690
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,858
Nothing. Just apologize to him.

691
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,945
Do I really owe him an apology?

692
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,323
Are you becoming like Gi-seok?
Why can't you say sorry?

693
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,535
Hey, I've said sorry to Ji-ho
so many times.

694
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,913
That's because you're such a troublemaker.
Ji-ho is so understanding.

695
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,959
-Aren't you leaving?
-Oh, I'm off.

696
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,294
-All right.
-Hey.

697
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,005
I'm going to sleep here
if he slams the door in my face!

698
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,550
-Is my place your private motel?
-Yes, it is. Didn't you know?

699
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,969
-Gosh, you kill me.
-I'll call you!

700
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,461
I'm taking a shower now.

701
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,216
What are you thinking?

702
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,930
Will you keep talking with no clothes on?

703
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,351
Just give me ten seconds.

704
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,443
Jeong-in, seriously.

705
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,640
I'll let go if you're not mad at me.

706
00:56:33,848 --> 00:56:35,600
If you're mad at me,
we can talk like this.

707
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,728
What did you do wrong?

708
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,815
I didn't tell you.

709
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,403
I met up with Gi-seok without telling you.

710
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,197
That's true.

711
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,282
So I'm not the only one at fault.

712
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,664
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

713
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,336
Do you want some coffee?

714
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,631
I had some beer at Yeong-ju's.

715
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,143
-What about you?
-I need to drive you home.

716
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,478
I'm going to sleep here.

717
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,109
What? Can't I do that?

718
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,822
Well, it's not that you can't.

719
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,407
Then what?

720
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,496
I bet you'll faint if I really sleep here.

721
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,123
I'll be sleeping at Yeong-ju's.

722
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,237
You're here to apologize, so go ahead.

723
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,409
I'm sorry.

724
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,498
I should've said that first,
but I kept beating around the bush.

725
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,047
I accepted the ring he gave me.

726
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,258
This will sound like an excuse,

727
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,928
but I had no choice.

728
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,807
To be really honest with you,

729
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,102
I don't deserve to throw it at him

730
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,522
or chuck it away.

731
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,110
When it comes to that failed relationship,
I am the culprit.

732
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,326
It couldn't have been an easy decision.

733
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,495
You must've agonized over it.

734
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,041
I learned it from you.

735
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,503
Unlike you,
I'm not such a wonderful person.

736
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,339
A while ago,

737
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,384
when you told me about Eun-u's mom,

738
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,679
I beat myself up a lot.

739
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,893
It made me realize
that all the whining I was doing

740
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,731
was extremely selfish and inconsiderate.

741
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,735
Without you, I would've never known.

742
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,370
From now on,

743
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,540
I'm going to try to become like you.

744
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,337
Are you teary-eyed now
because you don't want that?

745
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:02,974
Gosh.

746
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,976
You're still such a fool.

747
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,123
I'm making myself some coffee.

748
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,049
Where does Ji-ho live?

749
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:37,967
Why?

750
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,511
My sister just said
she isn't coming home tonight.

751
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,473
She said she's at Yeong-ju's place,
but I don't buy it.

752
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,267
So will you go to his place
and drag her out?

753
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,394
No way. This is such a great opportunity.

754
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,438
Doesn't Yeong-ju live in his building?

755
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,982
I'll go see if she's there or not

756
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,401
and use it to make her
give me an allowance.

757
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,528
-Jae-in.
-What?

758
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,530
You're such a bully.

759
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,533
It's always the beggars
who care about their dignity.

760
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,328
Anyway, what's Ji-ho's unit number?

761
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,666
Are you trying to be loyal?

762
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,018
Can you do something about that photo?

763
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,710
Most people won't approve
of your relationship.

764
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,255
In others' eyes, you're just someone
who cheated on her decent boyfriend.

765
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,466
Everyone will badmouth you.

766
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,177
Even if people talk shit about me,
I won't regret meeting Ji-ho.

767
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,095
I held myself back because of you.

768
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,555
Did we commit a crime or what?

769
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,974
I'll tell them everything.
He can't keep doing this.

770
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,102
Jeong-in said there's a guy she likes.

771
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,187
Tell her I'd meet him.

772
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,688
Tell Ji-ho this.

773
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,149
He has to stay by her side
no matter what anyone says.

774
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,276
He mustn't let her go
even if they have to elope.

775
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,361
Do whatever you want.

776
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:44,904
Ask me to meet up and visit me.

777
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,280
I'll put up with anything.

778
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:48,407
I'll think that I'm paying
for hurting you,

779
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,743
so bug me all you want.
But don't bother Ji-ho.

780
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,912
If you do, I'll do anything to stop you.

781
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,539
It's nice to cry sometimes.

782
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,957
I get to see you at this hour.

783
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,751
-By the way, what is this place?
-Where people kiss secretly.
