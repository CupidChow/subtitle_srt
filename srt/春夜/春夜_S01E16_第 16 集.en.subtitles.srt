1
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,808
FINALE

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,019
I don't know when it started.

3
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,646
I guess it was...

4
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,858
around the time Eun-u
starting locking eyes with me.

5
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,821
I had to endure to survive.

6
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,036
If I didn't suppress
my anger and emotions,

7
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,165
who knows what I would've done?

8
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,544
Did you ever think about

9
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,380
leaving Eun-u?

10
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,260
That's insane.

11
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,516
I controlled myself.

12
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,354
My life so far, my actions,

13
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,648
my words,

14
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,609
and even my thoughts.

15
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,488
It's what got me through everything.

16
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,327
Saying that I didn't think about that time

17
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,622
or about Eun-u's mom would be a lie.

18
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,753
I know it's hard to believe,

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,590
but I feel nothing.

20
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,719
Sometimes, it made me sad.

21
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,309
On the day I was drunk,

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,981
I found it hard to suppress my feelings.

23
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:32,652
I'm glad you didn't.

24
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,866
It's not just Eun-u.

25
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,202
I'm sure you wanted
to console yourself too.

26
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,249
Thanks.

27
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,626
I'm the one who's grateful.

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,880
You must've been upset,

29
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,591
but you still understood how I felt.

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,763
It's cooled off a bit. Let's drink.

31
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,440
You should finish it.

32
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,288
A verbal apology is one thing,
but that can't be all.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,081
Let's go.

34
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,004
Are you refusing?

35
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,924
That's not it.

36
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,510
That wasn't my usual self.

37
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,554
It was a mistake.

38
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,517
Doesn't that just make me human?
It makes me seem more down-to-earth.

39
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,521
Also, I should get at least one free pass.

40
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,815
Isn't it a bit inhumane
to punish me when it's just...

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,110
my first mistake?

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,155
You're really talkative.

43
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,116
Should I sign you up for the sober clinic?

44
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,099
A week?

45
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,351
Two weeks is too long.

46
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,353
You'll only drink once a month.

47
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:34,482
-Once a month? No way!
-Sober clinic it is, then.

48
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,026
Okay, fine. I won't drink.

49
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,156
You won't even take a sip.

50
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,993
Violate it and I won't marry you.

51
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,435
NO DRINKING ALLOWED. ENGAGEMENT WITH
JEONG-IN TO BE BROKEN OFF UPON VIOLATION.

52
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,811
JUNE 26, 2019, YU JI-HO

53
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,986
My father

54
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,031
has been pondering about
the best spot for you.

55
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,076
There's no need.

56
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,287
I'm not that greedy, you see.

57
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,126
All I want is a chance
to devote myself to the foundation.

58
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,880
There's nothing more I want.

59
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,759
I didn't know you were
that fond of my foundation.

60
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,972
It's upsetting to hear you say that.

61
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,728
So is your daughter
going to marry my son or what?

62
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,814
What do you think?

63
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,650
Do you agree with them marrying?

64
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,073
That decision is for the two of them.

65
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,536
We're only just the parents.

66
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,080
What are parents supposed to do?

67
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,417
We watch by with respect
as they make their choices

68
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,252
and show them support.

69
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:05,550
That's how I've treated my daughters
all this time.

70
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,475
You're right.

71
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,563
Marriage should be our decision.

72
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,316
I think it was great for all of us

73
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,318
to meet like this today.

74
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,408
Jeong-in and I will get married
before this year ends.

75
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,376
If you consider the weather,
fall would be the best time.

76
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,044
What do you two think?

77
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,599
My father's the issue.

78
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,726
I've never been that worried about my mom.

79
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,355
She may not show it on the outside,

80
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,025
but I'm sure the decision
was tough for her too.

81
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,487
It'll be even harder for your father.

82
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,824
I don't want us to rush things.

83
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,497
That's not the case.
This isn't just about me, you know.

84
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,125
I hate making you seem like the bad guy.

85
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,340
I'll be lying if I said I was unfazed.

86
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,841
Still,

87
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,928
it hasn't hurt my pride in any way.

88
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,891
How can you be fine
when my family doesn't approve of you?

89
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,893
Because of you.

90
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,354
You approve of me.

91
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,360
What? Do I not seem sincere?

92
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,280
I think you are.

93
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,659
Yes, you're right.

94
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,876
What a great meal.

95
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,757
Is your daughter
really going to marry my son?

96
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,011
I thought we were done on this subject,

97
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,721
so why are you bringing it up again?

98
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,057
You know I don't even trust my own son,

99
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,725
so how can I trust your kid?

100
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,020
If that's how it'll be,

101
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,316
let me also say that
I don't trust Gi-seok fully either.

102
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,610
Then why did you keep
bringing up their marriage?

103
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,489
It's Gi-seok who's rushing it.

104
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,867
My Jeong-in didn't even bring it up once!

105
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,203
I'm glad to know she has a conscience.

106
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,498
Gi-seok probably has
skeletons in his closet too.

107
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,044
Are you saying
that my son cheated on her too?

108
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,588
Who knows?

109
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:53,259
If I had known about this,
I would've taken photos too.

110
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,304
Are you challenging me?

111
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,848
-You think I'm scared?
-Sir!

112
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,726
-Bring it on!
-Let go of me!

113
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,186
-Seriously?
-Hey!

114
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,396
-What...
-Sir.

115
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,564
What's going on?

116
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,898
-Let me go.
-Let me go too.

117
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,484
I'm done serving you!

118
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,570
What? Are you insane?

119
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,696
-Sir, please.
-Sir!

120
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,157
-I'm allowed to speak my thoughts!
-Sir.

121
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,242
-You know my temper, right?
-Well, yes.

122
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,828
-I can't leave like this.
-You think I've got no temper?

123
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,830
-We should go.
-Let me take this off.

124
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,998
-Jeez.
-Don't do this.

125
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,500
-Bring it on.
-Sure, come at me.

126
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,127
-Goodness.
-Father, please.

127
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,338
-Bring it on then!
-Hey!

128
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,590
-What the fuck is this?
-Consider yourself lucky.

129
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,216
-As if!
-Let's go.

130
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,385
-Consider yourself lucky too!
-You!

131
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,686
Who does he think he is?

132
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,149
Back in the day,
I would've punched his ass.

133
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,657
He thinks that marrying off my daughter
is my only goal.

134
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,160
What a joke.

135
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,877
-What happened? Come this way.
-Okay, ma'am.

136
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:10,961
Gosh.

137
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,755
Unbelievable.

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,177
-Watch your step.
-This way.

139
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,102
My gosh! Why is he this wasted?

140
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,187
You're unbelievable.

141
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,857
Can you help me?

142
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,943
Gosh.

143
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,154
Goodness.

144
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,408
-Thank you.
-It's fine.

145
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,076
-No, wait!
-It's nothing.

146
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,209
Thank you.

147
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,753
I'm the one who's grateful.

148
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,677
Did your father get home safely too?

149
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,596
Yes, his driver just called.

150
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,434
Right. Well, thank you for this.

151
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,769
By the way,

152
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,314
how did the three of you
gather for dinner?

153
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,359
Did you have plans?

154
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,319
Yes.

155
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,703
It's about time we talked in detail
about our wedding.

156
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,752
Mother,

157
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,214
I must marry Jeong-in.

158
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
Hold on.

159
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,178
This is marriage we're talking about.

160
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,473
What the two of you want comes first.

161
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,850
I'm doing this for her.

162
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,561
I don't get what you mean.

163
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,982
She shouldn't be with Ji-ho.

164
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,614
I know that he's in a different situation.

165
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,660
Well, with regards to that,
I do feel bad for him.

166
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,078
That's not it though.

167
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,123
He's...

168
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,542
not decent enough.

169
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,173
I thought I knew him too,

170
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,803
but you really shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

171
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,307
Do you know about the photos?

172
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,646
You see, what happened is that

173
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:39,318
since I couldn't give a straight answer
about our marriage,

174
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,321
my father got worried.

175
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,823
He did

176
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,035
some research on his own
to look out for me.

177
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,495
Ji-ho...

178
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,791
just happened to be there
at the wrong time.

179
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,088
My father is just as shocked, you know.

180
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,340
He's worried about us not marrying--

181
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,092
Yes, I get that.

182
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,098
What do you mean Yu Ji-ho

183
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,140
isn't a decent man?

184
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,103
He came all the way to my workplace.

185
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,191
He threatened me
with the photos that were taken.

186
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,777
-He threatened you?
-Yes.

187
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,032
He said that he wasn't scared
of anything in this world

188
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,661
and that he'd make my father pay.

189
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,539
What does he mean by that?

190
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,083
Who knows what he'll do?

191
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,753
He could be after money.

192
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,510
Jeez.

193
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,349
Don't worry though.

194
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,395
I'll guide Jeong-in
back to her place soon.

195
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,024
Ji-ho will be out of her life then.

196
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,286
-Right.
-I'll take that.

197
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,669
Hi, Jeong-in.

198
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,839
My mom wants to meet you, Ji-ho.

199
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,426
When?

200
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,429
You're ready to spring out, aren't you?

201
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,265
If I must.

202
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,644
Why are you so at ease?

203
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,522
It's not like I can avoid it.

204
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,025
I like the attitude.

205
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,362
Okay, I'll let you know when and where.

206
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,324
Jeong-in, wait.

207
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,034
Yes?

208
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,663
I'd like to bring Eun-u, too.

209
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,415
Would that be wrong?

210
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,669
That's not it.

211
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,630
I don't want to burden you.

212
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,883
I have to introduce him sometime, don't I?

213
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,764
I should've thought of that first.

214
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,683
Sure, let's do that.

215
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,477
I like it.

216
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,229
Like what?

217
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,648
That you think this is our decision.

218
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,904
This is only the beginning,
so don't get too excited yet.

219
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,575
No way.

220
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,704
-That's amazing.
-It's really nothing.

221
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,956
-Not you.
-Your boyfriend.

222
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,374
Why not me?

223
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,002
-His situation is nothing like yours.
-Exactly.

224
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,422
He should be terrified, but he's so brave
to offer to introduce his son first.

225
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,423
Exactly.

226
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,300
Being a parent sure is different.

227
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,264
They're the same age
but completely different.

228
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
I agreed that it was a good idea too.

229
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,767
It was too late.

230
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,520
When I come over next time,

231
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,355
I should buy something from the pharmacy.

232
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,108
-Buy a couple of things.
-Got it.

233
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,401
Don't forget your wallet.

234
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,697
Seriously?

235
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,793
Are you sure about this?

236
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,464
Wouldn't it be awkward for everyone?

237
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,966
What do you think?

238
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,385
I agree.

239
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
She wants to get to know you first.

240
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,517
Wouldn't it be awkward with Eun-u there?

241
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,896
Without Eun-u, she wouldn't
be seeing my true self.

242
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,899
I get that, but...

243
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,527
You may think that
because you are Eun-u's dad.

244
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,197
Her family may like you right now,

245
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,033
but that doesn't mean
they're ready to accept Eun-u as well.

246
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,118
Jeong-in agreed with me.

247
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,331
Also, I believe that
no matter how small the matter is,

248
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,542
we should face it head-on together.

249
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,469
Head back inside.
I'll call when I get home.

250
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,681
I don't think
I was ever a father like you.

251
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,934
What are you talking about?

252
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,103
You gave me a lot and then some.

253
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,524
I'm truly proud of you, Ji-ho.

254
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,859
I'll get going then.

255
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,070
-Drive home safely.
-Sure.

256
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
Go on in.

257
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,691
What are you still doing here?

258
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,652
-Just go home.
-I need an answer.

259
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,072
How can you marry a girl

260
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,116
that's already with another man?

261
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,371
Let's say you did. Can you still love her
for the rest of your life?

262
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,374
Staying married is what matters, isn't it?

263
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,168
-You idiot.
-Why...

264
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,796
Why would you ruin this for me?

265
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,134
There wouldn't be any issues
if you hadn't taken the photos!

266
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,969
Are you blaming this on me?

267
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,054
Is it my fault then?

268
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,059
They're all upset that
you didn't approve at first,

269
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,103
and today you picked a fight with her dad.

270
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,316
Are you trying to help me
or ruin my chances?

271
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,069
Does marriage seem that much to you?
Where's your dignity?

272
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,614
This isn't the time
to worry about my pride.

273
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:03,577
That prick is threatening us
with those photos you took.

274
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,163
We must marry for your sake too.

275
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,207
I have to force her down the aisle.

276
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,253
Would you rather risk
the reputation you built so far

277
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,296
for an issue like this?

278
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,424
You have no idea what's going on.

279
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,511
Unbelievable.

280
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,388
It's so like him.

281
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,892
Have you ever seen him
ruin something he put his mind to?

282
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,520
He'll be the first of our friends
to get married.

283
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,649
He's just meeting the family.

284
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,860
You don't even have at least that.

285
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,487
This again?

286
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,530
And you do?

287
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,701
We'll see who marries after Ji-ho.

288
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,703
It'll be me.

289
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,541
The door is opening.

290
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,418
Good morning.

291
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,045
Going up.

292
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,422
What was that about Ji-ho?

293
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,008
Oh, it's just...

294
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,220
I think he's getting married soon.

295
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,432
The door is closing.

296
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,065
-Thank you. Bye.
-Take care.

297
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,946
This is so like Si-hoon.

298
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,950
Showering you with baby gifts
won't change anything.

299
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,162
How did he become a dentist
with this level of stupidity?

300
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,125
Don't unbox anything.

301
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,045
You should've pressed charges that day.

302
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,631
What do you mean?

303
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,468
What are you talking about?

304
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,637
Shouldn't it be just a lawsuit?

305
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,806
I'll tell you about it later.

306
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,393
Do it now. What don't I know?

307
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,980
What is it?

308
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,276
-I'll tell you later.
-Tell me.

309
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,698
-Tell me now.
-Jeong-in.

310
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,074
Get over here.

311
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,455
Si-hoon assaulted Seo-in.

312
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,197
PETITION FOR DIVORCE

313
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,964
Okay, I signed it.

314
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:38,185
Don't forget to be polite
when you meet the adults.

315
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,228
Do as your dad says too.

316
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,647
Make sure you don't make a fuss.

317
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,066
Have a good time, all right?

318
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,652
Enjoy yourself, my puppy.

319
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,863
Bye.

320
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,952
PYEONGCHANGSA LAUNDRY

321
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,078
Bye.

322
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,349
Ji-ho's here.

323
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,521
Mom.

324
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,159
Hi, Eun-u.

325
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,629
Eun-u!

326
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,257
Hi, it's been a while.

327
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,425
There you go.

328
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,928
It's nice to meet you. I'm Yu Ji-ho.

329
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,347
Yes, it's nice to meet you too.

330
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,641
We'll skip the greetings.

331
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,477
We've met before too.

332
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,145
Yes, it's been a while.

333
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,111
Eun-u, this is my mom.

334
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,240
-Go ahead and say hello.
-Hello.

335
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,744
That was a sweet little bow.

336
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,083
-Hello.
-Hello.

337
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,462
-Hi.
-Hello.

338
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,299
Don't you remember me? We met before.

339
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:37,178
-You're the younger sister.
-What a smart little boy!

340
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,267
Here. Have some water.

341
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,021
Is the food yummy?

342
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,572
Mom, you're burning a hole
in Ji-ho's face.

343
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,115
Come on.

344
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,494
You can be at ease with me.

345
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,747
I'll answer any question you have.

346
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,837
A single meal isn't enough
to get to know everything about you.

347
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,507
We'll just take it one step

348
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,551
at a time.

349
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,805
I know quite a lot of things about him.

350
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,932
I hope you'll be nice.

351
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,143
That depends on Jeong-in.

352
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,771
-How much is it worth?
-Do you want a piece of me?

353
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,986
Eun-u, are you done?

354
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,364
Want to go outside
and play with Aunt Jae-in?

355
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,240
-Aunt?
-I'm not his sister.

356
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,992
Would you like to go?

357
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,914
Okay, let's go.

358
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,083
Here are your shoes.

359
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,967
She'll bombard you with questions now,
so I'll block what isn't necessary.

360
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,722
You being this way
will only put him at a disadvantage.

361
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,224
Why are you being this way?

362
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,309
You're the one who wanted to meet him too.

363
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,315
Actually, I wanted a few pointers
since you're more experienced.

364
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,569
I don't know much
because my parents raised him.

365
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,531
Still, I'll gladly share what I learned.

366
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,868
I'm curious about one thing.

367
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,663
What went through your mind
as you handled it all?

368
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,421
I told you that
my parents mostly raised him,

369
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,256
but he's still my son.

370
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,676
He's living his life
with only me to look up to,

371
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,760
so I couldn't crumble.

372
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,389
The same goes for Jeong-in.

373
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,892
She's putting her entire faith in me,

374
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,854
so I'll protect her no matter what.

375
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,712
The women in our family are crybabies.

376
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,737
Welcome.

377
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,300
Si-hoon?

378
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,640
My gosh.

379
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,267
What are you doing here?

380
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,523
Why are you drinking
in the middle of the day?

381
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,068
I'm getting a divorce.

382
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,529
Sorry?

383
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,740
Seventy percent of the reason is...

384
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,744
Okay, fine. It's 50 percent.

385
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,039
You're half to blame for it.

386
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,585
Me?

387
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,337
Yes, you.

388
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,841
If only you had granted that loan

389
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,511
or had married Jeong-in soon.

390
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,722
I would've had enough time
to get back on my feet.

391
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,352
All you said was that
you'd look into it and do better.

392
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,068
What about you then?

393
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,996
All you did was talk about helping me out.

394
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,542
You kept saying you'd support me
and told me not to worry,

395
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,713
but have you actually done anything?

396
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,132
What have you done?

397
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,760
You little prick... Want a drink?

398
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,598
Eat more.

399
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,475
Exchange some comments and wrap it up.

400
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,895
If this drags on, it'll get awkward.

401
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,855
My goodness.

402
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,525
First of all,

403
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,862
this must've been uncomfortable.

404
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:50,700
Thank you for being so considerate of us
despite that.

405
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,328
And most importantly,

406
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,499
I should tell you that when I heard
you were bringing your son,

407
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,085
I was quite flustered at first, but...

408
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,924
I'm not sure how this will sound.

409
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,928
I was touched...

410
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,597
because I'm a parent too.

411
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,975
I'm flattered.

412
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,438
You could've said no,
so thank you for being so considerate.

413
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,275
And this whole situation must've been
quite uncomfortable and awkward.

414
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,320
Thank you for being so kind and accepting.

415
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,031
Thank you.

416
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,242
No, thank you. I really mean it.

417
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,497
I think I'll bug Ji-ho a lot from now on.

418
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,040
Sure, anytime.

419
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,293
No, you'll have to get
my permission first.

420
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,421
-My gosh.
-Goodness, you're so annoying.

421
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,340
-You little...
-Gosh, hey.

422
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,929
I told you.
He's a lot maturer than you are.

423
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,472
Don't be silly.

424
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,598
But...

425
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,607
And you're probably aware,

426
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,486
you have a long way to go
to persuade Jeong-in's dad.

427
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,822
Yes, I'm prepared for it.

428
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,824
I'll be totally fine,

429
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,867
but it might stress Jeong-in out.

430
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,745
No, it won't.

431
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,040
Mom.

432
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,501
Seo-in and Jae-in.

433
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,005
I can do this.

434
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,424
We'll get through it.

435
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,636
We'll wait for Dad to change his mind
and accept Ji-ho.

436
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,807
Mom, I'll always remember your advice.

437
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,519
I know

438
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,356
things that we never even expected
can happen,

439
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,527
and there may be moments
when we'll regret our decision.

440
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,532
But you know what? I'll still be okay

441
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,910
because I'll have Ji-ho right by my side.

442
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,500
I'll vent to him,
and he'll make me feel better.

443
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,836
And before I even know it,

444
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,466
I'll be happy again.

445
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,653
So you're going to keep saying
it's not your fault at all?

446
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,656
Why is it my fault that you got a divorce?

447
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,826
How many times do I have to tell you?
You're pissing me off.

448
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,040
You said you'd help me
so Jeong-in and I could get married.

449
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,917
You said I could trust you.

450
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,836
And what happened?

451
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,338
Where's the guy who said it?

452
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,384
Jeez, what the hell.

453
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,929
Look at you talking all casually to me.

454
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,140
-All right, fine.
-You expect me to talk politely?

455
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,273
Do you even know how I feel now?

456
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,745
Seriously, I never thought
a loser like Yu Ji-ho would...

457
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,456
Who? Yu... What?

458
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,961
How dare she even compare me to Ji-ho?

459
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,092
What happened? Did you have a competitor?

460
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,844
Competitor, my ass.

461
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,096
There was no competition.

462
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,223
That prick

463
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,518
doesn't even measure up to begin with.

464
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,648
I must say, this is quite shocking.
I'm shocked.

465
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:51,983
He just doesn't compare.

466
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:58,156
Jeong-in, my sister-in-law,
is seeing someone else?

467
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,118
Why are you telling me this just now?

468
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,287
You should've told me sooner.

469
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,580
What could you have done?

470
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,708
-Would you have--
-What? What kind of question is that?

471
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,586
I would've told the entire family.
Then what would've happened?

472
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:16,090
My wife's focus would've shifted
to Jeong-in,

473
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,926
which would've helped me buy some time.
To do what?

474
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,012
To patch things up. What a great plan.

475
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,391
But whenever I come up
with an important plan,

476
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:28,603
you always... You're just never helpful.

477
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,190
Hey, I have an idea.

478
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,317
Let's do this. Listen up, okay?

479
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,320
A win-win strategy.

480
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,325
I'll tell Seo-in's parents
that we're getting a divorce.

481
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,868
Then what will happen?

482
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,496
They won't want you and Jeong-in
to call off your plan to get married,

483
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,625
so they'll keep pressuring you guys
to get married soon.

484
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,460
Then it'll buy me some time,

485
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,337
which I can use to mend my marriage.

486
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,716
As they say,
God helps those who help themselves.

487
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,635
"Happiness begins at home." Yes.

488
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,929
Hey, it's an amazing plan.

489
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,558
What do you think? Tell me.

490
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,939
I must say,

491
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,360
-the more I hear you talk...
-Isn't it a fantastic plan?

492
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,720
Going to the washroom?

493
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,515
No, I'm not.

494
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,732
Let's just figure things out separately,
Si-hoon.

495
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,278
Jeez, what do you mean by...

496
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,988
Hey, hear me out.

497
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,031
The washroom is that way.

498
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,408
Hey!

499
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,749
You're done.

500
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,260
I HOPE YOU ONLY SEE, LISTEN, SAY,
AND DREAM BEAUTIFUL THINGS

501
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:42,611
I promise you
that I'll protect you forever.

502
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,961
What are you thinking?

503
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,135
The reason I came back to Korea.

504
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,765
You said you didn't want to study.

505
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,729
I thought that was the reason,

506
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,525
but I actually learned a lesson.

507
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,152
A lesson about what?

508
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,513
What?

509
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,024
You didn't make any mistakes today.

510
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,194
No, I just

511
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,114
can't believe this day actually came.

512
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,578
I'm also quite fascinated
by how my life is unfolding.

513
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,163
Dad.

514
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,832
Yes?

515
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,587
Are you and Ms. Lee getting married?

516
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,383
Yes. Why do you ask?
Does it make you feel weird?

517
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,969
Then,

518
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,890
is she going to be my mom?

519
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,518
Yes.

520
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,900
Yes, I'll be your mom.

521
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,575
I'll be good to you.

522
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,956
No, don't say that. The three of us
will get through this together.

523
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,271
You used to nag me to date someone.
Why tell me not to get married?

524
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,151
I need to live too.
You'd better not get married.

525
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,570
I won't go to your wedding
or give you money gift.

526
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,490
Are you worried that he might quit?

527
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,450
I won't quit.

528
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,287
Which area will you move to though?

529
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,665
You'll have to think about
Eun-u's school too.

530
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,124
Not for a few years.

531
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,127
And I'll keep working here
regardless of where I live.

532
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,755
Sign the pledge, then.

533
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,341
Don't even go there.

534
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,387
He's really sticking to his promise
and not drinking at all.

535
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,638
He's so obedient.

536
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,808
Can't you tell?
He'll be such a sucker for his wife.

537
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,351
Who?

538
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,561
-You.
-You.

539
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,480
Jeez.

540
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:49,942
Sign the pledge.

541
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,443
-I told you I won't--
-Sign it.

542
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,494
-About the other day...
-Oh, right.

543
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:06,000
I drank way too much that day.
I'm sorry about what happened.

544
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,710
It was my fault too.

545
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,881
What's done is done. Just let it go.

546
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,634
I wanted to talk about...

547
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,762
What do you say

548
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,307
to being a director after retirement?

549
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,727
I can't really give you my position,
you know.

550
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,688
That'd be crazy.

551
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,232
What do you think?

552
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,027
I'm underqualified.

553
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,945
I think I'm underqualified,

554
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,866
but it's... I mean...

555
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,327
Come on. Stop beating around the bush.

556
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,953
You don't want it?

557
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,914
Gosh, it's not that.
That's not what I meant.

558
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,171
You see, I'm just not sure
how I feel about it.

559
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,341
Mr. Lee, are you still sulking?

560
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,052
I said we should just let it go.

561
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,181
Not everyone gets an offer like this.

562
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,310
You're well aware of
how selective and fussy I am.

563
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,020
I sure am.

564
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,317
Well...
First of all, I appreciate the offer.

565
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,657
But I'd like some time to think about it.

566
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,408
What's there to think about?

567
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,205
You can lose
by trying to be too calculating.

568
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,416
Just give in and go along with it
if you want to be the winner.

569
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,793
Trust me.

570
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,048
Why do you keep chuckling?

571
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,097
You can talk now.

572
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:45,683
Well...

573
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,851
Is there no chance

574
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,105
for you and Gi-seok anymore?

575
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,195
Dad.

576
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,700
I think being a daughter who doesn't fill
her parents with heartache

577
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,537
whenever they see her is more worthwhile

578
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,288
than living a fabulous
and comfortable life.

579
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,711
I know that you say harsh things to Seo-in

580
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:16,255
because your heart aches when you see her.

581
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,844
I know that you're not happy

582
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,097
with my decision at the moment
because you're worried.

583
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,560
Just be patient with me, Dad.

584
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,105
I promise you this.

585
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,900
You'll soon see me live a happy life.

586
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,571
Please believe in me.

587
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:22,029
PRINCIPAL LEE TAE-HAK

588
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,247
Gi-seok.

589
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,667
You've done more than enough.

590
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,981
GI-SEOK

591
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,692
I'm sorry about everything.

592
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,025
Dude, you're being ridiculous.

593
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,152
We should root for Korea.
Are you a traitor or what?

594
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,946
Of course, I'm rooting for Korea.

595
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,533
But the ball is round, you know.
With soccer, you never know how it'll end.

596
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,368
Then let's bet.

597
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,121
Okay, deal.
Which team are you going to bet on?

598
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,832
Cut it out. You guys have to go home
right after the game.

599
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,917
No, we have to drink all this.

600
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,377
Just go home.

601
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,379
Did you really quit drinking?

602
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,090
Not voluntarily.
She forced him to quit drinking.

603
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,177
-She has him wrapped around her finger.
-What are you talking about?

604
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,056
-Here we go. Let's do this.
-Okay, go.

605
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,517
-No one's blocking you. Go!
-Okay. Gosh.

606
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,561
-What?
-Shoot! Pass the ball!

607
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,022
-Shoot! Do it!
-Shoot! Come on!

608
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,069
That hurt. Don't hit me.

609
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,155
The ball hit the post.

610
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,865
-Gosh.
-Jeez.

611
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,366
That was so close.

612
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,746
Bring me one too.

613
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,540
-You're really not going to drink?
-No, I have this.

614
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,836
Fine, you have to get married.

615
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,424
Guys, you have to go home
as soon as the game ends.

616
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,718
Okay, we heard you.
What's with all this nagging today?

617
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,094
Stop nagging us!

618
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,432
Yes, I'm going to bed now.
Are your friends gone?

619
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,685
Yes, they left a while ago.
As soon as the game ended.

620
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,480
You sound so down.

621
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,274
Is it because you couldn't drink?

622
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,028
No, I probably sound like that
because I'm lying in bed.

623
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,698
All right, then. Go to sleep.

624
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,077
Okay, you too. Sleep tight.

625
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,411
I will.

626
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,539
-Jeong-in.
-Yes?

627
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,417
I love you.

628
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,552
Good, done. We're good now. Okay.

629
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,847
Goodness, are you a teenager or what?

630
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,558
-"I love you"? What the hell.
-No, that was perfect.

631
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,479
He needed to end the call like that
to make sure we can fool her.

632
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,148
-I say it all the time.
-Sure.

633
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,067
Jeez.

634
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,570
Anyway, she's gone to bed.

635
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:54,408
-Hey, what do you guys want to eat?
-I really don't think this is right.

636
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,618
I'll just tell her you are here
and that we're drinking.

637
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,786
Why? Don't.

638
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,997
-Why ruin everything?
-I don't want to lie to her.

639
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,332
-No, forget it. Get lost!
-Wait, just a second.

640
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,210
-Get lost! We won't get caught.
-Gosh, wait.

641
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,170
Hey, don't let him out.

642
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,047
-Hey, hurry up.
-Okay.

643
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,008
-Order something quickly.
-She'll kill me.

644
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,759
-No, you won't die.
-She'll scold me.

645
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,803
-Fried chicken?
-Yes, order chicken.

646
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,805
-From that place.
-Where?

647
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,682
-Oh, right.
-The place that delivers quickly.

648
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,143
-Hey!
-Get some rest in there.

649
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:19,576
Is Ji-ho having
a housewarming party today?

650
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,672
Dude, you can't dance.

651
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,509
I mean, all you can do is wriggle.

652
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,011
Show us. You always do
that Michael Jackson dance.

653
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,931
-Michael Jackson? I shall show you.
-Yes, dude.

654
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,390
The moonwalk.

655
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,810
See?

656
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,396
-Jeez.
-You're pretty good.

657
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,898
-Right?
-Yes.

658
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,484
-I mean, look at this.
-What is that?

659
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,570
I saw Michael Jackson at an event
in Chungcheong Province.

660
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,822
-Show us, then.
-That's wrong.

661
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,990
You're doing it wrong. Look, okay?
He enters the stage.

662
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,575
Then he does this and...

663
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,872
Then he does the moonwalk. Like this.

664
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,707
You jerks.

665
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,460
You crazy fool.

666
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,922
-Let's just not dance.
-This guy is...

667
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,925
-Promise. Let's never dance.
-Never shake your hips again.

668
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,677
I'll kill you if I ever see you at a club.

669
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,958
What was that?

670
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,546
Hey, wake up.

671
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,299
-Wake up.
-Gosh, why?

672
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,093
-Just sleep here tonight.
-Wake up.

673
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,304
-Hey, wake up.
-Why? Just sleep here.

674
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,018
-Oh, gosh...
-Jeez!

675
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,688
Hey.

676
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,483
Hey, get up. We didn't drink...

677
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,151
-Why...
-We didn't drink that much.

678
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,238
Jeong-in, what are you doing here so late?

679
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,371
You should've called me.

680
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,628
Wait.

681
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,464
I'm sorry.

682
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,179
Yeong-jae, are you not going to study?

683
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,933
I'm really going to break up with you
if you don't pass the exam again.

684
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,235
Why do you keep saying no?
You obviously don't want to marry me.

685
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,905
-Why are you being like this?
-It's written right there.

686
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,495
I kept saying I can't drink,
but they persistently--

687
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,913
You're such a coward.

688
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,792
If you don't want to marry me,
just say so.

689
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,377
Why pull something like this?

690
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,256
-You're being too harsh.
-In what way?

691
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,342
What?

692
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,345
How am I being too harsh? Tell me.

693
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,516
My stomach is upset.

694
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,731
Where did you learn that? From Eun-u?

695
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,320
I said I'm sorry. I'll never drink again.

696
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,034
Do you think I'm angry because you drank?

697
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,246
You've become a total fool overnight.

698
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,750
It's impossible not to drink
when they're drinking.

699
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,253
You should've just been honest.
But you said they left.

700
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,880
You said you were in bed.

701
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,299
You even said you love me when hanging up.

702
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,052
-I really meant that.
-But everything else was a lie.

703
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,596
Why did you lie to me?

704
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,390
I didn't want to be scolded.

705
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,393
Shouldn't you have feared this more?

706
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,395
Did you really think you could fool me?

707
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,733
Yes.

708
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,863
Forgive me just this one time.

709
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,118
All right.

710
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,668
-I won't marry you though.
-Wait.

711
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:22,921
You can't come in.

712
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,596
-Here.
-Give it to me.

713
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:50,865
What?

714
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,034
That tickles!

715
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,835
Here you go.

716
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,045
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

717
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,300
I said you don't have to get anything.

718
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,096
How do I look today?
Should I fix anything?

719
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,348
You look stunning.

720
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,102
I'm so nervous.

721
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,895
Stay right by my side, okay?

722
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,648
I've never seen you this nervous.

723
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,733
What if they won't let me marry you?

724
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,655
-Hello.
-Welcome.

725
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,495
-Welcome.
-It's nice to meet you.

726
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,997
It's for you, Mother.

727
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,918
My gosh,
you didn't have to get us anything.

728
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,794
-Ms. Lee!
-Eun-u.

729
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:28,755
Come here.

730
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,757
-How have you been?
-Good.

731
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,467
I missed you.

732
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,846
What if she makes

733
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,642
some blunt remarks
in front of his parents?

734
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,269
I don't even expect her to impress them.

735
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:45,104
As long as she doesn't make mistakes.

736
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:49,067
Anyway, I won't keep you.
I'll call you again later.

737
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,194
Who was that?

738
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,030
Seo-in.

739
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,990
What kind of mistake?

740
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,618
She's getting a divorce, so what else?

741
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,957
It's already been decided,
so just let it go.

742
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,086
And just remember
that she has it the hardest.

743
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,131
What about how we feel as her parents?

744
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,303
When it comes to children,

745
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:23,101
the more you expect,
the more you're let down.

746
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,480
Let's

747
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:32,277
neither expect too much from them
nor pressure them in any way.

748
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,445
Let's be that kind of parents.

749
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,783
Okay? That's how I want to be
with our daughters, honey.

750
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,077
Jeez.

751
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,792
Why don't we

752
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:52,046
go to a nice restaurant for dinner
this evening?

753
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,757
Sounds good?

754
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,468
-What's this one's name?
-The Ankylosaurus.

755
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,846
The Ankylosaurus?
Shall we look for it in the book?

756
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:01,806
Oh, there it is.

757
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:05,101
-Hey, shouldn't we celebrate with a drink?
-The face is...

758
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,020
Mom will yell at you again.

759
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,898
-No, she won't.
-Wow, the Tyrannosaurus...

760
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,859
You can drink, right?

761
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,612
Dad.

762
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,906
I mean, everyone enjoys
having a couple of drinks these days.

763
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,950
Yes, I like to drink.

764
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,536
Forget tea.

765
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,872
Hey, what do you want to drink?

766
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,126
-Well...
-Ji-ho quit drinking.

767
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:33,254
I'm so happy to hear that.

768
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,632
Who came up with such an amazing idea?

769
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,348
My dad said he's met you before.

770
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,979
Right, we met by chance
before he joined the Assembly.

771
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,858
You must've impressed him that day.
He's talked about you often.

772
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:01,491
My dad told me a lot about you as well.
I heard you're very capable.

773
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,162
I guess he doesn't know that there are
many young professors these days.

774
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,006
When was your last relationship?

775
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,431
Let me think.

776
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,059
I don't really remember.

777
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,312
Right.

778
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,482
A past you're not happy with
won't help your present in any way.

779
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,071
Right, that's a good point.

780
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,910
So? Are you interested in getting married?

781
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,206
Obviously, that's why I'm here.

782
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,751
And...

783
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,547
I was just thinking that I'm glad
I decided to come here today.

784
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,354
Oh, thank you.

785
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,775
Drink slowly.

786
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,196
He can be quite impulsive,
so you have to be careful.

787
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:24,615
Oh, no. I can be impulsive too.

788
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,498
Is he asleep now?

789
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,253
Are you all right?

790
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,923
It looks like you drank a lot.

791
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,300
No, not at all.

792
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,303
When else will we have an excuse
to drink like this if not today?

793
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,513
I'm going to visit you often though.

794
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,559
Take it easy there.

795
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,312
I have to be honest. Right?

796
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,063
Yes, of course. Here.

797
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:58,983
My goodness.

798
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,612
I like Ji-ho more than he likes me.

799
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,822
At first, he didn't even want to date me.

800
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,459
I should tell you this
before I get too drunk.

801
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:20,463
I know that both of you
are still very worried.

802
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,841
But I hope you can worry a little less.

803
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,221
We'll be considerate of each other
and be happy together.

804
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:34,852
And I'll do my best
to be a good mom to Eun-u.

805
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,037
Oh, no.

806
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,870
Why didn't you take me home?

807
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:20,166
Gosh, you're the one
who insisted on sleeping here.

808
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,085
You went all out.
You drank hard liquor as well as soju.

809
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,337
You should've stopped me!

810
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,215
How can I sneak out?
Your mom must be mad at me.

811
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,052
Yes, she's so mad at you.

812
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,387
-Crap.
-She said she can't let you marry me.

813
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,056
Gosh, what do I do?

814
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,807
What should I do, then?

815
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,395
It's all right. My dad is very happy
that he now has a new drinking buddy.

816
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,273
But you said your mom
won't let me marry you.

817
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,320
-You'll still marry me though.
-Right, I will.

818
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,660
By the way, where did you sleep?

819
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,204
How could I have slept,

820
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,498
knowing that you're in this room?

821
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,166
You should've sneaked in.

822
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,210
Gosh, you.

823
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,047
How am I going to sneak out?

824
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,467
Before you leave...

825
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,107
-Here.
-My stomach is upset.

826
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:30,653
-Gosh, my stomach...
-Your stomach is upset?

827
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:31,779
-Yes.
-It's upset?

828
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,406
-Yes, for real.
-It doesn't seem so.

829
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:36,117
-Here, write your pledge.
-Oh, my stomach...

830
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,370
Come on. Write your pledge, okay?

831
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,788
My stomach hurts...

832
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,873
Gosh, it's killing me.

833
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:59,932
I WILL NEVER LIE. ENGAGEMENT WITH
JEONG-IN TO BE BROKEN OFF UPON VIOLATION.

834
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,560
JUNE 26, 2019, YU JI-HO

835
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,912
I, LEE JEONG-IN, WILL MARRY YU JI-HO
NO MATTER WHAT

836
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:29,170
IF NOT, I'LL STAY SINGLE FOREVER
JULY 6, 2019, LEE JEONG-IN

837
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:55,738
Thank you for coming to me.

838
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,217
Spring brought you to me.

839
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,022
WOORI PHARMACY

840
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,377
You said you'd call me
when you were leaving.

841
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:54,880
Hello,
do you have any medicine for hangovers?

842
01:08:58,134 --> 01:08:59,468
Don't you need a rubber band too?

843
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,638
No, I don't look so bad today.

844
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,852
-Should I open the medicine for you?
-If you'd like.

845
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:11,689
I don't do it for women
who brought their wallets.

846
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,079
Just a moment, please.

847
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,622
Ji-ho.

848
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,768
THE END
