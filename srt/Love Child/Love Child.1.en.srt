1
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,462
Villa?

2
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,338
Villa?

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,299
Please come in.

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,635
Please take a seat.

5
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:12,197
Your son has Autism Spectrum Disorder.

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,704
-Villa.
-Manalo.

7
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,879
We had his hearing tested
when Kali was two.

8
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,933
He is recognizing himself
and you as his parents just now.

9
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,479
Kali.

10
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,314
Kali.

11
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,857
Kali, son.

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,361
Kali.

13
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,769
Tim Burton.

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,896
Hm?

15
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,857
Tim Burton.

16
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,402
The filmmaker?

17
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,821
Yes.

18
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,331
He has autism too.

19
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,923
Ayla.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,511
Let's do everything we can for Kali.

21
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,350
Let's give him his own wonderland.

22
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,114
I don't know what you were thinking!

23
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,034
Ma, we have a free place to stay.

24
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,869
Ayla's aunt owns the house.

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,705
Plus, the cost of living is cheaper there.

26
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,374
So now you're thinking about expenses.

27
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,919
If you had just completed film school,

28
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,879
you could've been
the next Darryl Yap by now!

29
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,466
You have to own this now.
You're head of the family!

30
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,468
Don't be like your father!

31
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,387
Okay, okay. Bye.

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,972
If only you used a condom!

33
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,516
Over here!

34
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,059
There they are!

35
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,853
There! Aunt Tess!

36
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,147
That’s her. Aunt Tess.

37
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,947
Ayla! Thanks for the present!

38
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,742
Kali!

39
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,078
I'm your Grandma Tess!

40
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,207
He looks like your Uncle Arnold.

41
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,419
Oh my goodness, Ayla!

42
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,337
It's been so long since I've seen you.

43
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,256
Damn that annoying pandemic!

44
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,010
you didn't even have a child.

45
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,221
You were studying to be a lawyer.

46
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,474
Drop us off at the airport, okay?

47
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,686
You're leaving already?

48
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,563
To Siargao,

49
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,525
then Boracay, then Bohol, then Palawan.

50
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,338
You lazy bums!

51
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,718
You're all adults, but look at this!

52
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,970
Good lord!

53
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,140
They say Ilonggos are sweet,

54
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,018
but you all are a bitter pain in my ass!

55
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,102
Here, get this.

56
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,105
-Oh, they’re here!
-Wash it later

57
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,565
-Come on!
-Hello!

58
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,108
-Hello
-Leave the laundry!

59
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,320
I’ll open the gate.

60
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:04,989
Good day!

61
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,908
-Oh, shh-shh.
-Come on. Let's go!

62
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,660
-What?
-Just leave it!

63
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,871
What the?

64
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,249
Every Filipino rom-com
has quirky neighbors.

65
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,045
So, is this our rom-com?

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,548
Come in.

67
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,015
I’ll bring this inside.

68
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,652
Kali!

69
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,490
Kali, give it to me.

70
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,034
That might break.

71
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,452
-Kali.
-Kali.

72
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,121
-Give it to me.
-Give it to Mama.

73
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,413
-Give it to me.
-Give it to Mama.

74
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,873
Kali, come here! Come here!

75
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,960
Come here! Come to Papa.

76
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,086
Kali.

77
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,629
Kali!

78
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:10,805
-Kali!
-You might break some stuff.

79
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,522
Kali.

80
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,692
Come here!

81
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,778
Kali.

82
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,405
I’ll handle this.

83
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,322
I’ll handle this.

84
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,619
Kali, stop it already.

85
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,205
Cut it out. Please stop it, already.

86
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,374
Kali, stop it already.

87
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,292
Kali--

88
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,010
-Come here, come here.
-Stop it already, Kali.

89
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,321
Pao.

90
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,576
This is…

91
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,872
Uncle Arnold.

92
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,290
Let me see.

93
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,379
He looks like Kali, right?

94
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,342
He had autism too.

95
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,096
Pao.

96
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,852
I think Kali's condition
is from our bloodline.

97
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,357
I forgot about Uncle Arnold.

98
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,444
I'm so sorry.

99
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,197
-Why are you apologizing?
-I'm sorry.

100
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,409
Don’t say sorry. You can't control that.

101
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,705
But maybe when I was pregnant with Kali,

102
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,833
we could have tested
for his condition early.

103
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,959
And then what?

104
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,339
Like that?

105
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,507
No…

106
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,304
Nobody wanted this--

107
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,431
Coconut.

108
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,689
We can do this,

109
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,608
right?

110
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,155
Ayla,

111
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,949
remember back in college?

112
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,578
What our friends said
when they found out about us?

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,290
Caught.

114
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,167
Right. Caught!

115
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,960
But…

116
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,006
who would expect
that because of a dating app,

117
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:38,012
the top debater who never missed class

118
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,723
would fall for a wannabe filmmaker

119
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,727
who was always absent for film festivals?

120
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,356
I wasn’t the one who fell first!

121
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,401
Who was always hanging out at the oval,

122
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,029
even though it was far from his building?

123
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,658
Well, of course, you’d always be
the hero in your own version.

124
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,575
Really?

125
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,787
But seriously.

126
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,165
Remember what they called us?

127
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
No?

128
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Come on!

129
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,179
Remember? That’s what they called us!

130
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,475
We’re still a power couple.

131
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,686
I promise.

132
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,023
We’ll show them we’re still the same.

133
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,074
For us…

134
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,701
and for Kali.

135
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,044
Right, rom-com indeed.

136
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,559
Really?

137
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,899
You don't own that house.

138
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,234
-Yes, yes.
-How are your bills?

139
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,278
The electricity, the food?

140
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,824
We're okay here.

141
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,411
We’ve found
a developmental pedia for Kali.

142
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,250
Who is that?

143
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,794
No one. Just watching something.

144
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,839
How’s your son, by the way?

145
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,425
You mean your grandson?

146
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,432
Alright.

147
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,354
The cousins are all excited.

148
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,064
You’re the only one missing.

149
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,444
Bye.

150
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,037
You like it?

151
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,333
Towel off, towel off.

152
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,377
Time to get up.

153
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,546
Enough, already.

154
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,974
He doesn't talk yet, does he?

155
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,809
Not yet, Manong Bonnie.

156
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,853
Feed him some pig's vagina.

157
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,772
Look at Maring.

158
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,775
Her mom said she didn’t talk much before.

159
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,444
They fed her pig's vagina,
and now she never stops talking.

160
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,655
She talks even while she's asleep.

161
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,990
The same thing happened
to my friend’s son.

162
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:45,950
Kali.

163
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,036
They took him to a healer.

164
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,957
-Kali has a doctor…
-Yeah, he has a doctor.

165
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,583
-Come on, Kali
-Ayla, just try it!

166
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,501
Come here.

167
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,169
Come here.

168
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,714
They just needed a black chicken.

169
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,842
They slit its throat

170
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,971
and let the blood drip on the child.

171
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,682
They even had to tie the child down
because he went wild.

172
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,559
The demon was inside him.

173
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,894
Just try it.

174
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:14,895
Come, I'll buy.

175
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,313
There’s no harm.

176
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,732
Thank you. We’re leaving!

177
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,609
Hey, wait. I have something for you.

178
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,570
Thank you.

179
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,821
Thanks!

180
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,364
Just give it a try.

181
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,597
-I'll come back once you're done.
-Thank you so much.

182
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,353
You’re speaking Tagalog, huh?

183
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Kali…

184
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,692
You’re not from here, are you?

185
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,361
Or are you the kind
who just set foot in Manila

186
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,323
and have forgotten how to speak
Hiligaynon, just Tagalog now?

187
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,366
We’re really from Manila.

188
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,327
Do you have relatives here?

189
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,537
Yes, but they're on vacation.

190
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,749
Oh, so, it's just you here?

191
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,627
You’re not married?

192
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,467
When are you getting married?

193
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,810
Oh, you don’t have a religion?

194
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,439
Your child isn’t baptized?

195
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,028
I really like it here in Bacolod.

196
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,113
You guys love small talk.

197
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,202
You need Jesus in your life.

198
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,580
Especially,
since you don't have relatives here.

199
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,750
Jesus can watch over your child

200
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,002
while you work.

201
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:08,592
It’s not easy taking care of a child
with this condition, you know.

202
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,470
Jason! Oh my gosh.

203
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,721
No pissing here!

204
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,522
Is it possible for my son
to join a graded class?

205
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,858
He needs to be
in a non-graded class first.

206
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,445
We’ll see how Kali progresses.

207
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,035
You’ll create
an individualized program for him?

208
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,121
Looks like you’ve done
your research, Mommy.

209
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,791
Yes, that’s what they said on TikTok.

210
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,005
If you have a PDF copy of the modules,

211
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,507
could you airdrop it to me?

212
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,260
Uh, okay.

213
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,264
Ideally, they should be
in a resource room,

214
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,434
but the school is still looking
for the budget for that.

215
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:03,397
I heard the Department of Education
cut their special education budget.

216
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,649
Did you hear that on TikTok too?

217
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,900
On Twitter.

218
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,444
Alright then.

219
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,452
-Kali.
-Say bye to Mom and Dad.

220
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,203
We’ll be back later.

221
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,121
‎Kali.

222
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,750
Come on.

223
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,418
It’s school time!

224
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:34,970
That went well, I guess?

225
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,820
Pao. I’ll stay here for now.

226
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,782
You have work at home.

227
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:56,992
You sure?

228
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,662
Okay.

229
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,484
Follow Teacher. Let’s go!

230
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,902
Come here.

231
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,708
I HEARD FROM JONEL YOU’RE IN NEGROS?

232
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
HOW'S YOUR FAMILY?

233
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,378
IF YOU NEED A JOB,
THERE’S ONE HERE IN AUSTRALIA.

234
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,421
JUST LET ME KNOW.

235
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,348
I WON’T BE LIKE YOU, PA.

236
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,976
I WON’T ABANDON MY FAMILY.

237
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,343
Pao.

238
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,055
Pao, be careful. There’s a staircase!

239
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,890
Relax. I’m keeping an eye on him.

240
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,394
Get back to work. I got this.

241
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,232
Once we've saved enough,
let's get the bedroom’s floor fixed, okay?

242
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,775
-Okay, okay.
-Kali.

243
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,526
-Let's do that first.
-Kali.

244
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,532
Ayla, I’m tiring him out.

245
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,078
That’s not how you put
a child to sleep, Pao.

246
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:46,995
Why not?

247
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,998
Kali!

248
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,090
He needs to know that when we say sleep,
it means sleep.

249
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,468
Kali needs to associate the word "sleep"

250
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,095
with what it looks like.

251
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,598
But see how happy he is.

252
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,394
Is it that bad if he tires himself out
until he falls asleep?

253
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,313
You're just giving in to him.

254
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,774
We need to teach him discipline.

255
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,196
-Kali. Look, sleep.
-Give it to me.

256
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,284
Kali, sleep, says Mama.

257
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,163
Kali!

258
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,499
He doesn’t want to.

259
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,337
Of course, not right away.
We have to do this repeatedly.

260
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,382
Okay, okay, I got this.

261
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,592
Seriously!

262
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,137
Come on. You have work to do.

263
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,561
Say bye to Mama.

264
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,760
Did you really talk to Pareng Bikoy?

265
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,347
Or were you just too lazy
to go to the hacienda?

266
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,015
Mother! They don't need
a new truck driver yet!

267
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,976
Because you took too long!

268
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,061
And what kind of boxing is that…

269
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,480
Hey! What are you doing to your father?!

270
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,365
Two more lifts.

271
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:17,289
-Hey, cover up! You're embarrassing!
-You're mother is here.

272
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,458
Let’s pick it up later, okay?

273
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,501
You’re early.

274
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,170
‎Stop it.

275
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,380
‎You're embarassing.

276
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,549
Kali, let me have your bag.

277
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,550
Hey, look, Kali.

278
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,928
Kali, Kali, look.

279
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,898
-Damn, what’s this?
-What?

280
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,412
We aim for the least
restrictive environment

281
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,373
for kids like Kali as much as possible,

282
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:05,670
which is why we encourage them
to interact with typical kids.

283
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,299
But this is the third time, Teacher Anne.

284
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,177
At first, we thought Kali just fell.

285
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,220
Don't worry.

286
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,013
We've already called
the parents of the child

287
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,641
who did this to Kali for an intervention.

288
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,893
I'm sorry this happened under our watch.

289
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,019
It's sad to admit,

290
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:26,483
but sometimes it's hard
to monitor 21 kids like Kali.

291
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,363
We added teachers
trained in Special Education.

292
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,324
But rest assured, this won't happen again.

293
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,083
It’s him! He's the one who bullied Kali.

294
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,588
Come on. Let’s go home.

295
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,344
It’s about time. I'm really hungry.
I’m craving for bitso-bitso.

296
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,263
Let’s go look for some.

297
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,306
My stomach has been growling
for a while now.

298
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,808
Ayla! Ayla!

299
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,850
Did you hurt Kali?

300
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,810
Yeah! So what?!

301
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,604
Buddy, what you did wasn't right.

302
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,189
Kali doesn't have a brother.

303
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,651
Can you be that for him?

304
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:15,407
Do you know Kali's mom is good at judo?

305
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,534
Yeah, that's me. I'm his mom.

306
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,494
You know, when I was younger,

307
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,621
my mom told me to learn ballet,
but I said no!

308
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,500
I wanted to learn karate, aikido, judo.

309
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,626
Ayla…

310
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,836
I know all those.

311
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,964
I can kick, punch, flip,

312
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,675
chop, lift, spin,

313
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,052
and throw bad guys around like this!

314
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,723
Just what I expected.

315
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,684
Yeah, go ahead. Run!

316
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,317
You’re dead!

317
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,447
Let's hurry. Manang Maring
might be tired of looking after Kali.

318
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,743
I'm still mad!

319
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,412
I hope his food
won’t taste as good forever!

320
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,832
If I could just strangle that kid!

321
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,376
How much?

322
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,836
One hundred pesos.

323
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,880
-One hundred. Do you have a hundred?
-Yes.

324
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,883
I’ll take one-fourth.

325
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,343
One hundred.

326
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,678
-Would that be enough?
-Yeah.

327
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,854
Well, you pretty much scared him to death.

328
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,397
He'll probably tell his mom.

329
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,275
I don't care! I'll face his mom.

330
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,903
I’ll show her my Pacquiao combo.

331
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,368
Pao.

332
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,039
I don't want Kali to go back there

333
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,791
and get hurt again.

334
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,838
No child should get hurt, Ayla.

335
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,386
Can we move him to another school?

336
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,410
Yehey!

337
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,495
High five.

338
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,045
-Thanks!
-Thanks.

339
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,964
Our curriculum is similar

340
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,883
to the public school’s
special education curriculum.

341
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,013
so they get more attention.

342
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,476
As of now, we only have eight students
in your son's age group.

343
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,900
Do you have any bullying incidents here?

344
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,447
Luckily, we haven't encountered any.

345
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,492
The children's conditions are similar,
and they rarely fight.

346
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,296
How much will it cost us?

347
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,350
How much do we have saved up?

348
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,106
About 250,000 pesos.

349
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,860
That'll go down
by 75,000 for Kali's tuition.

350
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:45,533
Our grocery bill is around
11,000 a month, right?

351
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,497
Yeah, that includes
Kali's milk and vitamins.

352
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,292
Then, it's 1,500 for his pediatrician,

353
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,753
4,000 for electricity,

354
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:01,925
700 for water, and 2,000 for gas…

355
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,260
How much is that in total?

356
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,553
I don’t know.

357
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,972
I made films because I'm terrible at math.

358
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,227
Don't go there. Just stay here.

359
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,478
That's around…

360
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,940
18,000 pesos a month.

361
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,529
-It's kinda expensive.
-Then,

362
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,990
I only make 25,000
from my virtual assistance work.

363
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm expecting…

364
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,123
45,000 from the video I'm editing,

365
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,627
but inquiries are slow here.

366
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,089
Rates are much lower than in Manila.

367
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,010
Coconut.

368
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,184
We need extra income, Ayla.

369
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,524
How about we start a small business,
like a coffee shop?

370
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,611
Do we have enough savings for that?

371
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,534
No.

372
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,634
-Ayla!
-Son of a…

373
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,262
You startled me.

374
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,724
But, I was looking for you.
Didn't know you were having a moment here.

375
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,976
You startled me.

376
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,821
I know what our coffee shop will be.

377
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,301
Thank you.

378
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,076
I could still take it back.

379
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,119
It's fine.

380
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,456
I can still take editing gigs.

381
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,167
All I need is my laptop.

382
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,254
But that camera… Wasn’t it the prize

383
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,008
for your first short film contest win?

384
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,470
Yeah, but…

385
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,348
You sacrificed your car.

386
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:03,267
Your dad's gift to you.

387
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:10,316
If I have to sell a kidney
for you and Kali, I would.

388
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,325
You deserve some good sex tonight.

389
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,336
Manang Maring,
could we pick up Kali later?

390
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,697
Good morning! Can I take your order?

391
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,906
Do you have iced latte?

392
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,825
-Yeah!
-Two. Medium.

393
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,076
Okay, two.

394
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,994
Just a moment.

395
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,163
Thanks.

396
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,387
Can we borrow the menu?

397
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:22,972
Sure!

398
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,516
Just a bit.

399
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,559
Okay.

400
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,479
Did you make this film?

401
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,525
Yes, I did.

402
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,611
I used to make films like these, too.

403
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,864
Films with a cause.

404
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,242
Keep it up.

405
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,459
Thank you.

406
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,712
Come on, Kali.

407
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,758
Let’s go up the stairs. Let’s go.

408
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,178
Let’s go.

409
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:10,853
Get up! School time! School.

410
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,730
Kali.

411
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,567
Teacher Dan, he seems unwilling.

412
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,032
Kali, it’s school time.

413
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,909
-Are you sure?
-Yes, yes. Alright then.

414
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,706
-Don’t forget your bag, Kali.
-Kali, your bag.

415
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,460
-Come here.
-Go.

416
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,088
Look!

417
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,471
Sorry we’re late!

418
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,901
Kali will start speaking in no time.

419
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,820
That's how it was with Kacey before.

420
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,120
One-on-one sessions.

421
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,913
Every day?

422
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,626
Just once a week.
Same with an occupational therapist.

423
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,169
They have one-on-one sessions too.

424
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,505
How much does it cost?

425
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,261
Same rate for both therapists.

426
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,723
That's 1,500 a week.

427
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,559
On top of tuition here.

428
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,146
Those one-on-one sessions
have been a huge help for my Kacey.

429
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,818
My child's condition
really is for the rich.

430
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,449
That's how it is
when you're a mother, right?

431
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,577
No matter what shape, form,
or condition your child has,

432
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,204
you have to accept.
She’s still your child.

433
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,665
She still comes from you.

434
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,709
I really relate to that.

435
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:59,587
That's why my job is like this for her.

436
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,549
And I sell properties on the side.

437
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,926
-You're a lawyer?
-Yes.

438
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,139
That was my plan too
if I finished my college degree.

439
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:14,602
Finish it. You'll need
a bigger salary for your child.

440
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,606
Especially now that
Tiempo Muerto is coming.

441
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,441
Tiempo Muerto?

442
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:24,612
The sugar cane harvest just ended,
and they're starting to plant again.

443
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,530
Many people are out of work.

444
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,324
No work means no money.

445
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,705
But at least,
you’re lucky you have your husband.

446
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:39,085
Mine, five months after our child
was diagnosed, he just disappeared.

447
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:43,589
I never expected he’d be so weak

448
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,175
that he'd run away
from his responsibility so easily.

449
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,303
Don't let that happen to you.

450
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,183
Damn him.

451
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,527
Ayla, we might wake up Kali.

452
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,615
Ayla.

453
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,533
Kali…

454
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,090
Ayla…

455
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,097
Hey, wait. What’s wrong with you?

456
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,061
Are you okay?

457
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,739
I don't want a dildo, Pao.

458
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,871
Where did that come from?

459
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,141
Calm down. That’s enough.

460
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,613
Whenever Kali holds something,
he drops it or throws it away.

461
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,866
Does he do this at home too?

462
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,545
Would it be better
if he stayed home for now?

463
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,464
He's only turning five.

464
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,469
Kali's age is crucial for his development.

465
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,763
The earlier he learns, the better.

466
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,936
Maybe I could sit with him
while you teach?

467
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,273
At least someone
would be focused on him in class.

468
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,735
I've researched this.

469
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,779
I follow this vlogger,

470
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,447
and according to her,

471
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:58,617
the mother should know the child's needs.

472
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,456
There's supposed to be
someone licensed for that.

473
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,800
I'm Kali's mommy.
Do I need a license to help my child?

474
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,184
I wonder how much they get paid.

475
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:29,398
It's just 15,000 pesos a month.

476
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,988
Pao, that's expensive.

477
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,781
Look at this.

478
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,576
-She's the only affordable one.
-Look.

479
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,495
And it looks like Kali likes her.

480
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,591
Do you have kids of your own?

481
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,761
I do. Snow. My fur baby.

482
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:03,349
Personally,
married life and kids aren't for me.

483
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,353
But I do have five younger siblings here.

484
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,607
I practically raised them
when they were little.

485
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,829
You sit over there.

486
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,265
Here, coffee.

487
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,271
Not many customers here either.

488
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,528
What are you up to?

489
00:44:59,154 --> 00:44:59,988
Nothing.

490
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,246
Kali is so sweet with her.

491
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,373
He's not like that with us.

492
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,921
Kali.

493
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,466
Can you cook?

494
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,550
Oh, look at that.

495
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:05,012
-It's the color green, right?
-But I did it yesterday.

496
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,167
Kali!

497
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,084
Kali!

498
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,221
Get out of there.

499
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,893
Ma’am, let me handle this.

500
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,731
Here, Kali. Look at this!

501
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,907
Hey, here it is.

502
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,584
Come. Let’s prepare dinner.

503
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,803
I'll go get the ingredients
from Aling Maring.

504
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,648
‎Color this.

505
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,193
You’re learning.

506
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,000
-Let's play.
-Pao, get him upstairs.

507
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,586
And you can fold the clothes too.

508
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,337
Yeah.

509
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:05,716
Mama’s going to start working.

510
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,846
Look, there she is. She’s working already.

511
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,682
Come here!

512
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,108
-Please! My boss can hear you.
-Yeah, we’re leaving.

513
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,516
Let's make Mama happy.

514
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,730
Remember…

515
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,776
Papa loves you so much.

516
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,658
Mama loves you dearly, too.

517
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,622
As long as you know that,

518
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,333
I'm happy.

519
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,469
Your boss.

520
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,270
They're still doing videoke, huh?

521
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:50,941
Yeah.

522
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,319
It's almost three o'clock
and they're still not done.

523
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:55,946
Tuff.

524
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,704
Kali's milk is running low.

525
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:12,003
We also need to go back
to the pediatrician.

526
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,263
Is this still a rom-com, Pao?

527
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:45,120
Every rom-com still has its plot points.

528
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,800
Pao?

529
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,517
Are we messing up?

530
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,569
Is this happening to us
because we didn't finish school?

531
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,325
Is it because we had a child early?

532
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,294
I've been thinking about that too.

533
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,926
Maybe…

534
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,096
at first, yeah. Because…

535
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,818
But now…

536
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:09,412
That's what matters.

537
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,378
We won't fail when it comes to Kali.

538
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,757
What about me?

539
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:24,970
What about you?

540
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,430
Me…

541
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,851
Am I failing as a mom?

542
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,775
Nope.

543
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,362
No, you’re not.

544
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,667
Don’t ever think about it.

545
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,017
I'll take care of Kali for now.

546
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,019
You can head home.

547
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,478
Is Ma'am Ayla not here?

548
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,398
She's at the coffee cart.
We're catching up with Kali there.

549
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,650
He made some artwork earlier.

550
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,568
Really?

551
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,446
Here.

552
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,989
Okay, I have this. Thanks!

553
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,115
Okay, see you.

554
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,287
Kali!

555
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,208
So, you made an artwork. May I see it?

556
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,334
Let me see.

557
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,962
Give it to Papa? Let me see.

558
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,602
Did you make this, son?

559
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,136
Ayla!

560
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,063
The straws!

561
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,287
‎Wait a minute.

562
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:54,841
Ayla.

563
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,593
it's Kali.

564
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,601
Pao.

565
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,397
It's been an hour
and his fever’s not going down.

566
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,275
The medicine isn't working.

567
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:16,029
I’ll do this.

568
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,414
If his fever doesn't go down soon,
let's take him to the hospital.

569
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,465
-Over here! Here.
-Where!?

570
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,477
How is he?

571
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,771
His fever is too high.

572
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,669
Please proceed to the cashier, Sir.

573
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,818
The dengue screening test is expensive.

574
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,738
How much do we have in the ATM?

575
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,202
Why?

576
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,747
We just paid Kali's tuition.

577
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,294
Pao, what are we going to do?

578
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:02,969
You just stay here.

579
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,555
Go back to Kali.

580
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,307
I’ll figure this out.

581
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,810
Wait. I'll help you.

582
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,645
-No. I’ll take care of this.
-Pao.

583
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:13,563
Don’t worry.

584
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:15,898
I’ll be back.

585
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,032
Sure, buddy. I'll send something,
but it might not be half.

586
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,411
Okay, Migs. Thanks, man.

587
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,329
I'll pay you back.

588
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:32,415
It's okay, bro.
Text me your account number.

589
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,125
I'll send it right away.

590
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,839
What?

591
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,134
Don't look at me like that.

592
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,347
You're in love with me?

593
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,727
I HEARD FROM JONEL YOU’RE IN NEGROS?

594
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,270
HOW'S YOUR FAMILY?

595
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,689
IF YOU NEED A JOB,
THERE’S ONE HERE IN AUSTRALIA.

596
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,899
JUST LET ME KNOW.

597
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,162
CAN I PLACE AN ORDER?

598
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,539
This one.

599
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,795
Wait.

600
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,047
It's too much.

601
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,715
You make me drunk.

602
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,467
You took advantage of me, huh?

603
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,386
-Thanks.
-You like me, don't you?

604
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,307
You want to take advantage of me, huh?

605
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,435
If only I had something to lend you.

606
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,944
It's really tough raising someone
like Kali with no savings.

607
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,530
Ayla, with or without the condition,

608
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:49,283
it's hard raising a child
here in the Philippines.

609
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,160
It's so easy for others to say,

610
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,912
"Hey, have kids,

611
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,331
because when you get older,
who'll take care of you?"

612
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,752
But how about when you're
already struggling to care

613
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,963
for those who should be taking
care of you in your old age?

614
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,843
If only I could shove back
my three kids inside my vagina,

615
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,179
and even drag my lazy husband along!

616
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,764
Lord, forgive me!

617
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,198
Manang Maring,

618
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,784
could you please
watch over Kali for a bit?

619
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,745
Sure! I can handle this.

620
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,873
-I'll go help Pao.
-Okay.

621
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,708
-Go ahead.
-Thanks, Manang.

622
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,173
Just say sorry.

623
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,009
Thanks!

624
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:45,316
Dammit!

625
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,527
Bro!

626
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,825
Bro, can I borrow this?

627
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,661
-Sure thing, bro.
-I’ll be quick.

628
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,893
Pao!

629
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:21,811
Pao!

630
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,119
Sis, is that Ayla?

631
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:39,453
Ayla?

632
01:06:41,747 --> 01:06:43,499
-You’re here!?
-Denise!

633
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,460
What happened?

634
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:13,487
You can settle your bill now, Mommy.
Then you can go home.

635
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:14,572
Excuse me, Nurse.

636
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,782
Did you transfer the mother
and child from bed 3 to another room?

637
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,743
They’ve already been discharged, Sir.

638
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,624
And if Doc gave you prescriptions,
buy them at the pharmacy downstairs.

639
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,004
They have all you need.

640
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:02,995
Pao.

641
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,958
I've been trying
to call you since earlier.

642
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,878
My phone died.

643
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,091
Let's eat.

644
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:17,384
What about Kali?

645
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,762
Upstairs. Asleep.

646
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,765
Let's eat, Pao.

647
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,391
You didn't wait for me earlier.

648
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,482
Staying there much longer
would count as another day.

649
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:33,317
It adds up to the bill.

650
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,194
Where did you get the money?

651
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,288
I borrowed from Mama.

652
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,082
Borrowed.

653
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:49,375
Pay her back right away.

654
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,421
Let's just do the groceries first.

655
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,841
Pay her back tomorrow, Ayla.

656
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:59,051
She hasn't asked for it yet.

657
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,014
Next payday then. I'll pay her right away.

658
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:06,934
Pao!

659
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,937
Pao!

660
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,940
Rice. Cooking oil. Meat.

661
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:15,234
Vegetables. Soap.

662
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,616
Coffee. Lots of coffee
for the coffee cart.

663
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,120
Pao, we have a lot of things to pay for.

664
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,081
Gas. Electricity. Water.

665
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,876
At least we don't have rent!

666
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:35,588
Then, we'll go over
these expenses next month.

667
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,673
My salary is barely enough
to cover the bills.

668
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,845
Pao, let's set the money aside for now.

669
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,389
It might not be enough to pay her.

670
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:49,768
Pao.

671
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:51,854
Pao.

672
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,023
Pao.

673
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,025
Pao, come on!

674
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:57,818
Paolo!

675
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,071
Pao, what is your issue?
She's Kali's grandmother!

676
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,365
When did she consider Kali a grandchild?

677
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,247
She always says "your child",
"his child" to our son!

678
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,165
Right?

679
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,712
When did she call Kali
her grandchild? Tell me!

680
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:20,132
She was hurt by what happened to us.

681
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:24,428
She wanted to have Kali
aborted before, remember?

682
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,972
Ayla, she never wanted
Kali from the start.

683
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:32,561
How much more now
that our child has this condition?

684
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,356
But what if Mama was right,

685
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,401
that we should have just
aborted Kali back then?

686
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:40,361
Ayla!

687
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,072
What if Kali didn't exist?

688
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:47,326
So he wouldn't have to go
through all of this?

689
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,996
What if he never knew us?!

690
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,500
What if all this time, Pao,
everything was wrong?

691
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:56,961
Are you saying our child is wrong?!

692
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,213
That we are the ones
who are wrong for him?

693
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,273
Denise Javier.

694
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:23,821
Denise Javier. She was my classmate.

695
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,910
I saw her earlier.

696
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,747
What does she have to do with this?

697
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,749
She had plants with her.

698
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,671
She collects plants
from different parts of the Philippines

699
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,256
for her social media.

700
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:43,632
You know what they call them?

701
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,760
She was with Mylene Martinez earlier.

702
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,595
Mylene has a lot of cats.

703
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,931
She calls herself a fur mom!

704
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,809
Ayla, what's your point--

705
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:55,394
Kyd!

706
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,187
Kyd! Another classmate.

707
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,231
Flight attendant in Dubai.

708
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,902
That's always her caption.

709
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,863
Why are you telling me this?

710
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,990
Because maybe we're fools, Pao!

711
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:12,870
Maybe we were stupid to believe in love.

712
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,915
To start a family at this time.

713
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:24,048
Almost all our batchmates
don't care about building a family.

714
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:26,550
Just one-night stands.

715
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,681
But there's no love.

716
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,977
No chance to build a traditional family.

717
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,821
They always say, "How I wish,"

718
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,823
or "When will it happen to me?"

719
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,453
But if they have to choose
between sacrificing or themselves?

720
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,497
They'll choose themselves.

721
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,751
There's nothing wrong with that.

722
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,045
It's practical.

723
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:08,801
But here we are!

724
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:13,597
When we just wanted to make
a difference in college,

725
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,808
we became cliché.

726
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,523
Like right now,
where we need to speak lines in English

727
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:25,401
like a cliché rom-com!

728
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:30,864
Dammit, Pao.

729
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,661
We believed in fantasy!

730
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:42,478
Silent night

731
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:46,565
Holy night

732
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,195
All is calm

733
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:55,741
And all is bright

734
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:59,203
Round yon

735
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:03,373
Virgin Mother and Child

736
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:08,045
Holy infant

737
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:12,466
So tender and mild.

738
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,678
Sleep

739
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:22,392
In heavenly peace

740
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:28,857
Sleep in heavenly peace

741
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,405
Silent night

742
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:40,035
Holy night!

743
01:15:40,118 --> 01:15:44,414
Shepherds

744
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:49,002
Quake at the sight

745
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,255
Glories stream

746
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:56,051
From heaven afar

747
01:15:57,761 --> 01:16:01,098
Heavenly hosts

748
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:05,435
Sing Alleluia

749
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,857
Christ the Savior

750
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:15,821
Is born!

751
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:18,907
Christ the Savior

752
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,951
Is born

753
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,012
What is ABA?

754
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,772
I bet it's expensive, right?

755
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:55,527
Good thing his parents have jobs.

756
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,114
What do they do?

757
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,408
My daughter is a nurse

758
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:04,119
in the Netherlands.
She's been there for two years.

759
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:08,457
My son-in-law is a hotel manager in Dubai.

760
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:14,046
They're about your age.

761
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:17,507
That must be hard,

762
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:21,678
being apart from each other
and far from their child.

763
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:27,351
They realized the truth early on.

764
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,481
Their hope is to save up quickly,

765
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:34,983
so they can return to Milo

766
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,818
and be a family again.

767
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:44,785
Being a parent isn't easy.

768
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:48,830
If being parents is like
being superheroes,

769
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,126
the parents of kids with special needs

770
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,420
are the strongest superheroes.

771
01:17:56,296 --> 01:17:57,172
That's you.

772
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,051
And the best thing about you,

773
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:05,055
like my daughter and her husband,

774
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:09,518
is that you can handle
the daily sadness and hardships

775
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,062
because you have your youth.

776
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,627
Stay here, okay?

777
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,354
That’s my grandchild.

778
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,335
-Did you see Kali?
-Kali!

779
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:20,005
-I left him here.
-Kali!

780
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,007
-He's not here.
-Kali!

781
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,426
-The village security has been alerted.
-Kali!

782
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:28,096
-But maybe he hasn’t gone out yet.
-Kali!

783
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,015
-Kali!
-Kali!

784
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,016
Check there!

785
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,684
Kali!

786
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,478
-Did you check the rear?
-Kali!

787
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:35,937
We already checked there, right?

788
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,023
Kali!

789
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,485
-Kali!
-My God, where did he go?

790
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,197
-Kali!
-Kali!

791
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,281
Kali!

792
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,036
-I hope nothing happened to him.
-Nothing will happen to him!

793
01:19:53,413 --> 01:19:55,373
We failed again, Pao.

794
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,375
Don't be weak, Ayla, okay?

795
01:19:58,376 --> 01:19:59,878
We will find him.

796
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:04,841
After everything we've been through,
we won't give up.

797
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:09,221
If only he could speak,
he could answer my calls.

798
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,473
But our child is like this.

799
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:14,810
Are you giving up, Ayla,
because our child is different?

800
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:20,482
We are the ones who will fight for him,
especially when he can't.

801
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:22,108
Isn't that what superheroes do?

802
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:23,527
Paolo!

803
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,071
Our child is missing! What are you saying!

804
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,158
We are not superheroes!

805
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:31,910
This isn't a movie!

806
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,372
We don't have magic! We don't have powers!

807
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:40,335
I know you're scared.

808
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:44,422
I'm scared too right now.

809
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,802
I'm scared for tomorrow,
for next week, for the coming years.

810
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,638
I don't know what will happen to us,
or to Kali,

811
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:58,478
but I know Kali will grow up,
he will get stronger.

812
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:04,860
He will get stronger
while we grow old and weak.

813
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:08,154
One day, we won't be able
to control him, and that's scary.

814
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,703
And I'm even more scared
that one of these days,

815
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:16,997
we'll be struck by lightning,
get kidnapped.

816
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:19,291
Kidnappers won't get
anything from us, Pao.

817
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:22,544
What if an asteroid
falls on us and we die?

818
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:24,129
Who will take care of him then?

819
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,340
Who will protect Kali from bullies?

820
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:35,932
But you know what I think about the most?

821
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:40,186
That even if I grow old and weak,
I don't care…

822
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,483
I don't care because I know
I have a child to take care of.

823
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,574
Kali is my baby,

824
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:56,161
and even if he doesn't recognize
or know me, I'm his dad.

825
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:03,209
He'll be my baby for a long time
because his development is slow.

826
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,420
Other parents won't experience that

827
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:09,549
because their kids, by 16, 18,
will be hanging out with friends already.

828
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:14,429
And they’ll start their own lives.

829
01:22:19,726 --> 01:22:22,312
But Kali will be my baby for a long time.

830
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,985
And I'm happy with that.

831
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:35,784
And even if I gave up
my dreams for him, it's okay.

832
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,293
Our life is set to extra difficult. But…

833
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:52,217
Dump all the problems on me. I don't care.

834
01:22:57,347 --> 01:23:00,100
Because I've learned to love
because of you two.

835
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,584
Ma'am, we found him.
He's here, at the clubhouse.

836
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,097
-Kali!
-Kali!

837
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,098
Kali!

838
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,225
Kali!

839
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:43,560
-Kali!
-Kali!

840
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:45,270
Kali!

841
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:50,400
-Kali!
-Kali.

842
01:23:51,234 --> 01:23:52,360
Are you okay?

843
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,820
‎Kali.

844
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:58,324
Are you okay? Are you hurt!?

845
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,578
Don't ever do this again!

846
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:03,496
What if something happened to you?

847
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,000
Do you want us to be crying all the time?

848
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:11,880
You scared us.

849
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,230
Did you hear that?

850
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:30,774
He called you Papa.

851
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,193
Can you do that again, son?

852
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,322
He just called me Papa.

853
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:40,617
He just called me Papa!

854
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:45,914
One more time, son. Call me Papa!

855
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:47,332
He said "papa".

856
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,591
One more time, "papa".

857
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:12,107
I still can't believe he spoke, Ayla.

858
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:14,859
Yeah.

859
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,071
It means…

860
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:21,116
what we're doing is working.

861
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,724
But we can't keep living like this.

862
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,815
Always

863
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:58,778
holding our breath, afraid that tomorrow

864
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:02,282
we won't have anything
to withdraw from the ATM.

865
01:26:07,453 --> 01:26:08,288
You…

866
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:13,543
You still have dreams,
and I want you to achieve them.

867
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,133
I want you to become a lawyer,

868
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:24,721
a licensed notary,

869
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,433
winning lots of cases.

870
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,398
And me, I still want to be a filmmaker.

871
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:40,028
A bold filmmaker

872
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,115
who can tell the stories

873
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:48,369
about the corruption in the Philippines.

874
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,706
But also make money.

875
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,549
It's still possible, right?

876
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,846
That we can achieve those things

877
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,641
while raising Kali well?

878
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:20,109
If you can get struck by lightning twice,

879
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:21,361
then why not?

880
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,344
I need to work in Australia, Ayla.

881
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,057
Pao.

882
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,437
It seems like…

883
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,692
going abroad is the best option right now.

884
01:28:03,569 --> 01:28:05,280
Let's endure it, okay?

885
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,866
Like Milo's parents?

886
01:28:13,204 --> 01:28:17,709
Dad has been offering me
a job there for a long time.

887
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,550
But you're angry with him, right?

888
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:31,472
Maybe this is our chance to reconcile.

889
01:28:33,433 --> 01:28:34,851
And your mom…

890
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:40,023
Maybe it's time to let her into our lives.

891
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:47,697
We need a bigger family for Kali.

892
01:29:11,262 --> 01:29:12,513
You're leaving us?

893
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:22,774
I'm just going to save up.

894
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,737
I'll still come back to you.

895
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:32,075
Even though…

896
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:35,787
Australia's healthcare system is great

897
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:42,085
and it's a good place to raise a child,

898
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,590
I still love the Philippines.

899
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,845
I love you and Kali.

900
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:58,142
I'll come back here.

901
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:04,440
I'll come back to Silay.

902
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,903
Because isn't this still our wonderland?

903
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,398
Will you let me?

904
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:39,493
And just like a rom-com,
we ended up at the airport.

905
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:43,497
But at least,
we didn't chase after each other.

906
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,625
No intercutting happened.

907
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,628
But isn't this still cliché?

908
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,923
As cliché as it gets.

909
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,597
Ayla, that's so corny,

910
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,682
but it tickled my butt a bit.

911
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:07,104
Say hi to your mom for me, okay?

912
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,441
Finally, I'll get to hear
her nagging again.

913
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:12,902
I'm excited.

914
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:21,410
Call me as soon as you land, okay?

915
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,042
No drama, right?

916
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:43,576
Pao.
