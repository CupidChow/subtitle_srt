1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,930

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,410

3
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,180

4
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,850

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,510
 What's going on over there?

6
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,790
 Did people die?

7
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,780
 - What's going on? 
 - That makes no sense.

8
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,850
 How could that be?

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,350
 Devour the land,

10
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,330
 or send pestilence among my people,

11
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,310
 if my people, who are called by my name humble themselves

12
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,340
 and pray and seek my face and

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,830
  turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from Heaven,

14
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,290
 and I will forgive their sin and heal their land.

15
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,150
 Now, my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.

16
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,350
 For now, I have chosen and consecrated this house–

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,460
One of the homeless people came down with pneumonia so they gave him medicine for it.

18
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,240
It was donated so they didn't know it caused side effects.

19
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:36,850

20
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,980
 From all over the world, the reports of an infectious disease

21
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,250
 that makes people bite off a person's head and suck their blood, continue to pour in.

22
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,400
 Public health authorities say that they haven't confirmed the facts

23
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,290
 and have drawn the line, but similar incidents are happening domestically as well.

24
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,380
 At a homeless shelter in Seyang city, more than ten homeless people

25
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,830
 have been found dead.

26
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,190
 The authorities say a random fight broke out among the homeless

27
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,290
 who were staying at the shelter, causing these deaths.

28
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,750
 In case of a health hazard–

29
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,160
Are you eating salad again?

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,000
Sae Bom, are you all right?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,830
Yes, I was examined and got a physical.

32
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,990
What in the world is going on here?

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,020
Do you know that your training has been put on hold?

34
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,340
The training site that Lee Jong Tae messed up has been completely shut down.

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,270
Look. This is that guy, right?

36
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,180
Oh, yes. Gosh, he's pretty powerful, I guess.

37
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,320
What if something really happens at this rate?

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,210
If people start going crazy like that all of a sudden,

39
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,280
there is some medicine for treatment, isn't there?

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,190
I don't know. I think they're making an effort, but...

41
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,440
I got a call from reporter Ki Joo.

42
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,180
He says he'll pay me if I tell him what happened here.

43
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,350
Me, too. Gosh, he must've called all the team members.

44
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,550
Hey. Don't talk to people like that.

45
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,560
We signed the nondisclosure agreement.

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,320
Right.

47
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,720
- Are you back now? 
 - No.

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,190
I'm on paid vacation, for six months.

49
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,610
I packed up my stuff to move and sent them over. I stopped by to say hi.

50
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,550
Are you leaving the civil servant dorm? You put a lot into decorating that place.

51
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,820
I'm fine.

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,870
I got my own place. An apartment.

53
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,940
- A loan? 
 - No. Do you remember the score count I mentioned?

54
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,610
The special provision on a public rental and sales of housing program for police officers.

55
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,190
I remember. Service evaluation and apprehension performance.

56
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,840
Even though I got the highest score, it wasn't high enough.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,460
So I decided to get points for being a newlywed.

58
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,800
Well, so... you're getting married because you're short on points?

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,420
Yes.

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,300
- To whom? 
 - A guy who asked me out when I was younger.

61
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
I had rejected him,

62
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,070
but I asked him if he was still interested.

63
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,700
 It's not because I think you're easy.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:31,590
 I... have a dream of living in my own house.

65
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,620
 That's why.

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,660
 This is in place of your clothes that were incinerated.

67
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,600
 Thank you. I feel like I got closer to you.

68
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,640
 So cold.

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,270
 - Are you short on points? 
 - That is true, but...

70
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,710
 I'm saying this because I'm interested in you.

71
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,260
 You're pretty good-looking, and you're able to make a good living.

72
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,490
 Hey, I'm better than you think. Graduating from school two years late is not an issue at all!

73
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,690
 On top of that, it's a brand-new apartment. You'll regret it if you miss this chance.

74
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:27,230
 Hey, there aren't a lot of decent people like me out there.

75
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,430
 Fine.

76
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,220
 I'm asking you... to marry me.

77
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,000
 I know what you're asking. I like it, too.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,260
He said he likes it.

79
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,330
I see. Oh... Well...

80
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,270
He said he likes the idea.

81
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,020
Okay. Congratulations on getting married.

82
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,370
Well, you know...

83
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,140
- When do you move in? 
 - Today.

84
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,500
This is the scratch I got from Lee Jong Tae, but it's not healing quickly.

85
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
It's not infected?

86
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,930
No. They want to draw my blood every two weeks.

87
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,930
Are you okay?

88
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,260
What? Oh, I'm fine.

89
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,330

90
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,290
Aren't you going to answer the phone?

91
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,310
Yes. I'm leaving.

92
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,270

93
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,990
I'm going home right now.

94
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,760
I'll start unpacking things when they arrive. You can take your time.

95
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,120
 - Okay.  
 - Bye.

96
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,090
You're so devoted.

97
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,730

98
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,990

99
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,030

100
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,230
Sergeant, did you give it some thought?

101
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,000
How much can you give me?

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,280
I spoke to my director,

103
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,900
and if you have an internal video clip, only for us,

104
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,290
we can probably give you the maximum amount you want.

105
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,940
Hurry and get in. Let's discuss it comfortably.

106
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,390
 Hang on.

107
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,990
 It's okay. It's okay.

108
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,990
 Seung Hyun, what are you doing?

109
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,950
Here.

110
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,530
- Thank you. 
 - How do you remember a photo from twelve years ago?

111
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,460
I almost died back then.

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,830
Anyway, congratulations on pulling through. Although I never thought you'd do it this way.

113
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,500
- Move, move, move. 
 - What is it?

114
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,620
It's my gift.

115
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,460
My wife started a side job.

116
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,660
Don't worry! She's fine. She's healthy.

117
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,530
This can be packaged and delivered so advertise it in the apartment.

118
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,190
That will only be tough on your wife. Why don't you make some rice cake?

119
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,130
And the background information on Han Tae Seok that you asked about...

120
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll advertise very hard. What is it?

121
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,450
He's an infectious diseases specialist. There's a program that sends a few military academy cadets to medical schools.

122
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,240
He got a specialist license through that program, then served as an army doctor and got discharged.

123
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,730
After he was discharged, he worked for a pharmaceutical company.

124
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,480
Something called Competitive Edge Team Leader. Something like that.

125
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,320
And...

126
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,200
It's a picture of him when he was on trial for assaulting a pharmaceutical company's CEO.

127
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,000
He didn't seem like that type of person.

128
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,460
Usually, the calm and gentle ones are scarier when they go crazy.

129
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,950
Anyway, he was unexpectedly found not guilty, and he returned to the military.

130
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,290
To the Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters.

131
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,560
That's weird.

132
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,460
Anyway, don't get mixed up with him.

133
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,630
You might get hurt by hanging around trouble.

134
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,110
- All right. 
 - See you.

135
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,460
And let me know if you need more rice cakes.

136
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,920
- Okay. 
 - Bye.

137
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,110
I don't want to get mixed up with him, either, but I have a feeling I'm going to keep seeing him around.

138
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:17,110

139
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,180
 That trainee whom I gave first aid. I keep thinking about him.

140
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,040
 What about him?

141
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,920
 I heard he's not doing well.

142
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,340
 Just like Lee Jong Tae.

143
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,910
 He can't see his family, either.

144
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,580
 I asked the guys who were dispatched to the CDCH to look into him,

145
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,340
 but they say you don't walk out alive once you go in there.

146
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,920
 - Yet I came out. 
 - Yes.

147
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,060
 Only you did. Only you.

148
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,320
 I wonder if they're doing okay there.

149
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,190
 What if they all die there?

150
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,120
It's tough to become happy.

151
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,830
Gosh, you scared me.

152
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,130
Sorry. Be careful.

153
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,850
- I'm sorry. 
 - Sorry.

154
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,440
That scared me.

155
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,300
Fifth floor, please. Thank you.

156
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,790
Please wear your mask inside.

157
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,680
Okay. I'm sorry.

158
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,630

159
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,320
Your clothes...

160
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,040
Where did you buy that?

161
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,810
It looks like the real thing, not a fake.

162
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm an SOU officer.

163
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,330
S... S... Are you really an SOU officer?

164
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,780
A counter-terrorism tactic agent?

165
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,990
Yes.

166
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,460
Could you get me an SOU T-shirt?

167
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,440
The one that says SOU in the front and Special Operations Unit in the back. In large.

168
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,560
I'll look into it. A large?

169
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,170
Yes, please. That would be nice.

170
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,960
I live on the fifteenth floor.

171
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,930
How peculiar.

172
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,400
You're early.

173
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,610
We moved. We should eat black bean noodles or sweet and sour pork.

174
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,990
I knew it. I have already found some good places for delivery.

175
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,280
Hey, you had a photo of us?

176
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,570
Hyung Jung Gook had a digital file of it.

177
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,470
I printed it.

178
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,650
Do you not like it?

179
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,470
Well...

180
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,940
But you weren't exactly in a good place back then. Do you like it?

181
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,170
 Hey! Stand straight!

182
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,460
 Okay, ready?

183
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,050
 One, two, three!

184
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,790
 Look at this photo when you're having a hard time, and live diligently!

185
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,850
There.

186
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,020
Well, you said the city hall could come

187
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,170
and check if we're really married.

188
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,350
I guess we could explain why we got married with this.

189
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,170
It's an intense motivation.

190
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,900
Right, right. It looks like we have a story there.

191
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,250
It's good that I have handcuffs on.

192
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,660
When would I ever get to put on handcuffs?

193
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,210
Are you going to pass out rice cakes?

194
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,380
It's Hyung Jung Gook's side job. He wants me to advertise for him.

195
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,910
- I'll go and pass these out– 
 - No. I'll go.

196
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,250
You clean up the house and order the noodles. Order an extra large for me.

197
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,260
Okay. Be careful.

198
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,910
Okay.

199
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,130
 Who is it?

200
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,660
I just moved in. Are there any adults home?

201
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,460
Hi.

202
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,060
We will enjoy the food.

203
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,240
Bye.

204
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,940
It doesn't open.

205
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,230
From here, the lower floors are for rent, and the upper floors are for general sale.

206
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,080
They blocked the door so people can't come up from downstairs.

207
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,590
You know all kinds of things.

208
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,900
Of course, I know everything.

209
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,980
People at school call me dirt poor.

210
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,130
How do people come down from upper floors?

211
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,300
By the elevators.

212
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,230
I see.

213
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,080
- Are you going down? 
 - Yes.

214
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,910
One unit is empty, and a lady lives in the other unit, but she didn't come home last night.

215
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,130
You're a know-it-all, right?

216
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,410
That feels better.

217
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,850
- Are you allowed to do this? 
 - What?

218
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,370
It's in violation of fire department regulations.

219
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,320
If they complain, I can just report them.

220
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,680
I see.

221
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,790
See you next time.

222
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,170
The insurance company always speaks of 50/50.

223
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,070
Keeping a safe distance and looking ahead. Right?

224
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,040
No need to pay attention to their parroting. I saw the video clip.

225
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,690
Going with 9:1 is plenty possible.

226
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,700
I'm from unit 501. I just moved in today. Here is a rice cake.

227
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,940
Just a moment, Sir.

228
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,110
Since we're neighbors, I'll give you a free consultation. Stop by anytime

229
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,420
and tell me.

230
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,970
Yes, Sir. You can do that.

231
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,850

232
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,670

(T/N: Hae Sung sounds like comet in Korean)

233
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,480
"Attorney Gook Hae Sung, appearing out of nowhere like a comet when you're in a bind."

234
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,340
That's a different matter. Yes.

235
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,360
Please call me after checking into that.

236
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,460
I think that's a different matter.

237
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,710
Yes, yes. Of course. Call me anytime.

238
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,130
Yes, thank you.

239
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,120
Yes.

240
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,630
- Who was it? 
 - The unit downstairs.

241
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,610
She moved in.

242
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,440
But you threw away the food.

243
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,750
You were an attorney's secretary and now his wife. How come you're not suspicious at all?

244
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,880
You shouldn't eat food that a stranger gives you.

245
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,150
So you're saying the woman downstairs gave us poisoned rice cake to kill us?

246
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,500
Honey! You have a sickness in your heart.

247
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,340
So Yoon, I was a public defender. I have been awakened

248
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,660
to a person's wickedness early on.

249
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,770
Yes. Please do a consultation as a public defender.

250
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,700
I think he needs a lawyer.

251
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,990
Seriously...

252
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,570

253
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:00,160
Of course, you will, man.

254
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,920
I'm sure the cops are on their way to your house right now.

255
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,120

256
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,130

257
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
Who are you?

258
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,530
Hello.

259
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,280
I moved in downstairs. I wanted to give you some rice cake.

260
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:03,620
I don't like flour.

261
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,100
Rice cake. It's rice.

262
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,560

263
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,650
Nice to meet you, too!

264
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,480
Honey.

265
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,140
Honey!

266
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,110
Yes? You're home.

267
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,260
I rang the bell. Why didn't you come out?

268
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I was washing my hair. Does the door lock not work? Why ring the bell today?

269
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,160
I didn't ring the bell. Someone came up from downstairs.

270
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,640
The place is small as is, and the security sucks, too.

271
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:53,090
Hey, Min Ji, let's wash your hands. You have to wash your hands when you come home. Within twenty seconds.

272
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,820
Are you taking your medicine? Wait a minute.

273
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,120
Here is your water.

274
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,700
I received five complaints today alone.

275
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,860
I don't know why they have asked for so much when they're getting a few shots of the fillers.

276
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,070
This is why I didn't want to run a skincare franchise.

277
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,920
I'm sorry. It's such a hassle for you because of me.

278
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,370
I'll make you your favorite refreshing tangerine cocktail.

279
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,010
What in the world? It's as hard as a rock. I'll have to massage it for you.

280
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,970
First, should we go for a tangerine cocktail first? Madam...

281
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,910
You're being good today.

282
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,950

283
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,060
Let's eat 20 of them and order a free small sweet and sour pork.

284
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,670
Okay.

285
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,270
And this.

286
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,850
What is it?

287
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:40,090
A contract that says if this place is up for sale in ten years, we'll put both of our names on the title.

288
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,290
You understand the 6:4 ratio, right? I brought in more points.

289
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,720
Of course, you even saved my life.

290
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,950
- Right? 
 - Yes.

291
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,730
I wanted to have a herringbone pattern for the floor, but I don't feel right about tearing apart the new floor.

292
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,710
Still, this is clean and simple.

293
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,440
I can't believe it. A place of my own.

294
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,300
For a natural look, a white or beige curtain should look good, right?

295
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,760
Do we need to put up blinds for the veranda?

296
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,260
I think the lighting is good, but I'll buy a few interior lights.

297
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,840
- It'll be nice if we bring in some workout equipment. 
 - Sounds good.

298
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,430
The stainless steel is nice for the kitchen sink.

299
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,330
But this is brand new, too.

300
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,890
I guess I'll switch it after using it for a while.

301
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,050
Should we change only the faucets? For the bathroom and the kitchen?

302
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,030
Sure.

303
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,020
I'll have to make lots of money.

304
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,290
But it's still nice. It's worth making money.

305
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,910
True. I'll work hard to make more money.

306
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,540
Fighting!

307
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,200
Well, you said someone from the city hall could come.

308
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,870
Should I change it? Should I move it?

309
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,160
No, you did well. We should be meticulous with everything.

310
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,430
When I was little, we had our house.

311
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:39,890
I don't know where it went wrong, but we kept moving into smaller houses. We ultimately ended up in a basement room.

312
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,130
Seriously, just one room.

313
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,670
- While you were in high school? 
 - Yes.

314
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,390
I'd be out all day, but then I had to go home and sleep.

315
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,210
I'd stay out as long as I could, then I'd go home.

316
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,280
In that small room, everyone was lying next to each other, sleeping.

317
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,610
Mom and Dad were yelling at each other and fighting every day.

318
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:18,100
I tried to endure it, but if I couldn't bear it any longer, I'd take my dad's key and go out.

319
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,730
 I can't stand this! All you do is...

320
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,400
♫  She never cries  ♫

321
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,150
I wished I had my own space.

322
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,960
Entirely my own space.

323
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,430
I'm almost there.

324
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,330
Earth can't go down in ruins like this.

325
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,350
♫  She loves to take a photograph  ♫

326
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:30,950
♫  She loves to have her cup of tea  ♫

327
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:36,760
♫  With smile, with smile  ♫

328
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,320
♫  She never cries  ♫

329
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,400
♫  Because of the loneliness  ♫

330
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,920
♫  She never cries  ♫

331
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,100
Good night.

332
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,500
♫  Than sadness and sorrow  ♫

333
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,550
 You'll turn like this, too.

334
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,110
What's wrong?

335
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,010
What are they doing in the middle of the night?

336
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,020
Should I try going up?

337
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:02,050
No. I just got startled.

338
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,360
Hello.

339
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,760

340
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,960
Right now?

341
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,130
- Who was it? 
 - What?

342
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,600
This hyung I know. About an investigation.

343
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,140
Sleep more. You're on vacation.

344
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,540
Why are you taking Sae Bom's blood? She's exhausted as is.

345
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,610
I won't take that much blood. You married her thanks to me. Stop complaining.

346
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,950
Why is that thanks to you? It was completely due to my own abilities.

347
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,900
Yoon Sae Bom would've never asked you to marry her had I not given her the points she asked for.

348
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,440
You're pretty good at coming into other people's apartments.

349
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,840
You saw the news about the homeless shelter, right?

350
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,620
I saw.

351
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,700
This afternoon, there will be news that says Next was passed out to the homeless.

352
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,140
Out of concern for side effects, we'll retrieve everything that is out in the market.

353
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,360
If anyone sells them illegally, they will be severely punished.

354
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,340
That's the conclusion that the government came to.

355
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,640
Why are you telling me all that?

356
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,420
We should investigate this together.

357
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,960
The Ministry of Public Administration and Security has sent a letter requesting cooperation of your station.

358
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,140
I'm rather busy.

359
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,980
As you can see, I'm...

360
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,360

361
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,040
Yes, Chief.

362
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,610
Yes.

363
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,970
Do we have to work on that?

364
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,880
Yes, I should. Who else would?

365
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,560
So...

366
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,590
what should we do first?

367
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,570
This is Lee Jong Tae's cell phone.

368
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:04,720
It's unlocked so meet the dealer pretending you're Lee Jong Tae and arrest him.

369
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,710
Is Lee Jong Tae cooperating in the investigation?

370
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,760
Sort of.

371
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,420
But do you know the toughest thing about narcotics investigations?

372
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,920
Guys like this are extremely suspicious and very greedy.

373
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,490
Half the time, you can't meet them unless you pay them in advance, but it's not like the police has money or anything.

374
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm not saying this because I don't want to help out. The investigation can't proceed–

375
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,880
Use it for the investigation costs.

376
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,720
Keep your receipts of as much as you can and return the leftover amount.

377
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,280
I heard that you used to work at a pharmaceutical company.

378
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,140
Some kind of competitive team...

379
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,310
Competitive Edge Team. It was a department that was set out to steal other company's drugs.

380
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,050
I wasn't too good at creating one, but I was pretty good at stealing it.

381
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,270
Also good at beating people up, right?

382
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,780
Call me when you're about to arrest the dealer. I'll participate in it as an observer.

383
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,330
Exactly how much is this?

384
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,410
You won't say it's the wrong amount later, will you?

385
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,070
Sergeant Jung Yi Hyun.

386
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,780
I heard your nickname is Great Detective.

387
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,740
Since you always solve cases with logic.

388
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,730
They call me Reckless Yet Lucky Detective internally.

389
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,330
Because I do things unconventionally, but it ends up being right, strangely.

390
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,300
There's a bias that says athletes aren't that smart.

391
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,990
Please show us through this opportunity that you're both intelligent and physically fit.

392
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,740
I really hate that guy.

393
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,560

394
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,490
Hi, what's up, Mom.

395
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,850
 I heard you moved into the apartment yesterday,  but you didn't even call me.

396
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,550
Must I hear about you through Yi Hyun?

397
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,810
Mom, I'm having a hard time.

398
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,560
I had to take an infectious disease test and all.

399
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,620
 I took the coronavirus test more than five times.

400
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,990
Not that one. The infectious disease that makes you take a bite out of people.

401
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,490
Madman Rabies?

402
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,020
There's a name for it?

403
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,810
Yes, because it's similar to rabies.

404
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,980
I heard people could get rabies.

405
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,250
 Gosh. People who have dogs as pets are going crazy these days.

406
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,720
Right. Anyway, that one.

407
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,670
I took the test for it, and I am quarantining at the apartment.

408
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,280
I even dreamed of tearing into people last night.

409
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,490
Really?

410
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,850
How about Yi Hyun? Is it okay if he stays with you?

411
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,300
Of course.

412
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,650
We're truly in love.

413
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:10,170
I'll get better real soon and call you when we set the date for our wedding.

414
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,620
I'm coughing. I'll hang up.

415
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,620
I have to go grocery shopping.

416
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:01,710

417
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,140

418
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,860
- Hi. 
 - Hello.

419
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,540
What's that? A letter to challenge me for a fight?

420
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,440
Guess not.

421
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,260

422
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,130
So pretty. Thanks.

423
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,790
You know they deliver, right?

424
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,620
Yes, Myungwon Rice Cake.

425
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,090
If you want to eat rice cakes later, tell your family about that place.

426
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,920
Unni, are you really a police officer?

427
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,480
Of course, I am.

428
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,830
Look.

429
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,660

430
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,400
It's better than just the police.

431
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,580
When I get healthy, I want to be just like you, Unni.

432
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,260
- Are you sick right now? 
 - A little bit.

433
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,880
I was very sick before so I couldn't go to school for two years.

434
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,970
Really?

435
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,770
Yes, but I'm perfectly fine now.

436
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,510
You'll be much stronger than me so...

437
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:34,470
don't you ever worry. Really.

438
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,370
Thanks for this.

439
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,780
Where are you going?

440
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,860
To fight.

441
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,630
How can I help you?

442
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,410
I'm from downstairs. It was noisy throughout the night. Are you doing construction?

443
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,360
I'm sorry. I was moving my furniture.

444
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,120
In the middle of the night?

445
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,470
I have a pretty good drive.

446
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,710
If I feel like it, I have to see it through. I'm sorry.

447
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,410
That's not a drive. It's a sickness.

448
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,460
It won't happen again.

449
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,040
Please.

450
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,470
Oh, thank you for the rice cakes.

451
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,390
How did you know I gave it to you? We never met.

452
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,080
I heard.

453
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,330
She takes after you as her mom. Hey, girl, you're pretty.

454
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,860
Have you ever seen that man before?

455
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,430
I've been in the elevator with him a few times. I guess he's not interested in other people.

456
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,130
He and his wife are both doctors, but I heard he stays home.

457
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,060
My mom says that they have some legal issues.

458
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,210
It could also be that he likes not working.

459
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,220
Bye now.

460
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,450
How about you, Unni?

461
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,450
Me? I'm going to work out.

462
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,970
Goodbye.

463
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,250
Do you stay home alone?

464
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,460
My dad makes deliveries. My mom helps him with sorting in the morning.

465
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,630
How about school?

466
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm doing the field study at home.

467
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,750
If I tell the school in advance these days, I can miss nineteen days of school.

468
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,090
Follow me.

469
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,990
We'll do physical education today. Let's do a field study.

470
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,760
I see. Here it is.

471
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,230

472
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,610
Hello.

473
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,670
It's nice.

474
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,560
Hello.

475
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,730
Hello.

476
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,970
I'm a resident. I heard I can use it anytime.

477
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,280
Give me a moment.

478
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,430
You can bring in your workout shoes and towels.

479
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,670
Please write down your address.

480
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,890
Hi.

481
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,640
Hello.

482
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,240
Are you going to work out, too?

483
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,360
Yes.

484
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,910
Here.

485
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,280
Thank you.

486
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,740

487
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,720
Well, the renters cannot use the facility.

488
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,520
Why not? Because of the maintenance fee?

489
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,510
Yes, that, too, but because of the cost of the workout equipment.

490
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,990
The homeowners have purchased it, but it's not fair for the renters to use them.

491
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,370
- Some people feel that way. 
 - I see.

492
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,130
Okay. I'll train at home.

493
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,690
Wait, ma'am.

494
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:12,630
If you hire me as your personal trainer, I can overlook that.

495
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,450
I'm going to do home training.

496
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,150
- Did you know about that? 
 - Yes.

497
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,790
Why didn't you tell me?

498
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:25,370
I thought you might be able to resolve the problem.

499
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,490
Isn't there a method like that fire department regulations?

500
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,340
Well, it doesn't work out that well when money is on the line.

501
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,330
But there still is a way.

502
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,730
- One! 
 - One!

503
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,680
- Two! 
 - Two!

504
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,250
- Three! 
 - Three!

505
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,610
Slowly.

506
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,400
- Four. 
 - Four.

507
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,190
Good! Five!

508
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,340
Five!

509
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,800
Let's go on the glider.

510
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,120
♫  In my life, that's okay  ♫

511
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,560
♫  Like the thousands of days  ♫

512
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,280
What do they teach you in your sports class at school?

513
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,890
Running.

514
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,100
Are you a good runner?

515
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,590
No.

516
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,930
I'm really good at it.

517
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,850
♫  Dreaming keeps you forever  ♫

518
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:17,010
♫  No one knows what lies ahead, ahead  ♫

519
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,060
♫  Sometimes life gets so hard  ♫

520
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,640
♫  Like no one else  ♫

521
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,600
♫  By myself against the world  ♫

522
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,300

523
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,160
♫  I know you because  ♫

524
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,990

525
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:47,320
♫  And I know miracles only happen in here  ♫

526
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,720
♫  Believe  ♫

527
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,370
♫  So carry on like you've never failed  ♫

528
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,170
♫  Love like you've never been hurt  ♫

529
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,020
♫  Carry on like you've never failed  ♫

530
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,510
♫  Carry on  ♫

531
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,810
♫  Not knowing what lies ahead  ♫

532
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:11,750
♫  Not knowing what lies ahead  ♫

533
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,690
You exercised so get some rest.

534
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,010
Goodbye.

535
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,280
♫  I don't know...  ♫

536
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,470
So cute.

537
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,530
♫  What lies ahead  ♫

538
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,490
♫  Let me...  ♫

539
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,590
Hey.

540
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,510
 Sae Bom.

541
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,800
 Help me.

542
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,550
I got a scratch from the trainee that day.

543
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,380
I got scared so I couldn't tell you.

544
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,890
But the wound won't heal.

545
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,750
Where are you right now?

546
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,910
I'll be right over.

547
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,520
It's okay.

548
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,790
Look at me. I'm fine.

549
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:04,190
If you get some rest after the test today, you should be fine.

550
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,710
I'll tell your wife that you're not having an affair.

551
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,680
I get scared when I think that I might be dying.

552
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,510
Why would you be dying?

553
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,690
You didn't get bitten. Look at me.

554
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,120
It's nothing. Really.

555
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,500
You'll get tested today, get checked out, then you'll be fine.

556
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,430
I'll ask if you can get some bonus points.

557
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,310
You're not thirsty or anything, are you?

558
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,490
We have one more patient.

559
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,140
I'll take a look at your wound.

560
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,510
Are you sure you got scratched?

561
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,070
It looks like it was slashed with a knife.

562
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,190
Pretty recently at that.

563
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,610
I wish that was the case.

564
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,710
My wound wouldn't heal quickly, either.

565
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:56,370
It doesn't look too serious.

566
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,480
Let me examine it.

567
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,710
My gosh.

568
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,390
Does it look different if there is a problem?

569
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,200
The color.

570
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,550
The cut area changes to dark red.

571
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,060
Please stay here until the test is completed.

572
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,340
Aren't you going to take these off?

573
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,990
That'll do, right?

574
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,810
Tell me if you get thirsty.

575
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:48,600
Yoon Sae Bom, come out for a minute.

576
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,110
I told you. I said you'll be fine.

577
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,540
I'll go and draw my blood. Stay here.

578
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,790
I'm fine.

579
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,490
Nothing will happen.

580
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,220
I'll just make some money and go.

581
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,800
It's okay.

582
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,210
If something like this happens again, tell me in advance.

583
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,710
I don't want to be shocked.

584
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,050
I got it. Will you please open the bag?

585
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,640
I'm trying to be nice to you even though I don't like you.

586
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,950
Do you know our trainee? The one that Lee Jong Tae bit.

587
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,150
I heard he's not doing well.

588
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,080
And that he refused to see his family.

589
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,210
If you're bitten, you get infected no matter what.

590
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:09,020
Your condition worsens, and the duration in your normal state shortens.

591
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:14,670
You never know when he'll get thirsty and will attack people. So, of course, he can't have any visitors.

592
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,350
Is there a way to treat him?

593
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,900
As of now, there is no treatment.

594
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,090
Once they get worse, they are always thirsty.

595
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:29,380
They become irrational and attack people whenever they see them.

596
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:35,190
What we can do for now is to slow down the deterioration.

597
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,930
Then it's true that no one leaves here alive.

598
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,720
You were extremely lucky, Yoon Sae Bom.

599
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,780
If all goes well, Lee Seung Hyun will be okay as well.

600
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,740
Are you bored? Do you want to eat something?

601
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,860
Where are you right now?

602
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,870
I have a family.

603
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,700
If I die in vain like this, they'll keep my death a secret.

604
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,230
 Sae Bom, there is a way

605
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,760
where my safety is guaranteed, and I can make some money.

606
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,660
Hello? Hey, Lee Seung Hyun!

607
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,290
 The call is not going through. After the beep...

608
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,280
 I wonder if they're doing okay there.

609
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,180
 What if they all die there?

610
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,170
 I got a call from reporter Ki Joo.

611
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,250
 He says he'll pay me if I tell him what happened here.

612
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,090
He snuck out, wearing the hazmat suit inside out.

613
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,890
They thought he was moving chairs.

614
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,490
Where do you keep the critical patients?

615
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,010
Where are they?

616
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,160
We isolated them in the low-temperature warehouse where the food ingredients are stored.

617
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,870
But we had to move them elsewhere since the number of people kept increasing.

618
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,480
So where is that exactly?

619
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,440
In the refrigerated truck.

620
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:02,100

621
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,060

622
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,080
Make the deposit first.

623
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,540
Then I'll send you the video clip right away.

624
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,770
I'm recording our conversation right now. Don't think about lying to me later.

625
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,100
Deposit half, at least! S***!

626
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,470
Call me after making the deposit.

627
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:39,060
This is seriously breaking news.

628
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,740

629
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,200
You said he's in there. Why aren't we going in?

630
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,130
Someone is supposed to show up.

631
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,750
Who? Did you call for extra support?

632
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,880
Here comes the tiger.

633
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,380
What? Aigoo. You're Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok.

634
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,520
What brings you here to this shabby location?

635
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:45,220
I'd like Sergeant Jung and me to meet the dealer. Are you okay with that?

636
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,090
Yes, of course.

637
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,820
I'll stay put here.

638
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,420
- Hey, you– 
 - I know, I know!

639
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,720
Hold the line here.

640
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,060
So annoying.

641
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,620
But what are we doing here?

642
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,440
They were keeping the remaining Next inside the pharmaceutical company storage.

643
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,520
I wanted to find out who distributed it on the market.

644
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,280
It looks like this infectious disease is causing havoc abroad, according to the news.

645
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,920
Did Next get sold globally?

646
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,140
I told you I'm not good at creating something, but I'm good at stealing it.

647
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,130
I stole that drug from abroad when I was part of the Competitive Edge team.

648
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,330
How impressive.

649
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,920
There are three people.

650
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,470
Geez, turn off the headlight!

651
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,670
You brought the money, right?

652
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,090
But where is Lee Jong Tae?

653
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,580
Lee Jong Tae, that asshole.

654
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,000
You can't get in touch with him, right?

655
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,240
There are two.

656
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,450
There are three.

657
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,080
The drug.

658
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,130
Trunk. In the trunk.

659
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,540
Cuff him for me.

660
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,550
Jerks, you're all dead.

661
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,760
What was that?

662
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,100
It's a Glock. Have you never seen one?

663
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,160
Why do you carry something like this!

664
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,030
What the hell are you doing?

665
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,100
Making sure he's dead.

666
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,580
Killing a person in front of a cop?

667
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:42,650
Does he look like a person to you, Jung Yi Hyun?

668
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,710
Hands up, everyone!

669
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,900
Hands up!

670
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,080
It's over. It's over.

671
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,560
Oh, really? Geez.

672
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,850
Hey! How many shots did you fire?

673
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:12,300
It's a good thing we're not in a residential area. You might get disciplined!

674
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,570
Did you fire all the shots?

675
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,130
Please!

676
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,840
When did he turn like that?

677
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,860
I don't know, s***!

678
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,050
I went inside the house to get the money from him, and he was like that. He bit his entire family and killed them.

679
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:47,230
He was banging his head in a puddle of blood.

680
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,740
Did he take Next?

681
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:50,360
He took a lot of it.

682
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,330
He went totally mad, and he's been like that ever since.

683
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,000
And you did that to a sick person?

684
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,260
Then what else should I have done?

685
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:01,720
He's the best watchdog I don't have to feed.

686
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,760
You guys took the drug, too, right?

687
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,870
You'll soon turn like that.

688
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,150
- Bastard. 
 - Yes.

689
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,270
Got it.

690
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,990
Jung Yi Hyun, there's a problem at the dorm.

691
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,780
So?

692
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,070
Yoon Sae Bom is there.

693
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,410
Why did she go over there?

694
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:54,480
 They're not human.

695
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,300
Who?

696
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,370
 Everyone here.

697
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,930
Quiet!

698
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,880
Open this.

699
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,680
Hurry!

700
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,650
No! Don't open it!

701
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:29,080

702
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:50,330

703
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,370
 Be honest.

704
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,960
 You're seeing those people as monsters.

705
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,570
 They said to stop the investigation.

706
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,430
 The rabies is spreading throughout the apartment.

707
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,560
 It's true that you go crazy if you take that drug, right?

708
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,570
 Bad rumors don't help the real estate price.

709
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,800
 Block everything as planned.

710
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,250
 Are we locking them in and waiting for them to die?

711
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:15,960
 That lady upstairs. There was definitely something about her.

712
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,500
 What is happening in that house right now?
