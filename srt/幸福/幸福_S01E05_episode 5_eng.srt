1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060

2
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,500

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,560

4
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,290
Seo Yoon, I'm back!

5
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,350
Mom?

6
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,120
 The call cannot be connected so...

7
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,060
Is there something going on outside?

8
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,420
Oh, this? It's dangerous if people try to bite you.

9
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,790
I can't reach Mom.

10
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,840
I even texted her just now.

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,690

12
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,870

13
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,470
I think there's a problem with the base station. I'm sure you'll be able to reach her later.

14
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,080
If someone knocks, don't ever open the door.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,390
I will be back quickly so just watch TV, okay?

16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,180
But the TV doesn't work either.

17
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,760
What?

18
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,070

19
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,920

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,980
I think that's enough now.

21
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
We have to block it more.

22
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,860
You saw them earlier.

23
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,330
Go over there and get some rest.

24
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,920
Okay.

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Hyung, keep your eyes on him.

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,060
Okay.

27
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,750
Hey, hey, hey. Don't look over here.

28
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,760
Look at the wall. The wall.

29
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,950

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,960
Why? You said the infected are outside.

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,700
But it's too quiet.

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,300
Hey, hey, hey! Look at the wall.

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,920
What is all this?

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,460
Ahjussi, what are you doing right now?

35
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,350
Well...

36
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,270
What is this?

37
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:45,900

38
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,890
Why isn't it working all of a sudden? There are more than 1,000 people who are logged in.

39
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,620
- Dong Hyun.
 - What?

40
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,730
About the symptoms of Madman Rabies...

41
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,060
Do you know when your heart beats fast

42
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,560
and the scratch becomes itchy and hot?

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,330
That's menopause!

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,190
Geez, what are they doing instead of working?

45
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,030
In which building is the management office located?

46
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,930
Which building was it?

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,360
Oh, it's next to the children's library.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,200
Gosh, forget it. I will find it.

49
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,790
Dong Hyun. Son.

50
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,820
That's menopause. Menopause!

51
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,360
Hey, it's true. Don't you trust me?

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,270
No, and I trust you even less about this.

53
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,020
Hey, it's true! All the people in other buildings are infected!

54
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,410
Their eyes rolled back, and they were all walking around like this! I swear!

55
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,190
Darn it.

56
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,080
What are you doing?

57
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,010
Gosh, my children... They should be okay, right?

58
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,430
I'm sure they're better off out there than here.

59
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,260
Oh, Ahjumma, you live in unit 401, right?

60
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,910
Is your internet not working, either?

61
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,590
I'm not an ahjumma.

62
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,590
Both my internet and cell phones aren't working.

63
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,310
I heard the people in other buildings are all infected. Did you hear as well?

64
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,170
Really? Daebak...

65
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,360
Who told you that? The TV?

66
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,670
That person over there. Ask him.

67
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,130
It's true. It really is.

68
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,120
What?

69
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,360
What's going on here?

70
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,270
Hold on. Excuse me.

71
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,860
Don't do that here. Go to the gym.

72
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,260
Everyone is there.

73
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,700
- Who is "everyone"? 
 - The residents.

74
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,150
Do you see it?

75
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,700
This... Is this really blood?

76
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,930
Would it be ketchup then?

77
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,780
- I'm not the only one who saw them. 
 - I saw them, too.

78
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,860
Mr. Lee from the maintenance office got infected, and his eyes turned all white...

79
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,020
And like this... like this...

80
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,860
It's because I don't understand.

81
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,460
How could the people who were throwing a fit just this morning about locking our building residents up

82
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,940
all get infected since then?

83
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,030
Oh, hello...

84
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,410
Oh, that's real blood! Whose blood is it?

85
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,970
- No... 
 - Put your phone down.

86
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,430
Let's go over there and talk.

87
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,060
Oh? Is that blood?

88
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,500
- Aigoo, is this... 
 - Don't do that.

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,660
- Get away from there. 
 - This is real blood.

90
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,400
Are you doing this to scare me?

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,870
- What are you talking about? 
 - Are you trying to replace me as the resident representative?

92
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,700
 Someone is playing a joke. It's obvious.

93
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,960
Building Representative.

94
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,670
How do you open this? Dong Hyun, do you know how to open this?

95
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,290
Representative or whatever, I'm not interested so don't worry.

96
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,880
Step away! It's dangerous outside.

97
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,220
- I mean... 
 - You can't go outside.

98
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,260
- I just need a few minutes. 
 - Get away from here, please.

99
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,580
- I think a person just walked by. 
 - Can't you see this?

100
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,670
- You have no idea what's out there... 
 - We are so curious.

101
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,490
- Please calm down, and stay away. 
  - Children are playing a joke!

102
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,570
- Just open it. 
 - It's too frustrating.

103
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,060
Put that phone down!

104
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,620
- Please calm down. 
 - I mean...

105
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,870
- Please get away from the door. 
 - Sir...

106
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,960
Where are you going?

107
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,760
They're trying to open the door. You saw the monster earlier.

108
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Then you shouldn't run away but stop them!

109
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,290
 - Oh, gosh. 
 - Please stay put.

110
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,520
- Bom, I'm glad you came. Tell them what's out there. 
 - Gosh, you startled me.

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,970
That's it. Yes, it's open. It's open.

112
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,440
Those of you who want to go outside, please go ahead.

113
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,750
Hey, not like this.

114
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,190
Go ahead and leave.

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,860
The air underground is too stuffy

116
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,820
so it's not that great for smoking. Right.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,550
How do you give in right away like that?

118
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,970
All right. I will believe you both just this once.

119
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,240
Detective, I won't need to worry about you, right?

120
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,470
We need to notify the other residents as well.

121
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:09,600
We will also need to discuss our food supply and where the non-residents who are stuck here can stay and eat.

122
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,720
Without the management office, we can't broadcast, and the internet is down. How are we supposed to notify them?

123
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,200
We can go and tell them in person.

124
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,160
Where is your gun?

125
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,150
Jung Gook has it.

126
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,770
 What did the man from downstairs say when he handcuffed you?

127
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,540
 Physical liberty is a vital constitutional right.

128
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,340
 He can't do that without due process.

129
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,340
Actually, I don't remember that well. I don't think he said much.

130
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,250
I don't think he told me my rights clearly.

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,410
Then does the police have any proof right now?

132
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,540
By chance, you don't think that I killed my wife or something, do you?

133
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,150
What I think isn't important.

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,310
That's for the judicial branch to decide.

135
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,630
Well, I... I truly loved my wife Min Ji.

136
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,410
I still can't believe that she's dead.

137
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,460
Then we can strategize the defense as a wrongful arrest.

138
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:17,610
That's that... There is a dermatology office that is under my wife's name.

139
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,220
I wonder how the management of inheritance works.

140
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,310
Actually, I'm curious about that too.

141
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,630
Well, okay.

142
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:33,560
First of all, we need to exonerate you from the murder charge.

143
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,480
Excuse me.

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,360
They want everyone to gather at the gym.

145
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,190
I'll go first so cover me.

146
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,640
Let's switch. I'm better with a bat than you.

147
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,770
You're a pitcher.

148
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,170
If I hadn't injured my leg, I would be in the major league.

149
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,040
Let's go.

150
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,740
- Where did everyone go? 
 - Probably to their apartments.

151
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,430
Since the infected return to normal after a while.

152
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,010
Then what would they think after seeing what they've done?

153
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,220
They would probably regret it, unable to accept what they have done.

154
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,260
Exactly. They would want to hurry home and wash up.

155
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,110
The bloodstains at the entrance.

156
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,750
It looked like someone tried to wipe it off.

157
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,490
They wanted to get rid of the traces of their actions.

158
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,700
The fact that they were craving blood and that they wanted to hide that fact.

159
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,260

160
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,130
I didn't do it.

161
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,290
I just watched.

162
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,070

163
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,450

164
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,790
I should have gotten a walkie-talkie from him.

165
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,640
What do you think is going on outside?

166
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,460
There's a high chance it's very chaotic with tons of infected people suddenly showing up.

167
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,090
- Or... 
 - Or?

168
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,120
They gave up on this place.

169
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,230

170
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,730

171
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,450
We were going to capture all the Next dealers together,

172
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,270
but they sensed our effort to arrest them and locked themselves in.

173
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,410
- How many are there? 
 - Around fifty.

174
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,470
They invited only the members and were partying.

175
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,370
We can open it in five minutes.

176
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,040
Turn off the music.

177
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,630
Turn off the power inside the club.

178
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,510
Don't open the door and block it. Vacate everyone on other floors.

179
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,630
Shut down the building.

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,420
Go up and shut down the building.

181
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,380
If you need something, go ahead and spend it.

182
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,730
You're in a good mood all of a sudden.

183
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,660
They say everyone outside is infected.

184
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,330
Is that a good thing?

185
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,800
I won't need to go to jail anymore. I only have to quietly look for a chance to clear my name in here.

186
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,790
You must've come up with a plan.

187
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,830
I just have to shut up the couple downstairs.

188
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,500
They'll keep bugging me once the lockdown is lifted. I have to convince them before then.

189
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,600
You're on my side anyway, right?

190
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,080
Do I have to go, too?

191
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,520
A lawyer should show his face at times like this so we can get more consultations requests.

192
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,700
Honey, they say our building is okay.

193
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,000
Gosh, it's not because I'm scared.

194
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,800
I just can't believe that everyone in the other buildings is infected.

195
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,550
You sound scared.

196
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,990
Are you going to the neighborhood meeting?

197
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,760
I'm not scared of infected people at all.

198
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,590
The residents won't like you much, though.

199
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,550
I'm sure a lot of people think that you caused the lockdown.

200
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,830
I told you I'm innocent, didn't I?

201
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,960
Where is Woo Sang Hee?

202
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,150
Sang Hee cares about what other people think. Just like the lawyer here.

203
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,840

204
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,680
Geez...

205
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,100

206
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,590
Ma'am, is something out there?

207
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,780
No...

208
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,260
You fell pretty hard that day. Did you go to the hospital?

209
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,420
I'm okay. Gosh...

210
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,660
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes...

211
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,640
That's the grandma who bumped into the lady across the hallway, right?

212
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,290
Yes, unit 302.

213
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,840
Don't go near her. You might catch it.

214
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,940
I won't catch it.

215
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,900
What are you doing?

216
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,320

217
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,050
Geez, gosh darn it.

218
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,390
Come on! Someone needs to go outside and find out what's going on!

219
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,690
Are you going to sit back like this?

220
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,520
The internet is still down. Hurry and come.

221
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,890
Sir, I told you it is dangerous outside.

222
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,580
Everyone got infected, except for those in our building.

223
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,790
Aigoo. Damn it.

224
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,570
I'm so frustrated! Aigoo!

225
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,390
Gosh, look at her...

226
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,690
Why did you come? I thought you were feeling weak.

227
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,240
Mom, are you sick?

228
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,190
I'm not sick. I'm just tired.

229
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,930
I saw the bloodstains...

230
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,970
Are you sure the infected people are everywhere outside?

231
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,930
We have several witnesses.

232
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,160
Do you see that? It says, "Stay where you are."

233
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,620
Who are the witnesses?

234
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,360
Who are the people who saw the infected people everywhere outside?

235
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Yes, well... I saw them.

236
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,220
- Anyone from the upper floors? 
 - You mean, not the rentals?

237
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm saying this hoping some people can make a more rational determination.

238
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,470
- I... 
 - Why do you doubt my brother's ability to make a determination?

239
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,140
My brother works for a corporation. He's a manager.

240
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes, I'm a lawyer...

241
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,830
and my job is to figure out if the testimony has the admissibility of evidence.

242
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,270
You don't have an office and operate the business from home, right?

243
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,090
- I noticed you advertise in the apartment elevator. 
 - Geez...

244
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,830
I'm not "operating a business." I "take on" cases.

245
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,390
- Don't you know what that means? 
 - I write novels!

246
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,000
What did you write? What is your major work?

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,150
- Love is Joint Property— 
 - Calm down.

248
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,290
Please calm down!

249
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,900
Yes, fine.

250
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,260
I know everyone is hyper-sensitive, but we shouldn't fight among ourselves.

251
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,330
I haven't seen infected people, either, but since all your stories match...

252
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,590
Well...

253
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,430
I will give you money.

254
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,290
To the people who figure out what's going on outside,

255
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,690
it may be little, but I'll pay you 200,000 won.

256
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,500
If it's true that the infected are outside, we should stay inside.

257
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,430
We can share food among ourselves until the situation is clear.

258
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,590
The person who doesn't want to go out... Yes, yes, I got it.

259
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,390
I will...

260
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,690
give you six of them in cash. I'll give you 300,000 won.

261
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,890
Daebak to the max...

262
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,960
- Did you look around everywhere? 
 - It's safe in here.

263
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,630
Then I can turn on the elevator, right?

264
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:37,970
Sure, go ahead.

265
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,660
Ahjumma, I wouldn't get on the elevator if it were me.

266
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,530
You can't escape an infected person from a small space.

267
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,700
I thought I told you to stay home.

268
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,110
Why?

269
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,740
By law, anyone arrested without a warrant can be discharged after forty-eight hours.

270
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,020
Does everyone know that you're a murderer?

271
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:15,730
What a dangerous thing to say. Do you have a witness?

272
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,970
Excuse me, some of you have seen my wife walking around sick, right?

273
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:27,050
I was the one who called the ambulance so they could take her away!

274
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,200
That I couldn't stay by my wife's side until the end,

275
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,930
I acknowledge that.

276
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,830
But my heart hurts the most!

277
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,190
Is it such a crime that I couldn't be with her until the end?

278
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,360
Innocent until proven guilty.

279
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,690
I guess it's a good thing for you that the apartment building is in lock down.

280
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,570
Don't worry.

281
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,600
I'll continue staying at the apartment. Besides, this place isn't so different from jail.

282
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,800
Sir, you have something on your shirt.

283
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,970
Don't think about touching the woman you're with right now.

284
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,530
I'll kill you.

285
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,810
What are you talking about? So unsophisticated.

286
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,680
What crap...

287
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,430
Let's go.

288
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,210
Please be with all those families who are in pain through these deaths.

289
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,460
Please let them have peace in you, Lord.

290
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,530
You're here.

291
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,630
I pray in the name of Jesus.

292
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,460
Oh Joo Hyung recruited people to go outside.

293
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,180
Were there even people who wanted to go?

294
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,380
He offered to give them 300,000 won per person so they volunteered.

295
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,010
Honestly, I was tempted, too.

296
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,520
 I'll give you 300,000 won each!

297
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,600
I told them it's dangerous because it's nighttime and pushed it back until morning.

298
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,080
Then what about today? We have to figure out our food supply and sleeping arrangements for the people from outside.

299
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,560
 Anyone who came from outside,

300
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,530
 if you need anything to eat, come to unit 401.

301
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,050
 I'll give you some ramyun and water.

302
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,480
 Me, too. Unit 602.

303
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,450
 Do you have clothes to change into?

304
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,810
The residents decided to distribute amongst themselves.

305
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,440
At least some people are still caring.

306
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,160
What about Oh Joo Hyung?

307
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Don't even mention it.

308
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,840
He claimed he has nothing to eat at home and can't give anyone anything.

309
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,470
I guess I'm at fault for even asking.

310
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,360
Take care.

311
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,650
But... why aren't you leaving?

312
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,980
Earlier, you didn't seem to believe there were infected people all over.

313
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,600
It would be nice if you could go out with everyone else and check for yourself.

314
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,450
I'm a professional.

315
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,260
I can't go at that price.

316
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,950
Then how about 1,000,000 won   ($1,000)   right now?

317
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:14,060
Mr. Oh Joo Hyung, stop mocking people with money!

318
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,990
Let's go.

319
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,700
Okay. Rest well.

320
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,180
What does that bastard see me as?

321
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,300
Why did you stop me? I was going to kill him!

322
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,590
Honey, what's the point of getting involved with a lunatic like him?

323
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,510
Should we just not take the job?

324
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:57,350
 There is a dermatology office that is under my wife's name. I wonder how the management of inheritance works.

325
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,190
That bastard... I will just send him to jail.

326
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,710
All we need to do is earn money.

327
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,400
  I'm fine so look at this and don't worry.

328
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,720
I don't know if this will be enough.

329
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
- It's a little heavy. 
 - Thank you so much.

330
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,650
Before we leave, we will clean up your house for you.

331
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,320
It's okay! I live by myself so it's clean.

332
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,450
Don't worry about it. Go on and rest well.

333
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,920
Thank you so much.

334
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,100
Take care.

335
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,950
You... Why did you do that earlier?

336
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,230
What?

337
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,260
You took my side.

338
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,870
Only I can curse you out. If anyone else does it, it makes me angry.

339
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,090
Right? We are a family, right?

340
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,820
Yes, but you still can't have the house.

341
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,110
Wow, she's cruel.

342
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,640
  I'm fine so look at this and don't worry.  I'm okay here with Hyun Kyung.  If we live here, let's raise a dog.

343
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,680
Where were you trying to go?

344
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,930
You already know you can't leave the building.

345
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,140
I already told you.

346
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,860
- I really left something in the car— 
 - You drank water, right? 
 - You took the medicine, right?

347
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,130
I told you I didn't. I really don't know anything about that.

348
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,340
That scared me.

349
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,620
What...

350
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,490
Seeing as how you're avoiding my eyes, you're definitely hiding something.

351
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,810
If I'm being completely honest, I am hiding something.

352
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:59,790
However, it isn't related to you two.

353
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,030
You did drink.

354
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,950
H-Honestly, what person can live

355
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,660
without drinking water? Well?

356
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,680
Cut your nails short. I'm going to check in the morning.

357
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,610
If you tell me who bought the drug from you,

358
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,210
I will find a way for you to be more comfortable.

359
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,870
When I get out of here, I'm going to sue you.

360
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,860
I'm serious.

361
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,000
If we get out of here safely, do whatever you want.

362
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,600
Think about it carefully.

363
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,030
There we go.

364
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,850
Check the expiration date. It could be old.

365
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,070
What's wrong with you? Would there be something like that when it came from a household?

366
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,920
Do you not take this off even when you're eating?

367
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,020
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

368
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,590
What the...?

369
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,560
Who is it?

370
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,470
Hello. I'm sorry, but can she stay with you for the time being?

371
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,950
The cleaning dorm is in the basement parking lot,

372
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,090
and she said she's a little scared to go down.

373
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,480
Oh, sure. Please come in.

374
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,220
I'm glad.

375
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,100
Thank you.

376
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,250
Have a good night.

377
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,490
Thank you.

378
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,360
Come sit.

379
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,250
We were just making ramyun.

380
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,040
Excuse me... Have some.

381
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,290
Thank you.

382
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,480
Oh.

383
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,070
Eat slowly. It's hot.

384
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,550
Today was a long day too.

385
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,990
What will we do tomorrow?

386
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,850
Shouldn't we stop the people from going out tomorrow?

387
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,500
How? Are you going to block the entrance?

388
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,320
Then they would leave through the basement.

389
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,600
It's impossible with only the two of us.

390
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,410
It could be better to stay locked up in our apartment for the week.

391
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,950
We have food too.

392
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,790
It's not like the infected people are going to break through the windows.

393
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,880
What if this doesn't end by the end of the week?

394
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,930
Then we have to ration our food.

395
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,210
Oh, right.

396
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,410
Keep it a secret from Seo Yoon. There is no reason to worry her more.

397
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,850
Okay.

398
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,100
Unni, is it true that there are infected people all over outside?

399
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,630
What?

400
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,910
Well... Not in our building, but in the others.

401
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,750
Only our apartment complex has this issue. Everywhere else is normal.

402
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,690
Oh... Was that a secret?

403
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,880
You should have told me!

404
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,180
Hyung, I have something to say to you.

405
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,920
No, I just thought...

406
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,230
once the connection comes back,

407
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,940
you can call your mom again. Until then, we just have to stay here quietly

408
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,740
until the rescue men come to get us out.

409
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,670
Once there is a vaccine, everything will get better.

410
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,190
Let's just wait a little bit.

411
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm okay.

412
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,280
I'm not hurt anywhere, and you said it's better outside than in here.

413
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,890
My parents are probably doing fine outside.

414
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,580
Of course.

415
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,450
Yes.

416
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,760
Seo Yoon!

417
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,800

418
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,670
Madman Rabies,

419
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,170
also known as Lytta virus, is a nerve disease virus similar to rabies.

420
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,920
It travels through the central nervous system and triggers the brain.

421
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,340
It can only be passed through the blood directly,

422
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,500
and there are no symptoms before it reaches the brain.

423
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,810
The reason why the infected people mostly attack the neck is also

424
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,350
to reduce the amount of time it takes the reach the brain.

425
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,780
Is it fine as long as you are not bitten?

426
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,390
As of now, you can be infected in three ways.

427
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,470
By being bitten, scratched,

428
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,020
or by taking NEXT.

429
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,870
It is suspected that the disease started in people who took NEXT.

430
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,320
What about the development of a treatment?

431
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,680
The problem is that since the brain is the most important part of the body,

432
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,690
it is being protected by BBB, the blood-brain barrier.

433
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,190
Even if we come up with a treatment, it cannot pass the BBB to the brain.

434
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,110
So... are you saying it's impossible?

435
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,580
As of right now, through a disease created in the lab,

436
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:41,290
we are studying the effects of a new antibody that will directly affect the brain and will have results within a month.

437
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,310
Will we be able to endure until then?

438
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,060
As of now, yes.

439
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,900
However...

440
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,090
if a quarantine does not work,

441
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,780
and the number of infected people surpasses a certain number... within 72 hours or a week at best,

442
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,290
everything will be over.

443
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,470

444
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,710

445
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,910
Tell me.

446
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,730
You know there's no chance based on the lab results.

447
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:39,220
Without the antibody, all the subjects died.

448
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,530
Then should I say it's impossible to find a treatment?

449
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,830
If we just ask for more time and money...

450
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,100
Then they would just want to kill all the infected.

451
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:54,700
If there is no treatment and the number of infected just increases, there is no answer.

452
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:04,890
I thought you didn't see the infected as people either, Colonel.

453
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,990
If they are people who ripped apart and killed others, they should take responsibility for their actions.

454
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,890
Don't you think so?

455
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,410
We need to stall, even if that means expanding the quarantined area.

456
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:24,060
If we want to save more people... that is our only option right now.

457
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,060
Meanwhile,

458
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,790
we will have to wait until we get results.

459
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,950

460
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,470
It's not working.

461
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:10,940

462
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,380
I even talked big saying I had to do something...

463
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,040
Hyun.

464
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,430
What is that?

465
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,310
A protective mask.

466
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,370
Is Seo Yoon still sleeping?

467
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,830
I'm a detective. I have to do something.

468
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,970
Hey. We are in quarantine, too.

469
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,240
You're not here because you're a detective anyway. Doing this won't increase your salary.

470
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,480
You're right, but...

471
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,540
I'm sure there are people who aren't infected in the other buildings, too.

472
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,780
I have to look for ways to save them.

473
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,730
Just think about yourself! You!

474
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,500
You can't even run because you hurt your knee.

475
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,130
I can still run faster than older men...

476
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,600
I'll be right back so just wait a bit.

477
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,260
- You, really! 
 - Shh, she will wake up.

478
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,120
Good morning.

479
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,990
Seo Yoon, lie down.

480
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,340
If you get up right after waking up, you won't grow tall.

481
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,350
Lie down, lie down.

482
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,270
Good morning.

483
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,890
Aren't you going, Hyung?

484
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,450
It's dangerous, and I don't go to dangerous places.

485
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,020
Hey! If you're going to go, step over me. 
  (T/N: means the same as "over my dead body")

486
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,460
Is it me or the apartment's residents?

487
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,970
Seriously?

488
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,010
I'm telling you there's nothing out there! Everyone saw wrong.

489
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:30,200
How many times do I have to tell you?

490
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,470
Think about the children. If we get hurt, we can't even get help from the government.

491
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,570
Everyone...

492
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,610
beware.

493
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,200
Your safety comes first.

494
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,590
I heard your wife passed away.

495
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,530
May she rest in peace.

496
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,710
Ours, too.

497
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,140
I thought you said there are infected people outside.

498
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,760
Exactly. As someone who receives money from the government, I have to take the initiative.

499
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,440
Eat until your stomach explodes. 
  (T/N: take as much money as you want)

500
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,040
Hyun's too.

501
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,180
Are you going to accept it?

502
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,170
Forget it.

503
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,940
I don't like you today.

504
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,390
I'm sorry, but this is a violation of the law.

505
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,470
Will you wear this for me?

506
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,070
From now on, I will lead.

507
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,250
When we go out, please be quiet.

508
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,580
Why should we follow your orders?

509
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,870
Well... because you probably don't want to die.

510
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,640
Lord. Watch over me,

511
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,440
protect those who are sad,

512
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,510
and heal those who are diseased.

513
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,610
Please comfort the families mourning in death.

514
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,610
Help them—

515
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,970
Amen.

516
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,250
Please hear me.

517
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,360
You're so loud. Stop it!

518
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,450
Don't touch me.

519
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,490
What?

520
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,590
What did you just say?

521
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,120
I said not to touch me!

522
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,260
Th-That crazy...!

523
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,400
My gosh.

524
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,810
Hey, hey! Where are you going?

525
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,250
Hey, hey!

526
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,940
That brat...!

527
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,080
This wretched family...

528
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,520
Be careful, be careful!

529
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,330
There really is no one.

530
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,970
Didn't they all leave?

531
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,520
Hello.

532
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,270
I want to help, too.

533
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,290
You want to film and post it, don't you?

534
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:50,610
Before I post anything, I'll ask permission! I promise.

535
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,110
Hello.

536
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,150
Let's just go and come back quickly.

537
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,300
Follow me carefully.

538
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,950
Is everyone okay?

539
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,600
I heard you were infected.

540
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,320
There was a problem within the buildings.

541
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,850
We found someone we suspect to be infected during the meeting so we locked them up in the children's library.

542
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:09,230
There was an infected person in buildings 1 and 2, right? Is that person okay?

543
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:13,320
Did his condition get any worse or anything?

544
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,280
Sir.

545
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,660
Don't you remember me?

546
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,810
Of course, I do. You pointed a gun at me yesterday morning.

547
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,780
No, after that.

548
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,550
Then are the other buildings safe except for the person in the library?

549
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:37,800
Yes, I told everyone to stay in their apartments.

550
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,040
And just a few of us decided to take care of the communication with the outside world.

551
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,470
Excuse me, what are you filming?

552
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,620
Then you didn't receive the lunchboxes?

553
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,650
We waited, but they were not coming in.

554
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,480
Maybe there's something wrong outside...

555
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,810
Excuse me! Is there anyone out there?

556
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,370

557
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,070
Honey!

558
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,850
Will you continue to stay here?

559
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:29,960
We have to.

560
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,230
Then keep waiting.

561
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,670
We will head in first.

562
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,330
What are they doing there?

563
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,720
They want to leave because they're scared they'll act up again.

564
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,300
Then when they can't control their thirst, they'll look for a sacrifice.

565
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,450
What do we do now?

566
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,360
The supermarket.

567
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,170
We need to have as much food as possible.

568
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,820
Did you really get infected by the Madman Rabies or whatever?

569
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,680
I already told you, I didn't.

570
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,470
You smoke pot in the States, too.

571
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,420
- Didn't you fix that habit in Korea? 
 - I really didn't!

572
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,500
This bastard.

573
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,550
I called you here to get close with the residents, and you just stuffed yourself with drugs.

574
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,660
Noona...

575
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:41,030
You... Don't act as if you know me.

576
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,520
Is it really dangerous outside?

577
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,070
If it were me... I would never go out.

578
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,490
Everyone is so incompetent.

579
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,250
 I wouldn't get on the elevator if it were me.

580
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:16,360
 You can't escape an infected person from a small space.

581
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,840
Impossible.

582
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,180
How could a person suddenly...

583
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,980
Madam! Open the door!

584
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,150
There are patients in the other buildings!

585
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,180
- Really? 
 - Yes! Hurry!

586
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,540
I even brought information from outside. It's crazy out there.

587
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,700
Okay.

588
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,000
But... did you get hurt somewhere?

589
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,500
Your neck.

590
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,800
I just got scratched a little.

591
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,160
Just open the door for now.

592
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,140
Hold on.

593
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:21,410
 There are some characteristic behaviors seen right before the disease surfaces.

594
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,340
 They feel extreme thirst

595
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,920
 and when they are alone in an empty space, they display obsessive behaviors, such as knocking on the wall.

596
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,000
By any chance...

597
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,550
are you thirsty?

598
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,360
I mean... Those people did seem weird, but they didn't look dangerous.

599
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,740
Shouldn't we have just waited for the lunchboxes, too?

600
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,800
You can go and wait if you want.

601
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,280
Let's just pack some food first.

602
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:40,260
More important than food, get more water.

603
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,000
How do we pay for this?

604
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,680
You were raised better than I thought.

605
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,650
No, it's not like that.

606
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,480
What do you mean? I'm right.

607
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,700
I'm just trying follow the rules as much as possible.

608
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,740
Once I forego the rules, it'll become lawless.

609
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,780
Oh, sure.

610
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,890
Of course, Sir.

611
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,640
You're so honest.

612
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
You're first-rate.

613
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,450
I should watch myself.

614
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,230
No—

615
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:48,340
It's okay. Calm down. Calm down.

616
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,330
No, that!

617
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,800
This!

618
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,600
Ice cream.

619
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,390
Go over there.

620
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,640
That one!

621
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,900
Food...

622
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,000
What are you doing?

623
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,700
Why, why, why?

624
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,600
Oh my...

625
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,970
Everyone, it's Dong Hyun.

626
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,180
This is the mart.

627
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,260
There is blood all over the floor.

628
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,770
If it's for you all,

629
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:35,290
I will create the best content by putting myself in danger.

630
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,530
I love you.

631
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,240
Miss, what are you doing there?

632
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,550
Miss!

633
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,800
Be quiet.

634
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,920
 Here, The phrase "Take a look" is used.

635
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,480
A bunch of people suddenly came barging in.

636
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,720
I–

637
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,770
Their eyes were weird... I got scared so I hid here.

638
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:58,340
The infected people... Did they leave?

639
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,240
I don't know.

640
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,020
Let's leave.

641
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,100
My gosh!

642
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,560
Inside, there... there's blood!

643
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,210
Let's leave. What about the others?

644
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,290
I don't know.

645
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,620
Run!

646
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,250
- Why? 
 - There are people inside.

647
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,630
Hey!

648
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,990
We can't just leave!

649
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,240
Let's go together, that is what I mean.

650
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,590
Here! Hurry!

651
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,510
What are you doing? Let's go!

652
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:55,320
Sir!

653
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,890
Let's go to the first floor.

654
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,110
Why?

655
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:03,920
Unni said if she's not back by ten, that we should go downstairs.

656
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,590
Sure.

657
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,710
Did you really... see them?

658
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,950
I did!

659
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,660
Why did they go outside when it's this dangerous?

660
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,700
What if they all come back infected?

661
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,210
Yes...

662
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,710
If it's not entirely safe, I can't open this door.

663
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,660
Yes.

664
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,360
Okay. Go ahead.

665
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,170
That woman is just like me.

666
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,770
What are you doing? Open the door!

667
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,180
Is anyone infected?

668
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,270
Open the door!

669
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,790
Come close one by one! I need to see it!

670
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,030
Hurry and open the door!

671
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,600
Why is there blood on your face? Did you get bitten?

672
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,940
- Open the door now! 
 - No, I won't!

673
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,700
Won't you open it? Open it!

674
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,040
You were bit, weren't you?

675
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,600
Miss! We are all fine so open the door!

676
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,350
Open the door. Open the door!

677
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,160
Sir, open the door!

678
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,150
Go.

679
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,140
No, we can't.

680
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,860
Open the door!

681
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:37,990
- Open the door please. 
 - I will break the windows!

682
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,050
Honey!

683
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:44,380
Open it!

684
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,120
What is this sound?

685
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:47,920
Open the door!

686
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,760
Min Ji's sound.

687
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,260
What are you going to do with this now?

688
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,880
I told you, didn't I? We just have to convince the downstairs neighbors. A dead man can't talk.

689
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,770
Corpses can't talk.

690
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,430
But this...

691
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,170
Hurry.

692
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,930
Hurry and open the door.

693
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:47,910
Infected people can't come in!

694
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,870
Open the door!

695
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,040
Open it quick!

696
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,310
I can't open it!

697
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:56,030
Open it!

698
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:57,820
What is this—?

699
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,200
- What are you doing? 
 - I really will break the window!

700
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,360
What are you doing?

701
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,520
Hey, hey!

702
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,850
Open the door!

703
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:10,390
Open it now.

704
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,550
- Open it. 
 - Open the door!

705
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,760
- Hurry and open it! 
 - Open the door!

706
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,690
No!

707
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,510
Unni, hurry!

708
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,070
Open the door!

709
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,280
No!

710
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,480
You!

711
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,540
Calm down, please!

712
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,650
What are you doing? Are you not coming in?

713
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,060
You head in first!

714
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,600
You!

715
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,740
Hey!

716
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,740
Stop it!

717
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,320
- Come here! 
 - Stop it!

718
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,600
Turn this off!

719
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,630
Calm down, please!

720
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,500
You, come here!

721
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,990
This is all Mr. Oh Joo Hyung's doing.

722
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,510
What a waste.

723
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,650
It was a good chance. What a waste.

724
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,800
But what's with your expression?

725
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,600
I didn't do anything. I did nothing wrong.

726
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,400
What's wrong?

727
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,460
Oh Joo Hyung!

728
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,120
Did you at least bring my phone?

729
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,750
What is it?

730
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,880
You bastard.

731
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,800
What, why, why?

732
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,980
What are you doing now?

733
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,620
Are you crazy?

734
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,080
This is blood from outside.

735
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,080
Are you scared now?

736
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,110
Are you scared now?

737
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:14,970
You damned bastard!

738
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,140
Hyun! Hyun!

739
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:44,380
As soon as the Internet starts working again, I'll become so famous.

740
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:26,310
Sorry.

741
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,920
I overreacted, didn't I?

742
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,100
If it wasn't for you, everyone who went out would have been infected.

743
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,460
You did good, Hyun.

744
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,580
 Take responsibility for the infected!

745
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,640
 Take care, take care!

746
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,670
 Take responsibility for the infected!

747
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,850
 Take responsibility, take responsibility!

748
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,890
 Take care of the quarantined!

749
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,060
 Take care, take care!

750
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,910
 Prove it, prove it!

751
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:19,120
Colonel, an infected person escaped from the apartment.

752
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,530
He's showing symptoms. Should I bring him in?

753
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,640

754
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,380
- Let him go. 
 - I'm sorry?

755
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,990
 Protect them, protect them!

756
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:34,320
Pretend you lost him and let him go for the protestors to see.

757
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,160
Just make sure no one gets hurt and keep them in check.

758
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,360
 Colonel.

759
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,590
We can't let them feel pity for the infected.

760
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,940
Just make them scared and want to avoid the infected.

761
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:47,520
Then we can stall enough time to come up with an antibody.

762
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,470
 Go away, go away!

763
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,510
 Take responsibility for the infected!

764
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:53,470
 Take responsibility, take responsibility!

765
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:55,500
 Protect the infected!

766
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,010
 Protect them, protect them!

 The residents here... They're in a state of total anxiety.

  I... just want to buy it.

  Yes, that's it. We just have to change our thoughts a little and there are so many ideas.

  The situation will continue to get worse.
