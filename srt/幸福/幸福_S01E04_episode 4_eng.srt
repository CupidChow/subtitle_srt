1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,910

2
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,420

3
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,480

4
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,090
Sang Hee!

5
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,380
Oh Joo Hyung, you're arrested for the suspicion of killing your wife Park Min Ji.

6
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,990
- I need to talk to her for a moment. 
 - Take your time.

7
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,570
How could you kill your wife? Face reading is science.

8
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,900
Thank you for cooperating in our investigation.

9
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,070
I believed him because he said he would divorce her, but it has come to this.

10
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,230
Why don't you accompany us to the police station? As a reference witness.

11
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,520
Please make a statement about what happened.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,660
Later. It's... It's too difficult for me right now.

13
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,620
I'll pack my things and leave.

14
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,360
All right. Go ahead.

15
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,630

16
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,630
Hi, Bom. Where are you right now?

17
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,630
I'm trapped inside.

18
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,170
Don't get into a fight trying to come in.

19
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,580
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

20
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,820
What are you talking about? Where are you trapped?

21
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,760
I'll protect the apartment.

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,730
Wait, Bom, tell me exactly what's going on. What's...

23
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,460
I mean, I was going to tell you when I knew for sure...

24
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,540
I thought I was in here alone.

25
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,400
♫  I don't know what lies ahead  ♫

26
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,150
♫  In my life, that's okay  ♫

27
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,300
Sae Bom, I have to catch him right now.

28
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,260
It's okay. No one can get out.

29
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Who is it?

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,160
Hey, did you order rice cakes?

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,030
Enjoy and order more.

32
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,680
Are you a cop, too, Ahjussi?

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,120
How did you know that? Oh, you saw this.

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm not anyone suspicious. I'm a friend of that ahjussi across the hallway.

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,710
I see. You have two jobs, but why do you have a gun with you?

36
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,040
Well, there's a bad guy who lives in this building so I came to get him.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,070
Those people only think you're a cop if they see a gun.

38
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,730
- Can I see it up close? 
 - No, no, no. It's dangerous.

39
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,370
Actually, I have never used it in real-life.

40
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,760
I just carry it around.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,380
It looks cool. Don't you think?

42
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,010
 I'm home.

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,090
Are you dead? I'm back, and you won't even look.

44
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,830
Here, here. Here's your hamburger.

45
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,960
You get up now that I say I have food for you.

46
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,870
Thank you. You said it was a hamburger.

47
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,720
It's the same bread. What is the problem?

48
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,990
- If you don't want to eat it, forget it. 
 - Wait...

49
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,130
- Honey, I'm not saying I won't eat it. 
 - Wait...

50
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,260
- Is it dry skin again? 
 - No.

51
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,130
You're old. Put some lotion on.

52
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,210
No, it's not dry skin. I sprained it yesterday when I fell.

53
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,190
Geez, you're exaggerating about the pain.

54
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,620
Honey, aren't you even curious about what happened when I say I hurt myself?

55
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,850
- Did something happen? 
 - Yes.

56
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,050
On the sixth floor yesterday...

57
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,550
Mom! Why didn't you wake me up? I have a meeting!

58
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:15,220
Hey! How would we know you have a meeting? Are we telepathic or something?

59
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,100
Dong Hyun, do you want to eat this sandwich?

60
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,390
You two, eat a lot of it and live a long, long life.

61
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,490
Hey, this is...

62
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,950
That rude boy... Aigoo. Geez!

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,730
I have over 1,000 subscribers. At this rate, I know I will make some profit.

64
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,070
I'm saying I just need the initial investment. Don't you trust me, man?

65
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,950
All right, all right. I'll be right there.

66
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,510
What's going on?

67
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,050
Come on, seriously!

68
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,970
Gosh, what's going on? I'm busy here!

69
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,440
- The smaller room is pretty big, too. 
 - Yes.

70
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,760
How nice.

71
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,230
You can't smoke inside.

72
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,590
Hey, this is an e-cigarette.

73
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,640
Are you happy now? Are we good? Satisfied?

74
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,870
Honey, can't we let go of him? He's weird.

75
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,120
Come on, just put up with it.

76
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,970
He won't even accept minimum wage. He's like a treasure.

77
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:39,120
He has a weird name, too. Andrew? Does he have superpowers or something?

78
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,400
Gosh, seriously. Come on now.

79
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,760
They've been going at it since this morning.

80
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,600
- Is there a fire? 
 - We would know already if that was the case.

81
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,320
I know about fires. You never know unless you smell something burning.

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,290
- Was your home on fire? 
 - Yes!

83
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,530
I heard sirens outside, and the fire trucks were lined up on the main street.

84
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,570
I opened the window to look around and see where the fire was.

85
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,940
And someone from the apartment across mine was screaming at me.

86
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,740
- Saying what? 
 - "Lady, come out! Your apartment building is on fire!"

87
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,460
There was a fire on the top floor of my apartment building.

88
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,500
It looks obvious from the outside, but you would never know if you're inside.

89
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
No way.

90
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,600
Yes, this is attorney Gook Hae Sung.

91
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,460
 Hello, I live across from you. In unit 601.

92
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,780
Yes, I need urgent consultation.

93
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,230
Yes, hello. Well...

94
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,680
You must be extremely worried about your wife's issue. I'm home now. Are you home right now?

95
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,370
Should I come over?

96
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,940
No, no. I'm outside right now.

97
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,120
I see. Okay, then. Go ahead. What is this about?

98
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,200
 The police just arrested me.

99
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,610
An arrest without a warrant is illegal, right?

100
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,350
 What is the charge?

101
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,200
It's murder.

102
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,030
You ran away to avoid the arrest, correct?

103
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,030
Please... Please help me! Save me! I live in building 101.

104
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,380
I'm a doctor! I'm a specialist!

105
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,860
I'm a cop. Go on your way.

106
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,930
Agassi. No, are you an ahjumma or a college student?

107
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,130
He's your husband, right? I will report you both to the Human Rights Commission.

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,560
What are you doing? Beat him up without having him bleed.

109
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,570
Let's just go.

110
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,780
Put your shoes on.

111
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,960

112
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,730
I'm so disappointed.

113
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,860
Hey, you can't lend 150 million won ($15,000) to your one and only Oppa?

114
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,960
- I don't have any money. 
 - What do you mean you don't have any money?

115
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,490
You know the price of this place.

116
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,100
Hey, you hit the jackpot.

117
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,010
- Is there a construction outside? 
 - Or should we just live together?

118
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,870
How nice it would be to have my children study in a place like this.

119
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,080
Hey, you have many rooms. Why don't you give a room to each of your nieces?

120
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,800
Hey, honestly, it's lonely for you to live alone, too!

121
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,970
You've heard about dying alone, haven't you?

122
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,680
I have. That's why I get the newspaper delivered. Other people would know if I die.

123
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,810
Honestly, you lived off of Father's deposit while living here.

124
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,190
Thanks to that, you were able to buy this place.

125
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,190
Oppa, you got your inheritance in cash and land!

126
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,570
I received it ten years ago.

127
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,420
- Don't you know about inflation? Inflation. 
 - Be quiet.

128
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,650
 Hello, residents of building 101. I'm the building representative in 1202.

129
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,930
 All the noises around the building must be very unsettling.

130
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,720
 The entire building is currently isolated from the outside.

131
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,280
- What? 
  - The authorities have something to tell us regarding the infection of Madman Rabies.

132
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,560
 There will be a residents meeting at 5 p.m. at the underground gym.

133
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,540
 The police has acknowledged the existence of Madman Rabies.

134
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,240
 The authorities said 3 nursing homes and 2 homeless shelters,

135
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,760
 followed by a building in Seyang City, have been quarantined.

136
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,290
- Hey, was it like that when you came in? 
 - Yes. 
  - As a result, the cohort quarantine locations

137
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,210
- I just thought it was a construction site. 
  - have increased to six in total.

138
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,120
 The authorities say the action was inevitable in order to stop additional infections.

139
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,700
 With an accurate way to diagnose and manage the disease,

140
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,780
 they will do everything to prevent the spread of the infection.

141
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm sure I can leave. So nice.

142
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,930
Your mom must be worried, too. I'm sure she'll call you soon–

143
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,180
- Mom? 
 - Seo Yoon, are you okay? Is everything okay in there?

144
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,830
Yes. I'm over at the unni across the hallway's place.

145
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,020
 I'm in front of the complex right now.

146
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,690
 I'll get inside somehow. Just hang in there, okay?

147
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,400
 They just won't let anyone go out. I'm sure it won't be a problem to go inside.

148
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,680
All right.

149
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,470
 Let me talk to Unni if she's next to you.

150
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,690
Hello?

151
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,740
 I'm so glad you're there. Thank you so much.

152
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,360
I'll go inside right away. Please take care of Seo Yoon a little longer.

153
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,610
Don't worry too much. I like spending time with Seo Yoon, too. She's fun.

154
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,550
 Seo Yoon has a weak heart.

155
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,430
She suffers from mitral valve regurgitation.

156
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,800
Blood gathers inside her heart.

157
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,550
She can't do intense exercises, and she can't ever bleed.

158
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,160
 Last time, she had to be hospitalized and get antibiotics for hurting her fingernail a bit.

159
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,730
I will watch her carefully.

160
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,590
I couldn't stay by her side, only to make a few won.

161
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,180
I couldn't answer the phone when she called earlier.

162
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,530
I will see if there's a way I could let Seo Yoon leave.

163
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,420
Thank you so much.

164
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,610
 Gosh, it's not your fault, Ma'am.

165
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,560
 Don't worry too much. I will take care of her.

166
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,370
Mom, can I eat the rice cake?

167
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,160

168
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,810
- Hi, Mom. 
  - You said you were fine. What's going on?

169
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,990
 It's your apartment that was sealed, right?

170
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,490
It's a preventative measure to manage the spread of infections. Don't worry too much.

171
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,550
I heard many are infected. Stay home. Don't put yourself out there.

172
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,290
I want to do that, too, but...

173
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,060
we can't all stay put.

174
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,340
 - What?  
 - I'm busy right now. I will call you later.

175
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,400

176
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,000
Colonel? Can we meet?

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,420
What do you mean when? As soon as possible.

178
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,490
You know Park Min Ji was taking a drug, right? Did you take it, too?

179
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,540
Did Min Ji turn like that because of that drug?

180
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,760
You can't run away now anyway so stay still in here.

181
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,980
Well, you can consult a lawyer if you want.

182
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,650
Me, too? But I don't even live here.

183
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,740
No one can leave, and no one can come in.

184
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,250
You're a cop. Can't you do something?

185
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,600
I can't leave, either.

186
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,470
I heard there's a residents meeting soon. Let's go down together.

187
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,020
I don't want to. I'm sure the rumor spread about what happened in this apartment. What would people think of me?

188
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,770
Then are you going to stay in here with Oh Joo Hyung?

189
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,570
Just a moment.

190
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,130
What now? What, what, what?

191
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm worried about Woo Sang Hee.

192
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,610
I will release you later. Take a nap.

193
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,220
What the hell are you doing right now? Why are you doing this to me?

194
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,520
How about going to the bathroom? The bathroom... Should I just release it in the room?

195
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,520
Don't spill.

196
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,820
Are you really not going?

197
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,290
I really want to go, but you know how sensitive I am.

198
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,760
If I go to a crowded place while Madman Rabies is going around...

199
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,260
I can't be myself 100 percent.

200
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,140
What about me? Don't you think I'm afraid?

201
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,860
That's why I live trusting only you.

202
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,660
The clients will be lining up on a day like today.

203
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,720
This lockdown has a high potential of having legal issues.

204
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
I understand. I'll go and promote our business.

205
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,780
So Yoon, fighting.

206
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,430
Hello.

207
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,630
I heard you arrested the ahjussi across the hallway. Where is he now?

208
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,000
He's at home,

209
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:39,300
due to the lockdown. I handcuffed him so you can tell your husband to go see him for a consultation.

210
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,020
Is there proof of the murder?

211
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,530
You should ask him directly about that too.

212
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,690
But if I were you two, I wouldn't take his case.

213
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,380
 Sang Hee! Sang Hee, you're out there, right? Sang Hee, please

214
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,270
talk to me, all right? We live and die together. Hey!

215
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,410
No.

216
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,930
Hey, do you think you can live a good life by yourself?

217
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,600
Everyone will know you as a cheater, and you can't even get out of here because of the lockdown.

218
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,730
 You have no money, and you'll probably get fired from the hospital. The only one who could understand you

219
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,470
is me, Sang Hee.

220
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,060
 You know me, you know?

221
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,390
 Sang Hee, I'll give you money. Okay?

222
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,830
 Sang Hee!

223
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,780
How much money would you give me?

224
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,130
Hello. I'm the wife of attorney Gook Hae Sung in unit 602.

225
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,670
Please call this number here if you have any legal problems.

226
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,560
They don't know anything about a drug.

227
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,940
They got all angry, saying that they don't take steroids.

228
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,750
Are there only residents from our building here?

229
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,490
Yes, just our building. I think we're all meeting separately.

230
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,880
Dear residents of Seyang Forest Le Ciel.

231
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,190
Due to risks of additional infections inside the apartment complex,

232
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,820
 the entire apartment complex will be in cohort quarantine for a week.

233
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,370
Wait, wait! Wait, Ma'am! I don't even live here. Do I have to be locked up in here?

234
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,250
 Until the management of infected and total inspection is possible,

235
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,500
 - we will compensate for the damages caused by the lockdown.  
 - Never mind the compensation.

236
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,320
 We will make sure there are no inconveniences, including meals and other needs.

237
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,260
 Please hang in there with us. If you need anything in addition,

238
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,110
 please discuss among yourselves and let me know. That will be all.

239
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:17,970
- Wait, that can't be! 
 - Wait, no! Wait!

240
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,890
Geez, Ahjussi!

241
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm sure you're all in shock, but if you're a Seyang Forest Le Ciel resident,

242
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,680
I believe you will calmly overcome this crisis.

243
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,670
What do you mean, calm?

244
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,160
Now, now. I can't hear you if everyone speaks at once.

245
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,380
I will give you a chance to speak in order.

246
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,350
Is this because there was an infected person here yesterday? My goodness!

247
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:48,120
We have to prevent this based on coming in contact. I never even saw that person!

248
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,210
Well, the lady from unit 302 bumped into the woman from unit 601 yesterday and fell.

249
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,260
- Did you not hear that? 
 - Really?

250
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,300
I guess you lack communication among family members.

251
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,730
But if the disease is infectious, we shouldn't gather around like this, right?

252
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,770
- You saw the news, right? It is not spread through the air so don't worry. 
 - How can we believe that?

253
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,990
But what if there's an infected person with us who suddenly attacks trying to bite us?

254
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:23,720
- Since we are all together in this small space, we would all bite, kill and taste each other... 
 - Gosh, my head hurts.

255
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,340
To be honest, I don't think there are any more infected people among the residents in our building.

256
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,950
Everyone here is so sophisticated.

257
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,810
Fortunately, we have cops here as well.

258
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,630
Sirs?

259
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,420
Don't look at me. I will suffocate. You go out.

260
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,130
Some characteristic behaviors are displayed right before the disease surfaces.

261
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:56,720
You feel extreme thirst and your pupils shrink, making your eyes look white.

262
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,450
When one is alone in an empty space, they knock on walls or display some obsessive behaviors.

263
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,670
If possible, get together with more than two people

264
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,790
and leave a door open while you're together.

265
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,070
If you notice that you are behaving suspiciously, ask for help from those around you right away.

266
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,540
But I live alone! How could I be with two or more?

267
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,460
It's for a week.

268
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,520
We only have to hang on for a week.

269
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,230

270
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,930
You wanted to lock this place down while the children were at school. I noticed you stopped the cars from coming home.

271
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,900
You wanted a lockdown without children, right?

272
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,820
That would look better.

273
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,500
There is a child who didn't go to school. Let her leave.

274
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,610
You could do that much, can't you?

275
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,690
Park Seo Yoon, we are testing her parents.

276
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,280
Both of them are highly likely to be infected.

277
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:18,330
- Are you sure? 
 - Delivery work is tough. They probably took it as a stimulant.

278
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,490
I'm sure they're calling the child and saying, "I love you, I miss you."

279
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,210
That's all useless. No one knows how drastically people could change when push comes to shove.

280
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,130
Colonel, talk about your pessimistic view of family with your blind date.

281
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,080
What do you want me to do?

282
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm saying it's better for Seo Yoon to stay in here with a good guardian.

283
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,330
On the outside...

284
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,250
you just don't know how things could change.

285
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,820
Ahjussi Cop,

286
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,310
the wall outside... It looks like I could climb over it if I tried.

287
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,260
Would I get punished if I climbed over it?

288
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,880
More than that, I'm sure the reporters outside would be delighted.

289
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,330
You might even make it to the evening news.

290
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:20,510
How about food? Are we eating on our own?

291
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,990
We'll pass out lunch boxes starting tomorrow morning. You have something to eat tonight, right?

292
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,680
But where are the apartment management people?

293
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,060
The apartment building was put in lockdown at 9:30 a.m., but no one had come into work by then.

294
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,360
The night shift staff went to a meeting in another building. This doesn't make any sense at all.

295
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,120
What, what, what? So other buildings are meeting without us?

296
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,990
They're scared because the first infected person was our building.

297
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,130
They have abandoned their duty.

298
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,110
Then no one from the management office is in this building?

299
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,900
Yes, no one is here. Something we shouldn't keep quiet about has happened.

300
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,060
There's someone outside.

301
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:14,500
I lived in the States with my husband, but we returned to Korea because we fell in love with Korea's disease prevention.

302
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,900
Excuse me, Building Representative. The management office staff is standing outside.

303
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,620
It's not just this incident. There is a lot of corruption in this apartment building.

304
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,450
Do you know that they fixed the elevator in secret because it failed the installation inspection?

305
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:36,820
They collect recyclables only once a week, and they're spending money to maintain roadside trees inside the complex. Did you know that?

306
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,090
If you trust and follow me, I will represent all the residents

307
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,390
and resolve all the irregularities within this apartment complex.

308
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,020
Please allow the renters to use the gym as well.

309
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:57,120
My husband went to a seminar in Kentucky in the US.

310
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm sure some of you are wondering about the church service due to the lockdown.

311
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:09,530
Hallelujah. God is always by your side.

312
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,480
All the believers can come to me.

313
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:22,180
If anyone needs a damage compensation estimate due to the lockdown or needs any legal advice, please talk to me.

314
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,330
We'll serve you with quality legal representation.

315
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,730
Please come to unit 602.

316
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,200
- Let's go. 
 - Hurry up and come.

317
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,460
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

318
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,600
I heard you're some kind of police, too.

319
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,960
You should cooperate with keeping the order inside the apartment building.

320
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,730
I work in a different field. I only learned to suppress terrorists.

321
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,690
Please talk to me if you need any cooperation.

322
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,890
 Am I getting paid more? I don't think so.

323
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,290
However, I'm sure it will help me with my promotion.

324
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,360
 Gosh, I had no idea when I came in here. I want to go home and make deliveries, too.

325
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,950
What is this about?

326
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,390
You have to tell me so I can talk, too.

327
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,000
- Why lock the door... 
 - Let me ask you one thing. Are you close with this person?

328
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,720
Joo Heon? No, we work alternate days so I haven't even seen him that often.

329
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,190
And he stopped coming into work a few days ago so I came in every day.

330
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,210
You drink so much water. Do you keep getting thirsty?

331
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,160
I've always drunk a lot of water.

332
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,500
Can you open this? Oh, I'm from the Special Operations Unit.

333
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,030
Sure. Okay.

334
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,310
Go ahead and look.

335
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,040
One of your colleagues sold some drugs here.

336
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,010
The authorities believe that the drug is causing that Madman Rabies.

337
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,410
You're aware of the symptoms, right?

338
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,340
Extreme thirst. Hallucinations.

339
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,870
Be straight with us. Did you take the drug?

340
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,570
No. I didn't take anything besides supplements.

341
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,900
You know who took them, right?

342
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,130
If you don't tell us now, you could be charged with selling drugs.

343
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,350
Gosh, I really don't know.

344
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,700
Hiding the truth isn't going to get you anywhere.

345
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,790
The entire apartment complex is in lockdown because of you. Do you know that?

346
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,120
I said no!

347
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:00,330
I mean, you two keep cornering me

348
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:06,130
as the bad guy. I really didn't take a drug like that.

349
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,880
We have a bunch of cleaning appointments to catch up this week.

350
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,810
Could there be any way we could take care of this?

351
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,130
Sir, I came in here unexpectedly and can't leave.

352
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,450
They say they'll compensate for all the damages incurred.

353
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,650
Let's just wait.

354
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,690
Do you two have a place to sleep?

355
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,770
No, we don't.

356
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,680
We have a child at home.

357
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,870
How old is your child?

358
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,900
He is seventeen years old.

359
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,930
Seventeen.

360
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll check in with them to see if they'll allow you to sleep in the space you were cleaning.

361
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,920
Is he with you?

362
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,320
Oh, he works for us.

363
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,070
Can you tell me your name, please?

364
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,690
My name is Andrew.

365
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,380
What?

366
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,090
Hey, can you wait a second?

367
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,210
He is a little autistic, but he is a kind boy.

368
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,400
He hurt his face when he was young so he has a lot of scars.

369
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,790
He was always home, unable to go out,

370
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,550
but nowadays, people don't mind others wearing masks.

371
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,890
He mustered up the courage to start working.

372
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,760
Understood.

373
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,280
- You all have your IDs, right? 
 - Yes.

374
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,560
Can I see them? They need a list of people who are in the building.

375
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,810

376
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,210
Oh, I scratched it out.

377
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,490
Ahn Guk Jin.

378
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,300
Then why did you say your name was Andrew?

379
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,860
Because I would love to have some superpowers.

380
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,290
There was a drama like that a long time ago.

381
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,650

382
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,350
Who were you talking to that you're hanging up so quickly?

383
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,300
I was talking to a friend.

384
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,320
Should we tie him up?

385
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,040
We don't know just yet.

386
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,720
We won't tie you up so stay in here, okay?

387
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,280
Kim Seung Beom, if I catch you outside this office,

388
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,760
I'll just assume you're infected.

389
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,680
Let's see...

390
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,260
if you can hold off drinking water until the morning.

391
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,450

392
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,760
You'll get thirsty if you stay awake so don't look at your cell phone and go to sleep.

393
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,640

394
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,780

395
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:17,500
Hey, good thing they didn't allow renters to use the gym.

396
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,930
We have fewer suspected infected people.

397
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,260
You are really a police officer.

398
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,660
Of course.

399
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,280
 I went to the gym, but other than that, I was always home.

400
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,800
 I won't leave here until the lockdown is lifted so don't worry about me─

401
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,230
I'm not here about that. It's something else.

402
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,050
I need something for the people downstairs.

403
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,250
Blankets.

404
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,030
You have army blankets, right?

405
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,830
I can bring you a T-shirt tomorrow.

406
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,890
Thank you.

407
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:25,480

408
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,320
You remember that I live downstairs, right?

409
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,660
If you make noises on purpose, I won't stay put.

410
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,360
If you don't stay put, what will you do then?

411
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,660
Ahjussi.

412
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,180
No one will say anything if I say you died while running away.

413
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,040
There are tons of people who would say something.

414
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,340
This is also illegal confinement.

415
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,100
Moreover, I didn't see your name on the gym entry log.

416
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,170
Don't you usually exercise?

417
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,890
Breathing exercises. I also go out to golf courses sometimes.

418
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,400
My wife used to go to that gym.

419
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,960
Did madness rabies start spreading at the gym?

420
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,910
Stop thinking too much unnecessarily.

421
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:25,140
If you have time to do that, feel remorse for the murder you committed.

422
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,830
If you're human, at least.

423
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:38,500
Woo Sang Hee, I prepared some change of clothes and a place for you to sleep on the fifth floor so let's go down together.

424
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,960
I'll just stay here.

425
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
I testified falsely because I was so angry.

426
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,100
Actually, I never saw nor heard anything that day.

427
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm sorry, Detective.

428
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,460
Sang Hee fell for your enticing words,

429
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,300
and thought I really did do something terrible.

430
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,220
I explained to her that Min Ji's death was accidental.

431
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:26,460

432
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,410
- What? 
 - Unit 302 is broadcasting what's going on inside the building.

433
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:39,200
Stop him right now! If not, I'll shut off both the TV and the internet.

434
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,870
Hey. Hey, get up for a moment.

435
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,000
Why?

436
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,630
Did you meet the infected person yesterday?

437
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,170
Did you just find that out?

438
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,300
Did you get a scratch?

439
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,680
No, it's not like that.

440
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,120
What do you mean, no?

441
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,370
Aigoo. Why are you doing this?

442
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,250
I told you I didn't.

443
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,760
My gosh. You never even bought me any medicine. What in the world...

444
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,440
Aigoo. This is nothing. Are you lying down over this?

445
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,430
Drink a glass of soju. It won't hurt at all if you drink.

446
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,340
Aigoo.

447
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,820
 - Who is it? 
 - Is your son home?

448
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,780
I thought he left earlier.

449
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,240
Do you know where he went?

450
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,570
I'm sure he's in the building somewhere. Anyway, he's not home.

451
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,870
I think I know where he is.

452
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,930
 I clearly told you, I won't talk about stocks at all today.

453
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,180
I have some content today that's not made up at all. Aigoo, Kiro.

454
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,120
It's good to see you. Our generous Kiro, good to see you.

455
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:14,020
Now, everyone. Where is this?

456
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,500
 This is where the first infected was discovered.

457
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,310
I heard the family still lives here. I'm about to meet and talk to him.

458
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,380
Should I ring the bell? Well?

459
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,870
Should I? Or not?

460
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,380
Should I? Or not?

461
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,510
Should I? Or not? Should I? Or not?

462
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,350
 Should I beat him up or not?

463
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,530
 Should I hit him? Or not?

464
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,560
 It's going to explode! Explode!

465
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm turning this off. Wash up and go to sleep.

466
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,900
- Bangjong? 
 - What's this?

467
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,210
Thank you.

468
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,930
Is he supposed to be thankful?

469
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,800
- I got 500,000 won ($500)! 
 - Crazy...

470
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,330
- Aish! 
 - Why did you do that?

471
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,230
Ahjussi, come over here!

472
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,740
Gosh, what a long day.

473
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,720
I know.

474
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,180
What happened to the dermatologist clinic manager upstairs?

475
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,660
She fell for Oh Joo Hyung. She says she wants to stay there.

476
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,580
Hey, should I try to convince her again?

477
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,090
It's okay. She's an adult. She can take care of herself.

478
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,720
Could Oh Joo Hyung do something stupid at a time like this?

479
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,900
Let's just check on her and see if she's okay. I'm exhausted.

480
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:42,570
Let's do that. But the sleeping arrangement...

481
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,180
Where should we...

482
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,090
Where do I sleep?

483
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,490
♫  When...  ♫

484
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:06,000
♫  When did it start to go wrong?  ♫

485
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,760
♫  Where, where did it all go wrong?  ♫

486
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,790
♫  Since when, when did we hurt each other?  ♫

487
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,330
Hey, smile. Smile. One, two.

488
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,900
What are you doing?

489
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,710
My wife says to take pictures and send them to her.

490
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:36,190
She's asking if I went fishing. Why wouldn't she believe me?

491
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,250
I can't believe it, either.

492
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,810
What?

493
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,640
That I'm here like this with you.

494
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,920
Gosh, we had good vibes today.

495
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,610
There.

496
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,500
We just have to endure a few days.

497
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,320
Just think that you're vacationing at a villa or something. Okay?

498
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay.

499
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,820
Are you praying?

500
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,080
I changed the prayer today.

501
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,070
I prayed that the lockdown will lift when we wake up tomorrow.

502
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,770
Okay. I'll pray, too.

503
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,310
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

504
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,620
Sleep tight, Unni.

505
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
Let's sleep now.

506
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,710
Yi Hyun.

507
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,030
What?

508
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,310
I have a bad back.

509
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,300
All of a sudden?

510
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:54,690
- Geez. Sleep on the couch then. 
 - Thanks.

511
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,330
This is mine. Take this.

512
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,870
Okay. Thanks.

513
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,570
I met the wrong acupuncturist.

514
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:27,290
♫  It was destiny  ♫

515
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,880

516
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:39,740

517
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,570
♫  When, when did it start to go wrong?  ♫

518
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,490

519
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,910
♫  Where did we all go wrong?  ♫

520
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,430

521
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:09,830

522
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,010
Hyung, I know you're not sleeping.

523
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,810
- What? 
 - Do you know Han Tae Seok's assault case?

524
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,610
What happened to the pharmaceutical chairman?

525
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,740
What are you talking about?

526
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,120
If it was assault, it means the guy didn't die.

527
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,800
I just wonder what he's been up to since then.

528
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,970

529
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,350
You look much better, Chairman.

530
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,810
I heard you publicized the madness rabies and locked down the apartment.

531
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:10,300
It's chaotic globally.

532
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,030
They will report on it tomorrow and will shut down the borders.

533
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,410
You said you could resolve this quietly, and that's why I recommended you to the higher-ups.

534
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,150
Everyone must be disappointed.

535
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,970
Someone released Next into the market. That's why I failed.

536
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,900
Who?

537
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,270
You, Chairman.

538
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,800
You took out all the goods that were in the warehouse, right?

539
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,230
 I didn't buy that with money.

540
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,970
 Someone told me about the warehouse and said I could take everything.

541
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,730
Why would I?

542
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,180
There have to be many infected so the treatments could develop quickly.

543
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:02,200
You prefer that the world is destroyed rather than your own death.

544
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:08,820
Tae Seok... your wife's life is on the line here, too.

545
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,290
I heard the baby is still in her womb.

546
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,580
Two persistent lives are at stake.

547
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,130
Do you know that your wife's blood tasted the best?

548
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,030
It's tough to suppress your thirst, right?

549
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,320
Colonel.

550
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,370
It's okay.

551
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,690
That old man released them.

552
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:27,640
I'll give you the numbers of the people close to him. Track them all. We must shut down all the infection routes.

553
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,610
Is it okay to leave him like that?

554
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,040
Then what should we do?

555
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,930
We should quarantine him like other infected people.

556
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:39,310
His position is far too high for us to do that. When the treatment development is completed, he'll be the first one to take it.

557
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:42,370
Even if he's cured, he might still go around biting people.

558
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:46,740
He knows the taste of blood, and he knows nothing will happen to him even if he does that.

559
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:47,770
Even more so─

560
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,460
The most important thing is the treatment drug.

561
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,020
Whether he'll survive after that...

562
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,130
That's another story.

563
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,570

564
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,990
It's still the same.

565
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,330
 Today, the authorities added two more nursing homes

566
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:25,040
 as cohort quarantine locations.

567
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,830
 With the latest addition, one apartment complex, three nursing homes

568
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,150
 along with two homeless shelters,

569
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,610
 the locations have increased to eight in two days.

570
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,060
 The suspicion of the spread of Madman Rabies all over the world is getting bigger.

571
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,260
 Russia shut down the border due to the infectious disease so customs...

572
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,860
Did you sleep well?

573
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,850
Of course. You slept well, right, Ahjussi?

574
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,530
Yes.

575
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,900
Let's hurry and go.

576
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,020
- To where? 
 - To get the lunchbox.

577
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,660
- That's right! 
 - Hello.

578
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,840
- You're up, Seo Yoon. 
 - Hi.

579
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,650
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes.

580
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,820
Wow, Sae Bom. You look so happy today.

581
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,540
Yi Hyun was tossing and turning all night.

582
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:15,940
People should have something to look forward to

583
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,580
in order to become happy.

584
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,680
What are you talking about?

585
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,330
Aren't you looking forward to what's in the lunchbox?

586
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,840
Why, why, why?

587
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,330
It's my apartment that I bought with my money.

588
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,120
Why can't I leave?

589
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,750
Open up!

590
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:36,280
Sir, you live in a rental unit.

591
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,250
You moved in with my tax money.

592
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,910
The renters are residents, too!

593
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,450
You godd*** people!

594
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,220
They're management office staff and other building people.

595
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,060
But why?

596
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,560
They say we can't leave now. Other apartment buildings voted and decided that.

597
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Wait...

598
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,110
What are you doing right now?

599
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,520
This happened because an infected person came out of this building.

600
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,900
I heard you confined an infected person in the gym.

601
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,570
How did you know that?

602
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,880
We can see everything in the management office.

603
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,200
So are you saying you monitored us?

604
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,010
Now, now, for the sake of the entire apartment complex, the people in building one and two

605
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:23,320
should just stay home for a week.

606
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,220
How about our lunchbox?

607
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,040
We'll bring them in and put in the daily essential items for you.

608
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,830
We are all suffering. Why don't you stop this?

609
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,320
It's not like the disease is spread through the air.

610
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,770
Apartment buildings one and two have the most renters, right?

611
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,160
Yes, they have the most renters.

612
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,890
Why does that matter?

613
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,970
I'm saying it's unfair for us!

614
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:48,700
If there are more infected people and the real estate prices drop, we will get hit directly.

615
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,710
You guys can live here for ten years and buy it at a cheaper price.

616
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,450
We are not doing this on purpose!

617
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,480
Ahjussi Jung Gook, let me ask you a favor.

618
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,300
I can't even persuade my wife.

619
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,320
They don't want us to go outside. Let's not.

620
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,960
Not that. Let me borrow your gun.

621
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:16,400
Should I leave after shooting the door, or will you open the door?

622
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,790
Hey, the key, key, key.

623
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,170
Seo Yoon, don't ever learn stuff like that.

624
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,420
She's so cool.

625
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,510
Each and every day, I'm losing my love for humanity.

626
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,510
We just have to hang on for six more days.

627
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,000
Time is passing slower than it did during my training.

628
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,580
You're too much.

629
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,310
We paid special attention to your lunchboxes.

630
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,330
With lots of protein.

631
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,180

632
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,280
How about for people in other buildings? Is this it?

633
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,080
They want them later. After buildings one and two go back inside.

634
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,850
They're brave at times but also scared at other times.

635
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,440
I don't know about people.

636
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,520
You prepared enough, right?

637
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,390
We will take them inside for now.

638
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,240
Shall we go in?

639
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,160
Seo Yoon, let's go.

640
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,380
Do you need anything else?

641
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,960
Well, a T-Shirt. A large for men.

642
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,970
One that looks valuable. The one with the SOU mark on the back.

643
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:52,420
Well, you wouldn't have an SOU T-shirt, would you?

644
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,730
Are you working alone in the market, Lee Bo Ram?

645
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:01,340
Yes, the owner and his wife went to get the goods.

646
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,710
A lot of products are missing.

647
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,080
People from other buildings cleaned the shelves last night.

648
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,940
A few people from building 101 took some, too.

649
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:13,790
The situation isn't looking good, but you're calmer than I expected.

650
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,850
I'm getting triple the pay.

651
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:20,590
I work twelve hours a day. And with holiday pay, it's no joke.

652
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,840
Aren't you scared to be alone?

653
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,890
I would go crazy at home. Not at the market.

654
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,990
If all the goods are gone, I can just lock the door.

655
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,370
No delivery packages for me?

656
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:44,170
Geez! I have to get something delivered today. Good day.

657
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,490
I'm vegan. Isn't there a vegetarian lunchbox?

658
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,720
A vegan?

659
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,450
Just shove it in your mouth, whatever I give you.

660
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,360
This is the real thing. I know someone there.

661
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,770
I'll get you an SOU shirt as soon as the lockdown is lifted.

662
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:12,740
I like it.

663
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,580
Right?

664
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,960
Have you gone up to the rooftop?

665
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:28,150
- It's nice to be outside, right? 
 - Yes.

666
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,560
♫  Remember the moments we had  ♫

667
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,480
♫  on the beautiful hills  ♫

668
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,020
♫  Near where we used to live  ♫

669
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,560
I feel better since I'm standing in an open space.

670
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,820
I feel like we're out having fun.

671
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,340
I know. Let's stay here like this for a moment.

672
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,540
♫  Just forget the world  ♫

673
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,180
♫  Is this the end?  ♫

674
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,810
♫  Is this the end?  ♫

675
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:13,650
♫  I know, I know  ♫

676
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,880
Thank you for this food.

677
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,480
- Thank you for this food. 
 - Thank you for the food.

678
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,020
Eat a lot, Seo Yoon.

679
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,220
Considering this is emergency relief food, this place is good.

680
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,140
- It's quite good. 
 - Right.

681
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,690
Eat one more of this.

682
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,030
Thanks.

683
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,440
- You eat it, too. 
 - Thanks.

684
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,600
♫  It is a sad thing to know everything in life.  ♫

685
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,530
Seo Yoon, eat a lot.

686
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,190
What?

687
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,940
♫  Is this the end?  ♫

688
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,340
♫  No it's not the end.  ♫

689
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,920
♫  I know, I know, I know  ♫

690
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,660
♫  You don't need to answer  ♫

691
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:14,470
There are three bentos left.

692
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,650
Are you sure you passed them out to everyone?

693
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,490
Yes. The cleaning lady took one, too.

694
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,770
Oh, right.

695
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,810
The gym.

696
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,280
Kim Seung Beom, I'm sorry.

697
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,090
You should've called me saying you're hungry.

698
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,840
That jerk, he must've taken off.

699
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,110

700
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,680
- Hello? 
 - The potentially infected person at the gym disappeared.

701
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,430
 Please make an announcement telling everyone to go inside their apartments.

702
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,120
I was going to tell you anyway.

703
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,180
But the management office won't answer the phone. They must be upset over what happened earlier.

704
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,750
They're throwing a fit, saying they'll have a meeting without us.

705
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,340
Okay, I'll call them.

706
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,040
Hell-Hello...

707
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,710
This a**hole thinks he's above me.

708
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,630
He's merely a cop.

709
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:29,750

710
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:39,070

711
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,740
Hey, where are you going?

712
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,350
They're not answering the phone. What should I do?

713
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,380
Hey, where are you going?

714
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:01,830
He must be hiding in here somewhere.

715
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,220

716
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,770
 It's a wrong card.

717
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,930
Let's go.

718
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,200
Is he not there?

719
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,020
He's not.

720
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,090
What's that?

721
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,610
Hey!

722
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:02,210
It's blood.

723
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:14,350
Let's go.

724
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,520
- Let's see what's going on. 
 - Sae Bom!

725
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,850
I don't like being scared, not knowing what happened.

726
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,770
Ahjussi! Come out!

727
00:58:58,770 --> 00:58:59,940
Shouldn't we take him with us?

728
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,600
Hurry and come out if you don't want to die!

729
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,010
Why isn't it working?

730
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,410
 Please try entering again.

731
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,610
Let's go.

732
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,070
What...

733
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,580
What are you doing?

734
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,840
I just went to my car.

735
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,640
I really didn't drink.

736
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,710
Why did you run then?

737
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:45,450
I ran because you two ran!

738
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:47,400
Damn, let go of me!

739
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,240
Do you see him?

740
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,030
See who? Is something out there?

741
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:00,240
This is nuts...

742
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,620
Let's go up.

743
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:18,150
Help me, please!

744
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,960
 Ma'am! Are you okay?

745
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,730
 I'm okay, but that couple there is...

746
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,960
 Mommy, I'm fine.

747
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,570

748
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:23,580

749
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,790
Hey, hey. Now is the chance. Yes.

750
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,740
Hyun Kyung must be disturbed, too.

751
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:40,700
Let's try to have a more firm resolve.

752
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:43,970
Hey, we have to find an apartment in two months.

753
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,820
Are you going to move into a study dorm with our children?

754
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,110
It's too small.

755
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,660
Ahjumma, you can't leave.

756
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,390
Wait.

757
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:03,150
Stay put. If you take off again...

758
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,080
What are you doing?

759
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,830
- Is something wrong? 
 - Be quiet.

760
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,760

761
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,850
Yoon Sae Bom, are you safe?

762
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:33,370
Do you now know why the lockdown is necessary?

763
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,960
Who, who...

764
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,340
It's all over for other buildings.

765
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,310
I know.

766
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,900

767
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:39,040
♫  Realize  ♫

768
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:44,360

769
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:53,960

770
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,110
 If you're in danger, don't hesitate.

771
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,650
 Don't open the door and stop them.

772
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,460
 Does it make sense that they were all infected in that time?

773
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:10,480
 What if the situation isn't over after one week?

774
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,710
 We have to have as much food as we can gather.

775
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,120
 We just have to keep the downstairs couple quiet.

776
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,020
 Are you thirsty?

777
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,760
 You can't let them pity the infected. You have to make them fear them and want to run from them.

778
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,150
 Give me water!

779
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:29,910
 If you're human, why don't you have a sense of responsibility, at least?
