1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940

2
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,480

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,460

4
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,110
 I hope we can watch this together after getting out safely.

5
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,480

6
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,400
 I'll tell you properly then.

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,560
 That I like you.

8
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,040
 The receiver cannot be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

9
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,270
 You will be charged after the beep.

10
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,980

11
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,690
Seo Yoon.

12
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,390
Unni!

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,480
Hi.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,710
Yi Hyun is still at the apartment.

15
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,440
I'm going to go there and get him.

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,510
What about you? Do you feel okay?

17
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,260
I came to see Mom. I heard she is here.

18
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,660
Seo Yoon, wait here for a second.

19
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,460

20
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,460
- Seo Yoon! 
 - Mom!

21
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,440
Seo Yoon.

22
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,120
Yes, you should stay there.

23
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,950
I caught a cold.

24
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,070
I guess you came here with the police officer Unni.

25
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,110
Does it hurt a lot?

26
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,560
No, just a little.

27
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,740
But since you mustn't catch it...

28
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,430
- I heard you're getting the surgery. 
 - Yes.

29
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,960
You can't get sick before the surgery. Okay?

30
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,780
Get through the surgery well,

31
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,040
and do what Unni tells you to, okay?

32
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,400
So that the three of us can get healthy and meet again.

33
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,930
Seo Yoon, you should listen to your mom.

34
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,890
I'll see you after your surgery.

35
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,150
Mom... bye.

36
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,300
♫  Slowly down to low  ♫

37
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,740
♫  And it played around of game  ♫

38
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,140
I was told that Seo Yoon could get the surgery thanks to you.

39
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,250
You're the one who sent me Seo Yoon's letter, right?

40
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,220
I was only able to get this far because of it.

41
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,800
Without that, I would have ended up like my husband.

42
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,200
I know it's shameless of me to ask, but please look after Seo Yoon a little while longer.

43
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,250
It's because I don't know what's going to happen to me.

44
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,780
You should go now.

45
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,570
Please hurry.

46
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:32,240

47
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,650

48
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,210
You don't need to be nervous over my questions.

49
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,570
Okay.

50
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,910
How many peopke are infected inside the building?

51
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,760
If Detective Jung Yi Hyun is infected, too, then two people.

52
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,290
Since there was someone named Na Soo Min on the 4th floor.

53
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,250
And there are two more people who died after getting infected, right?

54
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,020
Please tell me everything you know about the infected.

55
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,020
We may need the information to develop a treatment.

56
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,780
Get through the surgery well. I'll come and visit you at the hospital with Ahjussi Jung Yi Hyun.

57
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,680
My mom is infected, right?

58
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,650
But she's just sick.

59
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,720
Like me.

60
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,050
That's right. That's why she'll be all better.

61
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,440
You and your mom, both of you.

62
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,600
About Seo Yoon's mother...

63
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,060
She held out this long just to see her daughter. She won't be able to hold out anymore.

64
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,150
She will be moved to the freezer warehouse in a day or two.

65
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,550
We made this with your blood.

66
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,580
Your antibody count is decreasing.

67
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,620
- And? 
 - This is the last effective treatment available.

68
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,560
We need to amplify it and use it for research in order to develop treatments.

69
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,520
Then all you have to do is give it up for everyone's sake.

70
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,560
A medical commander has come to take you.

71
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,840
He wants to take you and the cure to the lab.

72
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,000
So... are you breaking your promise?

73
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,540
What are you doing? Stop him!

74
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,920
It won't take long.

75
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,250
Do you realize what you're doing?

76
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,540
Of course, I do.

77
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm done.

78
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,460
Where's Yoon Sae Bom and the leftover cure?

79
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,060
She just left. Didn't you see her?

80
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,520
 If you go out the back gate on the first floor, you'll see a car.

81
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,920
  I left you a present inside, so make sure to take it with you.

82
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,420
 Should you be doing this?

83
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,760
 I thought you were a very ambitious person.

84
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,670
 I have a plan, so don't worry. Just do what needs to be done.

85
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,150
 But if you get caught, there's nothing I can do for you.

86
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,080
♫  With cutting words  ♫

87
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,300
♫  I don't want a change in my life  ♫

88
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,370
♫  Take me, I'm exhausted  ♫

89
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,310
♫  Burning through the grayish light  ♫

90
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,240
♫  Hold on to me, I'm stained in red  ♫

91
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,250
♫  Swimming through the darkness  ♫

92
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,360
♫  I'm trapped in despair  ♫

93
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,700
♫  Red light, there comes the pain  ♫

94
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,280
♫  Approaching without words  ♫

95
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:56,440
♫  Even if different days are here  ♫

96
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,060
♫  Please, I just want everything to stop  ♫

97
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,920
♫  With cutting words  ♫

98
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,860
Don't worry.

99
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,620
You'll get better.

100
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,070
What are you doing right now?

101
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,160
That's the cure, right?

102
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,010
Yes.

103
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,910
I was going to leave, but I just couldn't.

104
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,890
Do you want to shoot me?

105
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,100
What are you going to do now?

106
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:47,000
Even if you escape... you used up the cure.

107
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm not that special.

108
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,830
There will be others with antibodies.

109
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,690
Yi Hyun has me, but Seo Yoon... doesn't have anyone.

110
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,040
Until then, I just need to stay by Yi Hyun's side.

111
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,070

112
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,250
Hurry and leave. They check people who are wearing protective gear.

113
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,170
None will pay close attention to you.

114
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,510
I always knew we had a connection.

115
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,880
Hold on! You can't just leave.

116
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,850
No, not that. People will get suspicious if I look fine.

117
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,010
Really? But it'll hurt a lot.

118
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,400
Hurry and do it before I change my mind.

119
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,630
Close your eyes and take a deep breath.

120
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,280
Wait! Not the face!

121
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,650
Hit me someplace that won't hurt.

122
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,560
People will get suspicious.

123
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,510
Plus, the swelling on the face goes down the fastest.

124
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,120
Okay.

125
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,420
In one go.

126
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,310

127
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,710
Thanks for the gift.

128
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,080

129
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Did Yoon Sae Bom escape?

130
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,660
You know getting fired won't be all, right?

131
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,460
Why? Are you going to sentence me to death?

132
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,650
I thought you were a smart punk.

133
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,530
Why did you do it?

134
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,510
If you had used the last cure on your wife, I could have let it go.

135
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,530
I've done all kinds of things to lower the number of the infected.

136
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,080
Lockdown, quarantine, killing...

137
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,410
I have plenty of blood on my hands.

138
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,850
Thanks to that, you succeeded and protected a lot of people.

139
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,360
I only saw people as measures of efficiency and numbers.

140
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,000
But after seeing Yoon Sae Bom, I realized that there are other ways.

141
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,620
Hyun.

142
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,450
When you were next to me, I didn't realize how precious you were to me.

143
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,570
I will come get you, no matter where you are.

144
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,290
I heard Yoon Sae Bom left wearing your uniform.

145
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,210
- Yes, she forcibly— 
 - Never mind!

146
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,020
Where do you think she went?

147
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,990
It seems like she's planning to run away abroad with the cure.

148
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,930
I think we should put out an APB in airports and ports.

149
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,490
She probably went to her apartment since her husband is there.

150
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,620
Sir.

151
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,930
Keep going.

152
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,970
There's an antibody carrier in that apartment building.

153
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,140
Give me full authority.

154
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,560
Then I will bring the person to you.

155
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,930
Do you really think it's okay to leave?

156
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,800
It's okay. You saw the news. Everything is fine outside.

157
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,490
Everyone from Unit 501 left except the detective.

158
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,310
Still, if we leave, too, it'll be—

159
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,590
It's better if we're not here. We'll be helping by leaving.

160
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,190
Oh?

161
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,980
- Wait! 
 - Who is that?

162
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,490
Oh! Hey, Unit 501! The wife in Unit 501!

163
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,780
Hey, hurry and unlock this!

164
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,880
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

165
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,620
- Did they tell you to come back in? 
 - Hold on.

166
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,340
Where's Yi Hyun? Is he okay?

167
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,480
Is he alive?

168
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,370

169
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,700
 Hyun, wake up.

170
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,560
 We have to see each other again.

171
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,250
Sae Bom.

172
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,510
Ahjussi, are you okay?

173
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,550
You're bleeding a lot.

174
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm okay.

175
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,890
I'll sleep a little bit.

176
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,980
Okay...

177
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,800
You're sure about this, right?

178
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,630
You said it looks right, too.

179
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,860
Oppa, I told you it's over if we get it wrong ten times!

180
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,290
We need to consider all the possibilities.

181
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,320
Who is it?

182
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,480
Please help us. Please call the doctor.

183
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,540
 My husband got stabbed.

184
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,490
 He's conscious, but I think he lost a lot of blood. Please...

185
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,660
Oh Joo Hyung really isn't here.

186
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,880
I beg you. We're sorry for everything. Please.

187
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,000
I said the doctor isn't here!

188
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,810
Oppa, say something!

189
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,520
Really, no one else is here.

190
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,460
- Doctor! 
 - Come on!

191
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,640
 - Open the door! Open the door!  
 - But who...

192
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,350
did that to him?

193
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,620
- Damn it! 
  - Please open the door!

194
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,900
 Open the door! Open up!

195
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,650
Do you think you'll survive after everyone else dies?

196
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,570
I will set your unit on fire!

197
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,050
Darn it.

198
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,470
Open it!

199
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,060
D-Doctor?

200
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,760
Are you okay?

201
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,020
Hey, you saw that, too, right?

202
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,760
He was shot in the arm and the leg, but the bleeding has already stopped.

203
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,240
That's a good thing. What's the problem?

204
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,600
The smell of his blood disgusts me,

205
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,560
and I don't want it. He's infected.

206
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,370
What about my blood then? Did you want mine?

207
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,570
Can you just listen to me and not change the subject? I'm saying he's infected!

208
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,100
I don't hear you denying it.

209
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,000
How could you want your sister's blood? What kind of brother are you?

210
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,860
Oh...

211
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,050
Oh, are you okay?

212
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,050
- Get some water. 
 - Okay.

213
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,240
What are you two doing here?

214
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,160
You kept bleeding, and there was nothing I could do by myself.

215
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,190
I put that on him in case he had an attack.

216
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,950
Don't you feel thirsty?

217
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,850
It's not as bad these days.

218
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,830
I do feel thirsty

219
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,090
but diabetes runs in our family.

220
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,610
Where is Sae Bom?

221
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,900
What? She's not in the building.

222
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,840
The other detective and the girl are gone, too.

223
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,070
They left, didn't they?

224
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,630
The news said everything was fine outside.

225
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,370
I heard martial law has been lifted except for the areas in lockdown.

226
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,260
Maybe the door to the outside is open or something.

227
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,240
I don't know what's going on outside, either.

228
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,590
Oh, don't move! You have two gunshot wounds.

229
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,860
I bit Andrew.

230
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,580
What?

231
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,360
He's a murderer and even more dangerous if he's infected.

232
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,680
If he's alive,

233
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,260
I have to catch him.

234
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,670
Help him.

235
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,980
What?

236
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,590
Let's look for him on our way down before there are more victims.

237
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,470
 While the Central Disease Relief Center is minimizing the spread of infection with quick diagnosis and bold lockdowns,

238
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,770
 it looks like the prevention of Madness Rabies seems plausible.

239
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:09,390
 According to the insider, the current vaccine that's in clinical trials is showing a meaningful efficacy rate.

240
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,060
 And if positive results are produced, they will request immediate

241
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,570
 approval for usage with the Federal Health Department.

242
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,030
- Drink some of this. You have to eat something to gain strength. 
  - Considering the danger of spreading the infection, the government decided to

243
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,120
 maintain the quarantine of the infected until the treatment therapy has been developed.

244
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,400
 Based on that, the nursing homes and apartments that are currently in lockdown

245
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,910
 will continue for now.

246
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,710
 And the residents in the region...

247
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,350
Oh, look. The brave Detective is here.

248
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,440
You must've gotten hurt in the electricity room.

249
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,760
Are there people with injuries inside?

250
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,070
The cleaner couple from the second floor.

251
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,030
He got stabbed by Andrew, so I'm treating him on a humanitarian level.

252
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,270
I don't see Andrew nor the building representative.

253
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,620
Do you know where they are?

254
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,060
They must have gone out.

255
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,560
Where is your wife?

256
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,820
Andrew is dangerous right now.

257
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,090
Don't ever open the door for him.

258
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,650
If possible, I'm thinking of bringing criminal charges against the three of you.

259
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,190
The couple from across the hallway in unit 602...

260
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,720
Sang Hee and that attorney fell for each other. Look at this.

261
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,070
She did this to me.

262
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,780
Shouldn't you catch them and lock them away first?

263
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,430
We already stopped by unit 602.

264
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,650
That attorney ahjussi showed us where you bit his arm.

265
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,200
That's right. I'm infected,

266
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,530
but there are so many people who have been infected.

267
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,280
Do you think anyone will punish me for biting someone?

268
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,960
Oh Joo Hyung.

269
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,540
You're not infected.

270
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,140
I know because I am.

271
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm barely holding back the urge to bite you.

272
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,710
I took the pill, too. I took the pill, too!

273
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:15,240
You don't always get infected by taking the pill.

274
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,460
Some get infected much later, and some don't even get infected.

275
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,710
Where is your husband?

276
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,980
His condition keeps deteriorating. Is there anything you can do for him?

277
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,610
Of course, his condition isn’t good

278
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,810
when he has a knife stuck in his body.

279
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:46,360
Honey, I’m okay. I’ll get up soon.

280
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,060
So tell him to get out of here! Please!

281
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,570
Ahjussi, this is my place!

282
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,460
How long can he last?

283
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,230
He’ll die right away if you pull out the knife,

284
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,430
and if you leave it in, about two days or so?

285
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,440
I’ll look for a way to get him out. Look after his wounds in the meantime.

286
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,080
I gave him painkillers and even gave up my bedroom. What more do you want me to do?

287
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,600
You're keeping them both here in case you get thirsty for blood, aren't you?

288
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,240
Who do you think I am? What nonsense are you spewing?

289
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,890
Have you been taking those pills?

290
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,370
Is that why you thought you were infected?

291
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,630
Yes, I was going to have them as my lunch! So what? I took the pills because I thought I might die!

292
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,990
Just concentrate on treating him instead.

293
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,700
If you create one more issue,

294
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,480
I’ll lock you up in the basement.

295
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,290
What proof do you have to lock me up?

296
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,800
Are you the judge? Hey! Hey!

297
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,220
Honey. This.

298
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,150
Try this.

299
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,970
If you take this pill, the wound is supposed to heal quickly.

300
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,780
Did you drink?

301
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:01,250
You do love me, don’t you?

302
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,190
Don't bite me, even if you get infected.

303
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,230
Sir, are you okay?

304
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,580
Oh, of course, I am!

305
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,060
You don’t look so well, either, though.

306
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,470
- How is your wife doing? 
 - We’re fine,

307
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,440
so please just take good care of my son.

308
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,080
Isn’t Kim Dong Hyun back yet?

309
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,740
What? Isn’t he on the 2nd floor?

310
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,420
He did say he wanted to go out.

311
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:02,060
If you happen to see him, please tell him to come home, since we’re okay.

312
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,030
A home is...

313
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,610
there for you to go to when things get hard.

314
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,830
I understand.

315
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,340
By chance, if Andrew…

316
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,800
If you see an unfamiliar young guy, don’t ever open the door to him.

317
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,010
He’s very dangerous.

318
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,080
Oh, okay.

319
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,720
But why would he come here?

320
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,720
There are only two old folks living here.

321
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,660
Sir, do you have enough food?

322
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,230
Would you like us to bring you some more?

323
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,280
Why would you offer him food when we don’t have enough for us?

324
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,870
I’m going to give them some of mine!

325
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,570
Why are you so selfish?

326
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,370
The two of you, move aside.

327
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,980
That guy is infected.

328
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,760
I saw him biting Andrew.

329
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,950
I’m infected, too.

330
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,590
Let’s not fight, Building Representative.

331
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,930
There’s a good chance Andrew is still in the building.

332
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,220
Andrew is dead.

333
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,940
I was going to go out and meet with the person in charge of the blockade, but the infected are right in front of the building.

334
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,070
Still, we caught the murderer so all we have to do is wait quietly.

335
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:13,920
Did you get rid of Andrew’s body then?

336
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,100
It’s on the rooftop.

337
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,860
You're the one who bit him and killed him!

338
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,010
There’s no one on the rooftop.

339
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,410
You must be trying to fool me,

340
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,140
but do I look like an idiot? No way!

341
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,010
I’m normal. I’m different from you infected people!

342
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,000
It’s dangerous if you go alone, Building Representative.

343
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,560
Is it okay to leave that ahjumma alone?

344
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,210
She lost her family.

345
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,750
I’m sure she needs someone to hate.

346
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,230
Oh, my head hurts...

347
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,850
The police bastard hid Andrew’s body. He's lying to me.

348
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,770
I'll just kill him if I have to.

349
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,890
Andrew and Kim Dong Hyun must both have left.

350
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,220
What?

351
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,210
Wait...

352
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,060
Oh, don’t do that! What if the infected get in?

353
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,910
Don’t come out.

354
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,880
Are you okay?

355
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,960
How long has it been since you got bit?

356
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:19,150
Hey, isn’t that the jobless guy from the 3rd floor?

357
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,380
It looks like he got hurt.

358
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,500
Hurt? He got bit!

359
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,250
Well, um...

360
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:41,360
isn't he infected?

361
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,470
He hasn't had an episode yet.

362
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:49,340
If he stays with his family, he might be able to endure better.

363
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,200
Dad, I'm sorry.

364
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,760
Oh no...

365
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,080
Honey!

366
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,450
Dong Hyun is back!

367
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,560
Moon Hee.

368
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,120
Yes?

369
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,200
Are you okay? Do you feel better?

370
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,230
It hurts less.

371
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,750
Who gave you those pills?

372
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:18,180
Should I… try taking the knife out?

373
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,180
Hold on.

374
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,190
Do you have more pills?

375
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,210
Give me the water.

376
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,250
Let’s try removing it.

377
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,530
I’m going to pull it out.

378
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,930
Moon Hee, you know…

379
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,970
I don’t think I can leave empty-handed after ending up like this.

380
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,170
Let’s take this apartment.

381
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,160
How?

382
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,860
Sir…

383
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,370
What is it? Is he dead?

384
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,490
I pulled out the knife.

385
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,240
I told you not to! Did he bleed all over the floor?

386
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,230
Why don’t you people listen?

387
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,420
Sir. You don’t have any family, right?

388
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,330
Aigoo,

389
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:00,190
doesn’t it look more swollen than before?

390
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,250
Oppa, how many times do I have to tell you no?

391
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,810
Are you sure?

392
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,220
I already told you!

393
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,810
Stop touching it! That’s why it’s getting more swollen!

394
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,690
You really think I’m fine, right?

395
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,210
What do we do about the bitcoin?

396
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:24,630
I have the passcode but not the laptop.

397
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,210
The laptop!

398
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,170
 Sang Hee! I’ll give you the money, so open the door!

399
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,340
 Sang Hee! Open the door!

400
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,960
 - Sang Hee!  
 - Maybe he’s doing that so he can bite us.

401
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,630
 I’ll give you the money!

402
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,510
How much?

403
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,740
Hey, that cleaner bastard has totally gone nuts!

404
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,590
Get away!

405
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,600
If Go Se Gyoo’s condition becomes critical, we’ll have to get him out somehow.

406
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,190
We can't leave him to die.

407
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,500
Detective Jung!

408
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,350
Detective Jung, help me! I almost died.

409
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,750
What is it now?

410
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,420
He gave us the pills. He said the wound will heal if he takes it.

411
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,960
Are you nuts? That's not true. I'm not crazy!

412
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,350
Why would I increase the number of monsters?

413
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,180
Is your husband okay?

414
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,910
He's still struggling. He's lying down right now.

415
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,860
Can't you kick that man out somewhere?

416
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,570
I'm too scared to have him in here with us.

417
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,680
You have to kick these people out if anything!

418
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,440
Why don't you believe me? We're both residents of this building!

419
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,240
It's the first time hearing you say that we're both residents of this building.

420
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,350
I warned you, didn't I?

421
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,710
Let's go to the gym.

422
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,210
My laptop, laptop. Tell them to give me my laptop.

423
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,690
Laptop! My laptop!

424
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,980
Are you happy that I'm leaving?

425
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:36,040
What are you doing right now? Where are you taking the doctor?

426
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,200
I'm planning to quarantine him.

427
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,500
Watch yourself if you don't want to end up like this, too.

428
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,460
Honey, all this is ours, right?

429
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,900
Of course. You said that bastard doesn't have any family.

430
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,600
He nearly killed me.

431
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,990
We can ask him to compensate us for damages with this apartment.

432
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,540
He'd never agree to it.

433
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:20,420
We can get rid of him before the lockdown lifts. They'll think one of the infected killed him.

434
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,180
Right?

435
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,940
Oh, Moon Hee... Moon Hee...

436
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,190
- Get me some water. 
 - Oh, okay.

437
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,750
Just take this, too.

438
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm thirsty for some strange reason.

439
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,450
How many are there?

440
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,340
One,

441
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,360
two,

442
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,040
three...

443
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,830
Why didn't you leave with your wife?

444
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,960
I have to watch the house until she comes back.

445
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,420
It took a lot of effort to get this place through special provisions for civil servants.

446
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,710
I know that you were worried about us, too.

447
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:01,630
If you hadn't stayed behind, something bad would have happened.

448
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,880
Thank you.

449
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,810
I'll get some rest and then look for Andrew one more time.

450
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,950
It could be dangerous, so both of you should go home.

451
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,870
We can help.

452
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,670
I could be dangerous to you, too.

453
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:30,580
Your brother seems to have gotten a lot better, but not me.

454
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,030
Hey...

455
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,170
Be safe.

456
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,520
Bom.

457
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,210
Are you well?

458
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,470
I miss you.

459
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,060
We survived thanks to Jung Yi Hyun.

460
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,720
He is infected, but—

461
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,350
Then he's home, right?

462
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:35,170
It's dangerous, so don't go outside and stay home!

463
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,680
The lockdown will lift soon!

464
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,320
What? Really?

465
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,150
See? She says not to go outside!

466
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,580
 Hey, that's amazing.

467
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:04,400
Hey! Sang Hee. I knew you would come!

468
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,390
Let go.

469
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,080
Let go and talk.

470
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,930
What can you do without a key?

471
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,830
Building Representative, please help me.

472
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:18,230
I only came to help him.

473
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,760
You must be crazy!

474
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,850
Wouldn't it be better for us to get rid of that detective bastard?

475
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,740
His wife ran away, so we just need to get rid of that bastard.

476
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,380
Do you want us to kill a detective?

477
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,010
He's infected.

478
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:48,040
I'll break that for you with this, so do as I tell you.

479
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,940
 Help me!

480
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,000
Oh Joo Hyung.

481
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,910
Calm down, and let go of her.

482
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:30,370
Jung Yi Hyun, let's kill all the uninfected people

483
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:33,440
and say that everything happened because of the disease.

484
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,880
That's right. The monsters did everything.

485
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,250
You guys are the monsters, not the infected people!

486
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,430
Aren't you thirsty?

487
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,920
Should we find out who the real monster is?

488
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,960
Jung Yi Hyun! Jung Yi Hyun!

489
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,520
 Don't you love the smell of blood?

490
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,360
Don't hold it in! You must have lived your whole life holding it in!

491
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,860
 Jung Yi Hyun! Jung Yi Hyun!

492
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,060
 Come out! Come out!

493
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,600
 Come out!

494
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,620
 Come out!

495
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,790
Why won't everyone listen to me?

496
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,460
This is my building. Listen to me!

497
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,350
Calm down! I'm not here to arrest you!

498
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,880
You killed my husband.

499
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,560
I even captured a murderer, and I'm not infected, either.

500
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,220
I'm qualified to be Resident Representative.

501
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,290
Okay. When you're released from jail, I'll vote for you.

502
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,250
- Okay. 
  - Come out, come out!

503
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,670
 Come out!

504
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,270
Just come, bite me and change!

505
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:25,350
I'll have an episode soon, too!

506
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,710
You're dead.

507
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,300
Hyun...

508
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,360
I'm here.

509
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:19,440
I realized it when I heard what you said.

510
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,840
What matters in a home is who you are with.

511
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,860
I plan to be with you in the future.

512
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,270
Stay with me.

513
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:24,480
I don't care what state you're in.

514
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:40,660
Are you sure there is an antibody carrier inside the apartment building?

515
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,240
There was a testimony.

516
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,250
 Please tell me everything you know about the infected.

517
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,210
 We may need the information to develop a treatment.

518
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,960
 There's not much that I know,

519
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,900
 but Na Hyun Kyung said that her brother's wound stayed the same.

520
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,780
 That it didn't get worse or better.

521
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,920
Did you ask for full authority solely based on that?

522
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,750
Ji Soo.

523
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,440
Did we ever have anything we can rely on?

524
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:34,900
 Oppa, open the door, please. I got the bitcoins!

525
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,080
 It has been tough, hasn't it?

526
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,220
 I'm sorry that I've been so sensitive.

527
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:44,820
 I mean, we did all that to be happy.

528
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:45,780

529
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,520
 Oppa, are you listening to me? Oppa!

530
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,110

531
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,010
 Oppa! Oppa Hae Sung!

532
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:55,680
 Honey! I'm telling you, we can be happy now!

533
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,010
 - Open the door!  
 - So-So Yoon? So Yoon...

534
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:02,770
- I'm really sorry. It's all my fault. Please? 
  - Oppa!

535
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:04,390
 Don't ever call me again.

536
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,130
- No, no, no, I... 
  - Oppa...

537
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:07,620
 You're in there, right?

538
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,410
I've been repenting. Honestly.

539
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,930
 Can you hear me?

540
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,690
- So– 
  - Open the door for a second.

541
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:17,080
Gosh, but I really have been repenting.

542
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,270
 I'm telling you, we can be happy now. Oppa?

543
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,910
  - The call is not going through...   
- Geez...

544
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:35,480
 We were happy together. We can be even happier.

545
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,300
 Open the door. Please? Open it.

546
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,970
Fine. I'll have to take the next best thing.

547
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,550
Did he bite your arm?

548
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,460

549
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,310
Is the internet working now?

550
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:01,990
Oppa, I'll give you some coins.

551
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,990
- The passcode. 
 - Oh, okay...

552
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,620

553
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,360

554
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,930
Look.

555
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,890

556
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,950

557
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,780
 Various economic indicators and outlooks are still dim.

558
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:47,350
 In our nation, as well as globally, the stock markets continue to fall.

559
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:51,420
 More than 30 stocks declining in value were listed in the Korean stock market today.

560
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,070
 - The price of crude oils, gold, and various raw materials has fallen.  
 - Honey...

561
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,940
 The international crude oil price is $80 per barrel...

562
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,340
I'm sure the cure will be out soon.

563
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,310
It will be developed in no time.

564
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:09,670
The health department could suddenly come and ring our doorbell to help us!

565
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,250
 The drop in the value will continue to drop

566
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,000
 and the market capitalization of the virtual currency market

567
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,620
 - compared to three months ago, 97.5%...  
 - What...

568
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,600
Oh, my God! Aigoo!

569
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,490
H-Hey...

570
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:28,010
Mom, they're here. We'll live now!

571
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:30,380
- I was right! 
 - Aigoo!

572
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,580
I told you they would come! I told you so!

573
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:36,580
- Aigoo! 
 - Be gentle...

574
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,520
Aigoo!

575
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,720
Take it.

576
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,740
Thank you!

577
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,880
No, I never bit anyone.

578
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,120
I'm telling you the truth.

579
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,440
I'm not thirsty, either.

580
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,500
Try giving me some water. It's true. I don't get thirsty.

581
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,970
It's true. I never bit anyone.

582
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,220
He has been perfectly fine. He could have recovered completely.

583
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,370
I think he's actually recovered. Right, Oppa, you're all better now, right?

584
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:09,630
Yes, since I'm not thirsty.

585
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,460
Nothing's wrong with him, right? He's fine, isn't he?

586
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,950
- I don't get thirsty. 
 - Don't talk too much!

587
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,780
Yes, I'm being honest!

588
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,910
We found the antibody carrier. We're returning now.

589
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,510
I'll take care of Yoon Sae Bom.

590
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:42,230
Do what you need to do. Just bring in the antibody carrier.

591
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,800
Be careful with him.

592
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:52,330
Take Yoon Sae Bom and Jung Yi Hyun to the dorm.

593
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:53,870
Yes, Sir.

594
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,910
 No! No!

595
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:57,860
This is our home! What are you doing?

596
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,760
 No! No!

597
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,740
Honey! Look at this! No! It's our apartment!

598
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,460
No, it's our apartment!

599
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:07,040
No! No!

600
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,140
No!

601
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,740
This is our home!

602
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,270
- No! 
 - It's mine!

603
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:17,190
- This is our apartment! 
 - Let go! It's mine!

604
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,830
This is our place! Let go!

605
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:20,630
No! This is ours!

606
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,980
It's ours! Let go of me!

607
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,750
- I'm going to take it with me! 
 - It's ours!

608
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,380
- I said it's mine! 
 - This is our home!

609
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,850
Just stay here. It's too bad if it's hot.

610
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:39,430
Don't you dare think this is the end! Remember!

611
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:44,070
Sae Bom, you'll vote for me, right?

612
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,940
Sure. Let's go.

613
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:07,660
We shouldn't leave Kim Se Hoon here, right?

614
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,060
Let's move him to his place.

615
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,230
I'll go open the door.

616
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,300
Call Yoon Sae Bom here.

617
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,990
Drop the gun, Yoon Sae Bom.

618
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:17,620
Just shoot him. I can take a hit.

619
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,810
Drop the gun if you want him to live!

620
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,340
Never. Just shoot him now!

621
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,480
It's fresh blood.

622
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,360
Yi Hyun.

623
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,890
Yi Hyun.

told you that I was going to be the bad cop.

628
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,170
You...

629
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:02,600
keep being the good cop.

♫  Is this the end  ♫

650
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:09,520
♫  I know, I know  ♫

♫  I know it is the end  ♫

653
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,070
Be careful.

654
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,610
Aren't you tired after all that running?

655
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:28,330
- I'm not tired at all. 
 - Really?

656
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,930
Then shall we take it up a notch?

657
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:32,100
How about the gym?

658
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,800
All the residents can use the facility now.

659
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:42,670
- I have plans, so I have to go back home. 
 - What?

660
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,940
Bye!

661
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,960
Which plans?

662
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,590
Seo Yoon.

663
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:50,800
All right. Shall we go then?

664
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,720
What are you thinking?

665
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:05,440
Last year when we were locked up here.

666
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,640
It was tough, wasn't it?

667
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,570
Still...

668
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:13,010
But it was okay because you were with me.

669
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,360
When did you start liking me?

670
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,080
Since the beginning, I told you. Why don't you believe me?

671
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,940
I said to myself that you were my destiny, that I'll be with you forever.

672
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,510
So you never gave up?

673
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,100
Why do you think I became a cop?

674
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,880
Hey! Don't tell me you became a cop because of me!

675
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,060
I thought about going to the States, but I couldn't stop thinking about what you said.

676
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:45,520
You said our future was full of choices, so I should do whatever I wanted. But then you went with the SOU!

677
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,430
Hey, I had no idea.

678
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:54,390
So are you happy now?

679
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:00,620
Of course. Only when I'm with you.

680
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,690
I'm not that happy otherwise.

681
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,600
Stop lying.

682
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:10,210
The first one home will be exempt from recycling duty for a week!

683
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:11,820
You're cheating! Hey!

684
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:13,630
Including the food garbage!

685
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:14,940
I refuse to lose!
