1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,380

3
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,440

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,230
Sae Bom is here, right?

5
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,580
She is a little busy right now.

6
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,150
She will be out soon. Please wait.

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,970
Did you take the drug? The one you bought at the gym?

8
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,290
If you messed with Sae Bom, you're dead.

9
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,840
It seems like there has been a misunderstanding.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,350
Then open this door right now.

11
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,820
Where is Sae Bom?

12
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,180
Sae Bom!

13
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,630
What?

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,650
Hyun, are you hungry, too?

15
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,260
What?

16
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,090
Well, I came here because I missed you.

17
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,520
- Help me out. 
 - What?

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,830
- I said help me out. Stand up. 
 - What?

19
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,540
Come on, stand up.

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,880
We are newlyweds so I missed her a lot.

21
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,820
I mean, he worries about me even if he doesn't see me for a short while.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,190
You must... You must love her very much.

23
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,570
Of course.

24
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,840
What is it? Why?

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,410
Do you want some?

26
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,900
He has so many interesting things. Look.

27
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,650
He also has a lot of food.

28
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,320
- Weren't there any problems? 
 - No.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,740

30
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,620

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,340
Then I'll see you later.

32
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,550
Thank you for this.

33
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,910
Hey, why did you do that? If he gets annoyed, he will hold a grudge for a long time.

34
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,080
The gym trainer sold NEXT to that guy.

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,900
Don't turn around. He might be watching us right now.

36
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,960
No way. He is not some spy or anything...

37
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,090
Let me have a look at you.

38
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,400
Did you get hurt anywhere? Did you get a scratch or...

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,920
feel a pinch behind your neck? Anything like that?

40
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,250
This isn't healing...

41
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,610
It has almost healed. It is not even that noticeable.

42
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,260
Anyway, did anything seem strange besides the interior decoration?

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,050
He said his father was a diplomat so he traveled through Africa and the Middle East during his childhood.

44
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,750
And that's how he realized that the end of the earth isn't too far off.

45
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,140
So he is strange.

46
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,480
But he seems nice. He gave me all this, too.

47
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,290
These are super delicious when you're hungry.

48
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,510
Everything is delicious when you're hungry.

49
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,360
Who is it?

50
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,730
Hi.

51
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,460
Little Girl, are you alone?

52
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,600
- Who are you, Ahjussi? 
 - Don't you know me?

53
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,970
You know I'm your mom's friend.

54
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,830
Can you open this?

55
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,680
If you just unlock...

56
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,660
 Little Girl, why did you do that? You hurt my hand!

57
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,310
I'm sorry. Can you open the door for me?

58
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,990
 I'm not a bad person.

59
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,890
 Are you listening to what I'm saying?

60
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,760
Do you have any medicine or something?

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,210
Where did you get hurt?

62
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,250
How did you get in here?

63
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,880
The first-floor door was open.

64
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,770
I'm not trying to do anything bad.

65
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,160
I haven't even bitten anyone.

66
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,760
I just feel so lonely and feel frustrated.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,990
Try to say that nonsense after wiping the blood off your mouth.

68
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,560
Who did you bite?

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,420
Just slightly...

70
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,370
I didn't bite a lot.

71
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,630
He survived and ran away.

72
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Leave at the count of three.

73
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,160
One,

74
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,620
two, three!

75
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,660
Seo Yoon, it is Unni.

76
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,870
Seo Yoon, it is Unni Sae Bom.

77
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,160
Did that man leave?

78
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,930
Yes.

79
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,620
- Where is Ahjussi Jung Gook? 
 - On the second floor.

80
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,600
He went down because we are out of kitchen cleaners and toothpaste.

81
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,660
I will be right back. Don't open the door no matter who asks you to open it.

82
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,660
Just like how you did. Okay?

83
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,790
You did well, Seo Yoon.

84
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,230
Eat this and calm yourself down. Okay?

85
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,160
- I will be right back. 
 - Okay.

86
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
- I will be right back. 
 - Okay.

87
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,370
How did he get inside?

88
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,390
There may be more inside. I have to look through the building.

89
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,420
More important, I wonder whose blood he has on him.

90
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,860
 Ahjumma.

91
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,770
Ahjumma, I'm not infected. Really!

92
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,870
Actually, I came here because the ahjumma from unit 1205 said she would give me money,

93
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,190
 but with this lockdown and infection... What the hell is going on here?

94
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,030
Ahjumma, I will... I will help you.

95
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,030
I will help you so we can both get out. Think about it. Have I...

96
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,440
Have I done anything strange? I haven't!

97
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,490
I just sat here quietly, didn't I?

98
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,630
- Aren't you thirsty? 
 - What?

99
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,390
Look.

100
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm fine, right?

101
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,930
I'm perfectly fine.

102
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,720
I look fine, right?

103
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,830
 I will definitely help you, Ahjumma...

104
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,460
 Ahjumma, you'll never be able to get out by yourself. Really.

105
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,910
 Ahjumma, help me out just this once.

106
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,040
Thank you.

107
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,300
I will trust you just this once.

108
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,020
Are you okay?

109
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,000
Even if I drink...

110
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Even if I drink, I'm still thirsty... What am I supposed to do?

111
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,830
Ahjumma, I'm all better now.

112
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,630
Come over here. We have to go upstairs together.

113
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,190
Will you keep standing there

114
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,580
until the infected people come?

115
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,530
Ahjumma, come on. Trust me!

116
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,420
Hyun...

117
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,650
Let's hurry.

118
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,470
It is Na Soo Min's phone.

119
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,450

120
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,630
I mean, no matter how much I drink...

121
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,680
I feel parched.

122
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,300
Where are Na Soo Min and Na Hyun Kyung?

123
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,560
I don't know, either.

124
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,510
Kim Seung Beom, inhale and exhale deeply.

125
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,820
Your desire will subside if you can just control your breathing.

126
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,930
I mean...

127
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,810
I feel more thirsty the more I drink...

128
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,600
Do you know how tough that is when I know what I need to drink to quench my thirst?

129
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,700
when I know what I need to drink to quench my thirst?

130
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,860
What do you think will quench your thirst?

131
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,250
Human blood?

132
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,370
But how would you know that?

133
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,670
Who told you that?

134
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,330
I just know.

135
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,140
When I see a pale neck, I become more thirsty.

136
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,400
Do you think I'm not using a gun because I don't have one?

137
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,150
What are you doing here?

138
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,550
I came to help you two.

139
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,310
Where is my brother?

140
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,060
We will look for him.

141
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,220
Don't think about anything right now and get some rest.

142
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,430
He must blame me.

143
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,880
I asked him to come with me.

144
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,720
It is a disease.

145
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,120
We can only stand our ground until there is a treatment.

146
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,180
Colonel, the treatment is almost ready, right?

147
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,220
These are sleeping pills. Take one whenever you need one.

148
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,830
Take one now and get some rest.

149
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,730
Let's go outside and talk.

150
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Can't you comfort her when she is struggling?

151
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,870
Why did you shoot him?

152
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,560
Kim Seung Beom. He was more than capable of communicating with us.

153
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,900
There are tons of people who lost their families on the outside.

154
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,460
A mom is biting her child, and a husband is biting his wife.

155
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,090
If you don't want to lose someone close to you, you shouldn't hesitate, either, Yoon Sae Bom.

156
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,110
This isn't healing. Why is that?

157
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,750
I know you looked at me when I was giving her water so tell me the truth.

158
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,730
It means the virus is still present in your body. Sort of like debris.

159
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,330
Could I end up biting people?

160
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,820
That is why I wanted to draw your blood every two weeks.

161
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,660
We have to keep checking.

162
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,560
Is that why you came here?

163
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,820
To draw my blood?

164
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,300
- It is because of Seo Yoon's parents. 
 - Is something wrong?

165
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,280
Her father has been infected.

166
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,690
Her mother is fine, but she desperately misses her daughter.

167
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,690
Then you came to take Seo Yoon with you?

168
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,860
The Madman Rabies situation is worsening not only in our country but globally.

169
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,220
I have some news about the follow-up measures for the apartment, too,

170
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,480
so let's gather the residents after making sure the building is safe.

171
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,310
My Lord...

172
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,230
Is it over?

173
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,100
You said they become normal once they drink blood.

174
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,490
Maybe he bit someone and went home after coming to his senses.

175
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,130
 Is everyone okay in there?

176
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,100
 Open the door!

177
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,170
 Is anyone in there?

178
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,430
Hyun, are you okay?

179
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,450
You're not lying after getting bit, are you?

180
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,850
 This isn't the fable "The Wolf And Lamb"!

181
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,620
 Stop rambling nonsense and open the door!

182
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,060
He could be lying. He could!

183
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,860
- Don't you fall for his annoyingly good looks. 
 - My Lord...

184
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,200
 Sir, I can hear everything.

185
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,370
 Open the door, Hyung.

186
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,420
What is taking so long to open it?

187
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,680
- Hyung, what is wrong with you? 
 - I almost died!

188
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,190
Hey!

189
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,400
- Damn it! 
 - This is nuts.

190
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,860
Never mind, Hyung. What exactly is going on?

191
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,650
Well, I came to get some cleaners and toothpaste,

192
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,340
but the people with white eyes ran after us from the emergency exit.

193
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,330
- Did anyone get hurt? 
 - No.

194
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,190
Thanks to the pastor...

195
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,720
The pastor has spiritual powers.

196
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,460

197
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,520
- What are you talking about now? 
 - It is true!

198
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,890
No way...

199
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,590
I didn't have a gun at that point, but...

200
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,730
Oh, right. Hey, where is my gun?

201
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,160
- What? 
 - Gosh, calm down.

202
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,350
Who opened the door on the first floor?

203
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,930
Well...

204
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,800
- The jobless guy on the second floor. 
 - He and the supermarket girl left the door open and ran away.

205
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,490
Wait, Hyun...

206
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,670
Who shut the door behind me earlier?

207
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,460
Do you think they're okay downstairs?

208
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,300
What if someone got hurt?

209
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,790
All we need to do is make sure our stories match up.

210
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,900
We have to say that we ran away after spotting infected people.

211
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,560
No one can hold us responsible then.

212
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,260
Hello.

213
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,470
Miss, you're very pretty.

214
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,470
What is your name?

215
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm Lee Bo Ram.

216
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,790
Thank you for the food, Ma'am.

217
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,890
Mom, here.

218
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,760
We are busy. Get out.

219
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,270
All right.

220
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,130
- Let me know if you need anything. 
 - Okay.

221
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,310
Thank you.

222
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,430
Don't the two of them look good together?

223
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,680
Don't get your hopes up.

224
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,090
Who would fall for an unemployed guy like that?

225
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,690
Who cares about that?

226
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,260
Look at who I live with.

227
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,690
What?

228
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,000
I think someone is here.

229
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,840
Like I said, just make sure our stories match up.

230
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,300
Don't say anything strange, okay?

231
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,550
We will speak in private. Don't mind us.

232
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:18,700
No...

233
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,090
You two opened the door to the building, right?

234
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,860
What door?

235
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,170
We were here the whole time.

236
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,970
Why? Why, why, why?

237
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,270
We went downstairs, and the door was open so we got scared and ran away. Really, really.

238
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,340
Did you get bitten or scratched?

239
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,000
We just got scared and ran away. That is all. Really.

240
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,220
I'm fine, too.

241
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,250
Why did you go down to the first floor?

242
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,770
Did you go out because of this?

243
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:18,850
Gosh, give it to me. I have to do my show. I put my life on the line for that. Ouch!

244
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,880
Someone is missing because of you.

245
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,320
If you're human, you should have a sense of responsibility, at least.

246
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,930
Is everyone okay?

247
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,720
Well, for now.

248
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,050
Geez, I barely held myself back from wanting to beat him up.

249
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,840
Where is Han Tae Seok?

250
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,530
He went to the rooftop. He is looking for infected people.

251
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,630
Is something wrong?

252
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,310
Seo Yoon's father has been infected.

253
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,870
That is why he came.

254
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,940
I'm here to help

255
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,450
so rest assured.

256
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,960
Yes, it looks that way.

257
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,390
Did any infected come up here?

258
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,640
Two of them came up, and I told them to go down that way.

259
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,250
Oh, I broke that.

260
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,770
When you told them to go down, did they just go?

261
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,700
There aren't any infected people inside the apartment.

262
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,310
It looks like Na Soo Min went outside after being infected.

263
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:16,470
You know his name, too. I guess you did your research before coming.

264
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,570
Why did you come here?

265
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,820
You must have already heard from Yoon Sae Bom.

266
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,970
Exactly.

267
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,220
Are you taking Seo Yoon with you?

268
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,430
It's strange, though.

269
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,850
The Han Tae Sok I know isn't all that caring.

270
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,580
You even shot and killed someone earlier.

271
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,530
I don't know what you're thinking,

272
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,830
but I'm only trying to stop the Madman Rabies situation.

273
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,470
In that regard, I'm sure you also...

274
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,830
share my opinion.

275
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Are you sure Sae Bom is okay?

276
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,850
Her wound isn't healing.

277
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,350
Unless her wound changes color, you don't have to worry.

278
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,560
The Madman Rabies virus isn't harmful unless it goes to the brain.

279
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,670
Besides Sae Bom, there are lots of people who have recovered from that condition, right?

280
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,100
There were four people.

281
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,070
The recent examinations show that they've been infected.

282
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,540
Ultimately, it is a matter of time.

283
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,280
They couldn't avoid the disease.

284
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,820
When will the cure be available?

285
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm looking for an antibody that can penetrate the brain.

286
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,060
Without that, the development of a cure

287
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,250
is impossible.

288
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,440
So what you're saying is...

289
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,390
The situation...

290
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,500
will continue to worsen

291
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,930
until we find the antibody.

292
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,240
What are you doing?

293
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,450
I gathered the residents so come downstairs.

294
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,950
I will tell Seo Yoon first.

295
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,420
There is something her mother wanted me to tell her.

296
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,690
May I talk to her alone?

297
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,760
You're Seo Yoon.

298
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,780
You're the ahjussi from TV, right?

299
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,500
The one who talks about the Madman Rabies.

300
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,220
Yes, you're pretty smart.

301
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,630
I hear that a lot.

302
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,850
Can I speak to you for a moment?

303
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,700
Would you like to eat something?

304
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220
We have combat ration.

305
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,580
Ahjussi?

306
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,760
What?

307
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,920
Oh, okay.

308
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,160
Let's eat the combat ration next time.

309
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,100
I'm here to check up on you today.

310
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,050
I promised your parents, Seo Yoon.

311
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,180
Do you know my mom and dad?

312
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,500
Park Yong Cheol and Kang Eun Ji. I saw them this morning, too.

313
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,120
Do they miss me?

314
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,180
Very much.

315
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,140
Do you want to meet them?

316
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,740
If you want, you can get out of here.

317
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,730
Can Unni Sae Bom go out with me?

318
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,310
Of course. Yoon Sae Bom's mother is outside, too.

319
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,870
Sae Bom must also...

320
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,270
miss her mom a lot just like you, Seo Yoon.

321
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,860
You decide, Seo Yoon. I will help you.

322
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,490
- Hyun, you know... 
 - When Seo Yoon leaves, why not go with...

323
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,320
Go ahead.

324
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,700
What will you do if you end up catching the disease?

325
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:40,170
What disease?

326
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,160
Madman Rabies.

327
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,120
Since there is a chance...

328
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,680
you could catch it...

329
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,030
Yes. Of course, I could catch it.

330
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,480
It isn't like we did anything wrong to catch it.

331
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,900
By chance, if I catch the disease...

332
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,510
and get thirsty and want to...

333
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,270
bite people...

334
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,010
I will be sure to tell you.

335
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,820
So...

336
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:13,910
be sure you tell me if anything happens to you.

337
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,450
I will.

338
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,790
I spoke with her. Let's go and meet the residents.

339
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,470
Your son almost killed us!

340
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,250
How dare you glare at me like that? You're so much younger than me!

341
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,690
Didn't you catch the disease or something?

342
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,230
Do these eyes look like I caught the disease? Do they look like it?

343
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,310
Who exactly!

344
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,790
Told everyone to gather here without going through the Building Representative?

345
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,040
I heard an outsider has entered the building.

346
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,370
Has anyone seen him?

347
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,740
Did you see him? Who is it?

348
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,300
A soldier.

349
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,170
Are you sure you weren't mistaken? I don't think you can see well.

350
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,250
Are you joking right now?

351
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,300
Step aside, please.

352
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,850
The man from TV...

353
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,030
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Han Tae Seok from Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters.

354
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,510
Sir, has the lockdown been lifted?

355
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,630
- Really? 
 - Has it been lifted? 
 - Can we get out?

356
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,670
When can we get out?

357
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:27,180
The entire city is in a lockdown,

358
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,790
and the electricity will be shut off in the apartment complex tonight.

359
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,060
Wait, wh-why are you shutting off the electricity?

360
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,230
Are you telling all of us to die? What is this?

361
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,880
We plan to resolve this as soon as possible.

362
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,460
If you were going to do this, you should at least lift the lockdown.

363
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,410
You should let the healthy people leave at the very least. This is a violation of human rights.

364
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,440
I mean, we don't even live here. Never mind the lockdown or whatnot. You should let us go home at least.

365
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,460
Colonel, the people are exhausted.

366
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,660
Would shutting them out resolve the issue?

367
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,480
I-I-I know a hoobae who is a one-star general.

368
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,710
- The phone. Give me your phone. Let me make a call. 
 - Sir, Sir...

369
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,110
A phone call will end all this.

370
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,040
- That's not important right now. 
 - Just one phone call...

371
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,830
What is that?

372
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,690
What is that?

373
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,400
 This is a real situation.

374
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,330
 People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

375
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,680
 From this point on, the entire city of Seyang will be under martial law.

376
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,000
- Martial law? 
  - This is a real situation.

377
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,430
 People of South Korea, this is a real situation.

378
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,970
I will go and check up on Seo Yoon.

379
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,310
- I will go to the gym. 
 - Should I go with you?

380
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,620
No, I will go with Hyung Jung Gook later.

381
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,270
Be careful. If it is dangerous, don't hesitate.

382
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,330
If something happens, I will take all the blame.

383
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,650
Don't worry.

384
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,880
 The government is trying to stop the spread of the Madman Rabies and the false information

385
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,220
 while break-ins, assaults, and other crimes have been increasing,

386
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,230
 resulting in the disturbance of societal order.

387
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,700
 In order to restore public safety and order,

388
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,360
 protect the people's lives and property

389
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,990
 to end this crisis and maintain order,

390
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:33,550
 we are declaring emergency martial law in the city of Seyang.

391
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,790
Unni.

392
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,120
 From this point on, the people...

393
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,910
It is okay, it is okay. They're only making it sound serious.

394
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:56,100
As you heard, it is dangerous outside as well.

395
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,770
Four days.

396
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:03,750
The martial law will lift in four days and the level of the apartment complex lockdown will be lowered.

397
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,670
Why are you shutting off the electricity?

398
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,860
There are infected people inside the power plant, too.

399
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,170
Not only this place but the electricity will be cut off everywhere except for a few essential locations.

400
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,290
- What? 
 - Just like this place,

401
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,240
the entire Seyang city residents' ability to go outside will be limited.

402
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,170
Is it really that bad outside?

403
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:26,050
Everyday necessities and drinking water are short overall right now.

404
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,890
Violent incidents continue to occur from everywhere in the city.

405
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:33,040
Well, then, I guess it could be better to stay inside.

406
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,160
All right. We have endured well all this time.

407
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,020
Four days? That could be a short time.

408
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,540
Trust me, and let's endure a little bit longer.

409
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:53,180
That Madman Rabies... I thought you could catch the disease if you take this one drug.

410
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,320
Is it true?

411
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,010
We are still working on confirming the facts regarding the nature of the disease.

412
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,480
It is true. That is it.

413
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:19,590
Now, go home and get the stuff you need. Fill up your sinks and bathtubs with water.

414
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:25,130
When the electricity shuts off, the water will be shut off as well.

415
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,510
Don't worry too much.

416
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:37,540
Overcoming a national crisis is our nation's special character.

417
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,150
Thank you, Attorney.

418
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,380
I will go and fill up our bathtub, too.

419
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,860
Seo Yoon.

420
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,250
You talked to the soldier ahjussi, right?

421
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,650
I don't know too well how things are going in the outside world.

422
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:12,160
It could be better than here, or it could be worse.

423
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,400
Do you want to meet your mom and dad, Seo Yoon?

424
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,720
I don't drink that much water.

425
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,150
I'm not saying this because I feel that you're a burden.

426
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,540
If you say you want to stay here, I will do my best to protect you, Seo Yoon.

427
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,600
And I will let you meet your parents.

428
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm just asking how you feel, Seo Yoon.

429
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,810
I do want to meet them, but that soldier ahjussi is strange.

430
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,730
Why? How so?

431
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:54,190
He's just a bit... He seems to be interested in you, Unni.

432
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,750
He asked me how you've been.

433
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,890
He asked if you're sick, too.

434
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,180
Will this work?

435
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:33,740
It might be dangerous outside. I will be right back.

436
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,550
Where is Seo Yoon?

437
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,650
She wants you to give it to her mom and dad.

438
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:03,530
If you're concerned about Seo Yoon leaving alone, you can go out with her.

439
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,620
If not now, you don't know when Seo Yoon will get to meet her parents–

440
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,850
Why did you come here?

441
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,190
To resolve this situation, I came to find even the slightest possibility.

442
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,990
I think you came to get me, but I don't know why.

443
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,800
Does it have anything to do with this?

444
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,390
I guess you could say that.

445
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,430
We found an antibody in you.

446
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,070
We have to check and see if that antibody is useful.

447
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:43,380
Even if we have to let you get bitten by an infected, if necessary.

448
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,390
Don't shoot!

449
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:11,720
What?

450
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,200
Didn't you just hear a gunshot?

451
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,650
It's martial law. Someone must be shooting a warning shot.

452
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:27,790
Hey, Hyun. You're close to Han Tae Seok, right?

453
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,010
No.

454
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:34,960
Hey. When he leaves, could you ask him to take me with him?

455
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,420
I'm having a hard time.

456
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,390
Are you worried about your wife?

457
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,970
All right. I will ask him.

458
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,010
I'm sure your wife is okay, Hyung. Don't worry.

459
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,530
Didn't you say Kim Seung Beom is dead?

460
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,520
Yes, over there...

461
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,740

462
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,140
This is...

463
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,040
They cut out his brain.

464
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,060
Why would they do that to the dead?

465
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,360
 I'm looking for an antibody that will penetrate the brain.

466
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,430
 Before that, the development of therapeutics is impossible.

467
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,010
 This isn't healing.

468
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,860
 Unless her wound changes color, you don't have to worry.

469
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,700
 The Madman Rabies virus isn't harmful unless it goes to the brain.

470
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,540
He came to take Sae Bom with him.

471
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,790
To find an antibody.

472
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,170
Hyung, you watch this spot.

473
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,430
Make sure you stop Han Tae Seok if he shows up.

474
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,050
Seo Yoon, why are you out here? It's dangerous. Go back inside. Okay?

475
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:29,560
I heard a gunshot. Is Unni okay?

476
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,980
She went outside with a pair of scissors earlier. To give him my letter.

477
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,000
Let's go inside.

478
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,030
Unni is a much better fighter than me. You know that, right?

479
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,160
So you don't have to worry at all.

480
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,590
Go home and be sure to lock the door.

481
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,180
I will be right there. Got it?

482
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,680
S-Sae Bom...

483
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,540
Yoon Sae Bom is sick. Step aside.

484
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,580
Sae Bom is injured. Han Tae Seok took her.

485
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,030
Obtained my target. Coming up.

486
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,110
Don't feel too sorry for the infected.

487
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,390
They can control their thirst,

488
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,620
as long as they're willing.

489
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,380
If you hurt Sae Bom, you're dead.

490
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:16,060
Stay still if you don't want to die.

491
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,830
The tranquilizer was potent enough to put an elephant to sleep.

492
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:22,290
I guess I'm stronger than an elephant.

493
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,530
I'm letting you off because you didn't kill that man earlier.

494
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:43,340
Sae Bom, did you get hurt?

495
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,370
It's okay. I'm fine.

496
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,380
Calm down.

497
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,480
Lieutenant, long time no see.

498
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,550
If you don't want this to get ugly, please tell them to lower their guns.

499
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,600
Lower your guns.

500
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,770
Yoon Sae Bom.

501
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,810
What can I offer you for you to take the exam?

502
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,000
You bastard.

503
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,130
Hey.

504
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,010
I'm not doing this because I like you guys.

505
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,220
I'm doing it since it helps with finding treatment.

506
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,360
Thank you.

507
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,070
Wait.

508
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:12,330
Please prepare lunch boxes for the apartment residents with lots of meat.

509
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:18,970
And I heard that you took Kim Seung Beom's body.

510
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:26,060
I'm sure you need to follow the procedure to take care of the body, but please relay the news to his family.

511
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,920
The situation on the outside isn't too good. It will take some time to contact them.

512
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,650
And my mom...

513
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:38,330
Your mom is doing well in the nursing home.

514
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:42,760
Colonel took good care of her. Don't worry.

515
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,760
So why did you cut into Kim Seung Beom's brain?

516
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,060
Are you looking for an antibody?

517
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,540
I told you that the Madman Rabies virus affects the brain, right?

518
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,860
When we test the blood of a diseased dead, sometimes we find an antibody.

519
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,310
It's just that it can't penetrate the brain.

520
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,900
The antibody is in the body, but it can't penetrate the brain. That is the problem.

521
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,100
So that is why you penetrated the infected people's brains, to see if an antibody was in their brains.

522
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,500
How about Sae Bom?

523
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,800
Were you going to penetrate Sae Bom's brain, too?

524
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,470
No. We have to take her blood.

525
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:29,380
And we can experiment with her blood.

526
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:38,080
Can you develop the cure with Sae Bom's blood?

527
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,410
A new type of monoclonal antibody was discovered in Yoon Sae Bom's blood.

528
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,640
We have to examine further, but...

529
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,100
it is possible that it could penetrate the barrier inside the brain and get to the brain.

530
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,840
That means Sae Bom is a crucial person for our country right now.

531
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,150
That's possible.

532
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,280
Then give us a few weapons

533
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,490
to protect Sae Bom.

534
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,260
Will you be okay?

535
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,510
What about?

536
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,740
The existence of an antibody isn't a certainty yet.

537
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,500
Yoon Sae Bom can develop symptoms at any given point.

538
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,390
That's why I should be next to her so I can watch her. Right next to her.

539
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,050
Hyun!

540
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,320
Hey, I'm finished!

541
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,190
 The blood has been drawn.

542
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,860
Let's go. I will give you the supplies you want.

543
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,470
So why are you going this far?

544
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,810
Sneaking into the apartment and all. Well, wanting to save the infected...

545
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,110
Don't say useless things like that.

546
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,460
It is because of the money.

547
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,780
Many rich and powerful people are infected, too.

548
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,240
That is why we are taking care of this secretly.

549
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,730
If the word spreads, even if we have to draw all the blood from Yoon Sae Bom's body,

550
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,560
they'll want to be the first ones to heal.

551
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,500
Then the development of a cure that is truly worth a fortune will be delayed.

552
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:20,890
You want money, and I want Sae Bom. Don't ever mess with us again.

553
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:28,000
And, after all this is over, I will expose everything you did. Know that.

554
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,970
Do that.

555
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,870
I will take responsibility for everything I did.

556
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,780
Ahjussi, no smoking.

557
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,640
Open the door.

558
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,270
- Are you okay, Hyung? 
 - Oh, yes...

559
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,940
The blood all over Sae Bom's face earlier...

560
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,430
That wasn't Sae Bom's blood.

561
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,180
Don't worry, Hyung.

562
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,560
- Hyun. 
 - Yes?

563
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,400
My gun.

564
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,130
Thanks.

565
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,990
I heard something big had happened in the gym.

566
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,630
Is the lady on the fourth floor okay?

567
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,870
I will let you know if I need your help.

568
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,270
I will take this.

569
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,730
I told you, just eat whatever.

570
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,620
I'm looking at the expiration date. Geez...

571
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,040
I thought he would kill him, but he shot him once to graze his shoulder, then stopped.

572
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,140
And he didn't wait for me to get bitten, either.

573
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,460
 Don't shoot!

574
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,020
But he's still bad.

575
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,710
I know that,

576
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:15,890
but he seemed pretty desperate, too.

577
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,440
Four days. We just have to endure it for four days.

578
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,890
Then everything will get back to normal.

579
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,840
Will you cooperate with that weirdo on the sixth floor?

580
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,310
No. He's really not it.

581
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,910
We need a person.

582
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:19,190
Someone with power, yet will do whatever we tell him to do.

583
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,910
Where would we find someone like that?

584
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,330
Yes.

585
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:39,080
Well, is the pastor home?

586
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,700
 I wanted to thank him for saving my life...

587
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,720
 and I wanted to pray.

588
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,970
Hello.

589
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,890
- Come in. 
 - Okay.

590
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,090
Are you just going to watch your dramas?

591
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,030
What else would I do in here?

592
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:08,000
Take the trash out.

593
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,880
You don't like the stench.

594
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,920
There is no other husband like me on this earth.

595
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,060
Hello, Attorney.

596
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,550
Yes, hello.

597
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,510
You must be here to take out the trash.

598
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,230
Yes.

599
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,090
Oh Joo Hyung makes a guest take the trash out in his house?

600
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,060
Give it to me.

601
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,610
To throw this out properly, the lockdown has to get lifted anyway.

602
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,500
What's wrong?

603
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,040
Should I go downstairs and throw this out?

604
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,240
I'm so scared.

605
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,880
What's the matter?

606
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,180
Does Oh Joo Hyung bother you?

607
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:52,150
Can you help me?

608
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,040
What should we do with the food waste?

609
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,870
Should I put it in the freezer?

610
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,220
The fridge isn't a trash can. Give it to me.

611
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,680
Do you know where to leave it?

612
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,080
Are you crazy?

613
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,320
We pay the maintenance fee.

614
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,680
 Oh Joo Hyung killed his wife.

615
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,650
 - Are you serious? 
 - Yes.

616
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,890
 He told me.

617
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:13,240
 If you don't help me, he will kill me, too.

618
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,970
 I thought I would be fine if I just got out of here, but now we are under martial law.

619
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,710
 Of course, I must help you.

620
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,570
 I will protect you, Ms.Woo Sang Hee

621
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:33,840
 I knew you wouldn't turn me away.

622
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:39,410
 Yes. You'll be okay.

623
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:27,610
What took you so long?

624
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:29,030
I took out the trash.

625
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,260
In that fancy dress?

626
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,490
This is my usual dress.

627
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,710
I can't keep wearing your wife's clothes.

628
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:40,960
Are you thirsty?

629
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,930
Don't worry. I'm not infected.

630
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,710

631
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,910
What should we do with Ms.Yoon Sae Bom's blood sample?

632
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:26,000
Run it only at a lab that has level-three biosafety.

633
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,810
Yoon Sae Bom woke up after getting a tranquilizer shot.

634
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:36,200
But that much tranquilizer should have put anyone to sleep.

635
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,280
The virus could have gotten into her brain.

636
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,590
Being able to recover quickly is what the infected have in common.

637
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:45,970
But the test result came out clean.

638
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,640
It's possible that her body has working antibodies.

639
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,490
Proceed carefully so the higher-ups don't get wind of this.

640
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,850
No one can go after her before we can develop the cure. Got it?

641
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:56,260
Yes, Sir.

642
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,890
How are Park Seo Yoon's parents?

643
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:04,050
Her father's symptoms have advanced, but her mother is only showing mild symptoms.

644
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,690
Give this to him when he feels better.

645
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,890

646
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,230
It will help a bit.

647
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,850
Seo Yoon.

648
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,690
Yes. I'm coming!

649
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:11,430
Can I eat this?

650
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,170
Will they really cut off the power?

651
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,470
Yes, they will.

652
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,100
You know,

653
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,990
you took care of the fridge as if you were taking care of a shrine.

654
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,080
It is nice to have this much food at times like this.

655
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:33,090
We can eat doenjang out on the balcony, right?

656
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,250
I made it myself.

657
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,740
It is better than the store-bought ones.

658
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,380
Well...

659
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,590
Mother and Father, I will get going now. 
  (T/N: People often address other people's parents - usually friend's parents - in this manner in Korea)

660
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:55,400
Why? Is Dong Hyun not coming out?

661
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,700
By the way, do you have a place to go?

662
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,070
I should go to the second floor.

663
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,740
I heard you caused trouble there.

664
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,180
Are you sure you're welcome there?

665
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,960
- Stay safe then. 
 - You...

666
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,660
Oh, my...

667
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:22,730
Then take care.

668
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:30,560
You are so heartless. Dong Hyun is just like you.

669
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,960
Hey, Student.

670
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,130
We have an empty room. If you want to stay here, you can.

671
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,540
Really?

672
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:47,370
Thank you.

673
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,750
Thank you so much.

674
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,880
Oppa! Oppa!

675
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,070
 Hey, Hyun Kyung.

676
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,830
 I'm all a-all right.

677
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,350
 I just wanted to let you know that.

678
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,690
Do you have a place to sleep?

679
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:22,670
 I am a little scared,

680
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,130
 but you know I can't come inside.

681
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,490
 I don't know what I might do to you.

682
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:36,030
Oppa. I'm sorry.

683
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,630
Hey, don't say that.

684
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:40,880
Why are you sorry?

685
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,450
 It's all my fault.

686
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,160
 Hyun Kyung,

687
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,580
can I ask you one thing?

688
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:57,670
 If I e-end up...

689
01:04:59,110 --> 01:05:01,410
 If something happens to me,

690
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:07,510
 please look after...

691
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:09,780
 my family.

692
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:15,550
Oppa.

693
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:19,470
You'll be okay. They said the cure would be ready soon.

694
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,540
Hang in there—

695
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,310
Oppa. What?

696
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,530

697
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:50,980

698
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,650
Just a bit more. Give me a bit more time.

699
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,080
It is so delicious.

700
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,690
Really?

701
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,110
Let me try some, too.

702
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,420
It is quite good.

703
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,980
I told you. I know best when it comes to food.

710
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,550
Watch your fingers. It's still hot.

711
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,720
You're eating well.

712
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,190
Isn't it good?

713
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:58,330
It's good.

 ~ Preview ~ 
 There might be more infected people inside.

721
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,660
 I saw something weird.

722
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,060
 Where did you find this?

723
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,010
 She has a wound on her hand.

724
01:08:02,010 --> 01:08:05,470
 Dad! You know Mom is acting weird, right?

725
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:09,520
 He's inside, right? You're secretly harboring an infected person.

726
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,820
 It's better to get rid of the infected quickly.

727
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,880
 Did you drug the water?

728
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,250
 I only need the two of you to die. The rest of them is a bonus.

729
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,040
 How could you come up with messed-up thought like that?
