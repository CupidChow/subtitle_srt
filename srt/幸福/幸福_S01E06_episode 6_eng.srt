1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060

2
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,460

3
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,960

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,780
 There was a 50% off sale sign in front of the store.

5
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,300
 It's perfect for our baby,so I bought one.

6
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,340
But we don't even know if it's a boy or a girl yet.

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,430
 It's a girl who resembles you. I say that every day while tapping on my tummy.

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,850
A girl shouldn't look like me.

9
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,590
The chairman must be here.

10
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,390
 Yes, I'm nearby, too.

11
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,750
- See you later. 
  - Bye.

12
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,360
Yes.

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,760
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

14
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,530
Oh, so the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety gave the final approval?

15
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,320
Yes, yes, we will announce it tomorrow morning.

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,350
It's only for adults with ADHD, and if it's proven effective, we will add more patient categories.

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:01,530
Good work. I was getting concerned, wondering if I have to take all those Next pills piled in the warehouse.

18
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,700
Thanks to you, I will be making money again, Director Han.

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,070
It failed as a treatment for pneumonia, but I believe it's plausible for adult ADHD.

20
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,820
Yes, yes. The word is already out that it increases the ability to concentrate.

21
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,090
Quite a few people around me are already taking it.

22
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,860
- Is it Next? 
 - Yes.

23
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,260
- Have you not tried it, Director Han? 
 - No.

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,150
Try taking it when you're feeling tired. I feel alive. It's excellent.

25
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,890
Hello.

26
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,140
Hello, I'm Park Young In.

27
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,390
I heard a lot about you. Please take a seat.

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,880
- Is that it? 
 - Yes.

29
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,790
So are you having a prince or a princess?

30
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,460
Our baby? I think it's a girl.

31
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,630
Aigoo. That's great. They say having one daughter is better than ten sons these days.

32
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,830
That's what everyone says.

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,160
- Excuse me. 
 - Sure.

34
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,410
Then when do we get to meet your princess?

35
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,230
I'm at twelve weeks right now so probably in about six months?

36
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,040
Biting people?

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,390
Are you sure they didn't take some other drugs?

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,360
We are announcing the final approval tomorrow.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,210
Check him into the hospital and make sure no one talks. The rumor can't get out.

40
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,040
It's not like they died. Who cares? Just offer treatment cost and compensation then!

41
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,080
I'll call you back.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,390
Honey...

43
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,420
The prime minister's office is summoning you.

44
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,410
Where is it going?

45
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,080
The landfill. We lack facilities for mild case patients.

46
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,490
Do you still not understand what I'm doing?

47
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,920
No, Sir.

48
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,040
I made the choice, at which point I'll prevent further damage.

49
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,770
You'll soon have to decide how far you'll get your hands bloodied, Lieutenant Lee.

50
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,460
How did the treatment drug work?

51
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,890
We sorted biotherapeutics and injected them into the infected, but they all died.

52
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,650
Do it again. Until it works. I'll buy us time.

53
00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:00,060

54
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,300

55
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,380
What do we do then?

56
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,260
You're saying Madman Rabies patients are right outside, but we won't be getting help from the authorities.

57
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,390
We have to force our way out then!

58
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,250
They even installed fences along the walls.

59
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,870
Even if we make it out, where are we supposed to go?

60
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,790
We just have to get out first and go into the most expensive apartment.

61
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,820
What can they do then? Will they lock that down too? With a bunch of high and mighty people living there?

62
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,690
The reason they're doing this to us is that our apartments are cheap.

63
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,400
But are you sure the patients are outside?

64
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,030
Building Representative and Oh Joo Hyung are both absent.

65
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,310
Are you implying that it's just the renters that are here again?

66
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,080
I'm trying to say that most of the people who left the building are absent.

67
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,700
If you want to go outside, go ahead.

68
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,970
I can't guarantee that you'll make it back, though.

69
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,820
Then I'll assume that all of you understand.

70
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,380
The food and other items we brought from the supermarket are in unit 201. Go there if you need anything.

71
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,930
But I'm sure they are lacking something, too, so please exchange it for whatever they need.

72
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,960
If the infected people's symptoms get worse, what if they break in through the doors?

73
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,430
If they hit it with a car or something, it'll break since it's a glass door.

74
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:27,590
They'll probably find an easier way to get inside instead.

75
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,060
That's how a crime always starts out.

76
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,790
"I went in because the door was left open, I took the bike because there was no lock on it..."

77
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,950
But "I want to break in because I'm craving blood"...

78
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,470
To come to that decision is tougher than you think.

79
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,220
It means, as long as you don't give them a reason to...

80
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,050
All the doors have been locked...

81
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,820
Why?

82
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,460
The rooftop.

83
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,490
I'm the only one here.

84
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,190
Do you think he heard us?

85
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,390
I hope not.

86
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,890
Andrew, you never get startled. Outside or here.

87
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,650
I'm just happy that people don't see me as weird.

88
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,530
Be careful, both of you.

89
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,600
You, too, Andrew.

90
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,900
Let's take a breather before we go back in.

91
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm so tired.

92
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,130
This reminds me of the old days, standing here like this.

93
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,760
When?

94
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,940
That day? Hey.

95
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,430
Gosh, I wondered momentarily if I could fly that day.

96
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,300
You did fly.

97
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,260
I did.

98
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,790
If I could fly, I would go to my mom's nursing home.

99
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,170
It was uncomfortable to go see her so I kept postponing it, and here we are.

100
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,830
I wonder what happened to all the infected people.

101
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,030
Are they hiding somewhere and holding back their thirst?

102
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,120
They're probably scared.

103
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,630
Afraid that they'll bite someone closest to them. Afraid that they'll completely turn into monsters.

104
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,730
But I'm sure they'll fight until they're defeated by their thirst.

105
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,060
Everyone should be okay, right?

106
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,040
Of course. We just have to make sure not to get hurt so we can meet them again healthy.

107
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,960
So don't do that kind of stuff ever again.

108
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,550
Hey! We have no idea what kind of blood that is. Why would you get it on your hands?

109
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,540
But it's okay that I put it on Oh Joo Hyung's face?

110
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,270
Well, it's not like you made him eat it.

111
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,800
I doubt he would lick that blood.

112
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,300
He would never do that.

113
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,290
Gosh, it seemed like he really cares about his health.

114
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,580
Seeing that he didn't come down earlier, I think he feels a bit intimidated now.

115
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,280
Now that I think about it, the Building Rep didn't show up, either, right?

116
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,640
Are you okay?

117
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,650
Of course, I'm not okay.

118
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,870
Look at this.

119
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,220
I must've been so shocked for this to happen... Darn.

120
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe it's best to give up, given what happened.

121
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,500
Looking at the state of things, it doesn't seem like you would make that much money by being the resident representative.

122
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,780
And if we move? If we move now, this place would be worth nothing. Dirt cheap.

123
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,880
So you want us to lose money by leaving here and starting over at another apartment?

124
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,350
I'm saying it because there's no other way.

125
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,090
You said you think Seung Beom at the gym seems infected, too.

126
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,300
You went to the gym every day. What did you do there?

127
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,820
You should have monitored stuff like that.

128
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,620
I had no idea he would do that.

129
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,780
When the lockdown is lifted, the entire apartment complex will need some repair.

130
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,560
I'll change the elevator's interior, and I'll suggest getting rid of the outer wall.

131
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,500
The lockdown was easier because of that wall.

132
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,710
Let's also suggest that we plant some trees around the perimeter.

133
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,950
You said you know a landscaping company, right?

134
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,630
We can sterilize the whole place since there were infected people.

135
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,770
That's right! That's it!

136
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,230
Once we think differently, there are plenty of ideas.

137
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,410
But do you think you can become the resident's representative?

138
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,820
I'll recruit some people who are influential in the building.

139
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,070
 My father was a schizophrenic.

140
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,860
 He passed away two years ago.

141
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,770
 I get shocked easily if I see a similar type of illness.

142
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,410
Unni isn't home right now.

143
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,330
Darn it.

144
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,520
I see. You're the child from unit 502.

145
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,510
 So are you home alone?

146
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,950
 Where are the people from unit 501?

147
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,840
- Can you open the door for a second? 
 - The people from Unit 501 are here.

148
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,760
That scared me.

149
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

150
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,060
But you know, you should have explained properly that you're fine.

151
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,410
Anyone would misunderstand seeing the blood.

152
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,650
Don't you think so?

153
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,860
It's tough for you, too, isn't it?

154
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,050
But what a relief that there is someone taking care of you.

155
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,090
It is a huge relief.

156
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,890
That we are on the lower floors.

157
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,480
With all this going on, you must be so disappointed that you can't enjoy being newlyweds.

158
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,760
My husband and I started on the first floor of a villa.

159
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,290
And of all days, there was a flood.

160
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,090
When I think back to how much we suffered...

161
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,750
How did you two meet?

162
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,370
Oh, my goodness.

163
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,370
You two must go back pretty far.

164
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,990
Please have a seat over there.

165
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,590
- I can't trust that ahjumma. 
 - Me, neither.

166
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,900
So why did you bring her in?

167
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,130
"Keep your friends close, your enemies closer."

168
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,040
Hey, where is Sae Bom?

169
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,080
She's talking to the building representative. She says she came by to apologize.

170
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,540
Apologize?

171
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,420
- I'm sure even her apology makes you feel angry. 
 - Yeah!

172
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,830
It's because she's not sorry.

173
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,630
But she asked me if I was aiming to become the resident's representative.

174
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,430
- So that's what she's after. 
 - Why would you want to? It'd be such a hassle.

175
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,130
She spoke like you would make tons of money.

176
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,630
Hey, from the management office to outside services, the representative signs off on all those contracts.

177
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,890
The elevator, outer wall, rooftop, parking, electricity, landscaping.

178
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,250
- Everything. All of that is money. 
 - Everything?

179
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,900
Don't you have any more?

180
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,170
I'm an athlete, after all.

181
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,860
Give me one more kimbap.

182
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,000
- Kimbap? 
 - Yes.

183
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,300
Wait.

184
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,600
Ahjussi, are you going to handcuff me again today?

185
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,030
I'm losing blood circulation.

186
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,960
- Kim Seung Beom. 
 - Yes.

187
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,260
All the residents here are hyper-anxious.

188
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,120
They don't know so they let it slide until now.

189
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,890
But soon, people will start being suspicious about your condition.

190
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,880
So?

191
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,060
I'm asking you to be cautious so people won't get scared.

192
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,990
I can't keep you uncuffed today,

193
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:34,050
but if you're okay for a few more days, I'll let you roam around the gym freely.

194
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,700
You're not threatening me today...

195
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm just hoping you're not infected, Kim Seung Beom.

196
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,620
Even without your issue, there are tons of other problems in this building.

197
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,420
Seriously! Gosh! S***!

198
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,690
I'm going to kill him! Wait and see!

199
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,730
Why are you looking at me like that? I'm fine.

200
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,590
Hey, hey, look. All clear, right?

201
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,580
You seem to be the one who is scared.

202
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,960
You were basically washing your skin off.

203
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,630
Hey! Hey, hey, what are you taking?

204
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,990

205
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,190
I thought you were taking something weird and unhealthy.

206
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,020
Pour me a drink.

207
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,010
You saw Min Ji taking medicine at the clinic, huh?

208
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,430
Like supplements or a pick-me-up.

209
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,720
She did take something now and then when she got tired.

210
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,590
Which medicine?

211
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,530
I don't know. It was some type of pill.

212
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,230
She said it was a health supplement she got from her gym.

213
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,860
The gym?

214
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,200
 Moreover, I didn't see your name on the gym entry log.

215
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,050
 My wife used to go to that gym.

216
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,930
 Did the Madness Rabies start at the gym?

217
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,540
Why? Is it something important?

218
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,490
Go easy on the alcohol. It's not good for you.

219
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,650
Where are you going?

220
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,250
Somewhere. Don't worry about it.

221
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,760

222
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,240

223
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,430

224
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,020
- You go ahead, Hyung. 
 - Why?

225
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,330
I left my wallet.

226
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,030
Why do you carry your wallet?

227
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,820
I'll be right back. Go on ahead.

228
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,490

229
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,280
Who is there?

230
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,180
You're really here like this.

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,680
Ahjussi, are you stuck here?

232
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,340
Yes, well. I'm stuck here.

233
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,760
The cop from the fifth floor locked me up here.

234
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,320
Ahjussi, please help me.

235
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,360
There's really nothing wrong with me.

236
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,790
I'm totally fine, but that cop living upstairs...

237
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,350
- That cop– 
 - You sold

238
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,520
drugs to my wife, didn't you?

239
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,370
The woman doctor from the sixth floor. The one who died from Madman Rabies.

240
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,170
I'm not here to threaten you, nor to take revenge, either.

241
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm just grateful to you.

242
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,800
Ahjussi.

243
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,180
I want to buy that drug.

244
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,030
I really don't know anything.

245
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,200
- You don't know? 
 - I really don't know!

246
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,720
- You really don't know? 
 - I don't know!

247
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,110
- You don't know? 
 - I don't!

248
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,520
Geez, seriously!

249
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,170
You're pissing me off!

250
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll tell everyone you're infected and get you kicked out, you crazy nut!

251
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,270
Damn it.

252
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,450
Just wait.

253
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,670
You... You don't know.

254
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,310
Bastard. You don't know?

255
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,200
- You don't know? 
 - I really don't know.

256
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,180
Ahjussi! Wait a minute. I really don't know.

257
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,160
 Please?

258
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,910
 - Ahjussi. 
 - What do you mean you don't know?

259
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,620
 Stop.

260
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,130
 Please stop!

261
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,590
 You're Attorney Gook Hae Sung, right?

262
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,910
- Yes, I am. 
  - I live in unit 102.

263
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,260
 I'm contacting you because I saw your ad in the elevator.

264
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,400
But I heard there are tons of patients in other buildings.

265
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,690
 That's not true! There were a few, but we isolated them in the children's library.

266
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,910
 Your building is being sensitive and barring people from entering.

267
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,050
- So you're saying it's not that serious, right? 
 -  No!

268
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,580
 Can I meet you for a second

269
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,890
 and consult you? It's about my grandfather's grave site.

270
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,040
Where are you right now?

271
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,070
 First floor underground.

272
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,390
 Could we discuss it in person down here?

273
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:03,830
 The internet works down here so it'll be easier to show you the map, too.

274
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,920
Stay there. I'll be right down.

275
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,770
- Weren't you just talking to someone? 
 - What?

276
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,750
I don't know. It came from outside, I think. I'll be right back.

277
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,260
- Where are you going? 
 - I feel so stuffy.

278
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,530
I'm going to take a walk and cool off.

279
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,840

280
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,370

281
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:39,300

282
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,220
 You're Attorney Gook Hae Sung, right?

283
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,360
- What's going on? 
 - Hello.

284
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,310
Hi.

285
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,860
My husband went to meet someone from another building.

286
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,190
I heard earlier that there are lots of Madness Rabies patients out there.

287
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,310
Wait.

288
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,930
Where is he?

289
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,750
I was hoping he wasn't infected.

290
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,200
- Do something... Do something about this crazy bastard! 
 - Why should I?

291
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,340
I think your absence would help this world.

292
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,090

293
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,730
Hello, Sir.

294
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,020
Since we're locked down, I can't go anywhere for a consultation.

295
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,600
Yes, give me a moment.

296
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,140

297
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,950
The internet isn't working.

298
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,560
You have to come out more. Over here.

299
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,080
Here.

300
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,460
How do I open this?

301
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,270
Help me!

302
00:25:54,410 --> 00:26:00,250
Consider yourself lucky. If it weren't for Sae Bom, you would be dead.

303
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,000
Do you see that CCTV?

304
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,730
If you tell people about Kim Seung Beom,

305
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,700
I'll show everyone the video clip of him attacking you.

306
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,980
Then you'll become a Madman Rabies patient, too. Do you understand what I'm saying?

307
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,270
So stay cooped up in your house and just sit quietly.

308
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,860
Why... why... why... why is that a**hole...

309
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,820
Why are you... Why are you hiding that he's infected?

310
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,970
Because he's human.

311
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:39,830
Kim Seung Beom, calm down.

312
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,490
You can go back to being normal.

313
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,720
Ahjussi, the apartment is in lockdown.

314
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,160
Go home and get some sleep.

315
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,730
Ahjumma, what are you doing?

316
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,680
- You scared me! 
 - Stay put.

317
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,770
It would be bad if he could break in.

318
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,220
Ahjussi, I told you this afternoon that you can't go outside.

319
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,230
He was a client, asking about his grandfather's grave site. Didn't you see that he was fine?

320
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,740
I just saved you from going into a grave!

321
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,470
I lost a client because of you. What the hell? Are you trying to make me unlucky?

322
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,240
Oh, my gosh! Honey!

323
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,170
Are you okay?

324
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,180
Did you get hurt?

325
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
Did you tell her?

326
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,750
Why did you do that?

327
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,210
You try to stab me in the back every chance you get.

328
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,480
Should I just throw you over there and get you infected?

329
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,820
- You know something? 
 - What?

330
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,790
I'm...

331
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,230
super...

332
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,140
I'm super lucky, you know.

333
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:57,220
- Eat this, bastard. 
 - Let go! That's disgusting.

334
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,230
There are

335
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,290
people outside, you bastard.

336
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,820
I'm glad you're here!

337
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,930
Your husband is totally nuts!

338
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,280
Did you mess with Hyun?

339
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:17,040
Damn it! What's the matter with you?

340
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,680
Your husband hit my face while I have glasses on. It's attempted murder, no, no...

341
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,810
He tried to kill me! Come over here.

342
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:33,950
This guy tried to kill me using that monster or beast. Really!

343
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,730
What's that over there? What's that?

344
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,730
- Are you okay? 
 - Kim Seung Beom is showing symptoms.

345
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,670
Excuse me!

346
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,020
It's dangerous. Don't go any closer.

347
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,470
Did you know that there's a patient inside the building?

348
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,700
Then you should've told us!

349
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,670
I think the trainer in the basement gym is infected.

350
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,550
I didn't know we had a trainer down there.

351
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:35,410
- How is he? 
 - What? Oh...

352
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,030
He stopped banging his head around 10:45 or 46.

353
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,380
Go on upstairs first, Hyung. I'll go up after I assess the situation.

354
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,420
Be careful.

355
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,010
You're back to normal, right?

356
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,080
You are.

357
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,050
I'm sure people upstairs are discussing kicking you out.

358
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,210
I only took it twice because it was supposed to help if you feel tired.

359
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,600
Why did you go outside?

360
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,600
To look for leftover pills. It helps me focus better when I take it.

361
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,130
While all this is going on, you were thinking about taking pills?

362
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,560
I really only took it twice.

363
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,380
Can you remember the moment symptoms surface?

364
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,820
A little... a little bit.

365
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,490
The ahjussi from the sixth floor said something to me

366
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,690
so I tried to hold back.

367
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,740
- But he kept saying stuff, so— 
 - I suggest you hold yourself back more from now on.

368
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:09,160
The more often you turn,

369
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:15,030
the harder it'll be to get back to yourself.

370
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,840
I told that ahjussi about the drug earlier.

371
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,230
That it's inside the gym car.

372
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,200
I'll take care of that.

373
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,930
Were you happy?

374
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,130
Do you feel happy when you're having an episode?

375
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,920
Does it feel exciting and exhilarating?

376
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,380
I guess he won't be able to hold himself back too long.

377
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,320
It's cold outside, wear something warm.

378
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,330
How is the gym guy doing?

379
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,880
He's back to normal.

380
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,710
He turns for about 15 minutes and then goes back to normal.

381
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,560
We'll be voting tomorrow.

382
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,510
On what?

383
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:26,760
Whether we should kick Kim Seung Beom out or not.

384
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,750
The sixth-floor lawyer said we are a democratic nation so we should vote on the decision.

385
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:37,270
To be honest, I thought I had a bad temper,

386
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,890
but I'm nothing compared to the people here.

387
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,580
Didn't the building representative say anything?

388
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,290
She only cares about being the resident's representative.

389
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,650
She said she'll remove our maintenance fees later if we work with her.

390
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,250
Jung Gook was right.

391
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,870
But...

392
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:03,070
What Oh Joo Hyung said isn't true, right?

393
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,510
What?

394
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,920
That I tried to kill him? That's not true. That bastard...

395
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,370
He threatened Kim Seung Beom first so I scared him a little. That's all.

396
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,890
- Right? 
 - Of course.

397
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,140
It worried me a little.

398
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,870
You know, I'm not good at keeping things to myself.

399
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,370
I'm aware.

400
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,960
Bom.

401
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,410
- There's something called a good cop, bad cop strategy. 
 - Yes?

402
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,680
When one plays the bad cop

403
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,390
and gets angry and scares people,

404
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:33,690
the good cop speaks nicely and persuades them.

405
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,040
Carrot and a whip.

406
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,620
- So? 
 - I'll play the bad cop so you'll have to be the good cop.

407
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,350
- I don't want to. 
 - What?

408
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,200
You've played the bad cop numerous times. It's my turn.

409
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,150
I'll beat up anyone who annoys me.

410
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,400
So just be nice. Okay?

411
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,730
- Be nice. 
 - Hey...

412
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,170
♫  But myself against the world  ♫

413
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,110
It's because I don't want you to get hurt.

414
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,110
Usually, bad cops get hurt.

415
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,450
We have to release him. That's the only way we can survive.

416
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,770
We have to release him. That's the only way we can survive.

417
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,760
Are the rest of the people here okay?

418
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,040
Has anyone gotten bit?

419
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm not sure yet, but as soon as they show symptoms, we need them off the premises.

420
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
Sir.

421
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,130
Could you send this video to me?

422
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,570
Do you agree that we should remove him?

423
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,670
Of course! I saw all the infected people outside!

424
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,770
- Aigoo. 
 - I was watching that. Why did you take it like that?

425
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,480
I ask for your cooperation.

426
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,650
The situation is rather serious, don't you think?

427
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,950
Yes, yes. I got scared because I saw something like this!

428
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,820
Now you understand why I act that way, right?

429
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,330
Is that important right now?

430
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,020
Hey, look at his eyes.

431
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,290
Is Oh Joo Hyung inside?

432
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,380
He seems to keep washing.

433
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,950
If you prefer, we have a spare room

434
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:08,230
so you're welcome to stay with us.

435
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,160
Thank you for caring.

436
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,890
Do you have to go this far?

437
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,070
Of course. Imagine if I opened the door earlier. I would have been

438
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,680
killed by that bastard instantly.

439
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:44,620
He was trying to kill me by talking about the gravesite!

440
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
What if we become affected, too?

441
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,550
Why would we? We didn't do anything bad.

442
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,400
You don't have to do something bad to get infected.

443
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,350
 Anyway, I'm not coming outside until the lockdown is lifted.

444
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,770
It'll only take five minutes. Five minutes is enough to save someone's life.

445
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,580
 Are you sure they're human?

446
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,620
 I'm talking about the Madman Rabies patient.

447
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,200
Of course! If you go down to the gym, you can even talk to him!

448
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,050
By you refusing to leave your house,

449
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,840
a person may lose their life...

450
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,790
Please think about it carefully.

451
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,810
Please think about it carefully.

452
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,600

453
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,240
What are you doing over here?

454
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,340
I was just waiting for you. Where did you go?

455
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,410
To the 15th floor. I asked him to come and vote tomorrow.

456
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:30,470
Have you ever had any regrets in life?

457
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,180
I have.

458
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:44,500
When something happens, and it's over before I could do my best,

459
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,420
it really makes me regret it.

460
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,100
Even after time passes, it stays with me and makes me feel uncomfortable.

461
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,170
So, you don't want to regret anything this time?

462
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,720
Yes.

463
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,390
This time around, I'm not going to avoid it.

464
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,910
Bingo.

465
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,930
Oh?

466
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,580

467
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,470
Let's go!

468
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,700
Mom, let me borrow your phone.

469
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,080
Why?

470
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,270
I'll give it back after recording a video.

471
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,750
I lost mine.

472
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,410
Where did you lose your phone?

473
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,530
Wasn't it a new phone?

474
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,550
Mom, you only use it for calling, right?

475
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,390
Your password. Oh, it's open.

476
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,760
Thank you.

477
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,930
Hey, give it back after you're done recording.

478
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,400
All right!

479
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,310
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

480
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,230
Thank you for making time to come.

481
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,420
 Under Article 22 of the Criminal Code, there's a law about Emergency Evacuation.

482
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,080
I'll read it to you.

483
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,740
"An act to avoid the current danger to one's own or another's legal interests"

484
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,830
"shall not be punished when there is a good reason."

485
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,470
"The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to"

486
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,730
"a person who is responsible for not avoiding danger."

487
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:41,100
To put it simply, for us to survive,

488
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,610
it's okay to throw out the infected.

489
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,490
I'm sure none of you want to catch the disease and go crazy like other building people.

490
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,950
Right?

491
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,750
I'll show you this once.

492
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,350
It's frightening. Look.

493
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,390
My Lord...

494
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,350
Has anyone here caught Covid?

495
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,150
Why are you bringing up Covid all of a sudden?

496
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,780
No one?

497
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,040
I did... catch it...

498
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,650
Then let me ask you.

499
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,140
Sir.

500
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,120
Did you catch Covid because you did something wrong?

501
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,190
What are you talking about?

502
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,300
What did I do wrong? If only those old fogies didn't ask me out to lunch.

503
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,500
Why did I go there?

504
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,830
Exactly.

505
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,200
The disease doesn't select people to infect.

506
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,270
You remember during Covid, right?

507
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,180
When someone caught it, some people revealed their identity and blamed them,

508
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,830
but most people worried about them

509
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,730
and wished for their recovery.

510
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:52,060
That's not something you should get thrown out for without treatment.

511
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,100
 Well, how is this the same as Covid?

512
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,020
It is different.

513
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:06,410
It makes them attack and bite people. I get that everyone is afraid and anxious. I feel the same way.

514
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,560
But what will happen if it happens

515
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,520
to me or my family?

516
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,310
After we throw out trainer Kim Seung Beom, who is next?

517
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,320
Oh Joo Hyung on the sixth floor?

518
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,200
Or the attorney who came in contact with Oh Joo Hyung?

519
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,500
Should we play musical chairs until only one person remains?

520
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,770
That's enough. Let's vote.

521
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,760
Who agrees that we should throw him out?

522
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,800
We don't necessarily have to throw him outside.

523
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,040
I'm just saying let's not have him mingle with the uninfected.

524
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,330
If we lock him up on the rooftop or something and keep us separated, we'll all be safe.

525
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,410
Don't you agree?

526
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,790
Just be yourself and raise your hand comfortably. Why be timid in this day and age?

527
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,790
Hurry and raise your hand.

528
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,030
Go ahead.

529
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,340
Raise your hand. Hurry, hurry.

530
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,160
Ahjumma! How can you do that to me?

531
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,150
You're the one who brought me here!

532
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:23,170
I guess he feels betrayed since I treated him well all this time.

533
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,430
A total of eight people.

534
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:30,650
So Yoon, what are you doing? Raise your hand.

535
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,270
Hey!

536
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,400
Nine.

537
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,770
Those who oppose?

538
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,260
One, two,

539
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,470
three,

540
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,160
four...

541
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:04,970
five, six...

542
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,510
six...

543
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,540
seven,

544
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,980
eight,

545
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,810
nine.

546
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,890
We are tied. What should we do?

547
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:25,970
Do we vote again?

548
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,860
I don't think we need to.

549
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,610
One vote...

550
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,300
to not throw him out.

551
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,020
Ten votes. It's done.

552
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:17,670
I'm glad.

553
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,370
I didn't feel good about throwing out someone from our own building.

554
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,610
You know that we have nothing against you, right, Seung Beom?

555
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,420
All right then. Let's discuss how we'll monitor Kim Seung Beom.

556
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,890
It's too tough for my husband and me to monitor him along with Detectim Kim Jung Gook.

557
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,620
Let's pair up and check up on Kim Seung Beom.

558
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,660
Who wants to go first?

559
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,790
To follow the rule of democracy, shall we vote?

560
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,220
We'll go first.

561
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,840
 Open up!

562
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,510

563
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,280

564
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,690

565
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,400

566
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,880
 Why are you blocking us?

567
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,900
 Why are you doing this?

568
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,200
 What's going on?

569
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,400
I heard you suggested to the prime minister's office

570
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,210
to control access to the areas with lots of infected people.

571
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,170
I told them that we cannot stop the infection once the number of infected starts to increase.

572
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,920
True. We don't have a cure.

573
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:50,960
All we can do is maintain a low temperature and stall time with tranquilizers and sleeping pills.

574
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,930
Chairman, you don't have much time left, either, right?

575
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,820
Maximum a month?

576
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,260
Your wife is the same, right?

577
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,780
She got infected right around the same time as me.

578
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:06,890
I thought that's why you said you would develop a cure within a month.

579
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:15,530
I know very well how rushed you must feel, Chairman.

580
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,940
I'm giving up on all the quarantined areas.

581
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:34,230
You barely supported us all this time.

582
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,160
As you mentioned, we can't have more infected people.

583
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,990
Let's shut off electricity, and don't pass out food.

584
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:48,530
The ACs are on throughout the country. No need to waste energy.

585
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:54,360
Shut off the electricity and wait for the infected to die on their own?

586
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,720
Even with a cure, there will be problems.

587
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,240
We can't go easy on those who have tasted human blood already, just because it happened while they were sick.

588
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,880
But, Sir, you're one of those who are addicted to the taste of blood.

589
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,250
It's okay for me.

590
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,430
I'm telling you this so you know it in advance.

591
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,320
Since you seem to have a plan.

592
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,900
Shouldn't we stop him?

593
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,860
If the electricity is shut off, the water will be shut off, too.

594
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,960
People who are not infected will also end up dying.

595
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,920
Find out when they're going to shut off the electricity.

596
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,770
Hey, why do you think I married you?

597
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:50,320
If you're my secretary, you should act like it and

598
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,930
fall in line without being told to!

599
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,470
But we are married now.

600
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,690
You and I can think differently.

601
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,920
I still don't think I was wrong about it.

602
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,500
So if we catch the disease, would you be accountable?

603
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,550
This is why I shouldn't have married an uneducated person.

604
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:09,060
I think I made a mistake.

605
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,590
- Dong Hyun, my phone. 
 - Geez!

606
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,040
Mom, I can give it back when I'm done recording.

607
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,830
Mom, you strangely keep pestering me today. Is something on your phone?

608
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,350
No such thing.

609
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,440
Then wait a little longer.

610
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,120
I'll go out and see if there's anything else going on. Okay?

611
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,680
Hey, Dong Hyun...

612
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,910
Mom! I'll give it back to you soon. Damn.

613
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,830
I need something intense to get many hits.

614
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,410
What's the old lady doing right now?

615
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,500
Excuse me.

616
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,290
You lost your cell phone, right?

617
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,620
How do you know that?

618
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:18,580
You dropped it on our way in. Right in front of the building.

619
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:21,730
So how did you know that I was looking for it?

620
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,010
You were recording something with it all the way back yesterday. You are still recording.

621
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,360
I thought you might be looking for it.

622
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,940
Wait, wait... Lee Bo Ram?

623
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,610
Will you help me out?

624
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm not going outside.

625
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,630
I'll pay you.

626
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,820
Don't you need money?

627
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,040
Let me know if you need anything.

628
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
How about something like bullets?

629
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,080
Do you think that would be allowed?

630
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,490
Why are you so interested in military supplies?

631
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,360
I'm interested in the end of the world.

632
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,080
The earth is facing a crisis right now.

633
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,550
Even without infectious disease, climate change,

634
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,880
global warming, nuclear war, artificial intelligence... The apocalypse isn't too far off.

635
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,050
I see.

636
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:20,370
So I'm in the middle of collecting all kinds of survival tools.

637
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,000
I'm also collecting combat rations from different countries.

638
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,150
Did you collect a lot of them?

639
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,100
Combat rations?

640
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,000
Would you like to see my collection?

641
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,890
A collection? Shall I then?

642
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,530
Doesn't it break if you apply pressure?

643
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,450
I'm not so sure.

644
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,230
If you destroy that, your life will be destroyed as well.

645
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,950
You have to watch it if you don't want to get kicked out.

646
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,190
Are you here to annoy me?

647
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,910
I wanted to clear the air. I wanted to help you, too,

648
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,040
but you took the drug.

649
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,800
When did you ever help me?

650
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,410
Drink this when you get thirsty.

651
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,550
Only if you can't hold back. I came because I was worried about you.

652
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,120
 - That's the hardest. 
 - Of course.

653
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,900
Let me know if you need anything.

654
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,250
 I think it's a mental illness.

655
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:49,460
 Isn't that crazy?

656
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,950
 What do you mean by mental illness?

657
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,800
 I'm sure he has it.

658
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,420
 I can't believe you're my oppa.

659
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,070
 Hey, think carefully.

660
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:56,990

661
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,290
I told you to be quiet.

662
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,890
I comforted him as Building Representative.

663
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:09,570
I thought the young man would be struggling. All right then.

664
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,230
Wait...

665
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,930
I voted to throw him out earlier.

666
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,650
He would remember, right?

667
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,230
There are plenty of people for him to dislike more so I'm sure it's okay.

668
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,060
You can't get infected through the air so don't worry about that.

669
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:42,930
Watch him, and if he seems to feel extreme thirst,

670
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,830
do not give him water and come up to the fifth floor right away.

671
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,130
- Got it? 
 - Okay. 
 - Okay.

672
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:50,750
And this is the key for his handcuffs.

673
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:58,190
You won't need it, but just in case.

674
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,920
I'll go talk to him for a minute.

675
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,770
Hey, aren't you scared?

676
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,940
It's not even your apartment. Why did you vote yes?

677
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,840
What did you talk about with the building representative?

678
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:26,880
Instead of that, the thing that you're curious about is...

679
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,730
There are lots of things I'm curious about.

680
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,920
The drug buyer.

681
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,130
You know, the man in the hazmat suit?

682
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:40,340
The one who voted last.

683
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,720
 - You know how muscles form when you work out? 
 - Yes.

684
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,710
 If you take one pill, it's twice as effective as working out.

685
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,700
 If you look, it's in a small pill form.

686
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,670
The fifteenth floor.

687
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:05,690
It was right there. I can't see it from here.

688
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:06,810
Go quickly and come back.

689
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,650
I'll watch from here.

690
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,680
Let's move these.

691
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:26,100

(T/N: 119 is the emergency telephone number, similar to 911)

692
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,130
Student.

693
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,750
Are you looking for something?

694
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,130
Do you want me to help you?

695
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,320
Sae Bom! Kim Seung Beom says...

696
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,090
Seo Yoon, where is Sae Bom?

697
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,420
She went up with the ahjussi from the 15th floor.

698
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:45,790

699
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:46,980
So pretty.

700
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,330
Hyun Kyung, this is Jae Yeol. He's a great pianist.

701
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:54,660
When you write a novel about music next time,

702
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,720
you can get advice from Jae Yeol...

703
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:04,180
Or just lent me some money.

704
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,610
Aren't you even worried about your wife and children?

705
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,670
Talk about that kind of stuff after the lockdown is lifted.

706
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,700
I'm sure they're fine! Do you think something happened to them?

707
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,710
I'm working right now.

708
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,050
Hey, to put it bluntly, if you die here,

709
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,870
your apartment becomes mine.

710
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,870
But if I followed you in here to help you out, you should...

711
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,320
It sounds like you want to kill me.

712
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,770
But then again, you were the same back then, too.

713
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,510
You pushed me off the swing, and I got hurt!

714
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,500
I can't pull my hair back because of this!

715
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,790
Then, then, were you ever good to me?

716
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,450
You gave me hepatitis in my senior year,

717
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:36,880
and I delayed a year going to college!

718
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,140
Blame it on your weak immunity!

719
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,710
Do you know how it feels to speak formally to people who are the same age as me?

720
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,080
Let's talk outside.

721
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,940
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

722
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,470
I'm not wishing you bad or anything.

723
00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,540
It's not like that.

724
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,960
It's because I'm disappointed.

725
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,700
Why are you so disappointed? Well?

726
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,070
You received an inheritance when you got married, and they sent you to college.

727
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,990
I received tuition for one semester.

728
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:14,580
I paid for the rest myself.

729
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,970
Still, I held it in and didn't say anything.

730
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,160
And now you act like you left your money with me!

731
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,870
I'm sorry.

732
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,420
Let's not speak too crudely.

733
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,150
We are still family.

734
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,750
Family, my foot.

735
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:50,670
It's safe here. Right?

736
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,630
Where are you going?

737
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,980
What? I hear some noise.

738
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:59,040
Hey, it's okay. It's safe here.

739
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,270
Hey! Come here!

740
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,460
What's with you two?

741
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,140
Hey! Hey!

742
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,300
Run away!

743
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,850
I don't think anyone is there.

744
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,120
Hey, don't open it.

745
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,670
You always say "hey" to me. I'm your oppa.

746
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,190
Did you get scared?

747
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:13,400
Hey, don't worry. Your oppa is here.

748
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,060
Is something going on out there?

749
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,210
No...

750
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:15,090
Sae Bom! Yoon Sae Bom!

751
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,650
Sae Bom is here, right?

752
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:26,220
She's busy right now.

753
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,100
She'll be right out. Wait just a moment.

754
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:36,220
Did you take the drug? The one you bought at the gym?

755
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:47,440
If you laid even a finger on Sae Bom, you're dead.

756
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:56,070

757
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:10,490

758
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:14,700
 A person is missing because of you.

759
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,200
 We have the power, but we need a person.

760
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,080
 Someone who will do what we tell him to.

761
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,040
 It's not as if my thirst is quenched when I drink water.

762
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,110
 It's Na Soo Min's phone.

763
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,790
 The electricity in your building will be shut off tonight.

764
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:30,810
 Hyung, you guard here.

765
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,400
 I'm here to take Sae Bom.

766
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,580
 I came here to find even a small possibility.

767
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,860
 Even if we have to get her bit by an infected, if necessary.
