1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,080

2
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,450

3
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:55,450

4
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,900
What is this? Is this the military?

5
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,240
Hey, why did we come here?

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,750
Sae Bom is here.

7
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,520
Then you should have let me off earlier! I have to hand out rice cakes.

8
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,270
Should we practice?

9
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,360
I will take that one.

10
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,580

11
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,260

12
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,130

13
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,560
Hurry!

14
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,450
No, don't open it!

15
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,180

16
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,950
Check that the other cars are locked.

17
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,760
- I have to get Seung Young out. 
 - What?

18
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,440
He was fine just a minute ago.

19
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,930

20
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,400
Seung Young!

21
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Are you okay?

22
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,540
Hyun, how did you get here?

23
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,230
I'm glad I wasn't late.

24
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,320

25
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,850
Open your mouth.

26
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm sorry. I don't know why I did it.

27
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,170
It was unfair to die like this so I guess I wanted to do something.

28
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,400
Did something happen inside?

29
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,400
I went inside. And those people were...

30
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,490
all completely crazy.

31
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,790
- I saw. 
 - Sae Bom,

32
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,720
what if I become like that?

33
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,040
My wife and my children.

34
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,330
I'm disappointed in you, Lieutenant.

35
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,600
Yoon Sae Bom.

36
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,990
Five people have already been infected while trying to care for that person.

37
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,390
What are we supposed to do?

38
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,860
How did you know the flare would be effective?

39
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,750
Otherwise, there's no reason for the soldiers to carry it around.

40
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,630
It's not as if they're repressing massive terror, and there are already multiple people infected.

41
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,490
I found out when a few of the infected tried to escape the facility.

42
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,930
So you just lock them up here and wait for them to die?

43
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,000
What else should we do? They have no rationality, and the normal ones keep looking for fresh blood.

44
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,900
Should we give them a live offering?

45
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,250
They're still living people, though. We have to endure it.

46
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,430
This is enduring it.

47
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,460
We protect those with mild cases and isolate the severe ones.

48
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,760
Listen here, Han Tae Seok. What if your family became like that?

49
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,680
Be honest. You see them as monsters.

50
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,240
You'll shoot at them without a second thought if they come at you.

51
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,230
Do you know what we learned through COVID-19?

52
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,630
What? That we should wash our hands well?

53
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,190
Eating and living are more important than a few people tearing each other apart.

54
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,930
I'm enduring with all my strength to protect my family.

55
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,370
How much longer will you work in the shadows like this?

56
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,730
You have to announce it to the public and discuss what will happen to the infected.

57
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,970
I will. The news media are already catching on.

58
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,830
Hurry, or I'll break the news.

59
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,180
Let's not see each other again, if we can help it.

60
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,110
Oh, one more thing.

61
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,470
These people are also enduring with all their strength.

62
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,900

63
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,230

64
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,860
Finally, I can breathe now.

65
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,700
I had an installment saving plan in dollars, and I even planned a trip. What a waste.

66
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,800
Give me your hand.

67
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,070
It has almost healed, though.

68
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,890
This will sting.

69
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,590
Is it fine for me to be okay by myself?

70
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,130
Hey, it's a relief you're okay, at least.

71
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,000
There'll be treatments and vaccines soon.

72
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,530
This thing will pass safely eventually

73
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,890
so don't worry.

74
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,900
Can those people recover, too?

75
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,060
I hope so.

76
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,550
Oh, hello.

77
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,500
Did you look into the T-shirts? Large size?

78
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,630
I was preoccupied today. I'll bring it next time.

79
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,210
Unni! Mom, it's the special forces Unni across from us.

80
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:46,470
Oh, hello. I heard you took good care of Seo Yoon. Thank you.

81
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,820
That place earlier was nice, right?

82
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,990
Husband? He's handsome.

83
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,180

84
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,570
Found it.

85
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,480
Okay.

86
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,460
Are you okay?

87
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,290
Nothing. It's just weird to return to our everyday lives so easily.

88
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,960
Should we just do it another time?

89
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,120
No, we are trying to hold onto our normal life.

90
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,760
I can do it.

91
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,420
But do you think she'll believe we are getting married?

92
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,280
Of course, she'll think we love each other to death so don't worry.

93
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,080
For now, chamomile. It'll warm you up.

94
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,850
- Do I look okay? 
 - Yes.

95
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,300
Look at me properly first.

96
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,270
All right. Let's see.

97
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,930
You look fine. You look pretty.

98
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,690
But who would think we are getting married

99
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,180
because of the apartment? Of course, she'll think it is because we love each other to death. You're soâ€”

100
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,090
 Sae Bom!

101
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,570
Hello, Mother.

102
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,780
 From the moment I first saw you two, I knew it would work out well.

103
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,620
When I saw you two sitting together in the ambulance at the school, you looked so good together.

104
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,050
Oh, that photo is from back then!

105
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,830
 We are trying not to forget our initial resolution.

106
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,740
Sae Bom, I have something I wanted to say to you.

107
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes, please go ahead.

108
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,120
 Son, can you go elsewhere for a minute? I have something to say to Sae Bom.

109
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,890
Just tell me later, and I'll tell her for you.

110
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,320
 Oh? Do you have noise issues with the neighbor?

111
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,590
 That can be a headache.

112
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,350
Go tell them to be quiet.

113
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,730
Go ahead, Mother.

114
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,260
 Sae Bom, thank you so much.

115
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,370
 Thanks to you, Hyun seems to be living a normal life.

116
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,600
Mother, Hyun does quite well without me.

117
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,920
 He's a good boy, but sometimes he just can't control his rage.

118
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,170
 After he couldn't play baseball anymore, he started hanging out with bad guys.

119
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,030
 I had prepared to send him to study in America, but he said he couldn't speak English so he wouldn't do it.

120
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,430
I think detective work suits him. Catching bad guys and all that.

121
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,920
- It's late at night. I was wondering what was going on. 
 - I'm sorry.

122
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,750
I'm not here to hear an apology. I'm really worried. It's nothing serious, right?

123
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,830
I, well...

124
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Hello. I live below, and it is a bit noisy.

125
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,450
I apologize.

126
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,550
Wait...

127
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,520
I couldn't tell you yesterday, but my wife is ill.

128
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,620
She keeps throwing things and screaming.

129
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,390
So this is...?

130
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,030
She's from my wife's dermatology clinic...

131
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:28,050
She's the chief dermatologist there. She's here to help since she's worried.

132
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,890
She took sleeping pills and laid down so she'll be all right.

133
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,890
Does she bite or try to scratch you at all?

134
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,760
It's not like that. She's just sensitive.

135
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,670
It won't happen again. My apologies.

136
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,530
What is it?

137
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:02,260
What is the name of the dermatology clinic?

138
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,100
I think we should have a wedding. Who could officiate it?

139
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,160
Hyung Jung Gook?

140
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,190
That sounds reasonable, but does he speak well in public?

141
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,810
No.

142
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,630
We can just go out by ourselves and speak for ourselves. Saying we will live happily together.

143
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,860
That sounds good, too.

144
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,690
Seung Young is good at singing. I hope he can recover before then.

145
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,050
Should we go on a honeymoon too? Where should we go?

146
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,860
Somewhere you always wanted to go to?

147
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,100
What if I said I wanted to tour buffets?

148
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,820
I can't leave one place until I have ten plates.

149
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,600
Excuse me, I used to be a baseball player.

150
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,170
I eat a scary amount.

151
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,030
Thinking about eating makes me hungry. Quick, let's sleep.

152
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,860
All right. Good night.

153
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,590
You, too.

154
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:58,460
 The number of patients suffering from the disease that makes them bite others and drink blood is increasing,

155
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,510
 but the government still insists that they are not clear on the classification of the illness.

156
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:05,040
 - They are cautious to make announcements.  
 - Honey.

157
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,270
Honey!

158
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,590
We don't have that kind of money!

159
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,260
So are we just going to live like this? What if she collapses?

160
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,930
Why do you say such negative things?

161
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,570
Nothing happened so far. We just have to continue taking good care of her.

162
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,320
We're already being discriminated against for living on lease. What if it gets out she's sick?

163
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,230
I'll go visit Unni from across the hall.

164
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,870
We can just say that it's a study abroad and leave without anyone knowing.

165
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:31,080
No one will find out. Honey.

166
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,690
 Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?

167
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,550
Unni, it's me, Seo Yoon.

168
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,100
Hi! I have some leftover rice cakes. Do you want some?

169
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,270
Can I?

170
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,070
Even love has its moments of crisis.

171
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,430
It looks like it was a pretty severe crisis.

172
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,810
Where is Ahjussi?

173
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,190
He's working. He said he had orders from above.

174
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,140

175
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,260
 - Hello?  
 - Hello.

176
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,630
Is the head dermatologist, Park Min Ji, there?

177
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,630
 Oh, yes. She's on leave for a week. We can only take reservations from next week.

178
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,030
Then is the chief dermatologist also on leave?

179
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,040
 The chief dermatologist? Which one do you mean?

180
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,630
She had hair that came to her waist, and she had double eyelids.

181
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,030
 Oh, Woo Sang Hee. She's on a monthly leave.

182
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,060
 Oh, she's right there. One second.

183
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,300
What's this? Are you looking to get your skin taken care of?

184
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,690
I'm just bothered by the neighbor upstairs.

185
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,570
Oh, noisy neighbors.

186
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,150
That will really drive you crazy.

187
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,400
Hey. By the way, we are to halt the investigation on the car wash center.

188
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,190
Chief said another team was taking care of it so we should stay out of it.

189
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,130
Han Tae Seok?

190
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,330
Is it really okay? Isn't it a dangerous disease?

191
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,910

192
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,140
Hey, Mom. What is it?

193
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,490
 Are you okay?

194
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,660
I heard you got tested for the Madman Rabies.

195
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,690
They said it's okay. It's nothing.

196
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,380
I still need to self-isolate for a while.

197
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,980
Turn on the television right now. It's a mess.

198
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,610
 Is anyone there?

199
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,030
 They're not human.

200
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,240
 Their hands...

201
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,050
 The video you just watched was obtained exclusively by us.

202
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,820
 Let me say this again.

203
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,470
 Our network obtained the footage exclusively.

204
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,480
 An anonymous tipper snuck into a secret government facility

205
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,260
 and sent this to us after filming on his phone.

206
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,320
- Are you watching the news? 
  - They never even acknowledged this existence,

207
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,960
 and this disease has only been a rumor thus far.

208
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,410
 They bite people

209
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,250
 and drink their blood.

210
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,820
 Madman Rabies does exist.

211
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,450
 Perhaps the government is keeping this secret...

212
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,750
I'll call you back.

213
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,300
 This is the only exsting proof so far.

214
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,460
 The informant of this video could not be contacted after the release of this video.

215
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,320
 Our reporters are working to find out what happened to the informant.

216
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,330
 They are doing their best.

217
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,540
What is this?

218
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,160
The stores just opened up, but it looks like we are being banned from gathering again.

219
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,620
I want to bite everyone.

220
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,810
- Send me to the hospital. 
 - You just said it was COVID-19.

221
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,190
It's Madman Rabies!

222
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,310
Don't say something so dangerous.

223
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,990
Go easy on him.

224
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,790
Are you okay?

225
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,790
Where are you going?

226
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,380
Where are you going? You have to get tested.

227
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,860
The hospital.

228
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,940
You'll lose your place in the line.

229
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,990
Are you going camping?

230
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,160
We just got the emergency alert text, but there aren't a lot of people.

231
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,910
The emergency alert text comes every day. How can we react to it all the time?

232
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,390
Not unless some people die and the number of infected rises to the thousands.

233
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,810
Would you like these delivered?

234
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,940
- Just the water and rice,  please. 
 - Okay.

235
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,820

236
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,460
This is me. What is this about?

237
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,590
I'm the apartment representative. Suite 1202.

238
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,350
I blurred your face for your privacy.

239
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,210
I ask that you be more careful from now on.

240
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,030
What if you block the door and there is a fire?

241
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:38,360
The name of that door is "firewall." It is to prevent fires.

242
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
It keeps the fire from spreading,

243
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,830
but what would happen if it was kept open?

244
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,330
The fire would spread, wouldn't it?

245
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,930
It should be closed, but not blocked.

246
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,400
If it's blocked, no one could even escape.

247
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,610
It was the decision of the building's firefighting administrator.

248
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,600
Excuse me, Firefighting Administrator would mean an outsourcing agency.

249
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,450
Is that the official statement from them?

250
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,490
Who are you?

251
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,470
I live in suite 401.

252
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,860
On lease...

253
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,500
Do you know the doctor from suite 601?

254
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,780
She's suffering from people who constantly knock on her door.

255
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,930
According to her husband, she canceled the appointments at her clinic,

256
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,650
and she's sick in bed.

257
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,630
Is that what they said?

258
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,440
After making all that noise that night?

259
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,820
Ms., noises from neighbors have no set direction.

260
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,080
We can't tell which direction the noise comes from.

261
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,710
Don't fight. Come to church.

262
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,460
God knows all.

263
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,340
The madame in suite 601 must be suffering a lot these days.

264
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,450
She could be at ease if she leaned on Him in difficult times.

265
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:51,330
She has a husband so she'll be fine.

266
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:56,150
I brought up the emergency exit door opening so I'll let it go.

267
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,710
I'm so grateful.

268
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,890

269
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,260
- You have a lot of stuff. 
 - Oh, thank you.

270
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,440
Hello.

271
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,810
Is the head dermatologist still unwell?

272
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,100
Yes, she's resting for a while and asked me to bring her stuff to her.

273
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,630
She must be quitting. You have all her personal belongings.

274
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,070
What are you doing?

275
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,910
Police.

276
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,340
From now on, think about what you say before you answer me.

277
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,660
What is going on in that apartment?

278
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,240
Is your wife really all right?

279
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,040
Yes, I'll take her to the hospital today so could you just bear with us?

280
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,100
What is this?

281
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,040
Were you bitten?

282
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,390
Did your wife bite you?

283
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,920
Madame!

284
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,220
What are you doing? Why are you barging into someone else's home?

285
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,310
This is breaking and entering! It's illegal!

286
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,490
Then report me.

287
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,230
I'm from the suite below. Are you all right?

288
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,990
Don't do that. Don't.

289
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,230
How long has your wife been like this?

290
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,370
Since yesterday. She attacks when she sees people.

291
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:19,020
I've been meaning to contact a friend I know in a psychiatry clinic.

292
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,190
I've been considering it.

293
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,740
What about her eyes?

294
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,250
Her pupils were white.

295
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,990
She won't be in a continuous outbreak status

296
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,480
so judging by the silence, there's a high chance she's like herself now.

297
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,180
Madame.

298
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,910
Madame.

299
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,240
It's all right.

300
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,390
You can get better.

301
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,420
Your husband is worried about you.

302
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,660
Come out for a secondâ€”

303
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,530
Sir!

304
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,960
Madame.

305
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,240
Madame.

306
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,580
Calm down.

307
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,110
Madame.

308
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,460
 911?

309
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,260
 I think my wife...

310
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:27,210
 has the Madman Rabies. I think the lady from downstairs is in danger.

311
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,050
Do you want to go out?

312
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:36,670
I will open the door for you.

313
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,060
 No, unit 102.

314
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,710
 Geez, how frustrating! It's unit 102, not 101.

315
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
 Please, hurry over.

316
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,100
 Please, hurry. It's an emergency!

317
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,820
 Please hurry over! A person could die right now!

318
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,160
Please hurry over! Please!

319
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,610
Geez, this is urgent!

320
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,530
Hurry...

321
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,700
Min Ji.

322
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,500
Min Ji! Geez!

323
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,960
 - Hi, Sae Bom.  
 - What?

324
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,200
Don't go upstairs. Stay put even if you hear any noise.

325
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,870
I'm already up here.

326
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,790
I'm fine, but that couple...

327
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,470
Ahjussi! No one is home...

328
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,790
Ahjussi!

329
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,710
Seo Yoon, run! Hurry!

330
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,510
Help me!

331
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,560
Are you okay?

332
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,960
I think so.

333
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:22,020
That ahjumma... What's wrong with her?

334
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,650
It's because she's full of rage. It's okay.

335
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,740
And the ahjussi from that house is over there.

336
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:51,510
You live downstairs, right? Is everyone okay?

337
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,840
Are you okay, Ahjussi?

338
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,870
You should be relieved that it was me.

339
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,940
If it were Sae Bom, you would be dead.

340
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,220
Breathe, breathe. Over here.

341
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,540
He must be in shock since his wife is injured.

342
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,780
You have to see her in person.

343
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,190
We need weapons.

344
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:04,390
No, no. Not a tear gas gun. Something more lethal.

345
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,200
Are you just leaving?

346
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,490
Aren't you going to do more?

347
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,510
We'll disinfect the area in addition.

348
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,380
Please don't leave your house and follow the orders from the authorities.

349
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,080
Mom, let's go. Hurry.

350
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,800

351
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,910

352
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,900

353
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,960
Honey.

354
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,530
Honey?

355
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,780
Honey, today...

356
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,390
Where have you been? You didn't even feed me!

357
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,570
Gosh...

358
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,950
- Everyone! 
 - Dong Hyun.

359
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,490
I'm telling you that the long-term salary means the powerful ones have gotten involved.

360
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,260
Just because of Madman Rabies talk, you can't put all your eggs in one basket on the bio-related stocks.

361
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,810
Dong Hyun, on the sixth floor today...

362
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,880
Mom, can't you see that I'm doing my show right now? Later.

363
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,080
- Hey. 
 - My mom isn't too quick.

364
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,580
I will speak about Madman Rabies.

365
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,250
The authorities have confirmed that Madman Rabies

366
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,530
that causes the people to bite others were present in nursing homes and homeless shelters.

367
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,110
While analyzing the patients in detail,

368
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,370
they have come to a conclusion that

369
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,640
Madman Rabies exists.

370
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,200
The result of the analysis shows that it's a variant virus.

371
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,880
When the disease develops, the infected attacks people,

372
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,780
 and they will try to bite at the neck. Before the symptoms surface,

373
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,890
 they complain of extreme thirst.

374
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:35,920
 If you show any symptoms or find any infected people,

375
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,050
 please contact the Central Disaster Countermeasures Headquarters.

376
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,810
Wow, he's made it. He's on TV now.

377
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,280
He's not talking about isolating the infected.

378
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,070
Since Madman Rabies is shocking in itself.

379
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,870
For now, they'll talk about how you can get infected, when the treatments will be out...

380
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,830
They'll talk about stuff like that first.

381
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,300
Hey, more than that, don't go into someone else's house alone. Tell me first.

382
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,810
I was going to.

383
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:11,490
I was going to call 119 after making sure she had the Madman Rabies.

384
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,920
But the upstairs Ahjumma...

385
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,110
She kept chasing after her husband.

386
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,240
There's definitely something there.

387
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,530
Pushing me inside wasn't a mistake. Never.

388
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,040
I'll look into it and arrest him if I find anything.

389
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,670
Okay. I feel so secure to have a detective friend.

390
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,360
Of course.

391
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,380
Shall we go for a walk?

392
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,160
We've never gone outside together since we moved in.

393
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,430
Are you going out?

394
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,030
Yes. Is something wrong?

395
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,480
I wanted to ask you to keep quiet about what happened today.

396
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,290
Don't post about it anywhere, and don't spread any rumors.

397
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,080
But so many people saw what happened. How could we...

398
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,380
They all live in our apartment building.

399
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,530
It's difficult for outsiders to come in here.

400
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,510
We just have to keep quiet, unite and not make a big deal out of it.

401
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:22,840
Will it then really not become a big deal?

402
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:27,320
Bad rumors are bad for real estate prices.

403
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,280
Are you worried about real estate prices amid all this?

404
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,980
You'll live here for at least ten years anyway.

405
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,290
Wouldn't it benefit both of you

406
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,310
to say you live in a high-priced apartment?

407
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,170
The apartment representation Ahjumma is right.

408
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:00,830
It's crazy out there, yet it's so peaceful here.

409
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:05,460
Living here, the real estate price and happiness...

410
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,630
I think she would want to revel in it.

411
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,940
Even if she has to hide facts about the infected, if necessary.

412
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,480
You totally screwed me over this afternoon.

413
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,980
Did they send you home?

414
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,800
They said my tests came out so clean that I should just quarantine at home.

415
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,720
So even if it gets noisy at night, be understanding.

416
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,970
You'll get to isolate yourself in jail soon. Don't worry.

417
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,670
Jail?

418
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,280
After my quarantine is over, I'll just...

419
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,750
I'll report you first!

420
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,390
You messed with the wrong person!

421
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,320
When it comes to reporting and suing people, I'm an expert at it. I'm the best.

422
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,270
This was found in the infected person's house.

423
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,910
It looks like you took care of the dealers at the car wash.

424
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,870
Taking that drug gives you Madman Rabies, right?

425
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,150
I'm sure you didn't come all the way here to ask me that, did you?

426
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,320
Park Min Ji is here, right?

427
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,260
I would like to meet her right now.

428
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,660
Watch out.

429
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,440
Park Min Ji.

430
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,380
Shouldn't she be back to being herself?

431
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,340
She should be dead by now.

432
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,870
The disease surfaced right before she was about to die. She's alive now because of the virus.

433
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,630
So if she's back to herself...

434
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,050
She'll probably die.

435
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,240
She's all messed up in her head.

436
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,970
She must know it herself. She's been like that all this time.

437
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,680
It could be because she feels injustice.

438
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,020
Perhaps she wants to tell who killed her.

439
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,640
Park Min Ji.

440
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,290
Don't worry.

441
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:21,460
I will definitely catch whoever did this to you.

442
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,350
It's late, isn't it?

443
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:15,780
I had a lot to take care of.

444
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,690
Where is this?

445
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,060
According to your description, it is where we lock up guard dogs.

446
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,490
Your friends are behind you. Be careful so you don't wake them up.

447
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,350
An ordinary woman living in an ordinary apartment

448
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:38,480
developed the disease, and we found this at her house.

449
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,660
Seyang Forest, Le Ciel.

450
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,270
You sold it to her, right?

451
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,920
If I tell you, will you let me go?

452
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,010
Why do you think you're in here?

453
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:09,090
If... If you promise to save me, I'll tell you everything.

454
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,870
If there's something you desperately want, you won't give in to your thirst.

455
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:23,320
So think about...

456
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:28,670
what you really want.

457
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,820
Aren't you going to make dinner?

458
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,360
How much longer will you be lying down?

459
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,230
Maybe I was in shock yesterday. I'm feeling weak.

460
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,050
Aigoo, look at you. What a weakling you are.

461
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,600
I'll eat dinner out!

462
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,590
Honey, I want to eat a hamburger.

463
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,680
You should eat rice! Is bread the same thing? Aigoo...

464
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,680
Hello?

465
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,190
Park Min Ji just passed away.

466
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:19,840
 In the end, she didn't attack people.

467
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,150
 She was just spaced out.

468
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,470
Thanks for letting me know.

469
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,980
Here is the report from the NFS.

470
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:43,860
Let's go.

471
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,030
Right now? Will that be okay?

472
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,650
That's not a sure deal yet.

473
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,080
Let's go. We have to help out someone.

474
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,790
Hey! Be careful!

475
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,280
Hey, if you don't arrest him with that, it'll be a problem.

476
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,910
Police, excuse me.

477
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,790
Why are you barging in here?

478
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:06,800
How could both of you and your wife be so rude?

479
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,110
Park Min Ji passed away.

480
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,770
She...

481
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,750
All she did was struggle.

482
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,300
What, what?

483
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,350
You already cleaned up everything in that time.

484
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,320
I don't like the smell of the blood, and I was worried that the germs would be left behind so I cleaned up.

485
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,150
Why?

486
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,610
So did you clean up your golf clubs too?

487
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,250
Your wife's head was pretty much crushed.

488
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,310
The area you beat her with a golf club.

489
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:15,930
It was self-defense. She was trying to bite me. What else could I do?

490
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,090
If only it wasn't Madman Rabies, things would have turned out the way you wanted, right?

491
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:25,010
- What? 
 - She should've died when you hit her with your golf club.

492
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:28,620
But Park Min Ji suddenly developed the disease and didn't die.

493
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,550
If it weren't for that, you could've disposed of the body

494
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,820
and could've committed a perfect crime.

495
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,500
Perfect crime? What the hell are you talking about?

496
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,050
This is the NFS report on the blood found on that golf club.

497
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:46,550
A strong impact from an adult male's strike with all his strength.

498
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,610
Fragments of the laryngeal bone and cerebral tissues were discovered.

499
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,820
It looks as though the perpetrator struck the weapon intending to murder her.

500
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,480
I told you.

501
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,910
I got scared. Her eyes turned white, and she attacked me trying to bite me.

502
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,970
If it were you, would you die

503
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:00,870
by being bitten by your wife?

504
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,770
Do you love your wife that much?

505
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,630
So I looked into your trial records.

506
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,420
You had quite a record.

507
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,510
Illegal medical procedures, revocation of your license, and even declaring bankruptcy.

508
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,670
You handed over that dermatology clinic to your wife.

509
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,100
You must've thought you could get back on your feet if your wife weren't around.

510
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,720
So? So what? What? What? What about it?

511
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,630
Numerous people saw my wife walking around perfectly fine.

512
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:31,400
How will you prove that...

513
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,230
How will you prove that I killed my wife?

514
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,430
I have a witness.

515
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,650
Sang Hee.

516
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,880
Oh Joo Hyung, you're under arrest for the suspicion of killing your wife Park Min Ji.

517
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,910
 Honey.

518
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,870
We'll stop everyone as planned.

519
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:53,490
- Sir. 
 - More people will get hurt if we delay it.

520
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,300
Well...

521
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,510
Geez...

522
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,310
I decided to get the surgery.

523
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,020
Did you decide?

524
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,980
My mom is extremely worried, but it's also worrisome if the disease is spread in the apartment.

525
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,270
My wounds don't heal well.

526
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:00,150
I take antibiotics too.

527
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:04,470
I asked to leave quietly while all this was going on and get the surgery.

528
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:05,930
When do you leave?

529
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,810
I will go for an exam when my mom comes home later.

530
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,350
It's that ahjussi who was on TV.

531
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,510
Is he your friend, Unni?

532
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,000
No. I just know him.

533
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,520
What brings you here?

534
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,000
Madman Rabies is spreading throughout the apartment building.

535
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,350
One person already caught it.

536
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,450
Are there more infected people?

537
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:42,140
I questioned a drug dealer, and he says he sold the drug at the underground gym.

538
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,130
He sold them saying it helps you focus and for dieting.

539
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:51,090
Park Min Ji from the sixth floor was one of the buyers.

540
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,060
 - Hello, Ma'am. 
 - Hello.

541
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,410
 Hello.

542
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,170
 Aigoo, Ma'am. You're here.

543
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,950
 - How have you been? 
 - Good.

544
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,610
 - Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

545
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,080
 Thank you. Enjoy your workout.

546
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,150

547
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,330
There must be quite a few people like Park Min Ji inside the apartment.

548
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:38,490
I'm sure some people are living quietly, hiding the signs of their illness.

549
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,370
The numbers of infected will increase quietly like that and explode all at once.

550
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:47,560
What are you doing here then? You should start the investigation.

551
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,470
Will that solve the issue? When we don't have any treatment or vaccine?

552
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,520
We don't know when the apartment residents will start having symptoms. Where should we keep them and monitor them?

553
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,860
It's not like we can slaughter all of them like the swine flu.

554
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,390
What will you do then?

555
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,710
Do you have another way?

556
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,350
I do have another way.

557
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,740

558
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,830
 What is happening?

559
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,540
 Why are you trapping us in?

560
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,470
 What is this for?

561
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,240
 Come on!

562
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,160
As luck would have it, only residents are allowed to use the gym.

563
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,220
And half of the residents are families,

564
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,610
and the daycare inside the apartment hasn't opened yet.

565
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,350
Will you block off the entire apartment building?

566
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:42,310
Until we obtain the workforce and location to monitor all the infected.

567
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:47,730
You should notify the apartment's residents so people can mentally prepare.

568
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:53,260
They won't mentally prepare but run away and spread the disease.

569
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,190
You can get out, Yoon Sae Bom.

570
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:01,040
When it comes to work of this nature, we are always in need of decisive people.

571
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,680
It's my fault.

572
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:18,440
When I found out what you were doing at the dorm, I should've released everything to the newspapers, news, everywhere.

573
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,330
That wouldn't have changed anything.

574
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:25,050
You have to prioritize things when it comes to dealing with these situations.

575
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:30,230
Who is a more essential person and what is more needed...

576
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,050
I guess I'm an essential person.

577
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:47,410
However, I decided to live here, and this is my home.

578
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:50,450
Whether it's noise problems or Madman Rabies,

579
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:55,260
running away isn't my style.

580
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,300
Good day.

581
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,640
Hey, I'm in front of your house.

582
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,820
Hey, I came all the way here. How can I go back?

583
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,550
Yes.

584
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,300
What the heck?

585
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:37,230
This is my apartment building. Is something wrong?

586
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:38,840
If you go inside now, you can't get out again.

587
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,950
What? What is he talking about?

588
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,970
Yes. What floor are you on?

589
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,940
I'm coming in right now.

590
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,950
Hyun, I'm trapped inside.

591
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,550
Don't get into a fight trying to come in.

592
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,760
If my mom calls you, tell her I'm okay.

593
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,910
 What are you talking about? Where are you trapped?

594
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:23,560
I'll protect the apartment.

595
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,470
Wait, Bom, tell me exactly what's going on. What's...

596
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:35,440
I mean, I was going to tell you when I knew for sure...

597
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,440
I thought I was in here alone.

598
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:58,980
Sae Bom, I have to catch him right now.

599
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,680
It's okay. No one can get out.

600
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:41,880

601
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,860

602
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,620
 ~ Preview ~ 
 Let me leave.

603
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,870
 You two could likely be infectious.

604
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,090
 You don't know how things have changed on the outside.

605
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:07,710
 Did you take that drug, too?

606
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:09,470
 You know who took them, right?

607
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,960
 No one knows how drastically people would change when push comes to shove.

608
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,410
 What are you doing right now?

609
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:18,350
 They say we can't leave now. Other apartment buildings voted and decided that.

610
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,510
 Yoon Sae Bom, are you safe?

611
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,730
 It's blood.

612
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,220
 Hurry and come out if you don't want to die!

613
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,220
 Help me, please!

614
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:28,680
 It will be all over in seventy-two hours.
