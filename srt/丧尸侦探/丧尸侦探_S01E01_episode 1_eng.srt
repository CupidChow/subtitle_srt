1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,600

2
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,820
Don't come.

3
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't come!

4
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,650
 According to the Middle Age folklore,

5
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,120
 on the night of full moon, a human transforms to a werewolf and eats domesticated animals or humans.

6
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,380
 The screaming sound of wolves is called "howling."

7
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,390
 It is an act to let his pack know he's been separated from  his whereabouts.

8
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,880
 The howling of a human transformed to a werewolf is

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,970
 perhaps his longing to return to the past?

10
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,300

11
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,620
 On this night of the full moon,

12
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,280
 who is the person you miss the most?

13
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,970
 This is In Aegyeong's "The Face I Miss."

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,960
♫  Many nights have passed  ♫

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,500
♫  But I still long for you  ♫

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,480
♫  Even though I shed tears of sorrow  ♫

17
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,210
♫  You're still the face I miss  ♫

18
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,460
 Two employees of an animal hospital responsible for illegal disposal of nearly 100 tons of medical waste

19
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,160
 at a hillside in Gangrim City, Chowol-dong, have been arrested.

20
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,960
 I am now at the hillside where the medical waste has been illegally disposed of.

21
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,660
 Among the medical waste, there is even an IV used 4 years ago.

22
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,450
 There is a concern for serious secondary infection.

23
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,650
  They committed this crime in order to save costs,

24
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,690
 and the police are pursuing Mr. No, the director of the hospital, who ordered the illegal disposal.

25
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,980
 This is HBS Reporter Park Daegi.

26
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,060
 The so-called "Santa" kidnapping and murder case investigation has been ongoing for six months.

27
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,920
 Where is this place?

28
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,010
 Is this Hell?

29
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,490
 Why is smoke coming out of here?

30
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,790
 And what is with this wound?

31
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,720
 And why is my skin like this?

32
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,940
 I have no pain nor feelings.

33
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,390
 My face...

34
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,360
 What is this?

35
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,560
 And what is this sound?

36
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,180
 I can't talk and only strange sounds are coming out.

37
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,700
 I can't remember anything.

38
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,900
 Who I am or why I am here.

39
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,490
 And... where I need to go.

40
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,190

41
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,500
Please stay still!  You keep shaking.

42
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,630
Aren't you done yet?

43
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,370
Isn't it suspicious?

44
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,150
Why does a man living alone have women's clothes?

45
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,320
- And... that Christmas tree. This definitely is the Santa, I am telling you. 
 - Okay.

46
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,020
Hurry.

47
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,840
What?

48
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,280
 You crazy wench!  If you broadcast,

49
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,010
 I will throw you into the fiery pits of Hell, you broadcast jerks!

50
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,360
- Broadcast station jerks? 
 - Ah!

51
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,140
We meant to interview for the opening of the Fiery Pit sauna,

52
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,150
- but it looks like we came here by mistake.   You must have a daughter since I see some girl's clothes.
 - Yeah.

53
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,490
Camera.

54
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,750
Why?

55
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,720
- Hurry, run, run! 
 - Why?

56
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,530
Sic'em!

57
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,010
- Hurry! 
 - Hurry up!

58
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,760

59
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,510
Hurry!

60
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,870
- Car key! 
 - Car key.  Uh!

61
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,280
- I don't have the car key! 
 - Why not?!

62
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,080
- Hold on tight.  
 - Yes, Sir.

63
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll go this way, so you check that place.

64
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,930
Right.

65
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,870
Sunji!

66
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,180
Kong Sunji!

67
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,610
- Sunji! 
  - Over here! I'm here!

68
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,540
 Cha Dohyun, I'm in here!

69
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Let go! Let go of this!

70
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,670
Go away!

71
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,530
Kong Sunji, are you in there?

72
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:30,410
Cha Dohyun, hurry up and do something!

73
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,630
Come here! Come here, good job.

74
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,110
Come here. What a good dog.

75
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,210
You can come out now.

76
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,370
Hey, where's the PD?

77
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,170
The PD?

78
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,080
Detective Cha!

79
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,980
You really are something.

80
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,550
The police are here, so I'll talk to the chief.

81
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, he's coming.

82
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,520
- Is it him? 
 - Yeah, it's him.

83
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,650
This punk's the Santa, right?

84
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,760
What to do? It's not him.

85
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,540
What are you talking about? Yes, he is.

86
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,280
Here, look. The scar on his face and his eyebrows.

87
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,720
There's even a mole by his lips, it's him!

88
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,020
The thing is, he wasn't present when the incident occurred.

89
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,180
He wasn't there? Are you sure?

90
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,320
Wrong again? How many tries is this going to take?

91
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,380
I was certain of it this time.

92
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,020
He's not the Santa, but he has a location tracker for sexual predators.

93
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,350
I've never done that.

94
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,390
The kids came on their own to see the dogs.

95
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,590
That's why you're a criminal, you bastard.

96
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,450
Where the hell is he?

97
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,760

98
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,050
 I'm hungry.

99
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,180
 A rabbit?

100
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,230
 Did I just eat a rabbit raw?

101
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,500
 I am no longer human.

102
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,380
 If this is my new life, I'd rather die.

103
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,150
 I want to die, but I can't.

104
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,880
 I'm a living corpse. A zombie.

105
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,020
 How did I become a zombie?

106
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,910
 Can I go back to being a human?

107
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,200
 Human? You?

108
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,820
 A passing dog would laugh if it heard you call yourself human.

109
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,240
Detective, this is... this is defamation of character.

110
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,140
I... I'm going to sue this woman for assault.

111
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,090
How could she give a double nose bleed to an innocent man—

112
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,430
You're an innocent man?

113
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,240
You're an innocent man, but you carry a location tracker as an accessory?

114
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,330
What kind of a crazy-ass are you?

115
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,410
- Are you done? 
 - Do I look like I'm done?

116
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,320
Do you think I'd be done?

117
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,480
- You're worth less than a dog. 
 - Hey.

118
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,750
Don't be rude, come on.

119
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,100
You're worth less than a dog, so how could you raise one?

120
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,330
You better not raise any dogs from now on!

121
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,280
You scumbag!

122
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,920

123
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,520
My phone.

124
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,100
Oh, right. That dog.

125
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,100
 Something has definitely happened.

126
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,260
 Either the world has ended, or a zombie virus has spread.

127
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:05,150
 For now, I'll go to the village and see what's happened.

128
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,170
 I'm in a rush, but why am I so freaking slow?

129
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,150
Where did I drop it?

130
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,400
 Go away.

131
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,420
 I said, go away!

132
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,570
I definitely heard something around here.

133
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,340
 It's a human!

134
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,920
 Why is that human fine?

135
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,830
  - Is... someone there? 
 - Damn it.

136
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,910
 - I must retreat.  
 - Excuse me. Who are you?

137
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,710
 Why am I so slow?

138
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,490
Excuse me, that hoodie is mine.

139
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,500
- Do you live here? 
 -  What?

140
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,950
 This freaking flashlight...

141
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,150
Sir, you can keep my hoodie.

142
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,730
But can you give me the phone in the pocket?

143
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,680
 In the pocket?

144
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,010
I'll take it.

145
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,930
 No.

146
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,230
 What is this smell?

147
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,280
 Where is this sweet smell...

148
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,840
Hello? Yeah, I found it.

149
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,520
Hold on, I'll call you back.

150
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,200
Sir, this is all I have.

151
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,360
Take this and go to a sauna.

152
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,640
Also, please receive treatment for your alcoholism.

153
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,400
You might die from it, so you have to be careful.

154
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,430
Here.

155
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,240
Then, goodbye.

156
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,350
 Did I just try to eat a human?

157
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,160
 No way. Is this the natural instinct of a zombie?

158
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,870
 No.

159
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,520
 I cannot live as a zombie who eats humans.

160
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,570
 If I don't want to eat humans, I'll have to eat something.

161
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,800
 Bird eggs should be okay, right?

162
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,640
 I'm sorry. Just one.

163
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,510
 This freaking zombie thing.

164
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,930
 I've been starving for three days.

165
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,870
 When I'm hungry for too long, I lose my senses.

166
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,690
 And when I wake up, someone has been sacrificed.

167
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:19,650

Beef Tripe Stew? What is this?

168
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,550
Beef tripe really is the best.

169
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,440
Maybe I should quit and open a tripe restaurant.

170
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,550
Don't you think I'll do really well?

171
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,650
Where the hell is this Santa guy?

172
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,640
I also have experience doing colonoscopies.

173
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,980
You know what the funny thing is?

174
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,840
The more bad guys I find,

175
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,740
the more only similar suspects come up. Super close.

176
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,210
I should've become a cop.

177
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,100
Then you would've been fired within a month.

178
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,420
You didn't have to face any settlement charges this time?

179
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,560
Of course, I did.

180
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,230
I begged for three-month installment payments and got an agreement.

181
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,420
Three months?

182
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,580
Does your sister know?

183
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,900
She'll go crazy if she finds out.

184
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,360
On top of that, I even lost my hoodie.

185
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
It's actually hers.

186
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Are you sure you lost it?

187
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,000
I am sure you probably gave it to someone as charity.

188
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,050
A couple of days ago, I went back to find my phone,

189
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,730
but there was an alcoholic there.

190
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,900
He was walking towards me barefoot.

191
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:54,220
If only I had more money, I would've given him more. I felt so bad.

192
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,080
You don't have the time to pity others right now.

193
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,330
You said you haven't even paid off for your last gangster-like behavior.

194
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,010
Lower your voice, or my sister will...

195
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:08,330
You still haven't paid off the settlement for last month's gangster-like behavior?

196
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,570
That's not it, Sis.

197
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,830
I told you to lower your voice. You're so dead.

198
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,610
Is it the job of the journalist for 70-Minute Chase to beat up people?

199
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,100
Why do you always use your monthly paycheck to pay for these settlements?

200
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,610
Sis, I'm going to pay it back soon. There's not much left.

201
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,130
You should hit me, too.

202
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,920
I'll at least get the money you owe me for living fees that way, hm?

203
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,780
Sis, come on. You're making Bora uncomfortable.

204
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,540
Don't worry about me, we're not strangers. You can continue, Sunyoung.

205
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,460
If it's 70-Minute Chase, you should only chase for 70 minutes.

206
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,880
Why the hell do you always chase around day after day and only get paid about as much as a dried anchovy's crap-filled head?!

207
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,750
Forget about reporting others, I should just report this crappy broadcast station!

208
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,260
I'm sorry.

209
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,630
I'll pay you as soon as I'm done eating, so wait just a few minutes.

210
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,460
Where's the kimchi?

211
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,300
Of course, black bean noodles must be eaten with kimchi or yellow pickled radish.

212
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,540
My boss said you have to pay for the kimchi, too.

213
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,040
You should just order kimchi stew at this rate.

214
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,150
Give me a coupon.

215
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,130
Friend, where are you from?

216
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,850
- I am from Yanbian. 
 - Yanbian.

217
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,610
If I were to open up the first overseas branch,

218
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,450
I was planning on opening it in Yanbian, China.

219
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,320
Do you even have any customers here?

220
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,330
I heard that Detective Kim Mooyoung's office across the street does better business.

221
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,150
There is a rumor that Kim Mooyoung will soon be leaving Gangrim City.

222
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,890
If that happens, the only number in this Gangrim City,

223
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,110
will be me, Lee Sungrok.

224
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,900
You can leave the empty bowls out front.

225
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,270
How much does President Kang pay you?

226
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,920
I get paid the standard.

227
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,500
Then, how do you feel about working with me, Lee Sungrok?

228
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,430
I don't.

229
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,220
- Mr. President? 
 - Did you go all the way to Yanbian to deliver black-bean noodles?!

230
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,750
 If this is how you're going to work, don't bother showing up tomorrow!

231
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,430
 You punk, I took pity because of your current situation but you should be grateful!

232
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,720
 - I have plenty of others— 
  - I quit.

233
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,100
What are you doing?

234
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,500
He doesn't know how valuable people are.

235
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,690
To use someone fluent in both Chinese and Korean in this way...

236
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,710
What a shame.

237
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,850
With me, Lee Sungrok, it won't be a boss vs. underling,

238
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,420
but rather you will work as a person to person.

239
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,260
I will pay you the standard and will even provide you with room and board.

240
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,620
Even room and board?

241
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,870
On top of that, if I open a chain office in Yanbian,

242
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,930
I will even think about making you the branch manager.

243
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,800
- I can tell just by looking at you that you are branch manager material. 
 - Even a branch manager in Yanbian?

244
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,420
This reminds me of my mother in my hometown.  I haven't seen her in over a year.

245
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,480
I know this is not good manners, but how old are you, sir?

246
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,690
Boss, please speak comfortably. I'm 28 this year.

247
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,050
- Are you serious? 
 - Yes.

248
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,270
I was born in '92, so I'm turning 28 this year.

249
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,690
You suffered quite a lot after you arrived in Korea.

250
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,250
Just what on earth is happening in the Republic of Korea?

251
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,630

252
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,870
 A zombie virus has spread here, so take us to Busan immediately.

253
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,630
 Stay right here and don't move.  I will finish it quickly.

254
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,470
 Be careful, Oppa.

255
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,590
 Oppa, behind you! Careful!

256
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,590
 After I became a zombie, I could finally understand them.

257
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,490
 Tell me! Why can't you tell me?

258
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,940
 If it hurts, just tell me it hurts!

259
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,630
 - You waited a long time, didn't you?  It's okay.
 - Oppa, are you all right?

260
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,450
 I'm okay.

261
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,750
 Oppa, your hand.

262
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,170

263
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,240

264
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,750

265
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,370
 What the hell, you zombie punk!

266
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,300
 This punk. Hey!

267
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,970
 Die! Die!

268
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:41,630
 Die! Just die, you zombie bastard!

269
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:48,600
 Humans were cruel and so many zombies died, unable to speak their mind.

270
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,890

271
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,310

272
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,130
 I realized this that night.

273
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,700
 If I don't want to die unfairly at the hands of humans,

274
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,610
 I must walk like a human,

275
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,730
 talk like a human,

276
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,340
 and live as a human.

277
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,600
 To protect myself from humans,

278
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,900
 I have to be perfectly reborn as a human.

279
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,040
 That road is tough...

280
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
 far, and near impossible...

281
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,870
 but I must survive.

282
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,370
Peter... Piper...

283
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,620
picked... a... peck...

284
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,490
of... pickled... peppers...

285
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,580
 I want to be human again!

286
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,150
 Spring.

287
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,190
 Summer.

288
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,080
 Autumn.

289
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,640
 Winter.

290
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,830
 Spring again.

291
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,500
 So much has changed within a year.

292
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,610
 God does not betray those who persist hard.

293
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,580
 Even if it is a zombie.

294
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,700

295
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,030
 (T/N: tongue twisters using the word "soy sauce.")

296
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,990
 (T/N: tongue twisters, done in a rap style.)

297
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,120
 (T/N: tongue twisters using the word "soy bean paste.")

298
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,090
 (T/N: tongue twisters using the word "rabbit.")

299
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,170
Mountain rabbit, where are you going?
   (T/N: nursery rhyme about rabbits, done in a rap style.)

300
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,580
Rabbit, rabbit...

301
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,860

302
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,740
Ah, I am hungry.

303
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,180
 Just as all animals adapt to their environment,

304
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,540
 I, too, adapted to my environment quickly.

305
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,700

306
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,180

307
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,900

308
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,080
This bastard...

309
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,350
For what reason did he do this to Sori?

310
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,480
Really...

311
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,000
Is it because of the broadcast?

312
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:33,340

313
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,480
What a mess!

314
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,250
How is it that she is only looking for "Santa" the entire year?

315
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,100
Is she even eating properly?

316
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,750
You need to eat to have the energy to work.

317
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,720
Pathetic.

318
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,740
Did you stay up all night again?

319
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,390
It's for sure this time, right?

320
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,480
Don't worry, please.  It's going to be broadcasted this time no matter what.

321
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,840
Did the eyewitness contact you?

322
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,070
Not yet.  I should keep calling.

323
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,720
Are you obsessed with this case because of... some feelings of guilt?

324
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,980
What happened to that kid is not your fault.

325
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,590
I do feel bad for the kid, but that bastard—

326
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,220
It's nothing like that.

327
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,670
It is our job to get people interested in unsolved cases.  Isn't that right?

328
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,900
 Will the day I can eat tripe stew come?

329
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,490
 Zombies have a heightened sense of smell.  Especially,

330
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,790
 the smell of meat.

331
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,300
 It's a human being.

332
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,050
 I keep wanting to eat a human.

333
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,580
 No, I shouldn't.

334
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,680
 What is that? Is it a wild animal?

335
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,020
 It was slaughtered within the last 36 hours. It's a domestic, top-grade, front right leg.

336
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,750
 Seeing that the smell of green tea is strong...

337
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,510
Green tea fed pig?

338
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't care much for green tea.

339
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,950
I told you that you would get hurt if you ignored my warning.

340
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,070
 Humans really are... cruel.

341
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,790
 Is he really dead?

342
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,470
Ah, you startled me!

343
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,400
 What is this?  Is he still alive?

344
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,910
Where is he?

345
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,330
I'm here.

346
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,140
Per?

347
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,000
Person...

348
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,630
Office?

349
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,960
Office...

350
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,080
key...

351
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,910
 Key?

352
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,350
 What should I do with this human?

353
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:24,150
 Rest in peace now.  At a time like this, how can you be hungry?

354
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,740
 You crazy punk! You crazy punk!

355
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,000
 Kim Mooyoung.

356
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,580
 Detective?

357
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,530

358
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,970
 Finding missing persons...

359
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,470
 Would I be able to find out who I am, too?

360
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,120

361
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,330

362
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,300
 He should have lived more neatly.  What a mess!

363
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:35,040

364
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,980

365
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:15,370
The raccoon's head was ripped and eaten this time, too.

366
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,290
It wasn't done by a human or a wild boar.

367
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,060
 It looks tasty.

368
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,650
 That's right. I am a zombie.

369
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,330
There.

370
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,140
Shoong.

371
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,640
Kong Sunji!

372
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,320
You are here.

373
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,130
- Auntie! 
 - Joonwoo!

374
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,130
Sunjin, pass!

375
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,390
You said you were busy.  What brings you here?

376
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,060
I just stopped by because I was in the area.

377
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,290
Undercover?

378
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,890
What is it this time? Drugs?

379
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,790
Distribution of pornography?  Fraud?

380
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,680
I get that you are the journalist for 70 Minute Chase.

381
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,990
Let's separate business and pleasure, Kong Sunji.

382
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,530
Just give me a tidbit.

383
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,470
What good are friends?  We should help each other at times like this.

384
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,180
Help?

385
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,390
Don't you know that after your broadcast, the police bulletin board becomes chaotic?

386
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,230
It's probably best for you not to be seen by Team Leader for a while.

387
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,180
I thought he might like it because he wanted to appear on the broadcast.

388
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,720
You even followed Team Leader to the men's toilet to convince him.

389
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,350
Did I do that?  You are going to stay and eat, right?

390
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:10,100
I need to go soon.  I stopped by because I had a little bit of time to spare.

391
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,290
Just a little bit of time to spare?  It must be an urgent case.

392
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,110
I heard that a neighborhood auntie ran off with the money from a rotating-credit social group.  That's it, right?

393
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,310
- Are you curious?
 - Yeah.

394
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,560
To be honest—

395
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,110
What?

396
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,990
Hey, Joonwoo!  Let's play soccer!

397
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,730
Hey, Cha Dohyun, are you really going to be like this?!

398
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,120
Aren't you going to hurry up and spill it?!

399
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,390
- Joonwoo, pass it to Auntie. 
 - Oh, oh.

400
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,830
Steal the ball!

401
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,350
 After I came to the office, I searched up the missing persons nationwide.

402
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,570
 Just maybe... I can find myself...

403
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,680

404
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,250
 This person is not me, either.

405
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,300
 I am dying of hunger.

406
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:39,020
 There were plenty of things to eat in the mountains.  What am I going to survive on, here?

407
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,710
 Pigeon?

408
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,900
 Even though I am starving, a pigeon isn't the answer, is it?

409
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,280
 Pigeons have so many germs.

410
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,640
 Who cares?

411
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,380
 At this rate, I would even eat a human.

412
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:26,640
 Pigeons are even known to spread viruses with their droppings.

413
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,420
 A zombie has no business pointing out a pigeon virus!

414
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,800
What is he doing now?

415
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,070
In our country,

416
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,970
there's a pigeon and horse dish.

417
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,420
There is a dish that is made of boiled pigeon and horse—

418
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,310
You are saying that he is trying to catch a pigeon to eat it?

419
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,620
Then, he would be a crazy punk!

420
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,380
I'm sorry.

421
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:06,040
There cannot be two detectives under the sky.

422
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,850
Wasn't there someone called Sherlock?

423
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,080
There cannot be two detectives in Asia.

424
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,300
There are also Conan and Hajime Kindaichi—

425
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,190
You need to leave out kids!  Kids need to focus on their studies!

426
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,520
If not, it's called child abuse.

427
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,270
I'm sorry.

428
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,030
 He was nowhere to be seen for a while...

429
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,500
I, Lee Sungrok, will make you regret

430
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,920
coming back to Gangrim City.

431
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,420
 We look too much like villains then.

432
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,270
 In order to eat, I need money.

433
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,650
 Since I came to where humans live, I shall make money  the human-like way.

434
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,010
 (T/N: Temporary/Part-Time Jobs)

435
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,890
 As much as possible,

436
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,350
 avoid face-to-face meeting with humans.

437
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,470

438
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:21,200
 Did he change the newsletter?  It's strange.

439
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,290
 - Headless Badger?  
  - Woah!

440
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,120
I almost hit you, Sister-in-Law.

441
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,530
Why the badger, Brother-in-Law?

442
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,240
Headless animals were found on Mountain Chowol.

443
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,110
It looks like it was done by a zombie.

444
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,150
Zombie?

445
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,030
A zombie's weakness is his head.

446
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,370
And headless wild animals were found.  What do you think this means?

447
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:48,720
Instinctively, a zombie thinks that other animals' weakness is their head as well.

448
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,300
That's why the zombie eats up the heads (of animals) first.

449
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,680
It seems that my brother-in-law is still into zombies.

450
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,050
Sister-in-Law, I will become successful no matter what.

451
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:03,270
To give up on movie-making,

452
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:07,060
I am too talented.  You know that, right?  Look.

453
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,170
Director Lee Taegyeong's debut project,

454
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,840
depicting zombies' fight to get to Busan.

455
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,140
The record-breaking blockbuster, "Busan Express."

456
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,980
I thought for 10 years why only 23 people saw this movie in the theaters nationwide.

457
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,670
I still don't understand.

458
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,390
It's scary that you still don't know why.

459
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,740
A tear-jerker melodrama aimed at the Chinese audience,

460
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,550
"Chinese Zombie's Back Hug."

461
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:38,620
That one too. My sister found out that you emptied the savings to make it.

462
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,670
She ended up with 3 bald spots on her head the size of a ₩500 coin.

463
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,690
No, it's 4.

464
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,850
That's a lot.

465
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,220
A horror movie made jointly by Hong Kong and Korea,

466
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,360
"Why did Hong Kong Granny have to go to Hong Kong?"

467
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:58,200
Why do you think the Hong Kong Granny had to go to Hong Kong, Brother-in-Law?

468
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,230
Sister-in-Law, Hong Kong Granny is a killer content for the centenary era like now.

469
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:08,690
It is a misfortunate masterpiece that was ahead of its time.

470
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,940
My brother-in-law sure is an optimist.

471
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,680
That's why you live with my sister.

472
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,290
You are the only one who understands me, Sister-in-Law.

473
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:23,520
Of course!

474
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,430
What did I tell you will happen if you talk about movies at home?

475
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,340
You said I would die.  We are dead.

476
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:36,120
Kong Sunji,

477
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,360
when are you going to pay this month's living expenses?

478
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,240
- Can't you give me one more week? 
 - Ah! 
 - Ah!

479
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,660
Honey, honey, honey...

480
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,880
 They said this was the ultimate part-time job that Song Gangho chose.

481
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,500
 This is totally physical labor.  Labor...

482
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:06,580
 I didn't come down to the town to do this.

483
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,520

484
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,660
 What is this?  Why does he look so tasty?

485
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,400

486
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,270

487
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,300
 Hire?

488
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,960
 Even this crappy office has clients?

489
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,360

490
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:43,240

491
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,000

492
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,670
 How did I get myself involved with a nutcase like this?

493
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,820

494
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,400
 2,000 for human and 500 for animal.

495
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,440

496
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,460

497
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,020
What?

498
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,390
 Detective work... that won't do.

499
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:19,020
 Then again, when am I going to fold all those boxes?

500
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:22,810
 500 will last me a few months at least.

501
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,150
 How can I be a detective with this face?

502
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,120

503
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,870

504
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,200
 Monster Cover...

505
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,950

506
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,130

507
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,460
 God has not forsaken me.

508
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,020
 There is no disguise more perfect than this.

509
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,100
Hodoo's dad?

510
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,410
Mr. Detective?

511
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,930
Eunhee, here.

512
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:09,450
Mister, are you really a detective?

513
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,060
How do you become a detective?

514
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,300
Are you stronger or Conan?

515
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,200
What we talked about.

516
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:20,970
Here.

517
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,030
Don't you know that I first need to be paid the deposit money?

518
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,320
I don't trust humans.

519
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,260
What is this booger smeared money?

520
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,920
MIster, you said ₩2,000 for a person and ₩500 for an animal.

521
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,960
₩500?

522
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:51,230
 Since I came all the way here, I can't go empty-handed.

523
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,650
 No, for sure, I can't go back!

524
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:59,540
Hey, you Booger, if you want to at least confirm whether your dog is dead or alive,

525
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,300
go right now and bring me ₩4,999,500!

526
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,500
I don't have that kind of money.

527
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,580
You don't?

528
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:13,420
Then, you kids take out everything you have.

529
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,510
Mister, are you bullying us to get the money now?

530
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:17,460
Bullying?

531
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,660
Mister, you are not a detective, are you?

532
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,430
This uncle looks like a fraud.

533
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:28,650
You kids, if you know who I was, you would be passing bloody poop, not pee.

534
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:32,280
- This is a warning.  A warning to you booger faces.  Got that? 
 - Hey!

535
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,380
Just get the ₩500 and let's go!

536
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,820
I am late for study academy!

537
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,900
- Yeah, let's just go. 
 - Let's go.

538
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,210
Mister, give back my ₩500.

539
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,120
A refund is not possible if it is a change of mind by a customer.

540
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,640
- What do you mean? 
 - Ah, give it.

541
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,530
- Give me back my ₩500! 
 - Give it!

542
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,090
- Hurry! 
 - Please give it back!

543
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,060
- What do we do? 
 - Move those hands!

544
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:54,710
Hurry up and give it back!

545
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,850
The ₩500 belongs to Joonwoo!

546
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,130
The punks who commit crimes against kids

547
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,410
should get their limbs ripped apart.

548
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,830
Of course!

549
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,520
Ah, is that even a human?!

550
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,950
It's an animal wearing a mask of a human!

551
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:11,040
Then, are you wearing a mask too?

552
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,400
- Even recently, there was a punk wearing a trench coat who showed up at an elementary school and—
 - Please give it back!

553
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,720
- Please give it back! 
 - Please give it back!

554
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,020
- He appeared. 
 - Huh?

555
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,380
Where are you going, Journalist Kong?

556
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:28,670
Don't go!

557
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,230
- Please, give it back! 
 - Please, give it back!

558
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,590
- Give back the money! 
 - Come on!

559
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,640
Joonwoo!

560
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,570
- Auntie! 
 - Auntie! 
 - Come here kids.

561
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,520
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

562
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,840
Hey, Mister, what are you doing there?

563
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,460
Auntie, that uncle wouldn't give my money back.

564
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,620
Cheapskate.

565
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:58,570
You don't look like you belong in this neighborhood.

566
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,140
What is that in your fist?

567
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,860
 No need to be afraid.  In the wild, as soon as you show fear,

568
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,900
 you get eaten.

569
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,030
A third party should stay out!

570
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,920
Third party?

571
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,900
You are making the ego of the third party burst out!

572
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,210
Mister, do you think this is my first time seeing someone like you?!

573
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:24,340
Writer Kong, why are you making things bigger?

574
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,120
Let's ask Detective Cha to help.

575
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,140
What if he runs away?

576
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,180
Don't you know that with perverts like this, you have to catch him early?

577
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,180
 Pervert?   What does she see me as?!

578
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,390
Mister, can you raise the hem of your pants a little?

579
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,540
I want to check to see if you are wearing an electronic ankle bracelet.

580
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,110
 Who is this nutty human?

581
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,960
Hurry, please.

582
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,520
Why?  You can't show it to me?

583
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,770
If you have nothing to hide, why can't you show it to me, right?

584
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,890
You must feel guilty about something.

585
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,330
Why don't you go to the police station with me, right now?

586
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,130
 There are too many humans watching.

587
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,290
 Retreat for now!

588
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,400
- That perverted punk! 
 - Hey.

589
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,670
- Hey, aren't you going to stop?! 
 - Yay!

590
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,090
That bastard!

591
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,990
 - What is this?  Why does that human keep following me?  
 - Hey!

592
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,520
 - Die!  
 - Ah!!!

593
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,760
 Die!  Die!

594
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,090
 Die!!!

595
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:39,490
 You lowly zombie bastard!

596
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:56,100
 (T/N: A Korean children's song about playing Tag.)

597
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:57,440
Let's go! Let's go.

598
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,300
You need to pay before you go!

599
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,980
 Fortunately, zombies don't get tired.

600
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:58,910
Excuse me for a moment.

601
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,780
That's right.  You said your auntie played sports.  Which sport was it?

602
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,220
It was shot put.

603
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,720
- Noooo. 
 - Noooo.

604
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:51,930
 In the end, am I also going to face my end in the hands of the humans?

605
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:03,210

606
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,490

607
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,260
 December 25, 2018

608
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,140
 was a nightmarish Christmas to Sori.

609
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:14,320
 Mr. Hyungchul, think about Sori who passed away, and just once...

610
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,560
 It's because your interview really is necessary if we are to catch the culprit.

611
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,160
 - Aren't you Detective Kim? 
 - Hey!

612
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,060
 Detective Kim!

613
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:24,690
 What is this a gift from above?

614
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,160
 Heol!  What about my Hodoo?

615
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,960
 What are you doing now?!

616
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,860
 What the heck is that punk?

617
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,130
 This is why I don't like zombies.

618
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:35,170
 Do you know what this is?

619
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,850
 I'll let you know when I'm happy

620
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,430
 To Miss Kim Sori, who has become a star in the sky,

621
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,350
 our condolences.

622
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,040
 Do you have any idea what you jerks have done?

623
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,530
 Writer Kong, you are okay, right?

624
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:55,000
 Without even a single word spoken, you can feel his deathly energy.

625
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,460
 The problem is with the bastard who committed the crime after watching the broadcast.
