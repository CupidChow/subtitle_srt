1
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,840

2
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,040

3
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,440

4
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,610
Don't come!

5
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,470
Stop right there!

6
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,020
 What did I just see?

7
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,390
 A human?

8
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,250
 Or a monster?  What is that, really?

9
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,090

10
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,780
 What are those scars and what is with the raw chicken?

11
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,200
 I couldn't have made a mistake about seeing those...

12
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,480
 Now that I think about it, there was something strange about him even when I first saw him.

13
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,330
That's right!

14
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,010
 He doesn't seem to be a pervert like you said.

15
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,130
 Would you stop—

16
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,950
 Will you stop filming, sir?

17
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,980
That's right.  These were all over his body.

18
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,910
What could they be?

19
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,490
Sister-in-Law, let's eat breakfast.

20
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,690
Isn't that a zombie?  Is it a newly released movie?

21
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,630
Zombie?

22
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,260
Yes, a zombie.

23
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,660
Look at this.  This scar.

24
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,420
This is kind of scarring occurs on a rotting corpse.  A zombie has these all over his body.

25
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,740
 They really made it look very real.

26
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,030
It is just a zombie.

27
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,120
Why didn't I see this?  Sister-in-Law, what is the title of this movie?

28
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,280
What is the title?

29
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,250
Brother-in-Law...

30
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,800
Brother-in-Law?  The title is Brother-in-Law?

31
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,040
Brother-in-Law,

32
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,920
is a zombie possible in reality?

33
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,290
Don't you know that nowadays the reality is more like a movie than a film?

34
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,730
Even so...

35
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,330
A zombie in the 21st century?

36
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,360
I think it is very possible.

37
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,050
Zombies certainly do exist somewhere in the 21st century Korea.

38
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,890
Maybe... there could even be one in our town.

39
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,490
Sister-in-Law, here.

40
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,530
Take a look.

41
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,440

42
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,710
Zombie Mystery?

43
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,860
It has all records relating to zombies.

44
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,480
What in the world?!  What is all this?

45
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,820
A zombie only eats raw.

46
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,300
In other words, live meat.

47
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,430
 Boss, really, what would you even do with raw meat?

48
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,930
Ah... Ah, but a zombie eats human...

49
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,010
not raw chicken or raw meat, right?

50
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,910
You can think of it as food to cope with the cravings.

51
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,990
If the environment is not ideal for consuming humans, raw chicken, water deer, badger, or rabbit will do.

52
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,730
Of course, it won't give the feeling of fullness as eating a human would.

53
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,450
Feeling of full... fullness?

54
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,280
Yes, feeling of fullness.  The stomach has to get filled, you know.

55
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,860
And a zombie does not feel pain.

56
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,690
Because the peripheral nervous system which lets you feel pain is dead in a zombie.

57
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,680
 Ah!  Ah!  Boss, are you okay?!

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,190
 You are fine after getting stabbed by a cane and fine after getting stabbed with broken window glass.

59
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,980
 What are you, a zombie or something?

60
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,650
 I was just kidding.  Just a joke.

61
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,390
 Don't joke like that!  It's not funny at all.

62
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,590
 What is this?  Was I joking around with a zombie?

63
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,710
A zombie is a living corpse.

64
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,880
The heart has stopped beating.

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,590
 There is no heartbeat.

66
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,930
 It appears to be broken.

67
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,320
 Please, please.

68
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,120
 A zombie.  He was a zombie...

69
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,920
 That means I, not only accused a zombie of being a pervert, but even hit him in the back of the head with a helmet...

70
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,330
This is a secret but I actually wrote an amazing work about a zombie...

71
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,810
 I am done for.

72
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,490
 - Kong Sunji...  
 - Sister-in-Law—

73
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,070
Don't look.  You don't have to look.

74
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,150
I won't make... make it.  I am just saying I wrote... wrote it.  That's all...

75
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,890
And... And, Sister-in-law, keep this a secret from your sister.

76
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,470
 If the one who ate these animals is the boss...

77
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,720
 Then, why didn't he eat me?

78
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,610
 Why did he let me live even when he had me so close?

79
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,450
 Isn't it because he wanted to save and savor it slowly?

80
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,010
During the day, there would be clients who come by,

81
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,490
so he wants to eat while savoring at night.  Isn't that it?

82
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,000
Even so, why eat a chicken raw like a wolf cub?

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,490
Haven't you ever had chicken yukhoe?
   (T/N: raw meat served like sashimi)

84
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,330
Chicken yukhoe?

85
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,650
In Haenam or Honam, chicken yukhoe is a popular dish.

86
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,220
I had already figured it out.

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,070
Detective Kim...

88
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
- must be an epicurean. 
 - Epi...

89
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,560
Is it that tasty, enough to want to eat it whole in the middle of the night?

90
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,460
Boss, try... try... it first, then talk.

91
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,520
The chicken breast meat is nice and chewy and tastes amazing!

92
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,390
Let's make chicken yukhoe tonight's dinner menu.

93
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,730
Please get it ready for dinner.

94
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,700
You want me to do it?

95
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,570
Then, you think I should?

96
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,820
At least give me the money to buy the chicken breast meat before telling me to do it.

97
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,960
Did I get hired at a detective office or a restaurant?

98
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,310
How will we ever maintain a global chain office...

99
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,950
when we can't even maintain the original office?

100
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,670
Move aside, please.

101
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,250
Don't you know that I, Lee Sungrok, keep my word?

102
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,070
I will go global for sure.

103
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,920
Start!  Start!

104
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,570
Let's go!  Let's go!

105
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,720
And, shouldn't you have dusted this before I sat down?

106
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,870
Let's go!  Let's go!

107
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,260

108
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,990

109
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,610
Do I report or not?

110
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,660
What do I say when I report?

111
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,450
Should I consult Cha Dohyun instead?

112
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,910
- Kong Sunji. 
 - Uh?

113
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,000
Sis!  Sis!  Ah!

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,330
Sis, just hear me out!

115
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,370
Did I or did I not tell you to deposit the living expenses by yesterday?

116
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,930
It's already so hard to pay this month's loan payment...

117
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,400
Do you know how many months you are behind on your living expenses?

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,980
Sis, I am telling you that money is not the important thing right now.

119
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,170
Do you know who I was with until just now?

120
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,290
- Who? 
 - Don't get shocked, okay.

121
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,280
Zom... bie.

122
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,820
Not just Bi (T/N: Rain), but zombie?

123
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes, zombie.  You know it, too. Right?

124
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,920
You see it in Walking Dead, too.  Walking Dead.

125
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,790
Like this...

126
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,810
You know the one that runs like this.

127
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,420
Brother-in-Law, you know about zombies, don't you?

128
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,860
Sister-in-Law, you shouldn't act.  How is that a zombie?  That's a zom.   (T/N: long-tailed silverfish)

129
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,300
A zombie has to have different eyes to start with.

130
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,570
I am a zombie.

131
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,460
Dad, why does a zombie have belly fat like this?

132
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,040
You are dead. Arrgh!

133
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,650
Next is Sister-in-Law.

134
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,810
I told you not to talk about zombies at home, didn't I?

135
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,590
Yes, it's just that Sister-in-Law suddenly mentioned it so...

136
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,510
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,250
Sis!  I am telling you that he really is not a human.

138
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,000
He really is not a human.

139
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,720
Ah, it hurts!

140
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,340
How about you, who couldn't even make your living until now...

141
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,880
Are you a human?!

142
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,410
If you have any conscience, you can't do this to me!

143
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,890
How long are you going to live like this?  You are soon going to be 30 years old!  30 years old!

144
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,110
Please come to your senses, you wench!

145
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,220
- Sis!  Sis!  No!
 - What am I going to do with this—

146
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,200
- I am telling you it's the truth! 
 - Hey!

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,840
Hey, come here you!

148
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
Hey!

149
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,360
Eat.

150
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,050
Sister-in-Law seems to be too into the movie.

151
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,140
What movie?

152
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,500
There is one

153
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,270
that depicted a zombie very realistically.  A sensational movie!

154
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,190
Ah, darn!

155
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,500
Even so, how could she chase me out like that?

156
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,910
Is she even family?

157
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,870
She's not even family.  You are not even family!

158
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,780
Don't you dare even think about coming home until you get the living expenses!  Got that?!

159
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,910
She should at least throw down the shoes that match.

160
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,300
 That's true.  Is a zombie scary?

161
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,680
 My reality of being poor, that is scary.

162
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,720

163
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,230
I am about to go crazy.

164
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,750
 Would Gangrim City be all right like this?

165
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,830
 If you let that punk live, there could be a bloodbath.

166
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,270
You need to believe me!

167
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,070
Why did you commit those deeds if you were so concerned about Gangrim City?

168
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,520
- Why? 
 - I am in the middle of investigating a drug case...

169
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,490
there are so many punks involved.

170
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,900
It's such a big headache...

171
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,910
Let's keep up the momentum, and let's get to the bottom of the drug case. The strongest!

172
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,560
 Gangrim!

173
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,470
Probiotics are here.

174
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,750
Probiotics is the best for the intestines, of course!

175
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,520
Here you go, Detective Cha.  Go ahead and drink it up.

176
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,530
Thank you.

177
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,670
What are you going to do about our Sunji?

178
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,750
Excuse me?

179
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,700
That troublemaker, when are you going to take her with you?

180
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,340
I will go ahead and kick her out of the house because of the living expenses.

181
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,070
So, how about use this opportunity to live with her?

182
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,640
Noonim,  you know that we are friends.

183
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,320
There is no such thing as friends between a man and a woman.

184
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,510
Life is short.  There is no time to delay.

185
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,070
In a homo-hundred era, you need to look at the life long.

186
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,880
What are you going to do if someone else steals her?

187
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,810
Why?  By any chance, is there someone...

188
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,050
Is there someone?

189
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,860
Someone?  Of course not.

190
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,900
 - You know that I am on your side, right?  
 - Auntie!

191
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,630
Let me have one of those probiotics.

192
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,380
Isn't that the leader of the cult that was on the news?

193
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,820
Yes, he is.

194
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,980
Auntie, careful what you say!

195
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,670
How dare you say "cult" to our leader?!

196
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,940
Oh, it must be hard for you to go through the questioning.

197
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,570
Here, please have a yogurt.

198
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,930
You need to come closer if you want to it, please.

199
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,020
- Closer, closer. 
 - Thank you.

200
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,000
Here.

201
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,920
You're like a helicobacter pylori.

202
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,500
I should pull out your intestines and soak them in some probiotics.

203
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,870
Let go.  Let go.  My sister and the cane...

204
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,820
Who's the punk that tried to stab my sister?!

205
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,920
Who is it?!  You?!

206
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,130
Which punk?  Come here!

207
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,790
Let go.  You punk!

208
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,140
This smell?

209
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,960
 That's right.  They say even if you enter a tiger's den, you will survive as long as you stay alert.

210
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,250
 No way he would eat me, would he?

211
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,880
 No, no way.

212
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,800
 Kong Sunji, no need to be scared.

213
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,210
Are you okay like that?  It looks like you are sweating quite a bit.

214
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,830
It is quite warm today, isn't it?

215
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,340
Ah, didn't I tell you?

216
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,120
I started a sport.

217
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,000
I was in a hurry so... I didn't have a chance to change...

218
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,590
Are you really a zombie?

219
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,810
- If I am?
   - He really is a zombie.

220
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,190
Why?  Are you afraid?

221
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,320
No...

222
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,950
Afraid?  Not at all...

223
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,380
 Don't be afraid.  Stay alert!

224
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,930
You might have noticed but I have a lot of visceral fat.

225
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,330
You know that I like alcohol.  My liver is not in good condition, either.

226
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,900
Ah, my brain... is filled with crap.

227
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,940
It really wouldn't taste good.

228
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,430
Brain sexy people have tasty brains.

229
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,570
Mine tastes like poop.

230
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,660
I just want you to take it into consideration.

231
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,380
That's why I told you to text your account number to me.  Why the hell are you here causing a scene?

232
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,050
It's because if the money gets deposited into my account, it will go directly to pay the credit card debts.

233
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,380
It's not like I came here because I wanted to see you, either.

234
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,840
Please just hurry up and give me the money.

235
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:36,390
 Why does he have all the windows closed?  It's so stuffy.

236
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,510
This much?

237
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,370
We are done here so hurry up and leave.

238
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,140
Sure.

239
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,950
But are you going somewhere?

240
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,060
Are you planning on leaving here?  Not because of me, right?!

241
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,520
There is no need for that.

242
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,240
Where are you planning on going?  Do you have anywhere to go?

243
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,480
That's none of your business.

244
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,770
I will put it to good use.  Wherever you go, please be well.

245
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,620
And eating too much raw chicken is not good for your body.

246
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,590
Please make sure to take anthelmintics.

247
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,260
Ah, I guess a zombie doesn't need that.

248
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,350
Who's worrying about whom now?

249
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,330
That's why you shouldn't drink so much alcohol.

250
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,610
Ah, my stomach...

251
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,780
- Please help me. 
 - Are you okay?

252
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,240
Please save me!

253
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,280
Don't come near!  Go away!

254
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,830
You are going to eat me, aren't you?  How many have you eaten?

255
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,450
How many before me?

256
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,860
Where?  Start with the brain?

257
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,420
The gut?  The large Intestine?  Or the small intestine?

258
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,780
What nonsense?...

259
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,960
Ah, my stomach...  What did you put in the tea?

260
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,580
Are you in a lot of pain?   Are you all right?

261
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,380
Don't come near!  Go away!  Don't touch me!

262
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,160
I asked you if you are all right?

263
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,680
Don't touch me...

264
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,450
 My life passed by like a kaleidoscope.

265
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,170
 It's a life that never had the four major insurances.

266
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,800
 Still, I thought I lived diligently, without shame...

267
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,030
 Wait!  If I get bit by a zombie, is that an accident?

268
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,980
 Or is it a calamity?

269
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,230
 Do I have life insurance?

270
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,160
What was she thinking of coming here wearing all this as if I would eat her?

271
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,360

272
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,870
What's this now?

273
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,370
Ah, really!

274
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,730
 So, this is how I will end my life?  By getting eaten by a zombie?

275
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,990
 28 years, a short yet long life...

276
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,410
 You worked hard, Kong Sunji.

277
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,550
- What was that? 
 - Did you hear that sound?

278
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,510
 Where?  Is this it?

279
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,810
 It's here.

280
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,780
Sunji!

281
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,690
 Sun... Sunji, are you all right?

282
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,600
- Sister-in-Law, are you okay?
 - I... zombie...  zombie...

283
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,790
What the heck are you talking about, zombie?

284
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,140
What are we going to do?!  Oh, Honey, what are we going to do?!

285
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,350
Why are you hit... hitting?

286
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,200
- Ah! 
 - Oh!

287
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,120
Oh, hello, Doctor!

288
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,230
It's acute appendicitis.  Her appendix burst.

289
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,680
What?!  My appendix was taken?

290
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,470
Anywhere else?  Did any other parts get taken?

291
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,520
Were large intestines or small intestines taken?

292
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,350
Not taken, but burst.

293
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,130
And everything else is fine.

294
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,660
What about that... that zombie?

295
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,430
Zombie?

296
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,650
Why do you keep talking about zombies since yesterday?

297
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,750
Ah, you must be talking about that man you brought you here last night, right?

298
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,790
He just left after confirming that your surgery went well.

299
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,350
 He came running all the way to the hospital with you on his back.

300
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,160
 He registered you in and paid for all fees, including the fees for the surgery and hospitalization.

301
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,450
 You barely got here in time to avoid a disaster.

302
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,180
 What the heck?  Did I, a zombie,  just save a person's life?

303
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,120
  Was I a member of the Red Cross or an Emergency Medical Technician in the past?

304
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,110
 I really am doing all sorts of things.

305
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,650

306
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,330
How do you not know when your appendix burst?

307
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,470
You foolish one!

308
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,770
But, at least, you must have been worried about your sister collapsing.

309
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,100
Honey, you are mismatched right now.

310
00:23:52,690 --> 00:24:00,180
Of course, she is my only blood relation.  We grew up without parents relying only on each other.

311
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,160
Sis!

312
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,900
Now she is my source of income...

313
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,170
Sunji, are you all right?!

314
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,230
- Ah!
 - Oh, Detective Cha, how did you come here when you are so busy?

315
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,520
What are you talking about?  Didn't you call Detective Cha and ask him to come?

316
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,230
Honey, it's warm.

317
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,770
Let's go out to get some air.

318
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,000
What air?  It's really nice and cool here.

319
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,800
Get up.  Hurry!

320
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,360
We will go out for some air so please spend some pleasant time together.

321
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,320
Why are you drawing the curtain?  It will get stuffy.

322
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,130
Ah, wait, wait!

323
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,500
Are you feeling okay?

324
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,070
It's appendicitis.

325
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:51,910
You overdid it with the broadcast station work and the New Truth church investigation.  Why don't you take this opportunity to get some rest?

326
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,070
I just need one day to recover for something as trivial as appendicitis.

327
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,230
Let me see.  Mom told you not to eat candy, didn't I?

328
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,670
Really, I am telling you I didn't eat candy.

329
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,640
Look.

330
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,530
You really didn't eat?

331
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,530
- You... if you keep eating candy, your teeth will rot. 
 - Okay.

332
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,230
Boss would know...

333
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,670
I won't eat, okay?  I won't eat.

334
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,930
Why are you cooking chicken?

335
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,900
I was thinking about making chicken yukhoe to eat.

336
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,530
It must have looked good when Detective Kim Mooyoung was eating the chicken yukhoe.

337
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,120
Kim Mooyoung?  That... In front of the detective office?

338
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,270
Do you know a bit about Kim Mooyoung?

339
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,690
It's Gangrim City Teol-Sa-Mo.

340
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,570
Seol-Sa-Mo?

341
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,170
No, Teol... Sa... Mo.

342
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,830
- What is Teol-Sa-Mo? 
 - Beard Lovers Association.

343
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,290
Why would you love that?

344
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,330
Look!  There it is.

345
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,550
Is it "War for the Planet of the Apes"?

346
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,760

347
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,220
Wow.  All the beards look the same.  I can't tell the difference.

348
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,550
They all look the same?  There, he is in the middle.  In the middle.

349
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,260
- This one?
 - That's right!

350
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,020
This probably was the first and last time.

351
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,750
He was shy so I had to keep bugging him to come.

352
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,930
It's already been a few months.

353
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,250
Anyway, here you go.

354
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,260
Here.  Interest.

355
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,800
This month's interest.

356
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,660
Nowadays, with the business being slow, when am I going to pay it all back?...

357
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,560
If it weren't for this job of collecting interests, we wouldn't be able to survive either.

358
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,910
Dad!

359
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,930
Come here.

360
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,800
Brother, pay starting next month.

361
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,050
Cute child.

362
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
Don't misunderstand me.

363
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
It's not because I have any good intentions but rather due to an unavoidable circumstance, I need to take care the matter.

364
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,810
We can't keep Hodoo here anymore?

365
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:16,170
Taking care of someone means that you are responsible for that person.

366
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,350
Mister, are you going somewhere far?

367
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,560
You are coming back, right?  I like you.

368
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,440
It's late.  A young kid should get home early.

369
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,290
Joonwoo.

370
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,320
Hodoo?

371
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,370
Yeah.  Dad said I could keep him but mom said never.

372
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:03,140
What do you think?

373
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,210
Well, if you want it, I am on your side.

374
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:17,640
- Joonwoo, did you just now say bye to the detective?
  - Yeah.

375
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,630
Did he say anything about where he was going?

376
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:24,170
 I don't know.  He just went down.

377
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,660
I see.

378
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,880
Okay.

379
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,640
Miss, you can't go out yet.

380
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,240
Where did he go?

381
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,240

382
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,000
Did he save my number as "crap"?

383
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,920
Excuse us.  We will be conducting a check.

384
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,660
Sure.

385
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,190
Excuse me.  I am Gangrim City Police Lieutenant Oh Geum Tae.

386
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,070
We are conducting a check because there was a report of a suspicious person nearby.

387
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,930
We ask for your cooperation in confirming your identification.

388
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,660
Could I see your ID, please?

389
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,060
What's going on?

390
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,120
It's because the police received a report of a suspicious person.

391
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,660
Can I see your ID, please?

392
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,490
Thank you.

393
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,530
Can I see your ID, please?

394
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,230

395
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,080
Mr. Kim Mooyoung?

396
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,680
Yes.

397
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,230
You are Mr. Kim Mooyoung, right?

398
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,940
Yes.

399
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,360
It seems the photo didn't come out very well.

400
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,170
By any chance, do you have another form of identification?

401
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,810
A different form of identification...

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,240
 Boss!

403
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,450
Why did you leave your phone?

404
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,060
Writer Kong.

405
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,550
Detective Oh.

406
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,420
Do you know each other?

407
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,470
He's my boss.

408
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,670
He left in a hurry because he had a meeting with a client.

409
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,700
He even left his phone.

410
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,860
Here you go.

411
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,920
But are you feeling okay?

412
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,540
This is nothing.

413
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,580
You two must be looking for someone.

414
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,060
We had a report come in so we were conducting a check.

415
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,630
How did you know to come here?

416
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,030
Your phone... The search history showed this bus terminal.

417
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,870
Why did you look through my handphone?

418
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,060
Anyway, why did you come here?

419
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,020
We still have unfinished business.

420
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,910
It looks tasty!

421
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,120
So, that part-timer...

422
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,120
is you?

423
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:20,900
No wonder he looked familiar.

424
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,470
President even worked as a part-timer?

425
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,440
That is... He was working undercover.

426
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
You know how detectives sometimes work undercover and hide their identities, right?

427
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,590
Of course, I know.

428
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,090
Then, what about the intestines?

429
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,500
Why did he eat it raw?

430
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,850
That's because... there are so many stores involved in the illegal distribution of intestines nowadays.

431
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,200
Really?!

432
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,600
Old or bad intestines...

433
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,140
That's why he was personally examining and tasting.

434
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,190
Ah, please don't misunderstand me.  The intestines here were in very good condition.

435
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,310
Of course.

436
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,770
You are a total professional.  I had no idea.

437
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,500
Please excuse my behavior.

438
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,340
There is no need.

439
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,130
Oh my!  He is so cool.

440
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,080
Please eat a lot.

441
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,460
Eat a lot.

442
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,490
Okay.  I will eat well.

443
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,030
It looks so good.

444
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,960
I promised I'd treat you to beef tripe if you caught the cult.

445
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,280
You're okay with having a meal with me even though you know who I am?

446
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,440
If you were going to eat me, you would've done it a long time ago.

447
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,600
And I'm sorry about yesterday.

448
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,960
I didn't know you were trying to save me and I got the wrong idea.

449
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,420
Don't be sorry. I didn't eat you because your appendix was infected.

450
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,100
According to Joonwoo, you even returned Hodoo in one piece.

451
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,700
Why didn't you eat him?

452
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,630
What could I gain from eating that small mutt?

453
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,280
You're a very thoughtful zombie.

454
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,210
You don't eat things with names.

455
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,030
Or is it that you're very affectionate?

456
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,270
No matter how hungry I am, I'll get sick if I just eat whatever.

457
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,290
I'm also careful about what I eat. I stick to sanitary foods.

458
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,550
Let's just eat. You must be hungry, right?

459
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,520
I've been starving since yesterday.

460
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,850
This is delicious.

461
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,360
You have zero courtesy.

462
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,230
Oh right. You only eat it raw.

463
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,920
Excuse me!  Two servings of beef tripe and a bottle of soju!

464
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,210
Bring the beef tripe uncooked, please!

465
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:57,050
Wait!  Why do you even like beef tripe stew when you can't eat it?

466
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,480
I don't know.  For some reason, I wanted to see it myself in person.

467
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,440
Here it is.

468
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,650
Wait. We'll cook it ourselves.

469
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,690
Okay, then.

470
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,650
This one's on the house.

471
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,220
Thanks!

472
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,150
It's pointless to eat alone.

473
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,130

474
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,080
Is it okay for you to drink that much soju?

475
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,320
Your appendix burst and your face looks like it's bleeding.

476
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,060
You must not know this because you're a zombie.

477
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,890
Alcohol is a disinfectant.

478
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,370
Don't be ridiculous.

479
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,630
When you opened your eyes after you died, you were a zombie?

480
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,070
You must've had a mental breakdown.

481
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,870
You think that was it? I was so freaking shocked.

482
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,230
I wondered why something like this would happen to me.

483
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,120
 No matter how much I walked, my path was endless.

484
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,910
 To me, life and death were no different.

485
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:07,160
 Unlike humans, I couldn't even pick between the two.

486
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,140
Because that is the fate of a zombie.

487
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,940
It must have been scary, lonely, and intense.

488
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,310
Boss, can't you just stay here a bit longer?

489
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,800
It's not like you have anywhere to go.

490
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,720
I will never tell a soul.

491
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,700
From what I saw, being a detective is perfect for you.

492
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,770
You're fated to be one.

493
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,580
On top of that, you have your special superpower.

494
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,270
Your nose.

495
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:50,010
Come on, you know. In the movies, those characters with a defect

496
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,490
always think of themselves as monsters.

497
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,400
But to other people, they are heroes!

498
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,170
They save people who are in danger!

499
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,840
I think you could be like that.

500
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,390
A hero.

501
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:09,520
Someone who needs your superpower is out there, somewhere.

502
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,430
I have no intention to be of help to humans.

503
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,360
I'll help you recollect your past.

504
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,250
What?

505
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,500
There's a limit to what you can do on your own.

506
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,070
You could be caught for your faked identity, like today.

507
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,330
Your true identity could also be revealed.

508
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,290
What do you say?

509
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:41,850
Didn't you come down here because you wanted to know your past?

510
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:47,010
"Who am I? Why did I die?"

511
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:55,170
"By any chance, could there be a family that's waiting for me?"

512
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,660
Didn't you want to know these things?

513
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,690
I'll help you.

514
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,380
Is this sympathy and curiosity?

515
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,760
Let's say I'm nosy.

516
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,650
Don't you know what I am?

517
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,180
I'm a z-zombie.

518
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,430
So, what if you're a zombie?

519
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,670
Even zombies were humans before they died.

520
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,910
Okay, fine. But I have one condition.

521
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,540
Business partners?

522
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,870
When I saw you taking down that cult leader last time,

523
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,570
you were fine after getting hit.

524
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,610
Just add an extra desk and chair in your office for me.

525
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:57,470
Why exactly do you want to be a detective? Just go do that broadcast work you're good at.

526
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,330
That's...

527
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,240
Being a writer for a broadcast show is good, too.

528
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,210
But solving cases behind the scenes

529
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,320
seems to be more up my alley.

530
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,720
There's a thrill to it, too.

531
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,950
Intern.

532
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,790
You don't trust me and want to test me out more?

533
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,280
It's not that I don't trust you, I don't trust humans.

534
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,380
Full-time worker in a month.

535
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,000
- Three months. 
 - One and a half.

536
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,490
- Fine, two months. 
 - Four major insurances included, of course.

537
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,050
But working overtime is a given.

538
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,800
Deal.

539
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:53,190
Boss, will you be able to go back to being a human if you remember your past?

540
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,930
I don't know.

541
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,500
I'm not sure, but... What the hell?

542
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,160
I told you to go easy on the drinking.

543
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,820
 I want to believe that I can go back.

544
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,050
What is this?

545
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,890
It's the living fees I pushed back until now. You can keep the extra.

546
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,190
Where did you get this money?

547
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,840
I got a job.

548
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,060
What insane person would hire you?

549
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,040
Was it that detective agency?

550
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,740
It was. But not only that,

551
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,300
I also have the four major insurance benefit.

552
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,290
A detective agency? Isn't that work dangerous?

553
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,920
Come on. You think broadcast work wasn't dangerous?

554
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,190
You put your life on the line for every job.

555
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:59,290
He swept NewTruth.

556
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,900
He must be an expert.

557
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,860
Congrats.

558
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,720
Thank you.

559
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,970
Hold on.

560
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:14,160
Hey, do you want more rice?

561
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,070
The rice cooker is empty.

562
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,770
You need to eat up to work hard.

563
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,370
You have to eat to work.

564
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,150
True.

565
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,970
Honey, I have no rice.

566
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,020
You said just looking at my face makes you full.

567
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,810
That's why I don't really look at your face.

568
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,190
You little... Hey!

569
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,190
That mouth of yours, gosh. I'm letting it go because I'm in a good mood, Husband.

570
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,010
I feel so happy, my Sunji!

571
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:49,550
My son, I'm so happy today! How nice!

572
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,330
Hello! I am the high-quality intern, Kong Sunji!

573
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:58,200
I look forward to working with you for the next month!

574
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,780
Should I put these in the refrigerator?

575
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,920
I think erasing the beard will be easier.

576
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,240
Right?

577
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:56,610
Then, let's erase it.

578
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,460

Why isn't this erasing?

579
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:06,100
It's not like I can use a razor. You try.

580
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,120
It's not working.

581
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,040
Something's weird. Something's off.

582
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,900
I, Lee Sungrok, can feel it.

583
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,040
Feel what?

584
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,500
I don't know, either.

585
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,160
I just feel something.

586
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:31,340
Scrub harder.

587
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,220
Damn it.

588
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,160
How does he even eat this flavorless raw chicken?

589
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,460
You've never tried seasoned or fried chicken, have you?

590
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,650
It might actually fit your taste buds.

591
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:56,900
I'm not eating it for the taste. I'm eating it because I'm hungry.

592
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,840
If I'm even a little hungry, I begin to lose control.

593
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,310
And if I lose control, I don't know how far I'll go.

594
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,970
That's just like me.

595
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,790
When I'm hungry, I also get sensitive and don't know how far I'll go.

596
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,400
We should both be careful.

597
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:25,930
Why do you love beef tripe stew the most when you can't even eat it?

598
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,870
Because it's the one food that helps you overcome your zombie urges?

599
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,450
Or because you enjoyed it

600
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,530
before you became a zombie?

601
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,710
It's too bad.

602
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,560
Beef tripe stew is freaking delicious.

603
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,530
Woah.

604
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,260
A zombie uses an electric toothbrush?

605
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,420
Don't touch my toothbrush. Just clean.

606
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,870
- Go. 
 - Okay.

607
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:17,310
Woah, that's crazy. How is this so clean?

608
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,460
Do you usually have a clean personality?

609
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,820
Or did you just dislike dirty things after becoming a zombie?

610
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,450
I don't know. Just clean.

611
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:37,880
Boss, there's something I'm really curious about. Can I ask just one more question?

612
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,300
What? What is it?

613
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,840
Do you relieve yourself?

614
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,040
Have you ever used a bidet?

615
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,980
Just go. I'll give you these flyers so you can hand them out, Ms. Intern.

616
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,800
I was just really curious—

617
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,140
Here's your jacket, and go straight home.

618
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,880
- Do not return, and please just go home. Understand? 
 - I just wanted to know...

619
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,460
Gosh, she's driving me totally crazy.

620
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,420
Being a zombie's no big deal.

621
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,000
He eats, sleeps, and poops. He's no different than a human.

622
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,850

623
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,620
Is she selling the flyers and using the money to pay the debt?

624
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,140
Wow, she really is a force to be reckoned with.

625
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,810
Boss?

626
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:44,360
Boss?

627
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,440
Detective Kim, can you pass me the ball?

628
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,280
 What does this troublesome human want?

629
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,160
That rude brat.

630
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,760
Ouch.

631
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,910
Why does a guy's slap sting so much?

632
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,440
That's what I'm saying!

633
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,430
He took these and just flicked them all over the place.

634
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,610
They hit my bone!

635
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,520
So where is he?

636
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,100
I don't know.

637
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,650
He came from hell,

638
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,940
so I suppose he went back.

639
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,690
Wow, that was awesome.

640
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,860

641
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,810
About Detective Kim Mooyoung, even if we don't reveal his identity,

642
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,280
shouldn't we still thank him?

643
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,910
He helped us get New Truth.

644
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,720
Isn't Detective Kim Mooyoung the person Writer Kong is working for?

645
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,950
Yes, I think she was officially hired.

646
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:24,070
I looked into Detective Kim.

647
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,970

648
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,000
Excuse me.

649
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:48,910
 Since things turned out this way, as Crap said,

650
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,000
 I should earn money as a detective while I try to remember my past.

651
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:59,390
Oh, there's a 50% discount, right?

652
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,900
Of course. The sale ends today.

653
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,580
We need to have a business for me to even ask for a bonus.

654
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,570
Welcome.

655
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:25,320
Aren't you the owner of the tripe stew restaurant?

656
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,020
Someone broke the window of my restaurant!

657
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,270
Restaurant window?

658
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,400
I haven't paid back the loan for my restaurant, yet.

659
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,200
In order for me to pay it back, I have to clean, cut, and grill the intestines all day long.

660
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,590
I have to do that for years...

661
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:41,910
for me to be able to pay off the loan.

662
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,920
That jerk who scratched up my precious restaurant...

663
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,630
wait until I catch him...

664
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,920
Is that ball perhaps...

665
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,690
Yes, it was this soccer ball.

666
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:59,190
I searched this entire neighborhood but couldn't find him so I ended up coming here...

667
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,650
Teol-Sa-Mo.

668
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:03,750
Do you know who it is?

669
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,710
The culprit who broke Owner Kim's restaurant window is...

670
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,660
none other than... Kim Moo—

671
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,390
I can't find it!  I can't find the ball anywhere!

672
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,450
Owner Kim, what brings you here?

673
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,060
What is this?

674
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,500
Uh, the soccer ball?  Did it fly all the way there?

675
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,310
I looked for it for a long time.

676
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,750
Was this soccer ball... yours?

677
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,320
Yeah, it's mine.  I bought a new one this time.

678
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,110
I am thinking about growing a beard and joining the morning soccer association.

679
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,400
Maybe not.  Is this neighborhood too small for me to play soccer?

680
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,490
I am a world-class you know.

681
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,750
Don't I look like Ahn Junghwan? 
   (T/N: former soccer player)

682
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,760
Pretty awesome, aren't I?

683
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,600
Oh, you startled me!

684
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:42,660
With this, let's call it even.

685
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,820
What was that?  Why did she do that?

686
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,910
With that soccer ball, you apparently broke the restaurant's window.

687
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,450
That window is as precious as her blood since the loan has not yet been paid off.

688
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,570
You know that it was Kim Mooyoung who did that!

689
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,180
That Kim Mooyoung, that punk!

690
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,280
Boss, did you just see?

691
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,520
See what?

692
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,970
I am talking about a Korean dream.

693
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,210
He should be thankful that I stopped there.

694
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:27,970
 The second year of being a zombie, for the first time since I came down to the human world,

695
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,370
 I bought clothes with the money I earned on my own.

696
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,660
♫   and you go for yourself   ♫

697
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,240
♫   you move   ♫

698
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,680
 Is this what you call symbiosis?

699
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,900
 That's right.  What's wrong with being a zombie?

700
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,890
♫   Now take it kinda slow   ♫

701
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,100
♫   with a whole lot of soul   ♫

702
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,580
 Until death, a zombie was a human, too; no different than everyone else.

703
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,970
♫   make it last   ♫

704
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,200
♫   Now come on, baby,   ♫

705
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,880
♫   now get into your slide   ♫

706
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,730
♫   you gonna ride, ride   ♫

707
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:09,480
Hello.  It's Mooyoung Detective Office.

708
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,610
Hello.  It's Mooyoung Detective Office.  Please visit any time if you need us.

709
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:17,790
It's Mooyoung Detective Office.  Please call us any time if you need us.

710
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,820
Yay, all done!

711
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,760
Joonwoo!

712
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,790
Auntie!

713
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:26,600
Are you all done with school?

714
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,510
Why are you kids so down?

715
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:31,820
We had a spelling test today.

716
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,180
Joonwoo, he got 30 on the test.

717
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:38,400
I got 5 points more.  I got 35 on the test.

718
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,640
Our Joonwoo, you did well if you got 30 points!

719
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,400
Your mom, when she was your age, never got more than 30 points on tests.

720
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,700
- Really? 
 - Yes, really.

721
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,010
Then, can we play just one game?

722
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,080
 Please!

723
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,950
 Please!

724
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:02,320
Just one game, then.

725
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,840
- Fast! 
 - You have to shoot fast!

726
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,510
There!  There, it's coming!

727
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,380
Hurry up and kill!

728
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,930
- Hurry! 
 - Next to it!

729
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,550
Kill!  Kill!

730
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,440
Hurry!  Hurry!

731
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,360
Yay!

732
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,150
Joonwoo, you are ready. Right?

733
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,440
Good luck, Joonwoo!

734
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,600
Yay!

735
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,690
Ready!

736
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,400
Oh, yay!

737
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,500
Joonwoo!  Kill it!

738
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,860
What's wrong, Auntie?

739
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,600
I can't shoot.

740
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,080
Why not?

741
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:16,680
How can I shoot them when they are struggling like that to survive?

742
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,100
I can't do it!  I can never shoot them!

743
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,330
You kids, look.  Do you know how difficult it is for them to take each step?

744
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,390
Even if they walk like that all day long, they can only walk 5 meters.

745
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,630
You kids don't know how short of a distance 5 meters is, do you?

746
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,620
That's right.  Stay alive.

747
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:39,330
In this tough world, for sure stay alive!

748
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,290
Do it!

749
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,760
Hello?

750
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,250
Where are you?

751
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,030
Me?

752
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:54,200
In front of the Kim Mooyoung Office.

753
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,400
Right now?

754
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,660
Hey, wait... wait.  I will be right there.

755
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,580
- Joonwoo, I have to go first so you go home. Okay? 
 - Okay.

756
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,180
- Be careful getting home. 
 - Okay.

757
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,880
Who... might you be?

758
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,620
The door was left open so...

759
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,240
President Kim Mooyoung?

760
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,640
Yes, I am.

761
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,300
I am Cha Dohyun from Gangrim Police Violent Crimes Unit.

762
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:37,430
It looks like you mostly look for missing persons.

763
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:39,230
Yes.

764
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,600
I heard a lot about you from Sunji.

765
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,800
That you were a big help for the New Truth church investigation.

766
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,480
I should've come earlier to thank you.  I am sorry.

767
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,560
Not at all.

768
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,980
Detective Kim... Moo... Young.

769
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,020
Are you really Kim Mooyoung?

770
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,030
What are you talking about?

771
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,840
You...

772
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:23,590
I am asking if you are the real Kim Mooyoung.

773
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:38,830

774
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:44,070

775
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:48,520
 Would there be a mother who is waiting for me to return?

776
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,420
 I thought it was quite for a while... At this rate...

777
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:52,490
 Boss... your eyes...

778
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,010
 Would he even eat a human?

779
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,430
 Kim Mooyoung, the more I dig, it seems that there is something fishy about him.

780
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,590
 There definitely is something he is hiding.

781
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,570
 Did your memory come back for sure now?

782
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:08,230
 Yes, all my memory came back so don't even mention the word "memory" in front of me!

783
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,320
 Okay.

784
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,230
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.
