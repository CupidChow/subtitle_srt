1
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,050

2
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,510

3
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,100
It might help you get your memory back.

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,370
On Christmas Day, we planned something.

5
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,640
You and me, just the two of us.

6
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,230
What do you mean "planned something"?

7
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,650
You really don't remember that day?

8
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,680
That girl, either?

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,940
The one who kidnapped her,

10
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,280
killed her and planned everything was you, Brother.

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,590
Don't talk bullshit!

12
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,520
And you are the one who took the corpse to the reservoir.

13
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,830
I just followed your orders.

14
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,210
If it weren't for you, that girl could have lived.

15
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:40,550
Because of you, things got all messed up and my life was even more ruined!

16
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,390
Do you know that?!

17
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,160
That's not possible.

18
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,120
It's not that you don't remember but you don't want to remember.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,470
You said that everything will get resolved if we had the girl.

20
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,250
You killed that girl.

21
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,750
If it weren't for you, that girl could have gone back to her family and lived.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,500
Why did you do that?!  Why?!

23
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,970
 Please save me.

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,520
 Please save me.

25
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,690
 No! No way!

26
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,810
 That's not possible.

27
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,500
 I kidnapped and killed her?

28
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,060
 That's not possible.

29
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,030
I know you are having a hard time.  It can't be easy to accept.

30
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,010
Then, why did I do that?

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,850
It was to save that poor girl.

32
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,260
"Save"?

33
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,420
Although, in the end, you weren't able to.

34
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,590
Because of you, because she died...

35
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,050
Brother, but still, it's really fortunate.

36
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,750
I am really happy that you are back.

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,230
I really thought you were dead.

38
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,760
Just in case,  I am telling you

39
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,790
it would be best if you don't think about doing anything rash.

40
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,860
Someone losing their life... Once is enough, isn't it?

41
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,880
You wouldn't want that and the same goes for me.

42
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,180
♫  My old memories that the film broke  ♫

43
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,240
 Waking up as a zombie

44
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,650
 was a terrible nightmare for me.

45
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,830
♫  I don't kneel  ♫

46
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,780
 Even so, the reason why I didn't give up until now was

47
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,300
 the hope that I could become a human.

48
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:06,790
♫   I'll never hurt you again   ♫

49
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,210
♫  Even if everyone leaves my side  ♫

50
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,970

♫  Even if there is no one, I'll be okay  ♫

51
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,400
♫  Even if there is no one, I'll be okay  ♫

52
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,790
I even found his past so I am going to ask for a bonus.

53
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,420
Hurry up and answer.  Hurry.

54
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,960

55
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,810
 But to humans, I am just a monster.

56
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,400
 Your call cannot be completed...

57
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,700
Why isn't he answering?

58
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,040
 Kong Sunji.

59
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,010
Hey, Cha Dohyun!  What are you doing here?

60
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,760
You were on your way home, right?  Get in.

61
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,410
Woah, good timing!

62
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,560
Did something good happen?  You seem to be in a good mood.

63
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,190
Something good did happen, of course.

64
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,420
I am in a good mood so go ahead and eat anything you want.  This big sister will treat you.

65
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,640
So, what are you going to buy for me?

66
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,270
- Anything.  Anything you want to eat. 
 - Get in.

67
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,250
Okay, let's eat.

68
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,030
- What is that? 
  - Whoa!

69
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,430
There you go.

70
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,620
By the way, how did you know about that rabbit toy?

71
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,250
Ah, that?

72
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,530
Yeah, it wasn't found at the crime scene or at the residence.

73
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,900
I received a tip.  A tip.

74
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,020
- A tip? 
 - Yeah.

75
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,060
From whom?

76
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,510
I can't reveal that but I will tell you about the tip when it becomes more certain.

77
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,980
We were lucky during the Lee Gwangsik investigation, but this time it's different.

78
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,450
He kidnapped a little girl and killed her, and he even attacked the eyewitness.

79
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,950
What I am saying is you never know when, where, or whom he might attack.

80
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,800
That's why I will tell you when it becomes a certainty.

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,430
You know it too that I jump to conclusions too often.

82
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,660
We can't waste governmental power.

83
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,540
You are going to tell me first, okay?

84
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,700
Stop nagging and just eat the rice cake.

85
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,070
Ah, hot!

86
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,480
Is it hot?  I am sorry.

87
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,030
Hey, this...

88
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,870
First, eat the heart.

89
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,160
Then, chives and kimchi,

90
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,170
and intestine rolled together.  That's how you eat it to get the right flavor.

91
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,770
- Amazing! 
 - Right?

92
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,180
Hey, wipe.  Wipe your mouth.

93
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,740
Your boss, is he very busy?

94
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,940
I haven't seen him all day.

95
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah, I am curious where and what he is doing now, too.

96
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
Your boss, how is it that a man can have such beautiful skin?

97
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,330
It's not this-worldly skin.

98
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,310
It's glossy like porcelain.

99
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,600
I really like men with good skin.

100
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,530
It's because he uses BB cream.  He is subtle about it but he maintains himself.

101
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,110
On top of that, that feral attractiveness...

102
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,180
making me want to tame him as soon as possible...

103
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,620
should I say a beastly man?

104
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,070
True, he is a real beastly man.

105
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,620
Acknowledged.

106
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,400
Ah, why am I so thirsty?

107
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,430
Wow, you must have been really thirsty.

108
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,390
Would one glass be enough?

109
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,130
Yura, one more refreshing beer here!

110
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,570
Yeah, you are the only one who takes care of me, Bora!

111
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,060
Nowadays, the business at the restaurant has gone down.

112
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,350
The food must not be tasty.  Go ahead and order anything you want to eat.

113
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,530
It's my treat today!

114
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,740
Cheers!

115
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,580
 I was a human who deserved to die.

116
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:06,650
 Maybe because that death wasn't enough, I became a zombie; a living dead.

117
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:12,730
 Now that I know about my rotten past, I don't want to continue living even for a moment.

118
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,130
 To a zombie, the brain is fatal.

119
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,470
What?

120
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,990
Ah, what the heck?!

121
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,820
 A zombie can't die even if he wants to.

122
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,070
 Damn!

123
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,830

124
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,210
 I boiled the potatoes for a long time so—

125
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,410
Where is Brother-in-Law?

126
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,840
He was already out when I woke up.

127
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,700
He's probably wasting his time looking for investors.

128
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,580
He should really give up and look for a different job.

129
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,040
Why would he give up?

130
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,930
Right, Joonwoo?

131
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,520
Yeah, the kids told me that Dad's movie is really fun.

132
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,130
Of course!

133
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,420
Brother-in-Law is too far ahead of his time.

134
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,620
But he is never behind the times.

135
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,430
So?

136
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,580
So, he should continue with the movie—

137
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,770
No, what I am saying is that it's good if he keeps in step with the times.

138
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,120
He should keep in step with the times but...

139
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,690
where did he go so early in the morning?

140
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,570
Good morning!

141
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,490
Did he not come in last night either?

142
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,400
Just great.

143
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,300
Did he go out to work on his own?

144
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,750
Chickens are still here, too.

145
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,990

146
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,980

147
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,970

148
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,300
I wonder if something happened.

149
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
Why would Mr. Hyungchul...

150
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,430
♫ Flowers blooming ♫

151
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,590
♫ Dongbak Island, spring ♫

152
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,410
The fact that Kim Mooyoung has asked for help of Lee Sungrok

153
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,870
needs to spread all over Gangrim City.

154
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,300
So happy!

155
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,180
♫ The cold mist is surrounding me ♫

156
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,080
♫ It surrounds me.  I am praying for my skin to improve ♫

157
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,610
- ♫ I pray... ♫ 
 - Hey! Hey!

158
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,050
Why are you spraying that precious water on your face?  Are you a plant or something?

159
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,270
Are you a weed?

160
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,380
Boss, don't you know mist?

161
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,310
Skin needs to be maintained starting in your 20s.

162
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,200
You will need to maintain more.  Let me see.

163
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,280
Mist.

164
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,690

165
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,240
What is this?  She works for Detective Kim.

166
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,380
Did you come to the wrong place?  Kim Mooyoung Office is across the street.

167
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,330
You took this picture, didn't you?

168
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,210
No.

169
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,390
I haven't seen this before.

170
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,720
The corner, here.

171
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,260

172
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,780
- Pumpkin seeds. 
 - Wow!

173
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,160
You really have good eyes.

174
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,190
You don't know how to be professional!

175
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,450
My boss asked you to do it, didn't he?

176
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,660
Why did you take pictures of Mr. Hyungchul?

177
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,460
We can't reveal a client's private information.

178
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,190
Moreover, I, Lee Sungrok, cannot disregard the belief that I kept for 20 years as a detective.

179
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,000
So...

180
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,130
So, you can't tell me.

181
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,720
That's right.  Go.

182
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,190
Perhaps, you know what shot put is.

183
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,270
I know.  Go.

184
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,730
I learned to shot put some time ago.

185
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,250
It is very scary...

186
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,900
- Ppa!  Do this then— 
 - Ah, that startled me!

187
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,290
- Ah!  Like this— 
 - Oh, geez!

188
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,100
- Ah!  Like this— 
 - Ah, geez...

189
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,020
She is even more of a nutcase than we had expected.

190
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,130
Hey, do you think we will talk just because you behave like that?!

191
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,440
To be honest, Oh Hyungchul took the lighter so—

192
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,500
- Like a professional! 
 - I am sorry.

193
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,500
Did you say "lighter"?

194
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,720

195
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,200
Why in the world would Mr. Hyungchul? That means Boss knew something as well.

196
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,260
 When did you say he was attacked by the culprit?

197
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,980
 It's been about two weeks.

198
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,030
 It would be best if you are careful around him.

199
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,810
Then, why didn't he tell me?

200
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,110
Bora, let me ask you for a favor.

201
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,830
I want to check on someone's medical records.

202
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,210

203
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,560
 Let's bury a zombie's bones here.

204
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,500

205
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,800
- Mister, you can't enter! 
 - Okay.

206
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,900
Don't you know about restricted entry?!

207
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,900
 Be it a zombie or a human,

208
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,800
 nothing in life goes my way.

209
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,780
 Sir!  Sir!

210
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,020
You are President Kim Mooyoung, aren't you?

211
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,680
- Sir? 
 - No, I am not.

212
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,390
- You are my sister-in-law's boss, aren't you? 
 - No, I am not.

213
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,470
I can't be mistaken.  I saw for sure.

214
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,630
I can't be wrong.  You are!

215
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,300
- I saw just now.  You are! 
 - No, I am not.

216
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,270
You are.  Ahh!!!

217
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,600
S-Sir?

218
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,370
Did you perhaps...

219
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,130
get beat up by my sister-in-law?  The bruise on your eye...

220
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,670
I put on some disguise for infiltration purposes.

221
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,560
Ah, I was surprised.

222
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
I am sorry about that.

223
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,930
To be honest, I came here for work.

224
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,890
What kind of—

225
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,600
This is a secret but since you and I seem to understand each other well,

226
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,260
I can tell you that a zombie lives in this mountain.

227
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,250
Others say it's a fantasy or make-believe, but I believe that a zombie exists in reality.

228
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,250
In our neighborhood no less.

229
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,030
 Hey, it's in front of you now.

230
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,870
So, you need to be careful too, Sir.

231
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,920
You can't just roam around the mountain alone like this.

232
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,960
A hungry zombie has an appetite big enough to eat a grown man in one sitting.

233
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,890
Ah, I see.

234
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,730
Please remember.

235
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,040
I am busy so...

236
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,860
- I will be going. 
 - Sure.

237
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,030
He must've gotten scared.  I will stop by the office next time.

238
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,360
Sure.

239
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,230
- But that's the wrong way down, Sir.  It's this way.
 - Ah, there is a shortcut here.

240
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,630
- That's to the mountain. 
 - Yes, I know.

241
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,790
 I better look for another mountain.

242
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,240

243
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,660
 You are now even ignoring KakaoTalk (Korean chat app)?

244
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,050
 I am going now to meet Mr. Hyungchul.

245
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,330
Oh Hyungchul?

246
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,890
 It would be best if you don't think about doing anything rash.

247
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,310
 Someone losing their life... once is enough, isn't it?

248
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,130
 Your call cannot be completed...

249
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,720
He's damn lucky.

250
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,250
To be alive even after getting shot...

251
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,800
What are you going to do with it?

252
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,780
I was thinking about doing some house repairs.

253
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,750
Soon, it will be the rainy season.  I should prepare early.

254
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:59,330
But the guy who came here yesterday... He's the one, right?

255
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,890
Who?

256
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,890
You know, you said that he was dead.

257
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,240
He's not?

258
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,250
He is dead.

259
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,000
So, you don't need to concern yourself.

260
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,730
Is someone here?

261
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,370
Hello, we met last time.

262
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,810
Is Mr. Hyungchul inside?

263
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,990
- Well... 
 - I have something to tell him.

264
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,150
It'll only take a moment.

265
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,250
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

266
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,600
You were home.

267
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,420
There was something I wanted to tell you in person.

268
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,630
It won't take long. Just five minutes.

269
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,370
Sure. Come in, this way.

270
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry for appearing out of the blue without notice.

271
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,530
I just wanted to tell you this in person.

272
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,500
What is it?

273
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,920
I received a tip on the Santa case.

274
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,420
A tip?

275
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,970
Yes. I met the informant in person and he seemed reliable.

276
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,790
He saw what happened to you

277
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,470
and wanted to catch the culprit

278
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,870
and found courage.

279
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,240
I'm very grateful.

280
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,370
The day Sori was abducted,

281
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,130
a car filmed the culprit on the dashcam.

282
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,250
I brought it so we could watch it together.

283
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,170
I thought you might remember something if you watched it, too.

284
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,290
What about the police?

285
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,860
Come on.

286
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,390
The broadcast station has to release this before we tell them.

287
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,060
I suffered so much while investigating

288
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,680
this Santa case.

289
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,570
I see.

290
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,690
Your arm must be feeling better.

291
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,720
I heard you fractured it.

292
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,310
Yes, it improved a lot.

293
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,450
It can move more easily.

294
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,310
Hyungchul, are you hiding something from me?

295
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,660
- Excuse me? 
 - I looked into your medical report.

296
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,600
According to the doctor, it wasn't a fracture but a stab wound.

297
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,310
Why are you wearing a cast?

298
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,030
What are you trying to imply?

299
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,940
I thought you quit your job as a writer

300
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,890
and began work at a detective agency.

301
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,440
Are you saying I lied?

302
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,980
Ma'am! Please call the police, now!

303
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,280
What's going on? What's happening?

304
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,020
I'll tell you, but please call the police first!

305
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,960
Writer Kong, open the door. This is all a misunderstanding.

306
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,780
What's going on?

307
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,770
I don't know what you heard from your boss,

308
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,360
but it's not what you think, so open the door.

309
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,660
 Writer Kong!

310
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,640
What's going on? Did my husband do something wrong?

311
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,530
I'll explain everything to you later, so please call the police already!

312
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,760
Quickly!

313
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,900
You found out.

314
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,270
What?

315
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,650
Are you okay?

316
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,690
She's not dead, is she?

317
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,430
I'm sorry, Writer Kong.

318
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,320
I wasn't trying to fool you on purpose.

319
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,290
Things just ended up this way.

320
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:05,600
The day of the interview, you asked me to tell you what happened.

321
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,870
The face I saw at the reservoir that day...

322
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,140
How could I forget it?

323
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,060
For the past year, I haven't forgotten it once.

324
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,940
I see it every day.

325
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,390
If only you hadn't come to us asking for an interview,

326
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,320
then things wouldn't have gotten this bad.

327
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,210
Do you know how stressed I was?

328
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,640
My wife...

329
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,210
just did what I told her to.

330
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,900
You don't believe me again.

331
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,060
She figured everything out. What now?

332
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,380
I'm thinking about it.

333
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,890
What if it splatters everywhere?

334
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,610
Should we spread plastic wrap on the floor?

335
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,660
Is this alive?

336
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
It's dead.

337
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,020
I know.

338
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,810
You should go before the sun sets.

339
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,840
A travel bag should be good enough, right?

340
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,610
Yeah.

341
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,340
Buy the biggest one.

342
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,150
So the strap doesn't break as you're moving her like what happened last time.

343
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:50,090
Seriously, Mother.

344
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,750
Don't touch that with your hands, you can't even eat it.

345
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,170
It's okay. Eat something else.

346
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,410
Eat up.

347
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,180
 Take your time and drink some water.

348
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,850
I'll get going, then.

349
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,080
Mom, keep eating. Okay?

350
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,130
There's no choice. We have to live, too.

351
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,410
Hurts, right?

352
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,040
It hurt for me, too.

353
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,220
Where do you think you're going?

354
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,590
Help!

355
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,950
Someone help me!

356
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:41,940
Boss.

357
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,730
Are you okay?

358
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,320
You knew from the start, didn't you, Boss?

359
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,900
Why didn't you tell me?

360
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,300
 Did this human also...

361
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,620
 know everything?

362
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,140
Hyungchul...

363
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,480
No.

364
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,660
Oh Hyungchul was Santa.

365
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,770
 So was I.

366
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,200
His wife was an accomplice, too.

367
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,020
Someone had requested you to look for Sori.

368
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,320
What's that supposed to mean? A request?

369
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,680
Sori's father had employed you.

370
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,760
You were a private bodyguard.

371
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,760
That's why you were excluded from the case investigation.

372
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,420
I didn't even know.

373
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,750
I let a murderer speak on the broadcast.

374
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,430
Let's first go to the hospital.  Get treated first then we can talk.

375
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,260
No, I'm okay.

376
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,770
I have many years of investigative reporting experience.

377
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,860
If I don't have the guts to handle this, I wouldn't be Kong Sunji.

378
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,330
Your forehead is bleeding, you dummy.

379
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,700
What?

380
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:41,180
Kong Sunji,

381
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,350
wake up!

382
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,250
Kong Sunji!

383
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,540
Ah, that's right.  I forgot.

384
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,880
Just a minute.

385
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,850
Where are you going?

386
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,450
Please let me go!

387
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,710
Let go!

388
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,320
Are you okay?

389
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,510
You forgot that you were going to tell me first?

390
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:32,000
Why would you go in there?  What if something went wrong?

391
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,810
Ah, my head.

392
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,110
Kim Gyeongmi was arrested without warrant.

393
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,990
Oh Hyungchul is on the run.

394
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:40,780
You have to catch him.  You have to.

395
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,710
We will, no matter what.

396
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,560
Get some rest.

397
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,910
When you are feeling better, I will come back.

398
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,150
Boss, how about Boss?

399
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,260
He was with me for sure...

400
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,350
I didn't see him.

401
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,180
Bye.

402
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,510
You think being a detective gives you the right?

403
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,740
Someone almost died.   A person.

404
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,460
People like you do all sorts of dirty jobs to make money so you may not care,

405
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,290
but her...

406
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,550
Sunji, she's not like you.

407
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,730
I am warning you.

408
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,970
From now on, don't come near Sunji!

409
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,660
Got it?

410
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,270
You don't have to worry about that.

411
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,040
But what about the favor I asked you?

412
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,850
I talked to the family.

413
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,320
Thank you.

414
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,550
No need to thank me.

415
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,760
I didn't do it for you.  I did it for Sunji.

416
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,670
I shouldn't just sit here like this.

417
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,710
What is this?

418
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,050
 Do you really have to go this far?

419
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,000
 Didn't you hear?  Detective Cha said if she leaves here, she will get into trouble again.

420
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,320
Sis!

421
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,750
Sis, open the door!

422
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,530
 Sis!

423
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,940
I am sorry.

424
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,250
My hair!

425
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,180
Sorry.

426
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,890
- That was my hair. 
- Sorry about that.

427
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,270
Ms. Kim Gyeongmi, you know where Oh Hyungchul is headed now, don't you?

428
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,160
You should answer fast, for your husband's sake as well.

429
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,690
Got it?!

430
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,460
Hey!

431
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,160
Do you have any idea what you two have done?!

432
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,930
You killed a little girl.

433
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,470
You call yourselves humans?!

434
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,020
Let go!

435
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,160
Because of people like you, this world is getting rotten.

436
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,720
You are worse than an animal!

437
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,200
 On December 25, 2018,

438
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,390
 wearing a Santa outfit, he kidnapped and killed Miss Kim Sori.

439
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,710
 The leading suspect of the "Santa" kidnapping case...

440
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,840
 He lied to me?

441
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,590
 Oh Hyungchul was the culprit of the "Santa" case.

442
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,200
 His wife was an accomplice.

443
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,370
 The one who kidnapped her,

444
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,210
 killed her, and planned everything was you, Brother.

445
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,140
 The police are, with the nearby CCTV...

446
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,030
Mom! Mom!

447
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,690
My daughter, you want to go get something yummy?

448
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,790
 You were asked to find Sori.

449
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,790
 If it weren't for you,

450
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,010
 that girl could have gone back to her family and lived.

451
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,660
 There is something that I am missing.

452
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,690
 What could it be?

453
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,240
Hello.

454
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,970
I told you not to think about doing anything rash!

455
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,970
But you provoked me?

456
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,800
Do you want to see me really go crazy?!

457
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,350
Tell me.

458
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,610
What it is that you are hiding from me?

459
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,100
What happened on that day?

460
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,230
Do you want to know?  Do you want the truth?

461
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,670
 I told you.

462
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,540
Someone losing their life...

463
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,850
that one time is enough.

464
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,220
I said tell me.

465
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,860
For you, until the end, I really—

466
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,610
Where are you?

467
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:03,560
I should have killed him for sure that time.

468
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:12,020
Senior, they found Oh Hyungchul's car at a crossroad in the direction of Chowol Mountain.

469
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,610
Team Leader.

470
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,190
I will take care of the rest so go now.

471
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,810
Let's go.

472
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,920
Hey, where—

473
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,460
I think something must have happened in Gangrim City.

474
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
Search it up.

475
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,900
Not done yet?

476
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,850
I can talk

477
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,970
but I am still not used to writing, so please understand.

478
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,750
At the time of kidnapping,

479
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,830
Ms. Kim Gyeongmi,

480
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,090
you were at the scene, weren't you?

481
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,180
You should talk!  Talk!

482
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,820
It looks like something definitely blew up in Gangrim City.

483
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,220
Team Leader!

484
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,560
- What brings you here? 
 - Did something blow up?

485
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,380
No, it's nothing.

486
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,060
This lady...

487
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,900
Yeah, it's her.  This lady...

488
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,890
Do you know her?

489
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,290
Sure, I know her.

490
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:46,080
What's going on?

491
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,060
That's what I want to know but she won't open up.

492
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,660
Name: Kim Gyeongmi, Age: 28, Blood Type: O.

493
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,950
Zodiac sign: Libra, Favorite food: pancakes.

494
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,660
Favorite singer: Song Gain.  Ah, apparently it recently changed to Lee Myungmoo.

495
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,210
She went to the same elementary school as her husband Oh Hyungchul.  They didn't register for marriage.

496
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,400
They just remain in a trivial relationship.

497
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,630
Ah, and according to Gangrim beauty salon regular Mrs. Choi,

498
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,000
they can't conceive.

499
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,230
- But after checking on their marital relationship— 
 - Stop!

500
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,460
Unable to conceive?

501
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:28,170
We tried to raise her well.

502
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,990
You were going to raise the kidnapped child as your own?

503
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,310
Did Oh Hyungchul suggest it?

504
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,950
Kidnapping the girl, after watching the broadcast?!

505
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,200
He really is a pitiful person.

506
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,640
Come out.  Come out and talk.

507
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,620
Brother, do you know that?

508
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:14,140
I never planned the perfect crime the world talks about.

509
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,030
I planned the perfect life instead.

510
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,030
I said come out.

511
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:23,900
After losing something precious, you learn...

512
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,960
 that what I had was very precious.

513
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,910
That my life wasn't all that bad.

514
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,890
Where are you?

515
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,810
What was precious to me was family.

516
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,670
But today... I lost another family member.

517
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:50,360
 This time, I really wanted to live well. If it weren't for you,

518
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,050
 if only you hadn't shown up...

519
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,380
 You said you wanted to know the truth, didn't you?

520
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,620
 It's my gift to you.

521
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,440
Dying...

522
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,960
would be better than living.

523
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,530
 Sori, what do you want for Christmas?

524
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,100
 Dad.

525
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,690
 Sori must have missed Dad a lot.

526
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,200
 This Christmas, your dad will for sure play with you.

527
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,640
 Really, Mister?

528
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,400
 Of course!

529
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,270
 MIster, please save me.

530
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:11,120
 Sori!

531
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,480
 Please save me.

532
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,920
 Please save me.

533
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,900
 Blood doesn't flow through me, but it feels like it's boiling.

534
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,540
 I have no heart but it feels like my heart is heating up.

535
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:51,920
 This was my end as a human?

536
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,610
Mom, it's all over.

537
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:25,390
We will be living a new life.

538
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,400
You and I are the only family left.

539
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,000
We have to live depending on each other.

540
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,520
Understand?

541
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,590
How?

542
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,410
Why did you do that?

543
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,400
Why?

544
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,560
Why? Why?!

545
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,750
Your memory must have come back.

546
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,940
How could you kill that innocent little girl?

547
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:15,410
If you hadn't come looking for her,

548
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,900
she and I could have lived happily.

549
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,210
- What? 
 - I wanted to be her real dad.

550
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,790
It was Christmas Day.

551
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,630
The day that all children have waited for.  Christmas.

552
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:32,980
This crazy—

553
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,150
What a damn awesome revenge!

554
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:08,840
Mom, let's go now.

555
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,750
Mom.

556
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,300
Let's go now.

557
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,940
It's all over.

558
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,360
Mom, let's go.

559
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,710
Mom, let's go.

560
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,780
What are you?

561
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,180
Today, you and I,

562
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,490
will go to hell together.

563
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,800
Why don't you die?!

564
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,560
Why?  Because you killed me a year ago.

565
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,610
Die!

566
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,720
I said die!

567
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,040
Why don't you die?!  Why?!

568
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,240
Are you all right?

569
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,170
It's you.

570
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:06,440
My Minho.

571
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,940
 Minho.

572
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,590
  Jang Minho, hurry up and get up.

573
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:15,200
 Hurry up and get up.

574
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,400
 Why is he like this?

575
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,620
 Why is your face like this?

576
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,700
  Did you get into a fight again?

577
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,370
 Let me be.

578
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,890
 How long are you going to keep getting into fights? How long?

579
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,540
 Leave me alone, Mom.

580
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:30,410
 Get a hold of yourself.

581
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,790
 Are you learning sports just to get into fights?

582
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,840
 You should get a job or do something.

583
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,720
 That damn job!

584
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,640
 Mom, if I make lots of money, I will have you sit on a cushion made of money.

585
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,140
 Forget the cushion.  I will make a blanket filled with  ₩50,000 bills for you.

586
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,740
 Okay?

587
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:56,070
 If you get a job and say something like that, it would at least make me feel good.

588
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:56,970
 Job...

589
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:01,210
 Just get up and eat.  I made your favorite, tripe stew.

590
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,660
 Tripe stew?

591
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,240
 Madame Kim's tripe stew is the best tasting in the world for me.

592
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,040
 Let's go.

593
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,110
 What are we going to do about these on your good-looking face?

594
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,430
 You will get scars.

595
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:19,470
You will get scars.

596
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,710
My son.

597
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:26,160
Why, Mom?

598
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,540
Mom. Mom!

599
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,560
Mom!

600
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,020
Mom, here.  Mom!

601
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,050
Mom!

602
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,770
Mom!

603
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,970
Mom.

604
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,220
Mom, open your eyes!

605
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,710
Mom! Mom! Mom!

606
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,100
Mom. Mom.

607
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,640
Mom. Mom.

608
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,420
His family all died in a fire when he was seven years old.

609
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,870
Only Oh Hyungchul survived.

610
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:06,070
It happened to be on Christmas Day.

611
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:10,230
Mom.

612
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,800
Mom.

613
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,420
Mom.

614
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:49,700
I heard that she had a biological son but where is he?  How is it that your boss is the chief mourner for the family?

615
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,200
His character seems superior.  He is a good person.

616
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:15,850
It reminds me of my mom who died when I was young.

617
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:21,530
I was too young so I don't remember much.

618
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,600
Let's bow.

619
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:04,110

620
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,230
Thank you for coming all the way here.  Please drink up.

621
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,580
It pooped in front of my house.

622
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,430
If it's fighting with Hodoo, that little dog...

623
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,510
Let's go for a second round. There is a karaoke nearby, right?

624
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,450
What now?!

625
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,740
Why did you gather all the delivery ladies from the neighborhood?

626
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,670
A funeral hall

627
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,770
needs to be packed like this.

628
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,420
Every Christmas,

629
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:54,270
you became the Santa in place of Sori's dad.

630
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,660
Last year was the only time you couldn't go because your mother was sick.

631
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,890
I told you...

632
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,810
that you are a good person.

633
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:19,990

634
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,480
Brother-in-Law, thank you for coming today.

635
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,390
Of course, I should come to any sad event.

636
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:35,450
But when you were tearing up talking about Mother-in-Law...

637
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,270
my heart ached.

638
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:41,840
Your sis would be the same, right?

639
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,010
 Breaking news.

640
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:47,370
 A corpse presumed to be that of Oh Hyungchul, the leading suspect of the "Santa" kidnapping case,

641
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,850
 was found at a hillside in Gangrim City.

642
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,540
 Based on the fact that Oh Hyungchul's ID was found on his body

643
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,560
 and the description is similar to when he was being pursued,

644
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,080
 the police is presuming that the corpse is that of Oh Hyungchul.

645
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,560
 However, since the corpse was badly damaged, accurate identification...

646
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,200
The corpse was damaged?

647
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,200
 Gangrim Police, investigating the case...

648
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,790
 will send the corpse to the National Forensic Services

649
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:15,870
 for DNA analysis to verify the identity and...

650
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:18,530
- Brother-in-Law, this... 
 - Hot!

651
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,260
I'm no longer a human.

652
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:09,880

653
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:14,570

654
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:20,180
 It seems that a zombie living among humans would not be possible.

655
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,040
 Zombies can never survive not eating humans.

656
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,180
 I need to get away from here as soon as possible.

657
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,430
 Congratulations Gangrim City's Number One!

658
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,860
 Boss!

659
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,570
 Mister, what's wrong?

660
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:38,490
 I also believe that love that does not put your life on the line is not love.

661
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:42,160
 I found a way to suppress zombie instincts.

662
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,240
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.

663
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,500
♫  Just once more  ♫

664
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,099
♫  My heart...  ♫
