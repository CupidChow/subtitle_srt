1
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,290
 A corpse presumed to be that of Oh Hyungchul, the leading suspect of the "Santa" kidnapping case,

2
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,860
 was found at a hillside in Gangrim City.

3
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,780
 And the fact that the description is similar to when he was being pursued,

4
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,400
 the police is presuming that the corpse is that of Oh Hyungchul.

5
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,900
 However, since the corpse was badly damaged, accurate identification...

6
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,360
The corpse was damaged?

7
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,670
- Brother-in-law, this— 
 - Hot!

8
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,280

9
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,660
Are you all right?

10
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,730
Yeah, I am okay.

11
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,080
Thanks for coming.

12
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,060
No need to thank me.  Of course, I should come.

13
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,690
- Boss— 
 - Don't come to work starting tomorrow.

14
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,840
What do you mean "don't come to work"?

15
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Since I found my past,

16
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,410
there is no need for you to come to work.

17
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,210
What about being human?

18
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,300
You said that you want to become human.

19
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,380
It's not like you become a human just because you go back to being Kang Minho.

20
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,320
So, you need to find a way to become human.

21
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,640
Becoming a human,

22
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,510
no longer has any meaning to me.

23
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,560
You've worked hard.

24
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,190
It's because of Oh Hyungchul, isn't it?

25
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,860
Until the end,

26
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,930
you said you were with Oh Hyungchul, didn't you?

27
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,440
I heard that the corpse was damaged.

28
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,730
You didn't by chance...

29
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,910
You didn't by chance... eat Oh Hyungchul,

30
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,840
did you?

31
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,330
What if...

32
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,030
What if I did?

33
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,230
I understand

34
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,360
how you resent and hate Oh Hyungchul,

35
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,460
but this isn't right.

36
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,700
How could you?

37
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,740
How could you eat...

38
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,300
a human?

39
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,960
Because I am a zombie.

40
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,980
 I need to get away from here as soon as possible.

41
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,610
 This isn't my money.

42
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,930
 It's the deceased Kim Mooyoung's money.

43
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,280
 They are not my clothes.

44
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,470
 They are the deceased Kim Mooyoung's clothes.

45
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,670
♫  Way down we go to find me  ♫

46
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,840
♫   I will never kneel again   ♫

47
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,270

♫   I'll never hurt you again   ♫

49
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,610
 I will erase

50
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,310
 all traces of me.

51
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,910
 Thanks to Kim Mooyoung,

52
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,540
 I found my past.

53
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,140
♫  Even if there is no one, I'll be okay  ♫

61
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,180
 Shoot!

62
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,400
How could he eat a human?

63
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,110
Human?

64
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,900
Does being a zombie make it okay?

65
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,470
He should endure it!  He said he wanted to become a human.  Then, he should endure!  Why can't he?!

66
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,410
Why?!  Why?!

67
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,780
What is wrong with your auntie?

68
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,520
Did she break up with her boyfriend?

69
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,990
My auntie doesn't have a boyfriend.

70
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,060
My grandma always looks at the sky and talks to herself, too.

71
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,350
- I worry about Aunt Sunji. 
 - Me, too.

72
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,430
What about me who worked my butt off to find his past?

73
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,320
Sense of betrayal...

74
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,440
- Yeah, Dohyun. 
 - Are you feeling better?

75
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,190
What about your office?

76
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,460
Your boss didn't say anything?

77
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,730
Don't talk about my boss.  It's unsettling.

78
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,360
Oh Hyungchul,

79
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,360
his autopsy report just came out.  It was a visceral rupture due to a gunshot.

80
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,010
Gunshot?

81
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,360
Then... Then,

82
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,590
the corpse didn't get damaged because someone ate it?

83
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,000
Ate it?  Who did?

84
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,950
 Your brother-in-law must be getting ideas for a new movie.

85
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,920
Why are you like this, too?

86
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,130
Oh Hyungchul died of excessive bleeding due to organ rupture.

87
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,720
  - Ah, damn!  
 - Hello.  Hey, Kong Sunji!  Hello?

88
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,780
Seeing that she is still at home, she didn't go to work...

89
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,390
Did Writer Kong get fired again?

90
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,590
I knew it.

91
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,910
I was wondering why she's still working, with that personality of hers.

92
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,780
What do you mean "fired"?  Working at that detective agency didn't suit her, to begin with.

93
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,030
Ah, I see.

94
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,420
What is this?  Why is the door locked?

95
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,500
Boss!

96
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,650
Boss!

97
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,850
Did he leave already?

98
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,590

Your call cannot be completed...

99
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:22,320
He should've just told me that he didn't eat a human.

100
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,340

101
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,880
 I told you not to come out.

102
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,660
 Be careful and don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.

103
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,010
 Ah, I got it!  Hurry up and go in.

104
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,980
Who are you?

105
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,990
I think I must have the wrong address.  I am sorry.

106
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,950
 Son.

107
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,230
 Son, it's cold outside, isn't it?  You must be hungry.  Let's go in.

108
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,260
 Where have you been that you only now show up?  Mom waited so long for you.

109
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,560
 I should have recognized her then.

110
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,380
 I found my past,

111
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,130
 but I am, once again,

112
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,130
 alone.

113
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,130
Aren't you getting up?!  Shouldn't you get up and go report it to the Labor Department,

114
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,130
or send them a certification of contents, or do something?!

115
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,820
I will take care of it.

116
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,990
What do you mean "you will take care of it"?!

117
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,580
He didn't give you any severance pay and gave you only a one- day notice!  You let him go on a power trip with your eyes wide open?!

118
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,650
- Are you a moron?! 
 - I will take care of it.

119
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,390
Where is that boss of yours?!  Wait until I see him!  I will pull all his hair out myself!

120
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,680
I got it!

121
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,080
I want to know where he is, too.

122
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,310
 ... does that even make sense?!

123
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,990
- He probably had a circumstance that he couldn't talk about— 
 - What circumstance?!

124
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:23,590
The rich ones bullshit more.

125
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,820
According to Madame Lee,

126
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,840
that office building might be his.

127
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,880
And you know that animal hospital next to it...

128
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,660
Apparently, he might be interested in investing in it, so he's been looking into it through the real estate office.

129
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,120
Invest?

130
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:51,180
That kind of person probably never had to worry about money.

 Boss!  Boss has to grill!

Congratulations!  Congratulations!

Who ate it all?  I did.

153
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,930
Ah, for Kim Mooyoung to disappear without a word like this...

154
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,670
Ah, but still!

155
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,790
I thought he might at least say farewell to me before leaving.  He is more fearful than he looks.

156
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,820
Detective Kim Mooyoung, what good is nice skin?  A man should have ambition.  Don't you agree?

157
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,610
Pale and drained of color like plaster...

158
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,680
Anyway, he didn't make a good first impression to begin with.

159
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,270
Wait a minute.

160
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,750
Then, what happens to the employee who used to shot put?

161
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,140
Wouldn't she have become unemployed?

162
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,690
She was a talent to covet.

163
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,940
- You don't have the money to pay her anyway. 
 - No, I don't.

164
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,280
I will just have to change the person who will receive the payment.

165
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,790
Just tell me what to do.  I will work diligently at everything.

166
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,700
Okay, I will see how you do.

167
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,600
For now, make that braised mackerel you said you are good at making for dinner.

168
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,510
Yes, Boss.

169
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,520
I won't go far to see you off.

170
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,990
Goodbye, Kim Mooyoung.

171
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,330
 I am digging up ants to eat.

172
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,520
 But it's not doing anything for my hunger.

173
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,270
 Had I known it was going to be like this, I should've at least brought some money.

174
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,970
 I smell something.

175
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,630
 The smell of live humans.

176
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,180
 Now that I think about it, on that day, too.

177
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,730
 What is this?

178
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,520
 What was I thinking just now?

179
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,120
 How could I

180
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,870
 have an appetite even for that rotten human?

181
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,090
 I am no longer

182
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,400
 a human.

183
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,110
 A zombie can never live not eating humans.

184
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,840
Last time,

185
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,480
you said that it's possible with substitute food.

186
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,060
For a while, it may be possible.

187
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,840
But it can't take away a zombie's instinct.

188
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,350
- Sister-in-Law, why do you think a zombie is a zombie?
 - Why?

189
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,300
He's a zombie because he eats humans.

190
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,420
Then...

191
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,150
a zombie

192
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,590
living among humans would be impossible, it seems.

193
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,300
It's not possible at all.  Look, Sister-in-Law.

194
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,130
In front of a zombie,

195
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,930
food is walking around on its two feet like this.

196
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,120
How could he not?  Can you not eat it?

197
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,560
Appetite is a natural instinct for all animals.

198
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,510
Anyway,

199
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,800
what kind of food would your boss like?

200
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,190
Tripe, especially tripe stew.

201
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,690
Tripe... Then he must like meat.

202
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,430
 I need to satisfy my hunger.  If I wait any longer,

203
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,830
 I don't know what might happen.

204
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,670
What is this?

205
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,210
What happened?

206
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,450
Why am I here again?

207
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,230
What is all this?

208
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,730
 I can't remember anything.

209
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:42,230
 How did I get here and what the heck happened?

210
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,800
What is wrong with this?

211
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,740
This smell.

212
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,640
Mr. Kim Mooyoung, let me owe you one last time.

213
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,810
- What brings you here? 
 - Hello, Sir.

214
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,690
I... I didn't do this.

215
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,970
Ah, that...

216
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,680
What happened to this?  I wonder what happened to the door.

217
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,060
I didn't do it...

218
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,560
I will just leave this here.  I stopped by just in case.

219
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,700
Sure enough, you are here.

220
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,800
I didn't want to come empty-handed so I brought something.  I heard you like meat.

221
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,470
The bulgogi at this place is the real deal.

222
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,190
If you don't want to go alone, I will go with you to eat.

223
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,750

224
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,040
Thank you.

225
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,160
But, what business...

226
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,090
My sister-in-law has been looking for you.

227
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:26,410
If it's about that, I am sorry.  But I couldn't help it—

228
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,190
I know it.  I am sure there was some circumstance you can't talk about.

229
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,120
The reason why I came here is not because of my sister-in-law.

230
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,540
It's because I wanted to have a closed-door conversation with you.

231
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,880
With me?

232
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,870
I would like to show you this.

233
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,250
What is this?

234
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,600
It's my soul.

235
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,080
Why your soul to me...

236
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,860
To be honest, I am actually looking for an investor.

237
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,090
 It's not my money.

238
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,000
 It's Kim Mooyoung's money.

239
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,280
I am sorry but I don't have any money.

240
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,500
Really?  Why not?

241
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,860
I am not saying that you should invest in my movie at all.  Don't feel pressured, please.

242
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,620
It's just that you and I seem to understand each other so well.

243
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,480
Especially when it comes to a zombie.

244
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,950
I had no other intention.

245
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,860
Then, I will try to take a look at this later.

246
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,620
I am busy so...

247
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,950
I am aware that you are busy.

248
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,200
That's why I prepared a short briefing about this scenario.

249
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,230
- That's not necessary.
 - A world battle to follow "Freddy vs. Jason."

250
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,400
A Korean-Chinese collaboration horror action movie.

251
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,130
The time is the late Joseon era.

252
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,110
 Yes, we have a paulownia wood coffin here!

253
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,540
 It's at an amazing price!

254
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,090
 An unprecedented sale!  For the first one!

255
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,610
 Sales at this countryside are so damn slow!

256
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,820
After attracting the corpses,

257
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,290
these women sold coffins to them.  They were known as the best con sisters of Joseon.

258
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,120
 Sis, would this sell?

259
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:26,120
 The best business in Joseon is real estate.

260
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,870
 There are so many corpses in Hanyang.

261
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,200
 We need to sell this to make a living.

262
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,920
 You don't know anything.

263
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,820
 - Sis, they are coming.
 - Where?

264
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,900
Finally, the first customer makes his appearance.

265
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,230
A corpse from Qing who studied overseas.  A Chinese zombie.

266
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,820
 A customer.  A customer.

267
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,330
 Dear customer!

268
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,450
 One, two.

269
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,610
 One,

270
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,260
 You have to jump when I say "one."

271
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,150
 One, one, one, one...

272
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,700
 One, one, one, one...

273
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,080
 Welcome, dear customer.

274
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:09,180
 Let's see if you have anything good for sale.

275
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,950
 Dear customer, it's too hard nowadays to buy your own place, isn't it?

276
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,490
 Don't you worry.

277
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,890
 I have just the coffin for you.

278
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,940
 To tell you what kind of coffin this is...

279
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,710
 What kind of coffin is this...

280
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,010
 - It has a good aroma because it is made of paulownia wood. 
 - Good aroma!

281
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,250
 - It also has a good ventilation in the summer. 
 - It's cool inside!

282
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,930
 - It's roomy and comfortable enough for you to even rotate yourself 360 degrees. 
 - That's right!

283
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,950
 And even this modern and vintage design.

284
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,760
 Okay, you are in luck!

285
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,000
 If you buy today, it's 50% off.

286
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000

287
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,990
 Coffin and a burial plot, a double!  Go!  Go!

288
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,540
At that time the talisman that's been sealing in the Chinese zombie flew away.

289
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,100
A crisis was coming.

290
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
 Why?

291
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,120
Fortunately for us, we have Master Youngan.

292
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,240
 Please don't worry.  I subdued him.

293
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,050
 Uh?  This isn't it.

294
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,320
 Are you all right?!

295
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,740
 What do I do?

296
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,800
Even Master Youngan fled and the Chinese zombie started to attack the sisters.

297
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,450
The only thing that humans can do against the Chinese zombie is...

298
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,890
to plug their nose.

299
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,390
Because if they don't breathe, the Chinese zombie can't find humans.

300
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,580
They were about to get eaten by the Chinese zombie...

301
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,640
Appearing at that time to save the women is the Joseon corpse zombie.

302
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,300
Why did the zombie appear?

303
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,420
Perhaps, to eat humans?

304
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,750
Eating is important too but getting his own place is more important.

305
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:23,060
Please note that this work reflects today's social issues.

306
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,560

307
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,490

308
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,000
A fight for a coffin between the Chinese zombie and Zombie.

309
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
It's the big match of the century.

310
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,120
Ah, who are you rooting for?

311
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,490
Of course... for Zombie.

312
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,540
I knew it!  It's a dip attack.

313
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,630

314
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,970
What is Zombie's weapon?

315
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,250
Zombie's weapon is patience.

316
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,860
Since he has neither feeling nor pain.

317
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,630
How is that a weapon?

318
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,290
Finally, they bite.

319
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,980
Zombie bit Chinese zombie, and Chinese zombie bit Zombie.

320
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,700
Zombie becomes Chinese zombie, and Chinese zombie becomes Zombie.

321
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,120
As they get infected, their bodies get exchanged.

322
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,180
 That zombie is totally my style.  Should I go for him?

323
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,030
 Woah!

324
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:55,550
 Last time you seduced that bachelor ghost and...

325
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,470
 This time it's a zombie? My goodness!

326
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,370
 You can eat off of dead people.

327
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,900
 You vicious wench.

328
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,370
Who would indeed become the owner of

329
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,780
this paulownia wood coffin?

330
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,390
 Did you see my hat?

331
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,960
 You cheap jerk!

332
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,320
 I left my hat...

333
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,120
 Is the atmosphere changing now?

334
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,570
Does this even have an ending?

335
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,530
It will end only when one of them dies but since both are corpse...

336
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,700

337
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,390
So it never ends.

338
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,870
In the end, Zombie ends up with the coffin after the fight with Chinese zombie.

339
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:05,260
But that coffin has a water leak and Zombie, who goes back to the sisters for an after service,

340
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,370
ends up falling in love with the younger sister.

341
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,470
What do you think?

342
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,610
I think the predictable romance is childish.

343
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,750
My... My soul must've been a bit light.

344
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,750
If you give me one more chance, I will come back with a different soul.

345
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,660
- That's ok— 
 - No, no.

346
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,010
No, I was lacking.

347
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,170
I will come back for sure.

348
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:39,140
Why don't you look elsewhere—

349
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,930
Why of all people does he come to me?

350
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,400
I shouldn't be here like this anyway.

351
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,170
My bag...

352
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,190
Mister, were you gone somewhere?

353
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,040
 What's with him now?

354
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,610
Can we give Hodoo a bath today?

355
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,960
Mister, what's wrong?

356
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,920
Not today.  Leave.

357
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,960
 What was I thinking again?

358
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,590

359
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,160
Where would I

360
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,660
find a job right now?

361
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,270
What's this?

362
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,450

363
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,990
Wow, only 5 years?

364
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,540
This kind of bastard needs to get a minimum of 50 years.

365
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,680
Because of jerks like these,

366
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,260
I can't stop being nosy.

367
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,760
Finally, he's gone.

368
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:38,560
Ah, that tripe smell... even all the way here.

369
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,000
You were here and what's more...

370
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,500
 What's with this human now?

371
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,450
...all alone.

372
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,180
 Why are there so many humans coming by this office?

373
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,640
I brought this for you.

374
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:59,080
I personally went down to the local area and had it flown here.

375
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,560
First-class Korean beef intestine.

376
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,240
 Even stronger than the tripe,

377
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,200
 is the human smell.

378
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,560
Just for one hour, with me—

379
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,300
 It's dangerous.

380
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,100
 I don't know what I might do if she stays any longer.

381
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,130
- Let's talk just for five minutes. 
   - This human is really asking for it.

382
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,430
We can have a profound conversation about tripe and...

383
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:25,520
If you want to live, please leave.

384
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,140
Are you saying that if I want to see you,

385
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,770
I have to put my life on the line.  Is that what you mean?

386
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,300
That's good.  I also think that love that does not put your life on the line

387
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,380
is not love.

388
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,810
Thank you.

389
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:54,960
President.

390
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,940
President...

391
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,430
She's so persistent!

392
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,760
Oh, look at him being shy.

393
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,100
Totally my style.

394
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:13,750
 I am leaving.

395
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,610
Soon, let's have a profound conversation—

396
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,940
Okay, Wang Wei, let's go.  What are you doing?

397
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,310
- Kim Mooyoung is back. 
 - What?!

398
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,310
Where?!

399
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,550
Where?!  Where?!

400
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,980

401
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,740
Ah, you surprised me!

402
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,090
You must be seeing things.  That's too bad, at a young age.

403
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,740
Kim Mooyoung is no longer in this Gangrim City.

404
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,440
So get a grip and follow me.

405
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,690
There is so much work we have to do from now.

406
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,570
Let's go, Wei.

407
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,040
A detective office is perfect for me...

408
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,280
It was fun working with Boss, too.

409
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,470

410
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,910
World King—

411
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,980
How about going worldwide with me, Lee Sungrok?

412
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,220
I am recruiting talent to grow as a global company.

413
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,060
You nut— I mean, I really like you.

414
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,070
Ouch!

415
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,300
I was in the middle of a conversation...

416
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,340
Kong Sunji!

417
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,720
Uh, Bora, why are you coming out from there?

418
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,460
Why?  I met your boss.

419
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,180
- My... My boss?  My boss is up there now? 
 - Yeah.

420
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,600
Yeah, he is so cute.

421
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,660
I will see you later.  See you later.

422
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,150
What was that?  The back of my head stings.

423
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,660
What is that?

424
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,460
He really doesn't know women.

425
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,680
♫   Since I have nothing to lose   ♫

426
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,210
Aren't you afraid?

427
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,860
You are crying?

428
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,640

429
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,770
Boss!

430
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,780
What are you doing here?

431
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,900
What about you, why are you here?

432
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,230
You made it seem like you would never return.

433
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,520
I came for a bit to get something I left behind.

434
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,870
Really just for a bit.

435
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,860
No way, did you come here to eat that chicken?!

436
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,320
No way!  Would I come all the way here to eat this chicken?

437
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,600
It would take a crazy punk to do something like that.  What nonsense!

438
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,610
It's trash.  Trash.

439
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,790
You didn't eat Oh Hyungchul, so why didn't you tell me the truth?

440
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,120
Did you do that on purpose? Because you don't want to work with me?

441
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,910
- Yes. 
 - What?

442
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,140
I did that on purpose because I don't want to work with you.

443
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,190
So, you are going to run away again?

444
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,920
Where are you going to go this time?

445
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,890
You can't enter the mountain because of the redevelopment.

446
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,300
Ah, are you going to the USA this time or something?

447
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,380
Well, since USA has so many zombie movies,

448
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,110
maybe you will get your right to live recognized to a degree there!

449
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,440
But do you know that?

450
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,030
USA allows gun use

451
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,100
so as soon as you get discovered, they will kill you!

452
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,510
Stop being nosy.

453
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,860
If you are with me, you will be put in danger as well.

454
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,500
So, you really are going to leave like this?!

455
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,820
It's for both of us.

456
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,440
 Where is that Boss jerk?

457
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,730
- S-Sis! 
 - I am glad you are here.

458
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,310
How dare you fire my sister without proper notice?

459
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,250
Cough up the severance pay,

460
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,130
or go with me right now to the Labor Department.

461
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,910
I will go and tell the entire country that you are a boss who goes on a power trip.

462
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,280
Wait!  Calm down first, please.

463
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,330
I said let's go to the Labor Department.  Let's go to the Labor Department!

464
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,760
It's a misunderstanding!  Misunderstanding!

465
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,920
- A misunderstanding? 
 - Yeah, it's a misunderstanding.  Let go of him.

466
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,410
 Both sisters are equally scary.

467
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,410
He didn't fire me.

468
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:56,040
He was on a business trip but I misunderstood.

469
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,050
Our office is back in business as well. Right, Boss?

470
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,520
- Yeah. 
 - Is that true?

471
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,830
Yes, in fact, I was on my way to work now.

472
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,690
He was on his way to work.

473
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,560
If anything happens, please give me a call.

474
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Employees' family members even get a discount. Right, Boss?

475
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,350
Yea... Yes, of course.  Twenty percent.

476
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,020
It's for sure, right?  So, you didn't get fired either, right?

477
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,650
How could you misunderstand something like that?!

478
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,540
I am sorry.  I misunderstood.

479
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,670
Please take good care of our Sunji.

480
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,110
Sis, go home.  I will be back soon.

481
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,680
Then, I will be going, President.

482
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,190
I will see you later.

483
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:55,420
She is the kind of person who would really go to the Labor Department...

484
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,360
If you must leave, then do it.

485
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,610
I won't stop you anymore.

486
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,210
I didn't eat Oh Hyungchul,

487
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,700
but it's true that I almost ate him.

488
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,890
Because I felt an appetite looking at him.

489
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,200
That's the reason why I can't become human.

490
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,800
Is that true?

491
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,640
I am afraid what might happen, too.

492
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,120
Because it feels like I am becoming a real zombie.

493
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,210
You help me.

494
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,890
I want to live, too.

495
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,850
Like you, like a human.

496
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,460
A zombie that feels an appetite when looking at a fellow human...

497
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,450
I really don't want to live like that.

498
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,620
So, I am asking you to help me.

499
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,050
♫   Way down we go   ♫

500
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:26,910
♫  Go find me  ♫

501
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,210
Train a zombie?

502
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,810
Sister-in-Law, aren't you too imaginative?

503
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,380
Why not?

504
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:40,090
Aggression and appetite can be controlled for sure.

505
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,920
That may be possible but how does a zombie understand a human?

506
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,410
Brother-in-Law, all animals

507
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,680
adapt to their environment.  Don't you know?

508
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,220
There is no reason why a zombie can't do it.

509
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,850
He can master the language by practicing pronunciation.

510
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,530
And correct his walk by using a running machine.  There is no reason why a zombie can't do it.

511
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,300
A running machine?

512
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:03,900
It seems that you are more positive

513
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,430
about zombies than me.

514
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,160
It's not completely impossible since there is nothing that cannot be accomplished with effort.

515
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,900
But think carefully.

516
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,670
Who can train a zombie?

517
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,270
Anything goes wrong, you get eaten.

518
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,980
That depends on who the zombie is.

519
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,640
Brother-in-Law, do you know?

520
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:35,430
It's not that a zombie doesn't understand humans.

521
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:39,340
It's just that humans don't try to listen to a zombie.

522
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,930
Okay.  Ah!

523
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,660
That's right.  Strangely, it makes sense.

524
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:55,750
Zombie and human...

525
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:05,360
There has to be a way.

526
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,080

527
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,620
Zombie...

528
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,320

529
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,480
What zombie can walk looking like number 11 by using a running machine?

530
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,510
Boss is rewriting zombie history.

531
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,470
So, he can probably do anything.

532
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,310
Anything.

533
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,780
He can do it.

534
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,790
Boss!

535
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:55,790
What is this?  Why bring Damn Great Profit all of a sudden?

536
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:59,430
I invited someone special for you.

537
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,110
Who?

538
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:14,230
This is my boss.  And you know this person, right?

539
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:18,490
Animal behavior expert, Veterinarian Seol Chaehyeon.

540
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,080
You must be the guardian?

541
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,600
Yes.

542
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,160
This is the one with problematic behavior, right?

543
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,100
Recently, shall I say his appetite has increased...

544
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,340
Aggression has gotten stronger, too...

545
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,620
So, there is the possibility of biting humans as well.

546
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,110
Let's see.

547
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,050
It's a male.

548
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:50,770
Yes, a male.

549
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,720
 Oddly, this is making me feel bad.

550
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,700
Aggression is never a problem solely of the dog.

551
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,310
It's a problem that arises in the relationship between the dog and the guardian.

552
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:03,940
That's why it's really important to form a tie.

553
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,010
A tie?

554
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,460
 In order to form a tie, trust for each other is really important.

555
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,860
 Going on a walk together is a good way, too.

556
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,620
 During a walk, it's possible to urinate and defecate as well.

557
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,680
 So in the process of taking care of that, a tie can be formed.

558
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,530
If you want to go to the bathroom, tell me.

559
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,250
You, really!

560
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,800
How many times have I told you that I am not an animal?

561
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,600
Him, walking on all four, and me, walking upright, how are we the same?

562
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,260
How dare you compare me to a dog?

563
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,200
I am stretching.  Stretching.

564
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,570
Don't think any weird thought.

565
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,160
Tell me if you want to go to the bathroom.

566
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,300
That...

567
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,750
 Building patience is the most important thing.

568
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,720
 That has to be controlled in order not to bite humans.

569
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,180
 Wait.  Wait.

570
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,130
 Wait.

571
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,010
Did you just talk informally to me?

572
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,520
In a way, it's a signal.   Shorter and stronger, better it is.

573
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,680
No, wait.

574
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,120
I am not doing this.

575
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,870
  I just won't eat.  I am not eating.

576
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,630
Where did she put the bank account book?

577
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,230
It was definitely here somewhere.

578
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,010
Where is it?

579
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,690

580
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,500
I found it.

581
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,570
 Wait.

582
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:03,140
Sister-in-Law, you weren't asleep?

583
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,400
Sister-in-Law, I need to use the account so I came out for a bit.

584
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,840
- Sit. 
 - Sit?

585
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,390
I am already sitting but you want me to sit down more?

586
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:15,630
I was going to tell your sister honestly.

587
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,000
I said you can't, didn't I?

588
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,320
You said I can't?  When did you tell me I can't?

589
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,290
I don't think I heard you say it.

590
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:24,560
 - Hand.  
 - Hand?

591
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,250
Hand?  Should I give it to you like this?

592
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:30,500
 - Hand.  
 - What, like this, then?

593
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,810
Are you going to just let this go if I hold them up like this?

594
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,400
Sister-in-Law, it's because I really think this work will hit it big.

595
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,850
So, please keep it a secret from your sister...

596
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,600
Sister-in-Law, where are you?

597
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,830
Quickly, hand.

598
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,930
 Hand.

599
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,070
Really!

600
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,330
She keeps talking informally...

601
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,160
 Hand.

602
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,700
 Hand.

603
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,460
 Did you think that I would do it?

604
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,900
Boss!  Boss!

605
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,620
Doing all kinds of things...

606
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,420

607
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,650

608
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,760
Did you look up the identity of the grandmother who lived with Oh Hyungchul?

609
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,370
Yes.

610
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:40,220
Her name is Kim Gyeongja.

611
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,870
What about the family?

612
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,530
She has a son but he cannot be reached.

613
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,610
According to people nearby, he has not been in contact for about a year.

614
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,580
It seems like a simple case of runaway...

615
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,310

616
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,410
Kang Minho?

617
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,550
- Just a minute. 
 - Sure.

618
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,060

619
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:16,670
What is this?  President Kim Mooyoung?

620
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,300
He really does look very similar, doesn't he?

621
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,330
I was so surprised when I saw this, too.

622
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,010
What about President Kim Mooyoung?

623
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,030
He's not President Kim Mooyoung, Senior.

624
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,760
He is.

625
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,410
Do you really have to go this far?

626
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,920
If you know your enemy and know yourself, you will be victorious a hundred times in a hundred battles.

627
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,890
You have to know yourself to win yourself.

628
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,210
And you are curious too, aren't you?

629
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:54,760
What happens when you lose your memory.

630
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,120
 I am curious how I look when I lose my memory.

631
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:04,070
From now, for exactly three days, everything will be recorded for 72 hours.

632
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,620
Just in case, I filled the refrigerator with raw chicken as well.  
  - But how could you...

633
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:24,550

634
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,110

635
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,610

636
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:32,610
What is that?  Isn't that Kim Mooyoung?

637
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,090
Why did he come back?

638
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,880
That's what I say.

639
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,700
What is that?  Was Kim Mooyoung into that kind of thing?

640
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,350
♫  All that I have is all that you've given me  ♫

641
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,860
No, you can't.  Kids shouldn't see this kind of thing.

642
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,070
What?  She lowered the blind!

643
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,130
I can't see!

644
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,840
I am so curious!

645
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,890
During the day!

646
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,650
Are you all right?!

647
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,050
I am okay so far.

648
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,520
If you are going to sleep, just go home and sleep.

649
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,030
I didn't sleep.

650
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:21,280
Didn't sleep?  Bullshit!

651
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,260

652
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,790
Cha Dohyun, what are you doing here?!

653
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:35,040
Didn't you stop working?

654
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,420
Ah, I am working again.

655
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,340
Apparently, he can't run the place without me.

656
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:45,520
Your boss is not the problem.  It's you.

657
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,200
But what brings you here?

658
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,110
I was going to meet your boss.

659
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,750
Boss?  Why?

660
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,820
- I have some questions for him. 
 - What questions?

661
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,670
You don't need to know.  I need to confirm something for myself.

662
00:52:57,670 --> 00:53:00,300
- He's inside, right? 
 - No!

663
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,180
He's not here.

664
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,800
Where did he go?

665
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,720
- He's on a business trip. 
 - Business trip? 
 - Yeah.

666
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,000
To the USA.

667
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,630
The USA?

668
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,810
It's global nowadays, you know, the world is...

669
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,980
What...

670
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:16,450
Why would a detective go to the USA?

671
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:19,500
There are lots of accidents in the USA, too.

672
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,400
He'll be okay, won't he?

673
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,700

674
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:09,240

675
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,800
Boss?

676
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,250
It hasn't even been 2 days...

677
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:37,690

678
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,870

679
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:23,820
Don't... Don't come near.

680
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,110
Wa-Wait!

681
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,160
Good.

682
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,720
Good.

683
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:45,080
I said don't come!

684
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,220
Boss.

685
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,450
Boss, are you all right?

686
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,010
Did I hit him too hard?

687
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,960
Are you awake?

688
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,880
What? What happened?

689
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,930
Don't worry.  You didn't eat humans.

690
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,890
Why?

691
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:48,540
So, your plain face looks like this.

692
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,620
So, what?

693
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,090
I can't return you to being a human,

694
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:01,450
but I did find a way to suppress your zombie instinct.

695
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:03,230
What is that?

696
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,270
You!  Did you by chance, with this—

697
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:16,010
Hit me and now—

698
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,380
They say the back of the head is fatal for a zombie.

699
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,180
And you tried to get 100 million won from me as a settlement?

700
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,930
You are totally a con character!

701
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,620
At that time... well... ah...

702
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,710
The back of my head is already flat as it is...

703
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,780
Boss, I will ask you just one question.

704
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,630
Did you mean it when you said you want to become a human?

705
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,960
Yeah.

706
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:02,190
Then, let's keep running this detective office.

707
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:07,070
Find a way to become a human and live like a human.

708
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,270
One who needs to be punished, one who needs help...

709
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,920
and one who lost his life...

710
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,950
It's the work of this detective office to help this kind of people, isn't it?

711
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,070
Until now, of all the peo—

712
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:30,770
Of all the living beings I've seen, you were the most worthy of being called a human.

713
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:40,040
The way I see, staying here at this detective office is the safest.

714
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:46,900
For you... and other humans as well.

715
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,810
Don't you agree?

716
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,890

717
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,860
 Don't push me.  I said don't push!

718
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:26,990
Hey, hear me out!

719
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,210
 I am not the conman.  That detective punk is!

720
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,920
And getting hit by a car,

721
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,930
or getting stabbed with a cane, they're all fake.  Fake!

722
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,440
Kim Mooyoung or that detective, or whatever, investigate him first!

723
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,630
 Hurry up and relay my message!

724
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,600
 Detective Kim Mooyoung.

725
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,100
Did you just say "Detective Kim Mooyoung"?

726
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,830
Yes.  If I did?

727
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,120
 Come out 3715!

728
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,280

729
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:40,610

730
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:56,200

731
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,620
Kim Mooyoung is alive...

732
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,120

733
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,600
♫  One step with you, should I get farther away?  ♫

734
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,500
♫  I might hurt you without knowing  ♫

735
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,090

736
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,080
 This is Kim Mooyoung.

737
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,850
 It seems that it's my turn to pay you back.

738
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,920
 Mr. Kang Minho, I recently saw a man who looks exactly like you.

739
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,860
 He is not human.  He is a monster.

740
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,000
 Hyungnim, what brings you here?!

741
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,430
 - Sungrok.
 - Yes, Hyungnim.

742
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,670
 You will need to do a job for me.

743
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,530
 There is a path, but it's a path that cannot be taken.

744
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,960
 Even so, if there is a path, please let me know.

745
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,260
 What are you, a monster or something?  Somebody help!!!

746
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,150
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.
