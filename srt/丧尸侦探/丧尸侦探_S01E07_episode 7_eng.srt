1
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,280
 It's a human smell.

2
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:04,630

3
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,550
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

4
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,220
No!

5
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,270
What are you guys doing here?

6
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,630
Detective Kim.

7
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,740

8
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,090

9
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,050
What the heck did you come in here for?

10
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,200
Since we are in the same business, we just stopped by to have some chicken yukhoe (T/N: raw meat served like sashimi)

11
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,980
and soju together.

12
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,000
 Detective Kim, are you in there?

13
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,280
 It doesn't seem like anyone is inside.

14
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,370
 No.

15
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,620
 You bad punk.

16
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,330
 Detective Kim, the door is open.

17
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,690
 I am coming in.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,160
 I am inside.

19
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,150
 Detective Kim must be out somewhere.

20
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,750
 What are you doing, not coming in?

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,910
 What are you doing going in there?  It's trespassing you know.

22
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,100
 Like you said, I should apologize for the hate comments about Detective Kim

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,280
 and try to get along well with him now.

24
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,730
 Hurry up and come in!

25
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,700
 You are the who opened the door anyway.

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,520
 The yukhoe will spoil.

27
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,650
 This is definitely bigger than our office.

28
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,830
 The secret to maintaining a muscular body must be chicken.

29
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,430
 It's filled with raw chicken. The condition here is better than our office.

30
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,070
 Detective Kim!  Hey, hide!

31
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,290
Should I say it's the sixth sense of this great detective Lee Sungrok?

32
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,930
When that person walked into  the office, I had a feeling.

33
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,570
"Ah, this man is not Kim Mooyoung!"

34
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,120
That this definitely is an outsider.

35
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,230
Then, did you see that man's face?

36
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,780
That is...

37
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,490
Even though he had a hat on, the jaw—

38
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,710
What the heck are you doing now?

39
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:56,450
Detective Kim, are you curious about who he is?

40
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,470
If you are curious...

41
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,330
Wang Wei.

42
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,230

43
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,640
Come visit our World King Detective Agency.

44
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,100
Gangrim City number one detective agency, World King Detective Agency.

45
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,340
I, Lee Sungrok, will be waiting.

46
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,590
Since you are in the same business, I will give you a 5% discount.

47
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,650
Please understand.  He is like this because he is 29 years old.

48
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,740
Really.

49
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,190
Wow, to have a detective ask for help from another detective?!

50
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,880
You really are amazing!

51
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,140
This is what you call "There is a flying guy above the running guy." (T/N: There is always someone better than you.)

52
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,390
I, the flying Lee Sungrok, am above the running Kim Mooyoung.

53
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,340
You just wait.  Kim Mooyoung will for sure come to see me.

54
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,260
I think Detective Kim doesn't plan on coming at all.

55
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,630
Was five percent too little?

56
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,190
Maybe I should have told him that I will give him a 10% discount?

57
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,490
Detective Kim Mooyoung has his pride to consider, doesn't he?

58
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,820
That's it, right?

59
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,080
If he follows us out right away, it wouldn't look good. Right?

60
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,280
Should we wait a little longer?

61
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,420
 Why did he take only the lighter?

62
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,240
 Could it be that he is someone who knows my past?

63
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,710
My son, since today's your birthday, should we have a pork belly dinner party?

64
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes, sounds good, Mom.

65
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,550
Thanks to my son, I will get to eat some meat fat.

66
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,540
Our Joonwoo, if there is anything you want, let me know.  I will buy you anything you want.

67
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,740
Really?

68
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,010
Auntie, you are the best!

69
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,980
I am off to work.

70
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,130
Sister-in-Law, fighting!

71
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,460
- Fighting!  Bba-sae!
 - Ay, bba-sae! 
   (T/N: from DJ Hanmin's Show Me Your BBA SAE, has a similar meaning as fighting!)

72
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,510
- Stop with your crazy nonsense.  Hey, get home early, okay?! 
  - Okay!

73
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,360
Later, I am going to invite Detective Cha as well.

74
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,830
- Why? 
 - Before her boss decides to go for her,

75
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,940
I need to get Detective Cha and Sunji together.

76
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,800
I am sure Sister-in-Law will take care of everything on her own.

77
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,860
Do what on her own?

78
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,060
Sunji doesn't have any sense.  How would she take care of things on her own?

79
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,280
Especially at a time like this, you need to help them move things along.

80
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,400
You make sure to act accordingly as well, got it?

81
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,040
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,870
Son, invite lots of friends to your birthday party, okay?

83
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,630
I will make lots of tasty food.

84
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,360
Do you want to dance with Mom, too?  Try, like this.

85
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,580
Nice.

86
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,940
I don't think dancing is for you.

87
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,120
You look like a jellyfish.  A jellyfish.

88
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,190
- That's enough. 
 - I am sorry.

89
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,210
Good morning—

90
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,010
What is all this?

91
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,180
I don't know, either.  There was a theft last night.

92
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,740
What do you mean "theft"?  What's there to even take here?

93
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,400
He only took the lighter.

94
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,720
The lighter?

95
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,100
But, why?  Who would?

96
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,280
I don't know, either.

97
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,040
How about any smell?  Was there any unusual smell?

98
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,850
I am not sure.

99
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,390
Wiretapping?  Did you just say "wiretapping"?

100
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,450
Then, did you really think that I brought over the chicken yukhoe as an apology?

101
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,400
Wait. Why would he take Kim Mooyoung's lighter?

102
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,410
Was it expensive?

103
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,040
Or limited edition?

104
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,570
Is it a cherished item of his?

105
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,220
No more wiretapping.

106
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,430
There's nothing you can't do. Hand it over.

107
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,190
I swore to my mother that I would never do anything illegal in Korea.

108
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,560
That's to your mother, not mine. Give it!

109
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,970
Standing by quietly is illegal, too. If you keep this up, I'll report this to the police.

110
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,180
What kind of dirt could an amazing man like Detective Kim Mooyoung possibly have?

111
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,200
Amazing? Amazing?

112
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,990
Wow, you must be kidding me. Amazing?

113
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,730
You're calling him amazing because he caught one wild boar?

114
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,950
Didn't I tell you about my prime years when I fought against a tiger with my bare hands?

115
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,470
As I was trying to roll away from his claws, I got scratched.

116
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,300
I got a scar from that here. Look!

117
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,390
It's this scar right here! The tiger scar, you punk!

118
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,430
You said you got that from falling over when you were drunk.

119
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,260
I forgot! It's up here.

120
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,120
There's a scar on my right shoulder. This is the tiger scar.

121
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,610
Hey, one month ago, you said you didn't remember what happened when you were drunk.

122
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,380
But you remember me telling you this?

123
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,010
It's not like you can go to work with that injured arm.

124
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,620
We're living paycheck to paycheck. After what happened to you,

125
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,340
they should have compensated you at least.

126
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,550
It makes me so mad.

127
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,560
So why did you agree to the interview and get yourself into that mess?

128
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,830
- You found the lighter? 
 - What?

129
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,740
It was in my clothes.

130
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,750
See? I told you to look carefully.

131
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,470
You need to get your head on straight.

132
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,180
Thank you, Mister.

133
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,510
Hello!

134
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,980
You're back again?

135
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,470
How is the chairman?

136
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,280
I told him, but he said he doesn't wish to meet with any broadcast stations.

137
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,210
After what happened to his daughter, it's no surprise.

138
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,500
Yes, I fully understand.

139
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,900
He'll be back in two days.

140
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,720
Perhaps you can stop by for a while.

141
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,500
Thank you. Thank you.

142
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,770
If you knew about the rabbit doll that wasn't in the investigative reports,

143
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,050
you might have known Sori personally and met her.

144
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,140
So I could have some sort of relationship with her father.

145
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,920
Right!

146
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,650
What kind of person is Sori's father?

147
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,680
A year ago, we received a tip that he was laundering slush funds through international business,

148
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,070
smuggling contraband, and relaying and procuring goods illegally.

149
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,570
To sum it up, at home, he was a man who would do anything for his daughter.

150
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,050
But outside, he was a cold man.

151
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,970
He must have had a lot of enemies.

152
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,050
Of course. He even requested protection from Interpol.

153
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,600
Although it didn't work out.

154
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,980
What is it?

155
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,360
It's nothing.

156
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,770
Who are you?

157
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,740
- Dad! 
 - Joonwoo!

158
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,310
Brother-in-Law! Brother-in-Law, are you all right?

159
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,090
He's my brother-in-law! My brother-in-law!

160
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,850
- Are you all right? 
 - I don't think I am.

161
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,390
You should have just called me.

162
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,340
Well, I... since...

163
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,610
Since you were with a man, I...

164
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,910
I got curious and wanted to see his face.

165
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,210
I'm sorry.

166
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,960
- He's my boss. 
 - Your boss? 
 - He's my brother-in-law.

167
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm sorry once again.

168
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,620
- What is it? 
 - I think it's dislocated.

169
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,420
- You too, you too! Raise it a little higher, please! 
 - Ah!

170
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,010
Too high! Too high!

171
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,640
Bring it back down a little.

172
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,300
You're fine.

173
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,420
- What? 
 - You're fine.

174
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,970
Wow, you're right! What a relief.

175
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,730
Where are you coming from?

176
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,420
It's my son's birthday, so I bought some ribs and pork belly.

177
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,140
You should come with us, too! I'm inviting you to my party.

178
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,350
Dad, you're okay. Right?

179
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,410
I have to ask your mother.

180
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,380
Well, if it's okay with you, feel free to come over for dinner.

181
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,540
- I'll have to pass. 
 - Thank goodness.

182
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,170
Mister, come with us!

183
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,200
Come on, please?

184
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,150
Joonwoo, my boss is too busy today, so he can't come.

185
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,810
He's super busy. Hey...

186
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,810
Auntie, I want to invite Mr. Detective to my birthday party.

187
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,080
Please.

188
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,500
Next time, Joonwoo.

189
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,810
Let's invite the detective next time.

190
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,490
The boss is really busy.

191
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,010
Mister, please.

192
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,650
- I'll go. 
 - Excuse me?

193
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,490
What...

194
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,610
I said I'll go. To the birthday party.

195
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,080
Really?

196
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,340
Oh, yeah!

197
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,000
Dad!

198
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,900
Will it be all right? You don't have to force yourself.

199
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,790
It's all right.

200
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,290
What are you doing, Manager Kim?

201
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,340
Hangyul, you know how I was once completely obsessed with Sherlock Holmes. Right?

202
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,780
That style, that fashion...

203
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,200
The president at World King Agency is also a detective.

204
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,170
Why would you bring up President Lee?

205
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,030
He's single, too. Isn't he? Even his hair is permed like Sherlock Holmes's.

206
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,880
How could you compare their permed hairs?

207
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,710
Sherlock's is a chic curl.

208
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,170
President Lee's hair is just like an auntie's!

209
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,900
Auntie?

210
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,280
- Manager Kim! 
 - President Lee... 
 - You stay still.

211
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,330
What part of my hair looks like an auntie's?

212
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,270
A very famous hairstylist prepared this for me, okay?

213
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,040
Do you know how expensive this was?

214
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,680
I don't really care.

215
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,850
I don't care how expensive those curls were.

216
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,320
Oh, he's so handsome.

217
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,030
You're talking to an adult! Where do you think you're—

218
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,240
Wait.

219
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,790
That's Detective Kim Mooyoung, isn't it?

220
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,680
It is.

221
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,550
If he were a zombie, I don't think it would hurt at all if he bit me.

222
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:04,980
Let's talk later.

223
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,970
What's with him?

224
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,080
Wang Wei, what's wrong with you?

225
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,580
What's with the beer?

226
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,680
I can't stand Kim Mooyoung any longer.

227
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,590
Kim Mooyoung? Did you just say his name?

228
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,680
Kim Mooyoung is polluting these streets for sure.

229
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,130
I think it would be the right thing to chase him out of Gangrim City.

230
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,180
All of a sudden? Up until yesterday, you said he was amazing and wonderful and whatnot.

231
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,950
I was temporarily mistaken.

232
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,240
I think you were right.

233
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,280
From now on, I will fully obey your—

234
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,680
Only three shots...

235
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,880
I'm here!

236
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,380
You brat, why were you so late? Who...

237
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,020
This is my boss.

238
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,400
We ran into brother-in-law earlier, and he received an invite.

239
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Come make yourself comfortable.

240
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,490
Joonwoo really likes her boss.

241
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,040
Welcome.

242
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,010
It's nice to meet you.

243
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,210
I am Kim Mooyoung.

244
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,990
I heard a lot about you.

245
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,410
- You only call her an intern, but you're basically partners. Right? 
- Excuse me?

246
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:45,670
When my Sunji worked at the broadcasting station and went all over the place

247
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,420
for her scoop, she really was something.

248
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,080
Was it 70-Minute Chase?

249
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,850
While working there, she received so many police commendations.

250
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,200
- Wait, wait, they're here somewhere. 
 - Sis!

251
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,010
- I put them somewhere when we moved. 
 - Sis!

252
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,350
Sorry.

253
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,950
I'm here, Noonim!

254
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,410
Detective Cha, you're here?

255
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,070
Cha Dohyun, what brings you here?

256
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,540
Detective Cha! Of course, I called him over.

257
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,470
Uncle.

258
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,310
Hey, Joonwoo. How were you?

259
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,630
We meet again.

260
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,700
I invited Mr. Detective.

261
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,440
You did? Good job, Joonwoo.

262
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,120
Happy birthday!

263
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
Happy birthday!

264
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,420
Our beloved son!

265
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,720
Happy birthday to you!

266
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,220
- You should wear it like this. 
 - Joonwoo, happy birthday!

267
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,690
 Son, happy birthday!

268
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,130
If you have a present, please hurry... hurry...

269
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,810
Here, Joonwoo, your birthday present.

270
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,790
 What could have Auntie possibly gotten for you?

271
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,960
Buy anything you want with that, Joonwoo. Cash is the best!

272
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,380
Why would you give cash to a kid?

273
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,890
Joonwoo, I will keep this for you and give it to you when you are older.

274
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,310
Sis, you are going to take it for yourself, aren't you?

275
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,840
Here, this is my present.

276
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,880
It's my favorite.

277
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,960
But still, how could you give me the leftover?

278
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,800
No, there is still a lot left.

279
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,410
This is a present that this uncle prepared for our Joonwoo.

280
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,220
Detective Cha, you must have spent a pretty good amount on this.

281
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,330
- Oh, what could it be?  Let's see.
 - Wow!

282
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,270
What could it be?

283
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,310
- Wow, so cool! 
 - Wow!

284
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,370
Uncle, thank you!

285
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,630
Study hard!

286
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,260
- You must be happy. 
 - Here.

287
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,580
What could this be?

288
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,260
It's a little thick.

289
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,940
What is it?

290
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,180

291
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,230
MIster, you are the best!

292
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,400
The best!  I like this the best.

293
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,080
- What is it? 
 - A secret.

294
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,300
- What is it? 
 - It's a secret?

295
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,660
- No, no, no... 
 - Thank you.

296
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't eat snacks.

297
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,440
Can I see it?

298
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,010
Even though there isn't much, please eat well.

299
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,200
The yukhoe  (T/N: raw meat served like sashimi)  you brought

300
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,330
really is the bomb.

301
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,380
But why aren't you eating it?

302
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,360
Ah, you don't like it because it's raw.

303
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,990
I am doing intermittent fasting.

304
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,350
Why do you have to do something like that?

305
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,450
Try this, honey. It's so spicy.

306
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,430
It's spicy.

307
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,410
Your boss... Strangely, I don't feel good about the gleam in his eyes.

308
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,310
What gleam in his eyes?

309
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:05,340
Call it the sixth sense of a detective.  Don't they look like a hungry animal's eyes?

310
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,730
What do you mean "an animal"?

311
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,540
Eat a lot.

312
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:14,010
But then again, he even ate more than half a wild boar.

313
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,830
Brother-in-Law would be nothing.

314
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,700
He ate a wild boar?

315
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,270
No, don't.

316
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,420
No, don't!

317
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,380
Sister-in-Law, don't what?

318
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
Boss, grill the meat, please.

319
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,430
What are you saying to a guest?!

320
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,690
It's okay.  I can do it.

321
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,260
No, you stop grilling.

322
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,270
Come and eat meat.

323
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,130
You eat meat and, Boss, you grill the meat, please.

324
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,050
No, no, I... I will grill.

325
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,260
No, you can't!  Boss... Boss has to grill the meat!

326
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,210
- Why? 
 - Before he became a detective,

327
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,720
he used to own a BBQ restaurant.

328
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,400
Yes, I used to own a BBQ restaurant.

329
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,250
Then, we will ask for this favor.

330
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,780
Sure.  I will try to grill well.

331
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,880
Please make it tasty.

332
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,280
We will enjoy it.

333
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,220
Oh, it looks tasty!

334
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,320
Kids, enjoy and eat a lot!

335
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,850
- Eat meat too! 
 - Yes!

336
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,530
- Our Detective Cha, eat a lot. Okay? 
 - Yes, it's tasty.

337
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,500
Of course, of course.  We will grill more.

338
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,620
Eat lots.  Have some soup, too.

339
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,200
- Is it tasty? 
 - Yeah.

340
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,090
The juice got hot.

341
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,390
- Why? 
  - It's the best.

342
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,240
- Korean beef tastes so good. 
 - Of course, it's tasty.

343
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,490
Son, eat a lot.

344
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,470
Hey, eat this, too.

345
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,630
Is it tasty?

346
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,840
I am done eating.

347
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,870
- Eat more.  More. 
 - It's tasty, right?

348
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,370
Honey, on a day like this, it would be good to sing. Right?

349
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,930
Who wants to sing?  I will give you allowance money.

350
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:21,880
- Me. 
 - Me. 
 - Okay, let's sing a song.

351
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,100
One, two... one, two, start!

352
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,500
♫   Jjin jjin jjin jjin jjin-ee-ya!   ♫ 
  (T/N: Mr. Trot, Young Tak's Jjin-ee-ya)

353
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,980
♫   Total jjin-ee-ya! ♫ 
 (T/N: the real deal or the best.)

354
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,340
♫   The real one appeared now   ♫

355
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,960
♫   Really, really, jjin jjin jjin jjin jjin-ee-ya!   ♫

356
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,260
♫  Total jjin-ee-ya!   ♫

357
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,990
 My family would be somewhere as well.

358
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,250
 Would they know that I am dead?

359
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,590
 Would they still be waiting for me to return alive?

360
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,600
 If they find out that I am a zombie,

361
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,000
 would I still—

362
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,010
Mister, fire!

363
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,630
- Fire!  Fire! 
 - What?

364
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,980
Ah, it's hot!  Ah... Ah, it's hot!

365
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,320
Boss!

366
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,800
Wait, this is soju!  Soju!

367
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,060
Move aside!

368
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,220
 Even for a moment, it felt like I became a human.

369
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,330
Go  there.

370
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,260
Who am I going to throw it to?  Guess.

371
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,790
Must you go this far?

372
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,550
Just pretend that you are hurting.

373
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,220
What was that?

374
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,650
Try to be realistic.

375
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,360
- Mister, are you okay? 
 - It must hurt a lot.

376
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,690
Mister, you were showing us a magic trick earlier, weren't you?

377
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,620
Can't you teach me magic tricks, too?

378
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:52,230
Mister, you will end up wetting your bed doing that.
  (T/N: children are told that they will wet their beds if they play with fire.)

379
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,240
Kids, Mister is hurt so you should blow on his wound.

380
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,300
It's okay now.

381
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,910
- Every night... 
 - I'm fine.

382
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,430
- Good job. You're like a doctor. 
  - I'm sorry, Honey.

383
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,150
What did you eat that you smell like this?

384
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,420
Detective Cha,

385
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,380
you will need to try harder.

386
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,340
But still, you know that we are on your side. Right?

387
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,520
Right.  I am on our Dohyun's side, too.  Don't worry.

388
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,040
Thank you, Hyungnim and Noonim.

389
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,840
Kids!  Let's go have some fruit.  Hurry up!

390
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,440
- Yay, fruit! 
 - Sunji, help me with this.

391
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,390
- Sit, sit. 
 - Isn't this my movie poster?

392
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,400
We have so many in the house anyway.

393
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,350
The poster is for Busan Express?

394
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,200
- Yes, my brother-in-law made this. 
 - What?!

395
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,080
Why?

396
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,960
I was really impressed with this movie.

397
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,030
- Not "Train to Busan" but "Busan Express"? 
 - Yes, Busan Express.

398
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,860
I am so... sorry.  I've never actually met someone

399
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,410
who saw... saw my movie...

400
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,300
- Thank you!  It's an honor. 
 - No, I should thank you.

401
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,760
Then, you are a director—

402
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,800
Is there really someone in Korea who actually saw this movie?

403
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,300
Of course!

404
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,520
Yes, I... I am the director.

405
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,940
I am Lee Taekyun.  Lee Taekyun's Busan Express.

406
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,820
Director Lee Taekyun.

407
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,550
Yes, yes...

408
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,800
 Can't even talk...

409
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:39,160
 Gets killed by someone he loves...

410
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,860
 Talk!  I said talk!

411
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,450
 What is this zombie punk doing?!

412
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,890
 Why can't you just say that it hurts?!

413
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,190
I realized how important communication is after watching your movie.

414
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,980
Thank you.

415
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,980
That alone is a big tragedy.

416
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,620
Humans are always cruel and violent against zombies.

417
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,310
They never attack with bare hands.

418
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,930
At least, a baseball bat, gun, bow, and arrow... They always attack with some weapons.

419
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,430
- How cowardly! 
  - You are right!

420
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,130
It's not a fair play, right from the start.

421
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,750
Brother-in-Law and Boss,

422
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,720
- they seem to get along really well. 
 - Yeah, it looks that way.

423
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,370
Truly cowardly people.

424
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,420
Get beaten over and over again—

425
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,450
Kill even when they are dead—

426
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,660
They can't even say that they are hurting—

427
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,780
They can't even go to the hospital—

428
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,160
A zombie, truly is this era's...

429
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,860
I am sorry.  I got too excited.

430
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,230
I understand.

431
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,080
- ...the truly alienated weaklings, I think.
 - You are right.

432
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,810
But that's not it.  Zombies are such cowards.

433
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,450
They don't ever attack alone.  They always attack in groups.

434
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,940
"United you live, divided you die," don't you know that saying?

435
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,060
Be it a zombie or a human, it is a way of survival to stay alive.

436
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:54,340
A way of survival?  Why do you think there is a term "zombie virus"?

437
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,060
Everybody knows that a zombie virs is a vicious virus.

438
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:02,070
Besides, a zombie is just a rotten corpse that's walking and moving.

439
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,220
- A rotten corpse? 
 - Yes.

440
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,600
Stop talking about zombies, will you!

441
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,110
Boss, you stop, too.

442
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,410
- School violence, psychopath, cult— 
 - Ah, really!

443
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,120
All pleasure killings are done by humans, don't you know?

444
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,240
It seems that humans are more rotten than zombies but you should know since you are a detective.

445
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,000
Ah, sure.  There are... are some... some humans like that, but—

446
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,530
Wait.

447
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,970
So, what do you think a zombie is

448
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,830
most afraid of?

449
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,780
Of course, it's humans.

450
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,290
Especially...

451
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,910
- Ma Dongseok.
 - Ma Dongseok.
   (T/N: Korean-American actor who appeared in "Train to Busan.")

452
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,590
That's right.

453
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,830
The fist that was mercilessly punching zombies.

454
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,470
That arm.  Just thinking about it gives me the chills.

455
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,790
You and I seem to understand each other really well.

456
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,740
It's late so...  Dohyun, you are going home, right?

457
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,690
Would you be able to spend the night here and talk with me a little more?

458
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,310
I am sorry but that's a little...

459
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,810
That's too bad.

460
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,270
Thank you for coming today.

461
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,180
You are not thankful because everyone is safe?

462
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,650
But isn't it a zombie's instinct to eat humans?

463
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,590
Really, why aren't you eating humans?

464
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:47,150
If I start eating humans, then I will become a real zombie.

465
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,050
A real zombie.

466
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,060
I guarantee...

467
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,730
that you probably were a good person.

468
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,980
I buried him here somewhere.  Damn!

469
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,760
I was passing by so I came to get a business card.

470
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,040
I can't seem to find the one you gave me last time.

471
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,840
Sure.

472
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,790

473
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,760
I might need to find someone.

474
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,670
Can you find dead people?

475
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,680
A corpse disappeared.

476
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,940
Excuse me?

477
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,290
It was a joke.  A joke.

478
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,770
What kind of work did you do before coming here?

479
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:18,010
I've always done detective work.

480
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,710
Ah, I see.

481
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,150
It's a bit warm.

482
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,820
My hands get sweaty easily.

483
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,870
 It's lighter fluid smell.

484
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,290
 And... a peculiar smell.

485
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,610
Brother,

486
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,540
are you going to continue pretending that you don't know me?

487
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,680
For how long are you going to pretend that you don't know me?

488
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,730
What are you saying?

489
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,240
Brother,

490
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,650
I look easy to you. Right?

491
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,530
Do I look easy?

492
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,190
Why do you keep pretending that you don't know me?!

493
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,130
Why do you keep digging up the kidnapping case with that writer wench?

494
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,850
What am I supposed to do?

495
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,960
Are you doing this to see me go crazy?

496
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,750
If you keep this up, don't you know that it will get difficult for both of us?

497
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,230
I'm sorry.

498
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,500
I must have mistaken you for someone else.

499
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,710
It was a close brother. You were very surprised, weren't you?

500
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,740
I really am sorry.

501
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,630
Perhaps, is that brother dead?

502
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,730
Who is that brother?

503
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:36,880
Please don't concern yourself.  If he is alive...

504
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,700
he would have come looking for me first.

505
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,350
Then, I will be leaving.

506
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,430
A corpse?

507
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,700
Did he just ask to find a corpse?

508
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,950
Dog, wild boar, now even a corpse?

509
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,060

510
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,610
 If he were alive, he would have come looking for me first.

511
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,400
 Don't you know that it will get difficult for both of us?

512
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,900
 He said "us."

513
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,460
 For sure, "us."

514
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,540
Detective Kim must be asleep.

515
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,370
I don't hear anything now.

516
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,960
 World King Detective Agency President Lee Sungrok.

517
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,150
Did he just call me?

518
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:11,450
 Let's meet for a bit.  I know that you are listening so

519
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,680
 please come here for a bit.

520
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,350

521
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,320
I was wondering where it went.  It was here?

522
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,860
Ah, why am I going around dropping something like this? You little—

523
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,220
Could you please follow that man who was here earlier?

524
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,860
You mean that?

525
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:51,260
Is it possible?

526
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,060
Of course, when you are sincerely asking like this.

527
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,610
Being in the same business, how can I ignore your request?

528
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,750
But how come you don't do it yourself?

529
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,500
- Because he is already following me. 
 - Ahh.

530
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,050
You are right.

531
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,550
I will need to help you.

532
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,500
Secretly, you know. Right?

533
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,100
Not even a mouse or a bird will know.  It's our trade characteristic, isn't it?

534
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,780
Fighting!  Fighting!

535
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,870

536
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,230

537
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,190
Mr. Hyungchul came by?

538
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,580
Yeah, he said he is looking for someone.

539
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,260
He didn't tell me anything about it.

540
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,940
When did you say he was attacked by the culprit?

541
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,900
It's been about two weeks.

542
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,250
 Why do you keep pretending that you don't know me?!

543
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,360
 Why do you keep digging up the kidnapping case with that writer wench?

544
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,830
It would be best for you to be careful with him.

545
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,020
Be careful?

546
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,370
I am not sure but I just feel that you should.

547
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,620
Yeah, Dohyun.

548
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,880
Today?  Of course! The earlier, the better.

549
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,990
Yeah.  Okay.

550
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,010
It's too bad but we don't have any open spot.

551
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,950
We have workers lined up here, too.

552
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,940
Nothing you can do about it.

553
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,400
Okay, maybe next time.

554
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,470
Naturally, okay?  You are in disguise.

555
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,310
What's with your clothes?  Are you a girl scout?

556
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,410
Speak for yourself.

557
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,910
- Ice cream! 
 - Ice cream!

558
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,070
I look like an ice cream vendor, don't I?

559
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,170
Mister, can I have an ice cream?

560
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,130
Do you have a chocolate one?

561
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,980
I want a strawberry flavor.

562
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,280
Mister, did you quit detective work?

563
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,110
Kids, we are not selling ice cream here, so go.

564
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,680
Young friends, we are working now so go play over there, please.

565
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,670
They really must not be selling ice cream.  They don't have any.

566
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,300
I told you we don't have any.

567
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,650
Mister, what is this telescope?

568
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,200
Leave it!  Come here!

569
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,230
What are they doing?

570
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,420
- Are they playing detective? 
 - Why are they like that?

571
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,700
I am on night duty so I am the only one here.  You can relax and look at it.

572
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,190
You are the best, Detective Cha!

573
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,330
Thank you.

574
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,390
This for what I owe you for the New Truth church case.  We are now calling it even, right?

575
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,550
But didn't you already investigate everything while you were reporting it last year?

576
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,910
I just want to reconfirm.

577
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:21,510
These are the victim's belongings found at the crime scene.

578
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,620
There wasn't any DNA found either, right?

579
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,930
The suspect had used bleach to clean up.

580
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,120
Should we go get a cup of coffee?

581
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,100
- Later. 
 - Ah.

582
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,940
- Ah, my stomach! 
 - What's wrong?

583
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,170
Ah, I think my appendix burst again.

584
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,980
They took out your appendix so you don't have one, remember?

585
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,430
That's right.  I don't have an appendix.

586
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:56,850
Hey, let's go outside and get a cup of coffee.

587
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,960
I said I am not going to drink.  Later.

588
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,220
I said let's have it.

589
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,490
I am not drinking.  I am not going outside.

590
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,380
- Let's have a cup of coffee! 
 - I said I am not going outside.

591
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,800
- I am not— 
 - I have something to tell you.  Hurry up and come!

592
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,190
- I said one cup of coffee— 
 - I said I am not going to drink.

593
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,610
That office, is he not going to hire anyone else?

594
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,480
Why would he need to when I get paid one million won per day.

595
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,850
I get paid one million won per day but we don't have any clients.

596
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,160
I knew it.

597
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,040
Ah, hot!

598
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,220
Are you okay?

599
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,360
You are so clumsy!  You didn't get burned?

600
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,920
Why are you outside?

601
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,930
Officer Bae, hello.

602
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,000
Writer Kong, you've been well. Right?

603
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,710
I am always the same.

604
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,310
Detective Cha, I am going now.  Thanks for today.

605
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,770
Officer Bae, fighting!

606
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:19,210
- Hey, call me, okay? 
 - Okay.

607
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,970
He is quite good-looking.

608
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,170
They look good together, too.

609
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,200
It's not like what you think.

610
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,210
They are just boss and employee.  That's all.

611
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,020
Senior, that's why it's not going to work for you.

612
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,790
Not... Not what?  What about me?

613
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:44,240
Are you pretending not to know or do you really not know how you feel inside?

614
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,320
Senior, you told me

615
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,220
that patience is the most important thing when questioning a suspect, didn't you?

616
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:56,320
That's right.  You have to wait and wait more until you are certain.

617
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,620
I think...

618
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:04,350
that if you cultivate patience when you are dating, you will end up losing the partner you want.

619
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,270
Don't wait any longer and catch her as soon as possible.

620
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:13,040
I can't wait any longer, either.

621
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,750

622
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:25,350
♫  But then I break down over nothing  ♫

623
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:26,580

624
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,210
You didn't smell anything else from Sori's shoes?

625
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,480
It seems that all traces were erased with bleach.

626
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,630
I did smell rosin powder from the soles of the shoes.

627
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,180
 It wasn't an unfamiliar smell.

628
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,960
Rosin powder...

629
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,190
Sori's body was discovered in April and since it was found at a reservoir,

630
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,590
it could have gotten on her at that time.

631
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,370
I will look into it more.

632
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,640
Okay.  You can go home from here.  Good work.

633
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,510
Okay.  You, too.

634
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:02,080
And it would be better for you to take tomorrow off.  If something comes up, we can call.

635
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,270
I will do that.

636
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,510
Ah, and...

637
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,810
be... be careful.  Don't get yourself involved needlessly.

638
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,300
Don't worry.

639
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,180
I am going now.

640
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,700

641
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,340
That's why he's been doing squats.

642
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,340
It looks like he was following you.

643
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,940
That guy, Oh Hyungchul, apparently played baseball in the past.

644
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,790
After he stopped playing sports, he was working as a bodyguard when he got injured.

645
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:46,300
Since then, he's been surviving by working at construction sites.

646
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,550
He only has a wife and aged mother for family.

647
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,930
 It's the lighter!

648
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,550
You worked hard.

649
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,660
Anything else you need?

650
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,510
I think this is enough.

651
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,340
Okay.  If you need anything else, ask.

652
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,760
Wait a moment.

653
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,540
 Detective Kim must be satisfied.

654
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,520
 He gave us all this raw chicken.

655
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,380
 This is what you call "respect chicken."

656
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:32,810
I, Lee Sungrok, am not dead yet.

657
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,860
But... why did that guy follow Detective Kim?

658
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,790
Yes, why?

659
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:45,870
What did Kim  Mooyoung go around doing in the past?

660
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,100
 I've seen this house before.

661
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,580
 Your call cannot be completed...

662
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,770
Why isn't Boss answering his phone?

663
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:51,720

664
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,080
Sir!

665
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,920
Sir, let's talk for a bit, please!

666
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,260
Sir, just for a bit.

667
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,520
It will only be for a bit.

668
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,840
It's been a little over a year, hasn't it?

669
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,060
Since this is the first time after what happened to Sori.

670
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:20,560
Yes.

671
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,850
It's true that at first, I blamed you.

672
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:30,560
But it is all my fault.

673
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,390
I don't resent you.

674
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:40,860
Because of you, Sori has not been forgotten at least.

675
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:27,560
 As expected, it's rosin powder smell.

676
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:45,230
 The same smell as the first time I met him.

677
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:50,020
 I knew it!  This punk was the culprit.

678
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,330
What brings you

679
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,690
to my house?

680
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,320
It was you, wasn't it?

681
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,190
You kidnapped and killed Sori, didn't you?

682
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,280
Son!  Son, it's cold outside. Isn't it?

683
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,910
You must be hungry.  Let's go in.  Hurry.

684
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,330
Please go inside and wait, Mom.

685
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:26,030
My baby, you worked hard to earn a living.

686
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,080
What's going on?

687
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,540
My son.

688
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,100
Mother, you always call someone else's son your son.

689
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,970
Go wait inside.

690
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,600
Why?

691
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,670
Okay.

692
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:45,490
Please, hurry up and go finish your meal.

693
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:53,540
Let's talk somewhere else.

694
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,470
 This is broken.

695
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:23,590
Sir, this person here, the one wearing the watch, who is he?

696
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,310
He was our private bodyguard.

697
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:32,630
Private bodyguard?  Where is he now?

698
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,580
I haven't been in touch with him for over a year myself.  I wonder how he's doing.

699
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,870
Just a moment, please.

700
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:47,190
Perhaps, is this him?

701
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,650
Yes, that's him.  Do you know Mr. Kang Minho?

702
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,850
Where is he now?

703
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:57,040
I owe him a lot but I haven't been able to get in touch with him.

704
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,360
Really?

705
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,460
Sori trusted him more than me and was close to him.

706
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,900
I knew it!  He was a good person.

707
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:12,160
Boss!

708
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,540

709
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,150
Where did he go?

710
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,280
I found his past.

711
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,930

712
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,010
You are the culprit, aren't you?

713
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,910
You kidnapped Sorin too. Didn't you?

714
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,630
You killed me, too?

715
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,890
I asked you if you killed me, too?

716
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,180
Why did you do it?

717
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,170
Why?!

718
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,510
Brother, do you remember this place?

719
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:39,830
We used to fish together here and we were on really good terms.

720
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,580
It seems you really don't remember anything...

721
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,580
about what happened on that day.

722
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,340
Do you want to know the truth?

723
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,710
It might help you to get your memory back.

724
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:29,000
On Christmas Day, we planned something.

725
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,980
You and me, just the two of us.

726
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,750
What do you mean "planned something"?

727
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,150
You really don't remember that day?

728
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:40,980
That girl, either?

729
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,400
On Christmas Day, the person who kidnapped that girl,

730
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,870
killed her, and planned everything, was you, Brother.

731
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,580
Don't talk bullshit!

732
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,530
And you are the one who took the corpse to the reservoir.

733
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:05,200
I just followed your orders.  If it weren't for you, that girl could have lived.

734
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,550
Because of you, things got all messed up and my life was even more ruined!

735
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,380
Do you know that?!

736
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,690
That's not possible.

737
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,660
It's not that you don't remember but you don't want to remember.

738
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,040
You said that everything will get resolved if we have the girl.

739
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,750
You killed that girl.

740
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:52,270
If it weren't for you, that girl could have gone back to her family and lived.

741
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:55,110
Why the hell did you do that?!  Why?!

742
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,770
 Please save me.

743
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,490
 Please save me.

744
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,190
 No, that's not possible.

745
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,290
 That can't be.

746
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:37,270
 I kidnapped and killed her?

747
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,760
 No way!

748
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,950
 I thought humans were the most rotten.

749
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:21,350
 That rotten human... was me.

750
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:30,120

751
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,500
♫   I will never kneel again.  I'm living my life today   ♫

752
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,350
♫   I will never hurt you again   ♫

753
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:44,210

754
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:48,970
 I am warning you.  Don't come near Sunji from now on.

755
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:51,490
 It looks like something happened in Gangrim City.

756
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:56,990
 Waking up as a zombie was a terrible nightmare for me.

757
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,730
 Please save me!

758
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:03,980
 It's different this time.  You don't know when, where and whom it will attack.

759
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:06,950
 It's all over now.  We will live a new life.

760
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:10,340
 Today, you and I are going to hell together.

761
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,360
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.

762
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,510
♫  If there is a place I must go  ♫

763
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,190
♫  I won’t ever stop my footsteps  ♫
