1
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,590

2
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,730
Yes, Team Leader.

3
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,030
No Poongsik did?

4
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,030
I will be right back, so please wait.

5
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,230
Team Leader!

6
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,160
What happened?  What about Officer Bae?

7
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,660
Fortunately, she survived.

8
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,650
But she is still unconscious.

9
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,860
Wang Wei!

10
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,260
What happened?

11
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,830
Don't worry.  He did get bit by the zombie but its teeth were not able to penetrate the flesh because of the stomach fat.

12
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,730
What?!

13
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,540
In other words, he only has teeth marks left on his stomach.

14
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,840
That's a relief.

15
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,760
I know that you are awake so open your eyes.

16
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,330
Ah, I slept well.

17
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,340
Oh, hi.

18
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,010
I must've fallen asleep.

19
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,700
They said you can get discharged right away.  I don't know why you are lying down in a hospital room.

20
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,220
I might as well get some hospital food while I am admitted.

21
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,040
How can you talk about food after hearing about stomach fat?

22
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,160
Fast for a while.

23
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,920
Anyway, I wonder if Kim Mooyoung is okay.

24
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,020
Even though it was an accident, he probably was greatly shocked.

25
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,950
It's equivalent to a human killing another human.

26
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:24,310
Detective Kim Mooyoung is a zombie... I still can't believe it.

27
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,110
 Boss.  President Lee is fine and he wasn't infected either.

28
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,760
That's a relief.

29
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,690
How about you?  Are you okay?

30
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,900
I am okay.

31
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,070
- I will go now to the offi— 
   - Don't come.

32
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,550
Don't come to the office and just go home for the day.

33
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,240
And if anyone comes by to the office and asks about me, tell them that you don't know anything.

34
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,430
You had nothing to do with me.

35
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,470
Until now, you had no choice but to just follow my orders.  Understand?

36
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,390
Hello?  Boss?

37
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,740
♫  My old memories that the film broke  ♫

38
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,660
♫  Around the same place like a round earth  ♫

39
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,300
 If only I had died back then,

40
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,660
 Mom!  Mom!

41
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,730
 I wouldn't have had to witness my mother dying.

42
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,760
 Mom.  Mom.

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,200
♫  I will never kneel again.  I will live my life today  ♫

44
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,960
 What to do?  Please!  What to do?!

45
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,400
 Humans are put in danger.  Even a zombie, too.

46
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,520
♫  Even if everyone leaves my side  ♫

47
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,580
♫  Even if there's no one, I'll be okay  ♫

48
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,370
♫  Even if there's no one, I'll be okay  ♫

49
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,060
 A zombie should never have come to where humans live to begin with.

50
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,420
♫  ...everything disappears  ♫

51
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,660
 What I can do for them is...

52
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,340
 to no longer...

53
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,730
♫  Run away, you're like a monster to me  ♫

54
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,130
♫  If there is a place to go  ♫

55
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,670

56
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:33,540
♫  Way down we go, go find me  ♫

57
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,430
Why isn't he answering?

58
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,430

59
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,270
Hello?

60
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,070
Hello?

61
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,160
What the heck!  The battery is dead.

62
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,050
It's noisy!

63
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,070
What time is it?

64
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,920
 While being transported to the police for the crime of abducting the body of his deceased wife who died five years ago to the basement of his animal hospital,

65
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,540
No— No— Doesn't Mr. No refer to that Mr. No?

66
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,390
 attacked the officer who was accompanying him and fled.

67
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,060
Oh, no!

68
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,000
He fled?

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,130
Is it possible that he escaped to kill us?

70
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,400
Wei, lock all the doors!

71
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Hey, blinds!

72
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,200
 ...fled, the Prosecutor General is...

73
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
What will happen to us now?

74
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,380
This time, it won't just end with a bite.

75
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,900
 ...missing Mr. No...

76
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,300
 Next.

77
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,510
 Early this morning, the body of a deceased male was discovered at an alley in Chowol-dong.

78
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,410
 At the time of discovery, the corpse was missing the head and organs...

79
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,280
 The police are deducing that there is a high probability that it is an illegal organ trafficking crime

80
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,930
 and expects to expand the investigation.

81
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,200
 The police obtained surveillance footage around the area and are currently analyzing...

82
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,630
Missing the head...

83
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,300
 To find witnesses...

84
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,330
This was done by a zombie for sure.

85
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,450
A zombie appeared.

86
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,810
Honey, don't get shocked and listen!  I think a zombie really appeared in our neighborhood!

87
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,490
You like zombies that much?

88
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,410
Not that I like them.  It's just that they are an inspiration for my movie.

89
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,920
Come here for a bit.

90
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,720
- For a bit? 
 - Yeah, just for a bit.

91
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,800
- Should I, like a zombie— 
 - Get away from me!

92
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,190
Ah, calm down!

93
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,230
Sister-in-Law!  Save me—

94
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,050
Honey, you really don't believe me?!

95
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,490
I am telling you that I saw a zombie at No Poongsik's animal hospital.

96
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,870
So, you went to the animal hospital and discovered the basement.

97
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,580
Inside, you came across a zombie?

98
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,300
Yes. The zombie went... and looked at me.

99
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,660
You want me to believe that now?!

100
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,480
Ah, this is so frustrating!  Please believe me!

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,790
My boss was bit by that zombie!

102
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,070
Then, why didn't your boss become a zombie?

103
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,270
That... That's because, as you can see,

104
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,120
the teeth were not able to penetrate because of the extra fat.

105
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,870
I am telling you the truth!

106
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,300
Team Leader, no, Brother Chunseob,

107
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,030
I am Lee Sungrok.

108
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,300
I, Lee Sungrok, of Gangrim City's number one detective agency with a 20-year tradition,

109
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,970
I saw it with my own two eyes!

110
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,400
No Poongsik's wife was a zombie!

111
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,090
That zombie pounced on me!

112
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,200
A zombie... pounced on you?

113
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Yes!

114
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,670
Sungrok, are you lonely nowadays?

115
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,150
Yes... nowadays— No, no!

116
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,960
I am not talking about that!

117
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,040
Why are you like this?!

118
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,340
I am already disturbed as it is!

119
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,040
I am asking you what did No Poongsik do in there?!

120
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,250
I am telling you that No Poongsik raised a zombie in there!

121
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,090
You need to believe what I tell you so I can cooperate.

122
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,640
You just have to catch No Poongsik and ask him whether he is a zombie or not.

123
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,860
Please quickly catch No Poongsik.  I am asking you, please.

124
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,060
We have to protect ourselves.

125
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,130
Whether it's a zombie or No Poongsik,

126
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,490
I want to go back to Yanbian.

127
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,620
I have to protect.

128
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,530
Wait!

129
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,790
Didn't we lock the door before leaving?

130
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes, we did.

131
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,200
Then, why does it open without unlocking?

132
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
Boss!

133
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,170
Dohyun.

134
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,150
What brings you here suddenly without calling me first?

135
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,510
Today, I came here not as a friend but as a cop.

136
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:42,730
The body of the deceased Kim Mooyoung was discovered.  Did you know?

137
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,400
- What? 
 - That your boss is not Kim Mooyoung.

138
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,330
- That is... 
 - You knew, didn't you?

139
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,830
You knew and you worked with him all this time.

140
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,510
Boss... where is Boss?

141
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,740
I want to ask that question.

142
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,060
He is Kang Minho, right?

143
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,270
No... that is...

144
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,980
Dohyun, I think you misunderstood something.

145
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,400
My boss didn't kill Detective Kim Mooyoung.

146
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,120
Then, he just has to cooperate with the investigation.

147
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,460
Other than the murder, is there anything else you are hiding from me?

148
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,210
I am asking if there are any more surprises.

149
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,750
How is he related to No Poongsik?

150
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,280
And why did you go to the lab yesterday?

151
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,640
No Poongsik had been conducting illegal experiments all this time.

152
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,490
So...

153
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,510
So, what?

154
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,890
He made a zombie.

155
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,560
Of course, it's hard to believe, but he ate a human's head and damaged the corpse.

156
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,580
That's not something a human can do, is it?

157
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,400
If we approached this the usual way, there would have been so many victims by now.

158
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,170
- No Poongsik is not a human but a zombie— 
 - Kong Sunji!

159
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,070
This is the last warning I am giving you as a friend.

160
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,620
If you see Kang Minho but don't report him or if you hide him,

161
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,330
from that moment on you will also be punished.

162
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,230
So, judge wisely.

163
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,430
 Your call cannot be completed...

164
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,540
Why isn't he answering his phone.

165
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,020
What has he been saying?

166
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,380
You... head is...

167
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,550
My head.

168
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,620
...so bad.

169
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,810
What?  What?

170
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,900
Ah, why?!  Why?!

171
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,070
You really are dense.  Here.

172
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,650
Boss!

173
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,940
Where were you all this time without any contact?  I was so worried.

174
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,080
I couldn't go to my office and there are cops everywhere in Gangrim City.

175
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,870
Detective Kim, think of this place as your own

176
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,420
and stay here comfortably.

177
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,100
As if anybody would do anything to that stomach.

178
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,730
It's for my back.  My back.

179
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,940
Did I gain weight?

180
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,520
It looks like they found the body of deceased Kim Mooyoung.

181
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,130
Dohyun is looking for you now.

182
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,440
At this rate, your identity will soon be exposed.

183
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,320
More importantly, we have to first find No Poongsik.

184
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,270
Oh!  The internet is going wild

185
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,660
because there is a zombie case in Gangrim City.

186
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,500
Zombie?

187
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,350
Because the culprit damaged the corpse, it has been dubbed "zombie."

188
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,710
There is a talk of illegal organ trafficking as well.

189
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,760
This was for sure done by No Poongsik.

190
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,440
No Poongsik turned himself into a zombie.

191
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,430
Himself?

192
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,650
The vial that contained the fluid that he took out of my body was found at the scene.

193
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,570

194
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,670
No Poongsik injected the fluid to himself, is that it?

195
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,210
We will have to find No Poongsik first.

196
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,300
How are we going to find him when even the police can't?

197
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,860
On top of that, he even made me faint with that strange gas.

198
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,560
I am scared to death.

199
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,000
I was unprepared and lost to that green gas as well.

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,980
Even I fainted.

201
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,900
Green...

202
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,480
Perhaps, are you talking about this?

203
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,600
Where did you get this?

204
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,190
It was at the lab, so I  brought it.

205
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,260
What, No Poongsik?

206
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,820
I told you not to ask for that kind of favor since your broadcasting days, didn't I?

207
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,830
Detective or whatever the hell, quit right now!

208
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,940
Sis, this is all for us.

209
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,260
The fact that you can worry about the dinner menu and not about the end of the world or a war,

210
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,450
and although Brother-in-Law's movies keep failing, he can still dream...

211
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,870
And also the fact that Joonwoo is healthy and can go to school...

212
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,740
all this is because Gangrim City is peaceful, right?

213
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,800
In order to maintain this peace, your help is necessary.

214
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
Please, help...

215
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,810
Ah, really...

216
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,860
Let's drink these and talk.

217
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,220
Oh, that's right!

218
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,940
One of my customers is a distant relative of the in-laws of the animal hospital director's wife.

219
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,310
Apparently, Director No was doing well as a brain disease specialist.

220
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,030
Really?  Then, why did he quit?

221
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,980
They say it was because of medical malpractice.

222
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,440
- Medical malpractice?! 
 - Yeah, I heard it too.

223
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,470
I heard that patients died because of that medical malpractice.

224
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,670
A high school alumnus of the director of the animal hospital

225
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,750
is a member who gets our green juice.

226
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,640
And that member said something strange.

227
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
Yes?

228
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,360
When the animals he has been raising die,

229
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,040
that... that is...

230
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,970
What is it?!  Seriously!

231
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,260
Look.

232
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,560
Taxidermy!

233
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,140
You heard, right?

234
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,250

235
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,280
No Poongsik stuffed all the animals he had been raising.

236
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,570
Come to think of it, there were a lot of stuffed animals in that lab.

237
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,970
Then, those weren't toys but he actually made them?

238
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,130
You can say that he never had a soul to begin with.

239
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,650
I entrusted my Kkotsoonee to that bastard!

240
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:02,710
 I have to find him quickly before he becomes a monster.

241
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,930
 The prime suspect of the so-called "shadow" missing person and murder case

242
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,690
 that occurred in the neighborhood of Gangrim City

243
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,300
 is currently on the run from the charge of abducting the body of his deceased wife.

244
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,600
 The whereabouts of Mr. No, the director of an animal hospital is still unknown.

245
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,640
 The police have been figuring out the route he's taking through the CCTVs

246
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,430
 and concentrating their efforts on chasing the suspect Mr. No.

247
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,910
 In order to accurately identify the cause of death,

248
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,320
 the police have asked the National Forensic Service to perform an autopsy on Mr. No's wife.

249
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,290
 Based on the fact that the body of Mr. No's wife has already been badly decomposed

250
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,910
 and the fact that her whereabouts had been unknown for several years,

251
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,450
 the police is deducing that Mr. No had her body for over 9 months

252
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,090
 and have relayed a message through sources that the police will thoroughly investigate the case.

253
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,770
Yes, the tripe combination?

254
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,170
Yes, thank you.

255
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,610
Boss, tripe combination to go, please.

256
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,840
Got it!

257
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,910

258
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,690
- Tripe is here.
 - Hi, Bora!

259
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,950
Oh, hello.  Let me help you with that heavy stuff, please.

260
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,280
You should be so diligent about agency work.

261
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,960
Are detectives having a friendly meeting or something?

262
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,170
You can say that it's a meeting for the good of the entire Gangrim City.

263
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,570
You know that we are going Dutch on the bill, don't you?

264
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,310
- I will buy, as usual. 
 - Oh~

265
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,580
Since when?  You always got treated.

266
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,750
President Kim, you cook well.

267
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,020
Bora's tripe is jjin!

268
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,650
What is jjin?

269
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,900
- The real deal. 
 - Woah, new generation.

270
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,280
There is a bit of a generation gap.

271
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,370
Ah, the three of us are the same age!

272
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,070
What?

273
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,680
Friends? 
  (T/N: people who are the same age are referred to as "friends.")

274
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,090
Please talk informally.

275
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,750
Yes, let's talk informally.

276
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,600
Okay.

277
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
But, it is worrisome...

278
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,220
No Poongsik, where he is and whom he is targeting.

279
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,710
So, were you able to find anything on No Poongsik?

280
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,830
Not yet.  None of the victims share anything in common.  He had attacked blindly.

281
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,010
The only thing we found out was that taxidermy was his hobby.

282
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,540
Taxidermy?!

283
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,400
Maybe he was going to stuff his deceased wife, too.

284
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,290
So delicious if I say so myself.

285
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,340
Wait. Then the reason No Poonsik risked becoming a zombie to escape was...

286
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,420
- When is the autopsy? 
 - Tomorrow.

287
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,810
Ah, to No Poonsik, his wife is his everything. As long as there's the body, he would do anything.

288
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,500
- I'm going to call the police right away. 
 - Oh, wow.

289
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,910
Yeah, you're right. Why don't we just call the police?

290
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,550
We can't do that. The police won't believe us.

291
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,160
Also, the involved police can be in danger, too. You said the autopsy is tomorrow, right?

292
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,910
Before then, we should swipe the body and lure No Poonsik.

293
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,340
Then we have to enter the morgue run by the city government. How do we do that?

294
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,660
The morgue...

295
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,650

296
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,710
You over there. One moment. One moment, please.

297
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,580
There's no reason a corpse would come in at this hour.

298
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,440
I thought the message had been received.

299
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,020
All right. Go on ahead, please.

300
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,390
Wait, please.

301
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,760
Didn't he just blink his eyes a moment ago?

302
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,200
What?

303
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,930
He definitely blinked.

304
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,260
I mean, what are you doing, it's creepy. It's a cadaver.

305
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,710
What's the cause of death?

306
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,990
That is...

307
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,040
 Look at this punk. Don't I get any privacy if I'm dead?

308
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,320
 Stop it, you punk. What are you looking at?

309
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,300
Wow, he is in great shape.

310
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,820
It was a gunshot.

311
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,510
I keep seeing things from several nights of overtime I've pulled.

312
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,560
Go on then.

313
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,770
Why don't you get some rest, huh?

314
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,990
Yes.

315
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,670
Where is it?

316
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,660
Is he a dog?

317
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,870
Amazing.

318
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,700
Hot! So hot! Ouch!

319
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,440
- Oh... are you okay? 
 - Do something. Help me, please.

320
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,900
- It's too hot! 
 - Ah right. This way...

321
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,230
Quickly. Quickly!

322
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,900
Wait!

323
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,910
I will handle my departure, so let's meet up by the car.

324
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,070
Be careful.

325
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,430
 It's his smell.

326
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,790
 He has become the perfect monster.

327
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,050
You have decided to give up becoming human?

328
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,040
No.

329
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,310
I decided to evolve as the stronger zombie.

330
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,890
You mean a crazy zombie, not a strong zombie.

331
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,780
Where is she?

332
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,460
Tell me.

333
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,230
Where is she?!

334
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,120
If you really want to see her, I'll arrange a meeting for you.

335
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,050
In hell...

336
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,130
You are too slow.

337
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,990
Won't you get on a treadmill like me?

338
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,720
How long has it been?

339
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,370
It's already been 5 minutes.

340
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,390
This won't do.

341
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,670
I have to get up there.

342
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,480
President Lee, you stick out like a sore thumb.

343
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,430
I am more suited for this.

344
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,490
Take care of yourself.

345
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,200
Be careful, pal.

346
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,050
I'll be back.

347
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,090
Hide that going in.

348
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,380
You know what your side effects are?

349
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:42,990
That is this useless E.M.O.T.I.O.N.

350
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,540
I will let you taste the same hell.

351
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,510
Boss!

352
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,090
Boss!

353
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,520
Let go of me!

354
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,060
Boss!

355
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,920

356
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,970
Where are you?

357
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,570
Kim Mooyoung!

358
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,840
What happened to Sunji?

359
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,110
No Poonsik took her.

360
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,440
- What?! 
 - Let's hurry.

361
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,050
I will drive since I know where it is.

362
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,470
Was this the place you came together?

363
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,170
I was curious as to what shenanigans you were pulling.

364
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,630
Look detective Cha. There's no time for—

365
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,200
Don't say anything further.

366
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,300
If you speak any further, you can become an accessory to a crime.

367
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,670
Right now, No Poongsik has Kong—

368
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,580
What's this?

369
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,060
Detective Cha, I can explain it all.

370
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,570
Hey!

371
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,660
First, let's find her.

372
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,470
All right.

373
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,000
What kind of zombie works so diligently like a human?

374
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,140
That rude bastard.

375
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,910
 It'll be good for you to come alone.

376
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,020
 If you want to save the remaining humans alive.

377
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,660
Detective, please, you have to believe me. A real zombie

378
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,260
appeared in our city. Zombie!

379
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,320
Zombie again.

380
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,610
If we were to prevent this disaster,

381
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:44,100
first, we have to resolve the conflict between zombies and humans. If we can't resolve it,

382
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,280
zombies and humans both can become victims.

383
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,270
Wow, that uncle watched a lot of movies.

384
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,050
That's right.

385
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:57,270
I am the director Lee Taekyun who made the film "Busan Express."

386
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,680
Ah... you are that director guy.

387
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,520
Let me just ask you one thing.

388
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,780
Go on, please.

389
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,380
If perhaps,

390
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,960
I'm saying let's just suppose that the perpetrator is a zombie.

391
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:17,390
If it's a zombie, he should be bitten and have become infected to become a zombie, so

392
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,660
why are the victims all perfectly normal?

393
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,850
That is a real good question.

394
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,670
It's because the zombie has chewed up

395
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,360
all of their brains. Through the brains

396
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,490
muscles can move like this— I'll sit.

397
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,830
Muscles can move, but since they are missing their brains,

398
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,100
there isn't any capacity for regeneration.

399
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,970
By the way, why would it eat the brains?

400
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,530
That is...

401
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,520
the survival instinct of self-preservation.

402
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,920
Why? Because there's a shortage in food.

403
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,340
Have you ever seen a zombie movie?

404
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,420
In order to eat a human,

405
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,250
a zombie would...

406
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,640
prowl...

407
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,190
- prowling. 
 - Ah, no...no

408
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,690
Ah stop. Ah! I said stop!

409
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,580
- Seriously! 
 - Terrifying, right? This is only 30% scary.

410
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,390
Seriously.

411
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,360
Are you okay?

412
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:35,350
Do you know this? The one who brought you back to life was me.

413
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,670
Come to think of it now, it's pissing me off.

414
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,270
It appears you haven't gotten rid of the hope of becoming human again.

415
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,120
What to do? You can never return to being human again.

416
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,990
What?

417
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't see a particular reason to return to being human for myself.

418
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,340
I will send you to hell as ashes.

419
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,770
The place you were originally.

420
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,320
 I am the crazy bastard to have hoped momentarily

421
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,430
 from a human like this.

422
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,880
 Save me...

423
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Freeze.

424
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,230
Wha-What are you?

425
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,950
 (The head. The head!)

426
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,790
Freeze!

427
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:29,010
 (The head, I said. The head!)

428
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,870
Stop!

429
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,460
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

430
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,540
I thought he was shot just a moment ago?

431
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,930
Will you now believe me?

432
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,010
Then your boss is also... a zombie?

433
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,010
No Poongsik killed Kim Mooyoung. And...

434
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:28,260
he made the boss that way, too.

435
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,960
Hey, release me.

436
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,510
- Uh, right. 
 - Quickly!

437
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,790
Quickly!

438
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,700
Do you know what your wife really wanted?

439
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,740
To run away from you, that's what.

440
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,770
Though she wished for death, she couldn't die. And if she had to continue to stay next to you as a monster,

441
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,260
she'd rather die.

442
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,740
Did you know that?

443
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,640
You psycho bastard.

444
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,280
SHUT UP!!

445
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,400
Do you think that your pitiful self can shoot me?

446
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,110
You can NEVER kill me.

447
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,140
When did I say I'd kill you?

448
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,320
What's that? Aren't they also zombies?

449
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,850
They're human.

450
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,970
What's this?

451
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,000
My next door neighbors.

452
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,850
What's this?

453
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,760
Wear it first. I'll explain later.

454
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,820
 What happened to Sunji?

455
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,740
  - No Poongsik took her. 
 - What?

456
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,500
 He asked that I bring him his wife's body, but alone.

457
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,740
 Why don't you two stay here, since it's dangerous? I'll go alone.

458
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,850
 Look here. You saved me last time.

459
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,870
 It's my turn this time. I can't send you alone.

460
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,090
 Let's go together. We are neighbors.

461
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,140
 That rude bastard! Without a goodbye...

462
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,060
 Anyhow, whenever I plan stuff with him, it doesn't feel that great.

463
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,260
 Tell President Kim that we are starting our plan.

464
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,370
 I already contacted her. All we have to do is go now.

465
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,280
 Oh, it's up. Man, why did it have to be a couple app?

466
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,360
 My Man is Lee Dongjoon.

467
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,110
 My Ma— My Man? Is that you?

468
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,570
 Me?

469
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,020
 President Kim!

470
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,180
 What happened?

471
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,620
 When I analyzed that liquid Sunji sent me,

472
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,660
 it turned out to be an animal tranquilizer.

473
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,300
 (He) will sleep well for about an hour.

474
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,250
 One hour.

475
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,350
 I leave you to take care of the last bit.

476
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,870
 Don't you worry.

477
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,710
 I will take care of it.

478
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:50,580
 He can't drive. Give me the car key.

479
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,450
♫   Ghostbusters!   ♫

480

♫   If there's something strange in your neighborhood   ♫

484
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,090

♫   Who you gonna call?   ♫

486
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,120
♫   Ghostbusters!   ♫

487
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,430
♫   I ain't afraid of no ghost   ♫

488
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,420
We can take these off now.

489
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,530
Kim Mooyoung, you all right?

490
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,840
This time I did the deed.

491
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,520
Boss, are you okay?

492
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,870
Speaking of, how are you?

493
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,180
I'm fine.

494
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,770
Let me get this.

495
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,850
You are alleging zombie No Poonsik ate the people?

496
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:10,010
Will people believe this? You are saying it's a zombie?

497
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,520
You said you only believe what you can see, correct?

498
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,930
Can't you believe even after seeing this?

499
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,910
Let's go to the station first and be investigated.

500
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,080
What police station? If he were to go in his current state, what would you talk about?

501
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,820
Why don't you just drag this thing over?

502
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,000
Boss!

503
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,680
Get off him.

504
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,230
This is my last warning.

505
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,430
You think you're going to kill me?

506
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,250
No matter what, you are merely a zombie like me

507
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,480
who has to eat humans to live.

508
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,190
 I am a zombie.

509
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,540
 Though I wished to become human in a human world...

510
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:17,590
 Take a breath for me, Mister!

511
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,670
 ...I couldn't become human in the end.

512
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:25,430
 To be sure, how would becoming a human be easy?

513
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,870
 Even among humans, there are many who had given up on being a human,

514
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:32,250
 or haven't quite become a human yet.

515
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,620
Boss, are you all right?

516
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,790
Detective Kim! It was just self-defense.

517
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,650
You didn't do anything wrong. You are in the right.

518
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,750
♫  I'll never hurt you again  ♫

519
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,930
 However, it's strange.

520
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,750
♫  Even if there is no one, I'll be okay  ♫

521
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,500
 A zombie doesn't feel any pain,

522
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,800
 yet I ache.

523
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,450
♫  Like the setting sun  ♫

524
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:12,190
 Are you all right?

525
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,220
 Though a zombie doesn't possess a heart,

526
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,130
 why am I so nervous?

527
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,340
When the investigation concludes, it will be discovered that the one who killed Kim Mooyoung was No Poongsik.

528
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,270
So, so it will all be all right.

529
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,850
Detective Cha! You saw it all, right?

530
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:33,180
He will testify all. You are absolutely fine.

531
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,770
If it weren't for you, Detective Kim, the whole of Gangrim City would have become an ocean of blood.

532
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,190
Don't blame yourself too much.

533
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,240
He is right.

534
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,080
There won't be any more humans getting hurt because of a zombie.

535
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,880
♫   I'm living my life today   ♫

536
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,160
Because there won't be any more zombies

537
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,380
in Gangrim City...

538
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,560
Right, since this guy died—

539
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,260
What... What do you mean by that?

540
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,530
You are not alluding to your departure or anything, are you?

541
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,710
It's all over now, no?

542
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,730
It's because it's too difficult for me to live here.

543
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,050
It's not easy for a zombie to blend into the human world.

544
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:24,730
I mean, the rent, association fees, BB Cream, the chicken expenses... ugh.

545
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:26,720
I just prefer the mountain.

546
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,070
The mountain is perfect for a zombie to live in.

547
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,620
The police will be arriving shortly.

548
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,320
No. Don't do it.

549
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,590
Kong Sunji, I appreciate what you did all this time.

550
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:49,960
♫  I was just fine, as if nothing was wrong  ♫

551
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,810
If it weren't for you,

552
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:59,890
I would not have found my past. The same goes for my mom.

553
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,950
You need to stop your meddlesome ways.

554
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,360
You would have been eaten already if the zombie was other than me.

555
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:13,240
Why are you crying?

556
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,440
Hey, now.

557
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,000
♫  The time we were actually together  ♫

558
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,180
♫  A world without you  ♫

559
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,310
Hyung!

560
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:29,030
Don't go.

561
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,320
Why the tears...

562
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,000
What's with all this public display of...

563
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,800
Let me in on it, too.

564
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:43,170
♫  I’m just talking about us back then  ♫

565
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,440
♫  I’m always thankful that it was you  ♫

566
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,000
♫  And I’m sorry that it was me  ♫

567
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,540
Let us know which mountain you're going to.

568
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:58,480

569
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,470
 That was the last day I saw the boss.

570
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,200
How come he still kept these kinds of clothes?

571
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:34,930
♫  Another day passes and pretends it's okay  ♫

572
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:42,600
♫  I don't want anyone to see my tears  ♫

573
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,160
 As for me, this is all I have...

574
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,370
 Won't you go to a sauna or something?

575
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:54,670
♫  Tell me that it will be okay  ♫

576
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,920
I guess that was the boss.

577
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:05,910
♫  Heartbreaking through countless nights  ♫

578
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,350
♫  I think it's going to be dull now  ♫

579
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:12,920

580
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,250
  - And then we...   
 - Why aren't you coming in?

581
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,460
 - ...kept on living where we left off.  
 - Why would we come here?

582
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,080
Don't you know how expensive it is here?

583
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,770
Then, are you going to continue rolling your hair with the toilet paper roll?

584
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:24,260
For the price of a perm, all four of us can fill our bellies with grilled pork belly.

585
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,370
- No, I can't, I can't, I can't go. 
 - Common, let's go.

586
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:28,680
I can't.

587
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,740
 Welcome!

588
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,070
 Brother-in-Law took my sister to a beauty parlor for the first time in 10 years.

589
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,800
What would you like to have done?

590
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,190
Kindly give me a perm that won't lax for at least 10 years!

591
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:45,230
Please do a complete makeover to a style that shouts luxury and elegance.

592
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,040
A total opposite of your style would do.

593
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,010
Such a kidder!

594
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,120
I am serious.

595
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,780
We are finished!

596
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:15,520
 And my sister finally said goodbye to the toilet paper roller.

597
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,430

598
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,060
I didn't expect to actually receive this.

599
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:23,980
I thought it was only a dream.

600
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,690
 Finally, Brother-in-Law's time had come.

601
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,810
It's enough if there is even one person who has come to cheer for a zombie

602
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:34,530
after watching, then that's enough for me.

603
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:41,100
Also, my wife, Kong Sunyoung, who has suffered along with me,

604
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:46,440
you are the only forever heroine of my films.

605
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,580
 My sister who used to say she had permanent indigestion despite drinking all those probiotic drinks,

606
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,740
 commented how finally it felt all flushed.

607
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,260

608
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,390

609
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:04,430
 I hope that I can speak for the lone zombies who may exist in the world.

610
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,490
 Today, I...

611
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,870
Mister, you're the best!

612
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,500
 Thank you!

613
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,410
- Dad, you are the best! 
 - Mister, you are the best!

614
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,340
Awesome!

615
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,900
Thank you, guys.

616
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,910
 Brother-in-Law continues to dream about meeting a zombie.

617
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:26,330
 Not realizing that he has already spent many special days with a zombie.

618
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,860

619
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,890
Honey, don't you think it's cool?

620
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:39,700
What about our wedding picture?

621
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,970
I removed it.

622
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:46,810
From now on, the zombie will bring happiness and peace to our family.

623
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,770
Even so, you would remove our wedding picture?

624
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:54,350
I thought it was quiet around here these days. Didn't you say I was the heroine of your films?

625
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,730
There are two main characters. Two.

626
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,900
Man, oh man. I just can't even.

627
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,200
Still, you love me.

628
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,800
What bull crap are you...

629
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,370
- Love! Love! 
 - My gosh.

630
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,890
- You're too much. 
 - I'll put it back near it.

631
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:19,420
 Ordinary lives we lead arguing and fighting tumultuously

632
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,760
 was said to be the most envious state for someone.

633
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,500
 Thank you.

634
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,500
 Detective Bae, who was in critical condition, recovered safely.

635
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,040
How are you doing?

636
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,660
I am well.

637
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,830
What happened with Reporter Kong?

638
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,120
Sunji and I are friends.

639
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,570
- Eh? 
 - Friends.

640
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:48,300
- What? 
 - I said friends.

641
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,470
I don't need this. Won't you give it to Reporter Kong?

642
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,410
Come on! What's up?

643
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:59,500
What's this romantic atmosphere, eh?

644
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,630
Got close?

645
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,930
- It's not what it looks like. 
 - Wow, you are coming right at...

646
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,100
- Nah. It's not what you think. 
 - Wow... as for me,

647
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,170
- I am opposed to this! 
 - Oh, yeah. Me too!

648
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,120
Why are you teasing me?

649
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,930
 Dohyun stopped talking about the boss from that day forth.

650
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:17,530
 The only thing he says is that he still finds zombies rather scary.

651
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:21,300

652
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,110
It's our one-year anniversary event already. Time sure flies.

653
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,380
Boss, will you be running the zombie dance event again?

654
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,770
Of course!

655
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:36,910
Zombies can't be excluded in a tripe restaurant.

656
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,850
Are you all right?

657
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,170
Wang Wei?

658
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:01,300
I heard you went to Yanbian,  so what brings you here? 
  (T/N: a city in China, that borders N. Korea and Russia)

659
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,590
I came to find the Korean Dream.

660
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,070
And so?

661
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,770
Don't you think you came back a little late?

662
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,030
 In the fall of his 30th year, Wang Wei

663
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,140
 professed (his love).

664
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,000
Gosh! Not a single employee I like.

665
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,710
 Though President Lee dreamed of becoming the number one detective agency in Gangrim City...

666
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,670
- Boss! 
 - Wang Wei!

667
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,680
Look here!

668
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,200
You became quite stylish, huh?

669
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,790
So, how are things at the Yanbian branch?

670
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:39,230
There are too many clients to the point of being short-handed. How are things in Korea?

671
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:43,600
Don't even mention it. Ever since the detective agencies became legal, there's an outpouring of requests.

672
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,800
As you stated, World King Detective Agency is truly spreading throughout the world.

673
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,010
I told you it would be so.

674
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,630
 He is dreaming of becoming number one in the world.

675
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,850
Why is the office as I left it? I sent you so much money.

676
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,440
I like to keep things vintage.

677
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,690
Also, we should conserve it.

678
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,160
It brings back memories to see you.

679
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:07,320
I miss even Detective Kim.

680
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:12,380
There will never exist another zombie so kind-hearted in the entire world.

681
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,420

682
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,710

Hey, Detective Kong!

683
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,980
Hello, President Lee!

684
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,660
Wang Wei!!

685
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,980
You've become quite fashionable.

686
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,180
Howdy.

687
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,800
Or may have become weirder...

688
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,930
Take care.

689
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:42,110
 After the boss left the agency, there was an abundance of clients seeking help from the Kim Mooyoung office.

690
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,780

691
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,420
 That is why I took over the Kim Mooyoung detective agency.

692
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,120
 Of course, with the help of the business loan from the bank.

693
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:04,100
Yes, this is the office of Detective Kong Sunji.

694
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,190
A murder case, you say?

695
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,490
Yes.

696
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,670
Ten years ago?

697
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:16,110
The victim is your father?

698
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:19,370

699
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,860
Yes. I see.

700
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,690
Yes.

701
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,290
Uh-huh.

702
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,670
Don't worry. I will certainly help you.

703
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,050
 There are so many humans more rotten than zombies in the world,

704
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,540
 and I will never cease catching those rotten humans

705
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,360
 as I did with the boss.

706
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,190
 I wonder... if the boss is doing well.

707
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,440
Huh?

708
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:08,160
Halloween Party?

709
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,560
Let's go. One, two...

710
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,220
Being as it is Halloween, all the monsters in the world are gathered here.

711
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:36,400
Hey, Dohyun! Dohyun!

712
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,340
What brought on this sudden Halloween party? It's not even all that fun.

713
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,070
Why did you ask to come here?

714
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,250
Ugh, he's having the most fun but he complains.

715
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,360
What? Is someone else joining us?

716
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,340
- Huh? 
 - I said, is someone else joining us?

717
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:52,270
Nah, not at all.

718
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:56,500
If I'd known this place was so much fun! You should have brought me here sooner.

719
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,040
Over here! Right over here!

720
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,520
Wang Wei is here!

721
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,110
You wore it like you promised.

722
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:11,450
What!  Is a watchman allowed to be so cute!

723
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,360
Don't misunderstand. We are the same age.

724
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,870
Nah, I wouldn't think otherwise.

725
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,760
Then won't the peers of the same age have fun together? I'll take myself out of the equation.

726
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,190
I now have no regret. I didn't get blocked at the entrance.

727
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:25,620
 Love Halloween!

728
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,600
He is alone because he can't date.

729
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,110
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on, Dohyun!

730
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,600
Won't you go ahead and have fun? I'll follow you in a sec.

731
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:51,200
 Boss?

732
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,150
Boss!

733
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,030
I'm sorry.

734
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:15,970
Excuse me...

735
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:18,070
 Finally... we are meeting.

736
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,960
How have you been?

737
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,800
It's all the same for zombies.

738
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,010
And you?

739
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:34,520
Me, too... Oh, what about your meals?

740
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,350
Are you taking care of your meals all right?

741
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:40,200
Right. So these days, there's this thing called "bullet express delivery," so they can deliver the chicken they slaughter in the morning,

742
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,240
in the evening, and whatnot.

743
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,410
What about your love life? Do you have a girlfriend?

744
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,190
That's sudden.

745
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,890
For real, you've got to stop watching those weird dramas and movies.

746
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:01,890
Those kinds of things are the foundation of your ruin. What dating life would a zombie have?!

747
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,610
This!

748
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:10,410
What's this?

749
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:14,970
Don't you remember this? You know at the entrance of Cheowol mountain about 2 1/2 years ago.

750
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:18,670
I was all like "you are an alcoholic!"

751
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,010
Was that you?

752
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,320
Did you know?

753
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:33,500
Then, why didn't you use it?

754
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:40,320
Well, because I thought it was the first consideration a human showed towards me since becoming a zombie.

755
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,120
Seeing as that was the thought behind it, I couldn't use it.

756
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,300
And you, stop doing those things.

757
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,810
Don't you know how horrid the world is these days to just approach a stranger

758
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,640
and speak to them and give them money. It would be the worst for you.

759
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,200
Ah, I guess nothing bad would happen to you.

760
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,380
I'm just saying that's the conventional saying...

761
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,730
Just saying... God, don't curse.

762
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,030
- Don't you worry. 
 - I don't worry.

763
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,940
Do people ever change? Where will your meddling ever go?

764
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,750
So...

765
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,110
Why do you keep taking things out of there?

766
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:18,510
The one that gave this card to that meddlesome person was you. Right, Boss?

767
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,670
Oh-ho, why do you keep raising and putting down the glass you can't even drink out of?

768
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,060
I'm just smelling the scent because it smells nice.

769
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:33,010
So, why did you send this card? Was it because you missed me?

770
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,290
That probably wasn't the reason.

771
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:40,260
Did you eat something bad today? Why are you carrying on like this? Could it ever be that?

772
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,040
It's just to ask you first.

773
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:51,240
I'm looking for this person and I need your help.

774
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:53,320
Who is this?

775
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,710
This person is...

776
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,420
not someone in Korea but in Atlanta (Georgia) in America.

777
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,520
I heard that he is working on medicine that converts zombies back to humans.

778
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,680
 Naturally, the boss never gave up on becoming a human.

779
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,240
A person is two thousand, an animal is two hundred.

780
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,720
Are you asking me to pay?

781
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:22,750
 What happened?

782
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:28,290
Come on, what? I decided never to involve myself in the lives of humans.

783
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,330
If you solve this case, I'll charge only 50% of the consulting fee.

784
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,010
- Discount, 70%! 
 - 60%.

785
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:38,990
Deal.

786
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:40,830
 Is it a real corpse?

787
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,940
 - What is it? 
 - What's going on?

788
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,190
  - It's not from a shock?  
 - One moment, please.

789
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,090
One moment, please.

790
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,740
 What's this? Shouldn't we report this?

791
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,500
 Isn't that person dead?

792
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,810
 Is that a real corpse?

793
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,130
 This smell...

794
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,540
 A person killed a person... again.

795
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:29,330
The perpetrator is...

796
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:39,640

797
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,150

798
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Final Credits

799
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:05,060
Final Credits

800
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:11,100
Final Credits

801
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:17,150
Final Credits

802
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:23,110
Final Credits

803
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:27,810
Final Credits

804
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,230

01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:56,680
