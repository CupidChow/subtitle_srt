1
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,600

2
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,760
That's crazy.

3
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,190
- Is this fun to you? 
 - Yes.

4
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:39,520
Didn't I tell you? I'm a maniac for horror films.

5
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,830
Turn it off already. I can't watch it anymore.

6
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,630
Yeah, I'm sick of it, too.

7
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,000
It's okay. I act out when I get drunk, too.

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,120
- How can you compare the two? 
 - They're simi—

9
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,720
There is a solution.

10
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,730

11
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,410
Son, I'll make you some delicious fried rice.

12
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,950
Okay, Mom.

13
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,010
What the— Where did all the frying pans go?

14
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,430
Honey, there was no washcloth in the bathroom.

15
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,180
Auntie took it with her before.

16
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,240
- Why? 
 - Gong Sunji.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,980
This brat...

18
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,970
Dad, why is this—

19
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,200
- What? It's growing so well. 
 - What is it?

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,890
- Before, you... 
 - Wow.

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,460
These are too weak.

22
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,740
You're going to hit the back of my head with these?

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,240
I don't think that's right.

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,450
No matter what I might do, this is a bit... I'm not a mole.

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,960
These are all meant for the apocalypse.

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,800
For the sake of peace in Gangrim City,

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,970
for the sake of you!

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,910
What is this? Why is it so heavy?

29
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:52,640
That...well... I used to be a shot put athlete.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,140
Like this, and like that. What do you think?

31
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,090
Don't do that. I'm losing my appetite. Stop it.

32
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,450
Just watching me, it makes you suppress your anger?

33
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,930
Then let's keep this... and this.

34
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,850
Which one do you prefer? You may feel a bit of pain either way,

35
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,380
but we may as well pick the one you want.

36
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,410
- I think both will be pretty good. 
 - You're having the time of your life right now.

37
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,980
Go with this one. The frying pan makes me feel weird.

38
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,550
Deal.

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,660
Is this the right tactic?

40
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,460
So, if you don't want to get hit in the back of your head again, eat the raw chicken and beef tripe regularly.

41
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,690
I think, the more sated you are,

42
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,720
the more your temptation for humans goes down.

43
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,690
- Go. 
 - Me?

44
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,600
- Then should I go? 
 - I will go.

45
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,030
Hello, this is Kim Mooyoung Detective Agency.

46
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,930
The president?

47
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,770
One moment, please.

48
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,970
Hello? This is Kim Mooyoung.

49
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Please speak.

50
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,760
What is it? You can't hear?

51
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,610
He's not saying anything. Hello?

52
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,080
What the hell?

53
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,510

54
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,570
I think it will be best to put a hold on working for now.

55
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,140
Even if I can stop you temporarily with the frying pan,

56
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,570
we should find a permanent solution before we resume business.

57
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,600
There's something I have to do before that.

58
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,140
I could use your help.

59
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,970
You're the only human

60
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,360
I can trust right now.

61
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,440
Well, if you're asking me that so earnestly, sadly,

62
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,190
and sincerely, I think I could help you.

63
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,460
- What is it? 
 - Kim Mooyoung.

64
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,350
Thanks to him, I found my past and the man who killed me.

65
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,810
I feel it's time to repay my debt.

66
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,890
Kim Mooyoung. Thirty-two years old.

67
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,170
His only family member was his father who passed away two years ago.

68
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,300
He went to visit his father that day when he was murdered.

69
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,350
That's why no family members stopped by.

70
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,950
- And? 
 - And...

71
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,180
I found this as I was cleaning the office.

72
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,960
A receipt for a hair salon.

73
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,410
That's it.

74
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,040
The end?

75
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,660
You've been here for so long, yet this is all you have?

76
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,230
That's why I'm asking you for help.

77
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,390

78
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,960
Black bean noodles must be eaten with kimchi.

79
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,880
Maybe it's because the kimchi was made with ground Cheongyang chilli pepper but it tastes amazing.

80
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,400
You've become a full Korean now. There are people who don't know

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,730
so they eat pickled radish with Jjajangmyeon.

82
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,200
- But... 
 - Welcome. How can we help you?

83
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,750
Welcome, Sir. What brings you here?

84
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,000
It's been a while, Sungrok.

85
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,910
- Sir. 
 - Who is he?

86
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,590
Say hello. He's a hyungnim I respect.

87
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,270
Hey.

88
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,100
I heard you were working with a young, cute friend. Did he quit?

89
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,320
This is him.

90
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,480
I see you're making enough to get by, at least.

91
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,810
This is the best we could do, Sir.

92
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,430
Do you know how sad I was when I heard you went to prison?

93
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,100
I couldn't sleep at night because of it. If I knew you were coming, I would have prepared your favorite Mapo tofu.

94
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,420
Come have a drink.

95
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,070
 (What's this?) 
 (I don't know.)

96
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,190
- Sungrok. 
 - Yes, Sir?

97
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,080
That guy over there. Who is he?

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,170
You mean Kim Mooyoung?  He is the only one in Gangrim City who is in the same business.  Nothing more, nothing less.

99
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:58,640
From his perspective, he seems to trust and follow me respectfully. I just see him as a rookie detective.

100
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,660
- That's Kim Mooyoung? 
 - Yes, Sir.

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm sorry, but why do you ask?

102
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,970
I heard about him in prison. I wanted to see him for myself.

103
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,940
Wow, Kim Mooyoung really is amazing if he's talked about in prison.

104
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,500
- Sungrok. 
 - Yes, Sir?

105
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,060
- I have some work for you. 
 - Yes, Sir.

106
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,920
What work is it?

107
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,570

108
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,920
It's this place. This is the last place Kim Mooyoung went, one week before he was murdered.

109
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,410
Let's go in and confirm for now.

110
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,040
- Oh, you made sure to eat, right? 
 - Don't worry.

111
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,630
I stuffed myself to the point I thought my stomach would burst.

112
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,970
But why are we following Kim Mooyoung?

113
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,830
Hyungnim must have something big in mind.

114
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,150
So, we're doing this without even knowing why?

115
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,220
Is he really such an amazing person to you?

116
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,500
To me, he is my savior.

117
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,970
My only family,

118
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,750
Kkotsoonee (Flower girl).

119
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,610
My beloved Kkotsoonee...

120
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,040
He was with her when she crossed the rainbow bridge.

121
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,180
Hyungnim...

122
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,120
tried until the very end to save my Kkotsoonee.

123
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,290
Are you crying now?

124
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,160
No.

125
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,400
I, Lee Sungrok, never cry.

126
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't talk nonsense and starting from now we are moving in the northeasterly direction.

127
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,890
Remember that a detective can never let others discover what he's doing.

128
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,100
Aren't we already too obvious?

129
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,120
Okay, let's move again.

130
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,630
 - Let's go to the arcade today. 
 - I am good with that.

131
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,140
- What is that? 
 - Wow!

132
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,890
- The boxes are moving on their own. 
 - Woah!

133
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,960
 - Darn you! 
 - Hey, let's defeat them.

134
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,220
 - Yes, let's defeat them! 
 - Okay!

135
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,170
  - Take this! 
 - Take this!

136
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,880
Hey!  Aren't you going to be quiet?!

137
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,490
Hey, young friends, we are working now so go over there and play.

138
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,220
 - Yes, let's defeat them! 
 - Yes! 
 - Woah!

139
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,490
 Take this!

140
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,740
Yeah, he's that young man from that time.

141
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,040
- Do you remember him? 
 - Sure I do.  He didn't do his hair but just had his beard trimmed.

142
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,350
Then, he just trimmed his beard and there was nothing unusual?

143
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,690
Ah, he did ask about Director No.

144
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,280
Director No?

145
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,310
The director of the animal hospital across the street.

146
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,630
I said bye to my Chorong last year.

147
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,070
Director No...

148
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,800
is not a human.  Not a human...

149
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,280
He is an angel. He takes in all strays in the neighborhood and raises them.

150
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,290
But didn't you say that Director No got arrested?

151
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,000
You know, they say he dumped something in the mountain.

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,550
Illegal... drugs or something...

153
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,750
- You mean illegal medical waste? 
 - Yeah!  That's right!

154
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,150
There is also the talk that he was framed.

155
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:16,150
Hey, ladies!  Is our Director No someone who can do something like that?!  He is all about taking care of the animals.

156
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,320
Of course!  He can't even kill an ant.

157
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,870
After his daughter went missing, he almost lost his will to live.

158
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,000
He was looking terrible.

159
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,850
His daughter went missing?  When was that?

160
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,230
Maybe about five years ago...

161
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,330
 It must have been so tough for him to raise a daughter on his own without a wife.

162
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,030
 The wife ran off with another man in the middle of the night.

163
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,730
 - You are saying something that hasn't even been confirmed. 
 - Did I make it up?!

164
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,900
 All the neighbors... know it.

165
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,460
But the living somehow move on, I guess.

166
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,350
- Thank you for your help. 
 - Thank you.

167
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,930
- Aren't you going to get a perm? 
 - It's not time for me to get my hair done yet.

168
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:05,050
How about you, young man? Aren't you interested in getting a perm?  I think my perm will look good on you.

169
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,820
Yes, why don't you take this opportunity to change your style.  Make it stylish.

170
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,550
I am not interested.  Thank you.

171
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,840
Thank you.  Wait for me.

172
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,190
 I should throw a bucket of salt. 
 (T/N: salt to ward off evil/unlucky spirits from returning.)

173
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,670
 That's what I say.  He is good-looking but prickly.

174
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,610
 Why did you let him go?!  You should've talked him into doing the perm!

175
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,860
- Welcome! 
 - If I may, I would like to ask you something.

176
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,120
Can you tell me what you talked about with the person who just left?

177
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,570
Why do you want to know?

178
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,190
I am this kind of person.

179
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:57,240
I am trying to prevent anything dangerous from happening, so I ask that you cooperate fully as a citizen of Gangrim City.

180
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,430
- A detective agency? 
 - Yes.

181
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, right.  Valuable information for free?

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,240
Information is the life for a detective agency.

183
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,350
It looks like it's time for a perm.

184
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,410
He says it's possible.

185
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,530
- Which seat? 
 - This way.

186
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,020
It looks like there is no one inside.

187
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,180
Maybe he hasn't been released yet.

188
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,390
 But this awful smell... I am sure I have smelled it before.

189
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,410
Boss, there.

190
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,270
 He must be the director.

191
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,130
 It's that punk.

192
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,680
He's the punk who killed Kim Mooyoung.

193
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,460
- Really? 
 - I am positive.

194
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,910
 He can't kill an ant but he killed a human.

195
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,410
What's he doing there?

196
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,760
First, I should send a picture to Hyungnim.

197
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,240
What's with this hair?  Who does hair like this nowadays?

198
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,480
It's okay.   In your 20s, anything looks good and cute.

199
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,590
Oh, cute.

200
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,140
You were cute just now.

201
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,800
It will look that way.

202
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,860
- Kim Mooyoung visited my hospital, is that it? 
 - Yes.

203
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,610
Like this.

204
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,450
Perhaps...

205
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,980
- did you see? 
 - See?  What do you mean, Hyungnim?

206
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,100
What I killed.

207
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,170
K-Killed?  What do you mean k-killed, Hyungnim?

208
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,630
Who are you talking about?

209
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,490
I was joking.  A joke.

210
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,580
Why would you make a scary joke like that?  I was surp—

211
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,780
I should pay properly for the labor.

212
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,340
Thank you, Hyungnim.

213
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,460
I would like for you to set up a meeting with Kim Mooyoung for me.

214
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,410
Yes, I'll tell him so, Hyungnim. I'll schedule a meeting.

215
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,910
As you know, I've only recently been released from jail, and many eyes are on me.

216
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,650
I can't personally get involved.

217
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,940
I hope you can bring (him) quietly to me.

218
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,170
I'm off.

219
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,210
How much is all of this? Don't you think we can even build a chain agency with this amount, Boss?

220
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,190
Right.

221
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,910
 A veterinarian who buried medical waste nearing 100 ton illegally in a wild hill in Kangrim City, Chowol boro—

222
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,100
Not too long after Kim Mooyoung was murdered by No Poongsik,

223
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,820
No Poongsik was arrested for illegal dumping of medical waste.

224
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:57,090
If so, could it be that what Detective Kim Mooyoung was investigating was related to medical waste dumping?

225
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,630
Possibly.

226
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,510
Oh my gosh, No Poongsik?

227
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,620
- Do you know No Poongsik? 
 - One of our regulars is an employee of the animal protection association.

228
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,500
And according to that person, No Poongsik is a nasty being that commits all sorts of brutalities

229
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,780
under the guise of protecting animals.

230
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,490
What are you referring to when you say brutalities?

231
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,650
Well, I'm not sure, but wouldn't it be something like animal cruelty and such?

232
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,980
Did you enjoy the Gob-chang (intestine) I gave you last?

233
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,770
Yes. I enjoyed them.

234
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,960
Ah, have you any other information on No Poongsik?

235
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,610
I don't have any.

236
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,150
Specifically which part of the Gob-chang (intestine) do you prefer the most?

237
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,520
Intestine? Gut?

238
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,670
Last viscus?

239
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,210
 If it's human, it doesn't matter what kind he/she is.

240
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm going to take my leave.

241
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,730
- So suddenly? 
 - Won't you go home from here?

242
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,680
- You... You worked hard today. 
 - Come again!

243
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
You saw it too just now, didn't you? He was so shy he couldn't even meet my eyes.

244
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,510
Totally cute! I wanna bite!

245
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,370
You're going to really get bitten like that.

246
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,040
Totally. I'm totally going out of my mind, wanting to get bitten...!

247
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,470
Yep. Crazy all right.

248
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,090
 If I stayed in there any longer, there's no telling what I'd do.

249
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,800
Sunji said you were on a trip to the States.

250
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,110
Is it that you are already back or never did go on that trip?

251
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,340
Oh, I somehow couldn't. Then...

252
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,700
Mr. Kang Minho.

253
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:06,230
By chance, do you know someone by the name of Kang Minho?

254
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,040
It's just that I recently saw a man who looks exactly like you,

255
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,340
someone named Kang Minho.

256
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,040
Perhaps, have you heard that name?

257
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,520
I am not sure.

258
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,550
What do you think?  Doesn't he look exactly like you?

259
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,330
He really does.

260
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,010
People might think he's a twin or a doppelgänger.

261
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,010
Don't you have a brother who's been hidden,

262
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,540
or a birth secret?

263
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,590
No, I don't have any.

264
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,420
For now, he's missing, but we will need to further investigate.

265
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,290
If we don't give up and continue investigating we might find even a small clue.

266
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,260
And that's my job as well.

267
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,170
Yes, sure.

268
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,400
I am...

269
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,040
always watching you...

270
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,560
You do know that, don't you?

271
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,930
I didn't know that you were that interested in me. Then...

272
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,570
- So? 
 - I thought about doing something.

273
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:38,560
- Dohyun! 
 - Detective Cha!

274
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,800
It's been a while.

275
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,520
It has.

276
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,390
I just saw President Kim Mooyoung.

277
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,750
Do you have a new client?

278
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,550
- No. 
 - Nowadays, she— 
 - Hey!

279
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,140
You are looking prettier.

280
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,300
Bora keeps getting prettier, right?

281
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,630
- Me? 
 - Yeah. 
 - Is that right?

282
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,050
We are temporarily closed.

283
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,520
Ah, I just saw Boss just for a bit.

284
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,870
We are not digging up any case.  Never.

285
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,380
You haven't forgotten what happened last time, have you?

286
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,610
Don't ever take dangerous work.

287
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,260
Of course not.  It's been a while so should we have some tripe together?

288
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,040
Tripe?  Deal!

289
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,040
- I will bring it. 
 - That's great! It should be tasty.

290
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,730
Those damned investors.

291
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,440
How could this scenario not be fun?  It doesn't make sense.

292
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,600
 Before my identity gets discovered,

293
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,280
 I should quickly repay my debt to Kim Mooyoung.

294
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,090
President!  I meet you here.

295
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,360
Were you visiting some place?

296
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,320
I've been meeting investors.

297
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,980
Then...

298
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,650
Would you please listen?

299
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,480
 This human... really is tenacious.

300
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,600
This scenario... I am really confident.

301
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,830
Please, just once.

302
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,310
The Joseon era as the background,

303
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:42,620
a superb historical horror work that will chill your insides.

304
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,290
It's a story about a filial daughter

305
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,610
who nurses her sick father.

306
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,710
A historical fiction, again?

307
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,160
I took "Korean Ghost Stories" and made a 2020 version.

308
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,130
Everyday, she would get medicinal herbs from the mountain for her father

309
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,990
and put care into preparing the tonic for him.

310
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,120
 - This is driving me crazy.  
  - And... there was someone watching her.

311
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,300

312
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,340
 Father.

313
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,060
 I brought your medicine.

314
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,460
The tonic she prepared had a fatal flaw.

315
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,180
It was sooooo bitter.

316
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,790
  - Bitter. 
 - Bitter?

317
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,330
And then, the devoted daughter handed him a mint candy.

318
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,370
Were there mint candies during Joseon Dynasty?

319
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,540
This is a fusion period piece.

320
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,150
One day, to this wretched daughter,

321
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:10,730
one monk approached.

322
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,420
 Though there is a road, it is the road unable to be taken,

323
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,860
 what good is it to know that road?

324
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,920
 Still, if there is a way,

325
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,950
 please tell me the way.

326
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,990
 Cut off the leg of a person who's been dead for three days,

327
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,500
 boil the leg, and feed it to him.

328
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,200
 Your father's illness may be cured.

329
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,950
 Dead person's leg...

330
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,750
 Father!

331
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,800
 Father! Father!!

332
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,270
She makes a stout resolution for her father.

333
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,400
 In the deep of the night,

334
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,990
holding a knife unknown to anyone

335
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,830
she takes the mountainside road.

336
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,140
A few days ago, a body of a young man who died due to the epidemic

337
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,170
was disposed around here somewhere.

338
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,880
Finally, the place she arrives at is a shrine.

339
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,190
It's the cadaver!

340
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,860
She closed her eyes tightly,

341
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,300
and starts to saw off the cadaver's leg.

342
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,550
Swish. Swish. Swish...

343
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,460
Swish.

344
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,010
 That's my leg. Where is my leg?

345
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,020
 Where is my LEG???

346
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,770
 My leg!

347
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,580
 My leg!

348
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,670
 My leg. My leg!!

349
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,390
Isn't that too fast for a clop-clop one legged run?

350
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,970
It's because... before his death, the cadaver was a track athlete.

351
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,450
If he were a track athlete, I guess his leg was like his life.

352
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,850
 It's mine. Give me my leg back! Give me my leg back!

353
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,160
However, the eldest daughter of K's resolve was also unmatched.

354
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,780
 Give it back. Give back my leg!

355
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,910
The devoted daughter starts to beat (the cadaver) with the leg as if it was her own.

356
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,420
I bet it's pretty crappy to get beaten with your own leg.

357
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,940
 Give me my leg back!  My leg! My leg!

358
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,800
This is all because of her filial thought to save her father.

359
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,650
Come on. Come on.

360
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,000
Finally, even the cadaver gives up his leg to the devoted daughter's resolve.

361
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,450
 Father.

362
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,820
Just  like that, she

363
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,240
boils the cadaver's leg and makes the medicine with all her heart.

364
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,070
However, the father who drank that medicine...

365
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,670
 Father...

366
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,350
...becomes the Zombie of Joseon Dynasty.

367
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:30,620
 Come here. Give me your leg. Give over your leg to me!

368
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,230
Give me your leg! Give me your leg!!

369
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,690
This movie (is about) cadaver defiling and body stealing

370
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,940
and the awareness towards tomb raiding and dead bodies...

371
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,460
To sum it up, (it emphasizes) the zombie's dignity is also very

372
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,630
important. That's the main point.

373
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,360
What do you think?

374
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm sorry but I'm not all that interested in a horror movie.

375
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,930
Let me make myself scarce.

376
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:13,150
Pr-Pr-President! I have many other genres, too...

377
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,270
Why didn't he tell me in advance that he didn't like any of them?

378
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,870
I've put so much into explaining...

379
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,880
Are you sure it'd be okay?

380
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,870
It's the only measure.

381
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,490
With one of these, you can die on the spot.

382
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,980
If you were to kick the bucket like this...

383
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,280
Don't worry. It's not enough to kill me.

384
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,750
I tested it out before, and the (amount) is just enough to lose consciousness.

385
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,670
Do you really have to go this far?

386
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,730
If we can't take away Kim Mooyoung without anyone unaware,

387
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,760
we could die without a trace.

388
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,580
Do you mean by that hyungnim Poongsik?

389
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,760
That hyungnim divides mankind into two segments: one is beast

390
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,200
and the other is beast with a human mask.

391
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,000
To that hyungnim, all humans are beasts.

392
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,230

393
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,420
Let's await the chance.

394
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,640
A-Ar-Arrive—

395
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,560
A-Arrived.

396
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,320
Arrived. He arrived.

397
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,430

398
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,380
Sis, Sis! Ah, Sis!

399
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,860
Where did you hide it?

400
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,390
Did you swap it for sticky candy? Did you sell it to the pawnshop?

401
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,040
Ouch, Sis! Let go and let's speak.

402
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,000
I'm not going to let go.

403
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,220
What's this? What's going on?

404
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,460
What is this? Where is he?

405
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,380
High?

406
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,240
What is this?

407
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
Where is this punk?

408
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,830
What's going on?

409
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,030
What's going on? What's going on?

410
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,080
Ouch, ouch! Honey, honey! Ouch!

411
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,740
Why are you here?

412
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,250
I was on my way to the bathroom.

413
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,140
Surprised the heck out of me...

414
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,270
Boss!

415
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,490
Boss!

416
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,770
What sort of peeps are these?

417
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,830
Bos—

418
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,980
Good morning!

419
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,540
What are World King people doing here?

420
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,670
What happened to their hair?

421
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,940
FIRE!!!

422
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,930
What?

423
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,970
Now, let's chat.

424
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,230
What on earth is going on?

425
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,270
Detective Kim, do you have something to discuss with me?

426
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,100
Huh, I don't have anything to talk about.

427
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,640
This right here. It's the device you installed, correct, President Lee?

428
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,710
What's this? I've never seen it before.

429
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,370
Hey, Wang Wei, do you know what this is?

430
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:55,800
Oh, not sure if I know what it is. Is it a coffee maker?

431
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,720
Then, why did you come here last night?

432
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,200
Ah, the thing of it is

433
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,650
we had some things to celebrate yesterday so we had a drink,

434
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,710
but we were a bit tipsy and thought this was our office.

435
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,560
Hey, how come a young man is unable to find his way?

436
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,520
- We drank four bottles of Erguotou. 
 - Was it four bottles? 
  (T/N: Chinese liquor made from sorghum)

437
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,260
Do you think that makes sense? These two offices are completely different in their location.

438
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:20,960
Detective Kim! Have you ever drunk Erguotou? Four bottles at that?

439
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,640
Do I look like a person who'd lie?

440
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,040
I am Lee Sungrok. Lee Sungrok.

441
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm saying this since you are Lee Sungrok.

442
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,260
Is that how the story goes?

443
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,320
Anyway...

444
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,060
The one who installed this must be a wackjob. A total psycho.

445
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,180
You have to get them and take them out. Hang on here...

446
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,170
I'll take my leave.

447
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,880
- Hold it. 
 - What?

448
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,900
Why are you taking that?

449
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,430
I was going to throw it out for you. You know you have to recycle. It's bothersome.

450
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,670
It's all right. I'll throw it out.

451
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,340
Will ya?

452
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,060
You're earnest.

453
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,750
I'm leaving.

454
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,480
Detective Kim's office is, wow, always so broad.

455
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,680
It's twice as wide as our office. How does he keep it so clean?

456
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,620
See you. Take care.

457
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,770
Ouch. The door!

458
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,730
Open (the door).

459
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,690

460
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,470
Why on earth are those fools acting so (weird)?

461
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,960
We are out.

462
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,390
You don't think he's onto us, do you?

463
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,440
I don't think so.

464
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,200
Still jolted...

465
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,940
We almost kicked the bucket.

466
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,410
Not as easy as he appears. We need to increase our tactics.

467
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,510
Ouch! That stings!

468
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,730
Static electricity, you punk...

469
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,330
Ouch!

470
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,260
Lightening, dang it.

471
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
Come in punk.

472
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,660
What? Do you smell something?

473
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,350
 It's a revolting smell.

474
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,320
A kind of burning smell, I think?

475
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,030
It's the smell I came across at the veterinary clinic.

476
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,600
At the veterinary clinic?

477
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,910
Then, are you saying No Poongsik was here?

478
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:42,280
Director Lee Sungrok and No Poongsik might be related somehow?

479
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,630
 I warned you that you'd be hurt if you ignored my warning.

480
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,110
 Does this perhaps mean he's warning me?

481
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,870
We have to find out the case Kim Mooyoung tried to investigate even while ignoring No Poongsik's warning.

482
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:04,200
If (the case) was requested by a client, there should be evidence left on the cell phone or the computer as a file.

483
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,960
What if it wasn't a file on a cell phone or a computer?

484
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,640
Huh?

485
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:29,360
If he mostly used this pen, wouldn't he have left the evidence on a notebook or a pocketbook?

486
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,820
Nah. I really cleaned the office over many times, but there wasn't any trace of such.

487
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,810
Think about it more carefully and see if there's something you might have missed.

488
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,360
That employee of the animal protection association that Bora mentioned before contacted us.

489
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,360
- I'll meet with her, so you keep looking for the evidence here. Okay, Boss? 
 - Yes, I will.

490
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,850
My name is Kim Sunji. Just speak comfortably, please.

491
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,700
If it's okay with you, I'll record it.

492
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,350
Okay.

493
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,180
I heard that you submitted a complaint about No Poongsik.

494
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,000
He loudly proclaimed to rescue wild animals or animals off the streets

495
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,640
acting as if he were a sentry, but it is far from the truth.

496
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,990
Have you any idea what No Poongsik did while he was avoiding the arrest order for the illegal medical waste disposal charge?

497
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,190
What did he do?

498
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,730
Hunting.

499
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:56,970
No Poongsik's hobby is hunting.

500
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,710
A veterinarian's hobby is hunting, you say?

501
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,010
He was arrested by the police due to a complaint filed against his illegal hunting.

502
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,390
No Poongsik is not human.

503
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,490
He is a monster.

504
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,150
It is unclear where he took all the rescued animals.

505
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:26,030
Half of them were euthanized and disposed of, but it's unclear what he's done with the remaining half...

506
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,350
 I am slowly getting hungry.

507
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,340
 It's a human.

508
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,980
What is this?

509
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,220
What are you guys about?

510
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,120
Hard to tell. Is our side getting hit or hitting?

511
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,750
It looks like our side is getting singularly hit.

512
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,880
Is that right?

513
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:25,110
Do I, Lee Sungrok, have to get involved again?

514
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,080
Boss! Don't over do it. You can really be broken at that rate.

515
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,090
I don't think Detective Kim Mooyoung is an average being.

516
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,720
I am also not average.

517
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,820
Should I put a preventative 911 call?

518
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,740
He is average.

519
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,070
 Kangrim City's #1, me, Lee Sungrok.

520
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,870
 The time to settle the score face-to-face again has come.

521
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,210
Can a sheet of paper cover your face?

522
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,590
You should cover your body.

523
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,770
Director Lee.

524
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:33,690
Why on earth are you wearing a mask?

525
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,160
Let's at least know what your reason for acting this way towards me is.

526
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,900
Who ordered you?

527
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,830
If you are a detective, you should know that I can't reveal the identity of my client.

528
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:39,200
That's what I'm saying. Just why on earth are you going so far with me?

529
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,390
Kill me!

530
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,410
Then you can find out.

531
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,810
What the heck is he saying?

532
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,480
 Driving me crazy, this punk. Did he really have this much meat on him?

533
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,860
 The world's best feast ever.

534
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:03,870
 Besides, why did he come so naked? Couldn't he have worn a cover or something?

535
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,390
What kind of crap are those two pulling?

536
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,290
 The scent of the cranium that circumnavigates through the permed hair.

537
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,560
 This is a dangerously appetizing meal.

538
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:51,380
 What are you about? A pervert?

539
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,490
 Oh hell. I can't hold back anymore. I might just...

540
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:19,800
What are you?

541
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,630
Why is that bastard's eyes like that?

542
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,790
Don't come near me!

543
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,100
Don't come near me!

544
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,630
Are you a monster or what?

545
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,230
Don't come. Don't do thaaaaaaat!!!!

546
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:07,890
Boss! BOSS!!!

547
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:08,970

548
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,870
BOSSSSSSSSS!!!!

549
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,540
Boss!

550
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,140
Bo-Boss!

551
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,460
Where... Where are you, Boss?

552
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,500
Bo-Bo— Oh God! Boss!

553
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
Boss!

554
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,180
Boss!

555
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,090
Boss! I'm Wang Wei, here

556
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,470
to take you back, Boss.

557
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,910
Save me! God, save me!!!

558
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,220
Save me!!!

559
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,310
Are you all right?

560
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:03,350
Boss.

561
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,320
I'm not all right.

562
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,460
I'm not all right. Waaaaahhhh.

563
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,310
Kim Mooyoung. Kim Mooyoung!

564
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,350
That bastard isn't human.

565
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,740
He is a monster!

566
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,140
Here... is split open...

567
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,260
Not a human. Not... human...

568
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,490
Let's get you up.

569
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,120
I came to take you back, Boss.

570
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,000
Boss.

571
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,230
Boss!

572
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,130
What about Kim Mooyoung?

573
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,190
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

574
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:20,540
Let's hear about it at least. What's the problem?

575
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,210
He was not human.

576
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:28,690
That punk was not a human but a ghost.

577
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:38,470
The thing is... this was piercing his chest yet he kept walking towards me,

578
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,480
and the electricity wasn't able to penetrate him either.

579
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,430
And also, the way in which he was looking at me

580
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,320
could never be human.

581
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,450
It was a beast. A complete beast.

582
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,680
Boss, even still. Aren't you speaking a bit too ill of him?

583
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,050
I'm telling it like it is.

584
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,200
He isn't...

585
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,270
a human?

586
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,190
On one day, it's the boss;

587
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,150
and on another, it's some unknown punks.

588
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,490
Not a single day goes by the office isn't a mess.

589
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,820
Are you awake?

590
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:48,490
Did I perhaps (attack) a human again?

591
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,090
Don't worry. Fortunately, not much happened.

592
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,790
What's going on here? You aren't going to try to do that again?

593
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:09,890
That's why I said, if you don't want to be smacked upside the head, fill your belly with chicken...

594
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,970
I think the instinct to prefer eating humans over chicken is stronger.

595
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,580
Especially Director Lee Sungrok.

596
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,600
Towards Boss Lee?

597
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,840
I just couldn't contain myself.

598
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,060
Although I've encountered countless humans,

599
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,430
this is the first time the appetite became explosive as this.

600
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,530
That chubby fat and

601
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:33,690
the taut skin that barely contains it,

602
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,670
as well as the veins

603
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,130
that are see-through...

604
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,360
By the way, why is Director Lee acting like this towards me?

605
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:00,660
Wh-Why don't you just ask him directly?

606
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,190
Would he answer me if I were to ask directly?

607
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:07,390
He'd say some nonsensical stuff like "I have to protect the identity of the client."

608
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:11,850
Anyway, until I can control my appetite

609
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,830
I think it best to avoid Director Lee for now.

610
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,750
By the way, what happened to yesterday's meeting you had?

611
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,620
It appears to be that Director No Poongsik

612
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,430
euthanized all the rescued animals.

613
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:27,760
How come?

614
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,950
According to him, it was to unburden the animals' pain.

615
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:35,710
What crazy guy—

616
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:43,730
The issue is there's a gap in number between euthanized animals &amp; disposed animals.

617
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,340
The rest of the animals haven't even been found yet.

618
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,800
What are you saying?

619
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:52,190
That he siphoned the dead animals?

620
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,950
We will have to look into it further.

621
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,620
What's this?

622
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,620
What's all these?

623
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,220
What's all these?

624
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,650
Kim Mooyoung definitely was investigating around No Poongsik.

625
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,360
If it involved the medical waste disposal, he could have leaked it to the press.

626
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,320
It seems that there was some sort of experiment.

627
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:14,390

628
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,670

629
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,770
Look at this.

630
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,610
It looks like they conducted some sort of animal experiment.

631
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:35,570
But it's all in English...

632
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:39,850
Kim Mooyoung was murdered while investigating this experiment.

633
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:51,810
This is where I woke up.

634
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,170
Boss, this...

635
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:09,090
What's this?

636
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:13,380
Isn't this a zombie?

637
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,940
It's done.

638
00:59:57,940 --> 01:00:00,400
I finally found it.

639
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,470
The real zombie.

640
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:47,760
 Kim Mooyoung recognized me before he died.

641
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,470
 Being certain that I was related to the experiment,

642
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:01,640
 he handed me the office key that contained  the research.

643
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:18,820

644
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,750
 If it's this bastard that turned me into this state,

645
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,260
 wouldn't he know how to make me go back to being 
a human?

646
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,530

647
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:41,090
♫  A world without you  ♫

648
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,160
♫  is nothing to me  ♫

649
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,320

650
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:51,120
 Even if you don't want to, if I were to disappear or something happens, don't overstep your bounds. Got it?

651
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,060
 No Poongsik?

652
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,900
 You are curious about the "Shadow" incident, correct?

653
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,450
 Since there wasn't any proof, and the body was missing as well.

654
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:59,420
 The report says the unidentified body was found in Shinwol mountain.

655
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:04,540
 If so, Kim Mooyoung must have known everything about No Poonsik's illegal experiment?

656
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,310
 Have you any idea how agonizing it is to live as a zombie?

657
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:11,990
 The important thing is the fact that a zombie like you has been created.

658
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,560
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.
