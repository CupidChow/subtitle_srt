1
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,630

2
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,630
 You need courage to live.

3
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,920
 And that courage will...

4
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,230
 get me out of this hell I am in now.

5
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,570

6
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,730
Zombies are a killer content.

7
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,760
Of course, as a fictional character, you can meet— Ah!

8
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,160
In reality.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,620
Ah, I am achy.

10
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,580
Ah, Sister-in-Law,

11
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,930
- why are you coming out looking like a zombie? 
 - Brother-in-Law!

12
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,550
Are you okay?  You must've blacked out from drinking.

13
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,230
Eat this.

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,690
- I just made it so— 
 - Ah, hot! 
 - It's really hot.  I just made it.

15
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,140
- Water. 
 - Water?  Oh, water.

16
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,980
If you are in this state, it's probably better you blacked out.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Oh, my head hurts.  I remember I came back in a taxi but...

18
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,570
Do you know how worried your sister was last night?

19
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,040
She gave me such a hard time because you weren't answering your phone.

20
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,160
Phone?

21
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,340
What is that?  Is that a thread or noodles?

22
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
It's noodles.

23
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,180
What is this?

24
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,130

25
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,880
What—

26
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,370
Are you all right?

27
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,440

28
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,060
- ₩100,000,000?! 
 - ₩100,000,000?

29
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,180
What are you talking about, ₩100,000,000?

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,270
Agreement.  Kim Mooyoung.

31
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,890
Sister-in-Law, did you cause trouble again?

32
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,520
₩100,000,000?

33
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,270
Does it even make sense to ask for ₩100,000,000?  This uncle!

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,360
Sister-in-Law, where are you going? Sister-in-Law, where are you going? Sister-in-Law, where are you going?

35
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,520
I will make a plausible excuse for you to your sister!

36
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,100
Although you will die anyway.

37
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,030
♫  Starlight is falling down~  ♫

38
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,750
♫  Shalalalala  ♫

39
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,760
♫  Shalalalala  ♫

40
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,420
 Electricity bill, health insurance, gas bill.

41
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,960
There are more bills to pay than income.

42
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,850
When you watch dramas, even grim reapers and aliens all have their own house and car— 
  (T/N: he's referring to the K-dramas "Goblin" and "You Who Came From the Stars.")

43
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,960
Why is my reality that of trying to make ends meet day-today?!

44
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,970
But if I just get that settlement money from that crap...

45
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,150
I should be okay for a little while.

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,110
Crap smell?!

47
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,660
 What is this?

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,590
We need to talk.

49
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,330

50
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,520
Are you kidding me?!

51
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,600
It's good that you remember.

52
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,590
What in the world are you thinking?

53
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,390
Don't you think this is too much?

54
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,820
- I just responded in the way you wanted. 
 - What I am saying is,

55
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,710
what were you thinking asking for as much as ₩100,000,000?

56
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,030
Compensation for psychological damage, compensation for aftereffects from the accident.

57
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,240
Of course, I know very well that you can't convert psychological damage to a monetary value.

58
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,140
And I admit that I am at fault for throwing the helmet, but...

59
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,900
isn't ₩100,000,000 too much?!

60
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,320
Can you just give a little... discount?

61
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,780
How much?

62
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,190
I really am not saying this because I don't have the money.

63
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,700
I am going to give you the settlement money. But to be honest,

64
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,840
it's just that yesterday I quit my job at the broadcast station...

65
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,070
  - What is this smell?  
 - So I can't right now...

66
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,090
 Those clothes, covered with drops of kimchi soup and all kinds of pollutants, that haven't been laundered for at least a week...

67
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,550
 and that seborrheic scalp that has been neglected for more than 4 days...

68
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,540
 - And this smell—  
 - To be honest, I am...

69
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,520
 - It's not a smell that comes from a human.  
 - ...right now...

70
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,360
- ...having a little bit of a hard time. 
   - The smell of poverty that is emanating from deep inside...

71
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,200
Quite a bit of a hard time...

72
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,080
 Really sad state...

73
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,060
I have to dig a hole to pay another with credit card debts as well...

74
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,680
And I will get kicked out of the house if I can't take care of this month's living expenses.

75
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,340
My sister is no joke.

76
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,720
 This human looks like she has it harder time making ends meet than I do.

77
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,190
 What was I expecting from this human who looks like she doesn't even have ₩1, let alone ₩100,000,000?

78
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,110
I... will somehow get together the settlement money, so if you could please wait a few days—

79
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,920
no, a few weeks?

80
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,290
A few months?

81
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,360
Leave.  Let's forget the whole thing.

82
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,260
- What are you doing now?  Forget the whole thing?  We can't do that—
 - Why not?

83
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,530
I said we can.  So just leave, please.

84
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,180
- Hey, look here, Mister— 
 - I said leave.

85
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,480
- I said leave. 
 - No, the settlement money—

86
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,220
- Leave. 
 - Uh!

87
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,290
Wait, Mister!

88
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,700
He doesn't have to go so far as to forget the whole thing...

89
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,020
Making me feel bad....

90
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,030
I am a crazy punk for expecting anything.

91
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,820
  Aftermath of crap, reality came knocking.

92
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,120
 For a zombie to make a living...

93
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,790
 is that the only way?

94
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,490

95
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,620
Are you sure?

96
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,510
Yeah.

97
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,700
Hey, tell me the details.

98
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,740
There is a dog that the elementary school was taking care of.

99
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,190
Detective Kim Mooyoung found it, so the young friends are all talking about it.

100
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,960
But where did the kids get the money?

101
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,530
He only charged ₩500 for finding the dog.

102
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,470
He really is awesome, isn't he?

103
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,460
Unlike somebody I know, he has great character...

104
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,380
Great?

105
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,990
If he is that great, why don't you go and work for Detective Kim!

106
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,760
Go across the street right now, you punk!

107
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,720
I will at least work as much as I got paid in advance.

108
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,630
This damned decisive punk!

109
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,090
₩500?

110
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,900
Detective Kim, you won't do.

111
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,780
If you price dump like this,

112
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,870
are you telling other detective agencies to fold business or what?

113
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,500
You want to be the sole business?  To me, Lee Sung Rok,

114
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,440
you are declaring a war?

115
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,960

116
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,660
 Until I find my past, I have to zom-buh (endure like a zombie with tenacious vitality) in this neighborhood.

117
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,890
 In order to zom-buh, I have to earn money myself.

118
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,670
This teacher studied abroad in Italy.

119
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,660
Hey, young man, take this.

120
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,310
We have skilled teachers.

121
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,210
Oh, hello, young man!  They say he studied overseas, in Italy.

122
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,390
My goodness, Miss!

123
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,510
 It is a capitalist's smile from much experience.

124
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,220
The study academy at the corner. He studied overseas, in Italy...

125
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,560
He teaches from the basics.

126
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,340
Miss! Here, here!

127
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,820
Bring the kids.

128
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,570
 I cannot seriously take this anymore.

129
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,520
Hey!

130
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,290

131
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,900
Amazing!

132
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,240
What's going on?

133
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,430
What were you doing so early in the morning that you don't even answer your phone?

134
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,260
It's just that I had to go somewhere.

135
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,620
You drank again last night, didn't you?

136
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,400

137
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,130
Here.

138
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,930
It's nice!

139
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,360
So, any new information on the attacker?

140
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,110
Are you curious about that even now?

141
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,790
It's a construction site so there is no CCTV and, same as before, there was no evidence left behind at the crime scene.

142
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,460
Ah, he made the difficult choice to do the interview because of me...

143
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,720
He went on the broadcast program then got attacked.  What witness would get the courage to come forward?

144
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,540
I will catch the culprit,

145
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,870
so you just take care of yourself.

146
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,130
Are they putting together a dedicated team?

147
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,850
The Violent Crimes Unit is also investigating, right? What about wanted posters?

148
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,200
Ah, what if the investigation closes early like last time?

149
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,580
Each and every case is important to us!

150
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,390
But if we don't have enough evidence, there is going be a limit to our investigation.

151
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,240
I know.

152
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,990
You don't have enough manpower per case and you can't do anything without a search warrant.

153
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,120
But what if you fail to catch him again?

154
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,530
What if someone else is sacrificed?

155
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,260
We have to find that bastard fast.

156
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,020
How in the world are we going to find him?

157
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,010
You just have to hire a detective.

158
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,330
The detective can find anything if you give him money.

159
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,510
Detective Uncle even found Hodoo in just one day

160
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:25,720
when the police couldn't.

161
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,900
Detective Uncle is the best!

162
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,760
Our Joonwoo, come here!

163
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,430
You even know a detective?

164
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:35,020
Our Joonwoo is the best!

165
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,140
Ah, Director Lee.  Ah, sorry, sorry.

166
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,230
I forgot.

167
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,310
- Did you wait for long? 
 - No, I didn't.

168
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,160
I get forgetful.

169
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,880
I read the script well.  It's really fun.

170
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,900
Thank you, Mr. CEO.  I will work hard to make the film.

171
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,910
But it's going to be difficult for me to make it.

172
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,430
But you said you had fun reading it.  Why not—

173
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,070
It was fun.

174
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,530
So, this basically is a story about a zombie taking revenge against the humans who made him that way, right?

175
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,440
Yes, that's right.  It's a zombie noir.

176
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,340
Ah, zombie noir?

177
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,210
- Noir.  Yes. 
 - Wow, it's cool.

178
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,360
It's nice.  It's cool.

179
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,130
But there are a few things that are bothering me as well.

180
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,360
What things?

181
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,860
Isn't it a bit strange for a zombie to attend a Catholic church?

182
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,000
Wearing a veil and all?   It could become a sensitive religious issue.

183
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,580
I will take it off.

184
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,370
- Take off what? 
 - I will take the veil off.

185
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,370
So that there is no religious issue, I will go with no religion.

186
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,520
Oh, that's good.

187
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
No religion is good.

188
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,400
But other than that, as a whole...

189
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,710
isn't this beautifying the zombie?

190
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,070
How and in what way did I beautify the zombie?

191
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,940
Zombies eat human intestines.  It's not a hero...

192
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,250
Mr. CEO, the zombie that I wrote about...

193
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,190
has deep pain, is lonely, and...

194
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,830
he even sacrifices himself for someone he loves.  He is a romantic zombie.

195
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,450
What zombie is a romantic?

196
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,840
But how do I explain this?

197
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,160
- Director Lee, you watched "Walking Dead," right? 
 - Yes.

198
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,020
"Train to Busan," "Peninsula." Zombies attack in groups, get chased, and get shot to death...

199
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,440
This is what the audience wants.  Exhilarating.

200
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,290
But there are so many zombie works that are like that.  I want to write about a different kind of zombie.

201
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,430
It is different.  I like it because it is different.

202
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,680
It is different.  Too different.

203
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,370
Director Lee, you tended to be ahead of your time.

204
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,800
You are right.  That is sometimes a problem for me.

205
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,740
But I think it is a good thing to be ahead of my time.

206
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,310
I like it but I don't know how to convince the investors.

207
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,910
To say it bluntly, unless you find some blind investors from somewhere...

208
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,460
Mr. CEO, I will find blind investors.

209
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,210
Then the movie can be made, can't it?

210
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,790
Ah, of course.

211
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,100
Ah, that's a relief.

212
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,920
Call me when you find them.

213
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,140
I will find them for sure.

214
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,890
What about what you promised?

215
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,410
A man doesn't go back on his words.

216
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,730

217
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
₩5,000 per hour, right?

218
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,490
Honor your promise about time.

219
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,680
 I should at least be able to buy the cream for disguise with this money.

220
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,940
They say a dog's life is the best and it's a carefree life...

221
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,480
Great Profit is even happier than this zombie.

222
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,340
You put on some weight, what did you eat?

223
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,560
Did you have something delicious?

224
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,870
What is going on?  How did you get in?

225
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,960
Please drink this.

226
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,650
You must have been distributing your business cards.  It is tiring, isn't it?

227
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,260
 It's giving me the chills... this crap.

228
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,910
We are already done with the settlement talk, so leave.

229
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,470
I am not here because of the settlement.

230
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,750
I have something to ask you.

231
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,330
Make it fast and just leave.

232
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,750
I did the broadcast program on the "Santa" kidnapping case.

233
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,240
There is something I need to find related to the case,

234
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,300
if I could ask for a consultation.

235
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,530
2,000 for a human, 500 for an animal.

236
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,220
I am not saying that I will hire you for sure.

237
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,510
Before that, if I could get a consultation...

238
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,370
 She is the worst of the fleas.  I need to get rid of her before she clings on to me.

239
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,490
I am sorry but that will be difficult.  Please leave.

240
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,010
Uh, wait just a moment, please!

241
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,540
- Is it okay to chase a customer out like this? 
 - Yeah, it's okay. So leave. (T/N: speaking informally)

242
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,980
Excuse me, but why do you keep speaking informally to me?

243
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,340
Then if it were you,

244
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,960
would you speak formally after getting hit with a helmet and breaking your head?

245
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
You are right.

246
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
Please speak comfortably and informally.

247
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,030
I will, so please leave.

248
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,140
Ah, is this because of the settlement money?

249
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:55,140
I... normally can't live being indebted to someone.

250
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,430
Ah, I will pay back with physical labor instead of money!

251
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,950
Don't you need help in this detective office?

252
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,110
No, I don't!  So, please leave!

253
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,120
Ah, Mr. Presi—

254
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,970
 What is that?

255
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,550
 Who is that?

256
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,340
It's been a while, Detective Kim.

257
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,210
Why aren't you answering your phone?   You had me worried.

258
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,020
- You— 
   - Does she know Kim Mooyoung?

259
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,450
Didn't you tell me that you would never shave?

260
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,960
 Ah, that's right.  Kim Mooyoung had a beard.

261
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,910
Did you have a change of heart or something?

262
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,730
This is nice, too.

263
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,330
 I thought my heart was going to burst.

264
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,450
Is she a new employee?

265
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,150
I am... not an employee.  I am just—

266
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,230
I will get to the point.

267
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,730
Find me someone.

268
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,470
- She is my daughter. 
 - Daughter?

269
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,520
You know... that I don't like exposing my private life.

270
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,430
I have been very satisfied with how you took care of things for me quietly until now.

271
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,920
That's also the reason why I trust you more than the police.

272
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:24,610
This time it would be good if you could pay extra attention to security.

273
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,280
Please drink this (energy drink) while you talk.

274
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,350
You too, Boss.

275
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,360
Boss?

276
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,350
How long has it been since your daughter left home?

277
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,190
Why do you ask that?

278
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:45,100
Maybe about a month?

279
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,600
Mother must be very worried.

280
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,570
 I let my guard down.

281
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,400
If you find my daughter and bring her back, I will pay you double what I paid you last time.

282
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,320
 Double?

283
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,560
 How much is double?

284
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,560
Give me a call when you find her.

285
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,190
If you were going to do that, why show it to me?

286
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,100
The woman who just left, she is Kang Goeun, right?

287
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,320
Who?

288
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,930
You know, she even came out on a drama recently.

289
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,780
She is your regular and you don't even know what she does?

290
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,750
Of course, I know.

291
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,260
As a detective, I can't leak any information on my clients.

292
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,750
You don't even know anything.

293
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,670
She looks better in person than on screen.

294
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,060
I didn't know she had a daughter.

295
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,970
She said she was single on broadcast...

296
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,990
But why would the daughter leave home?

297
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,120
You still haven't left?  Leave!

298
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,150
This case, why don't we take it?

299
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,660
We?!  Where do you think you are squeezing yourself into?

300
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,730
This is a case that has come to me!

301
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,550
About that settlement money...

302
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,880
I don't have any thought of collecting that settlement money so just go.

303
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,090
That settlement money...  I really want to give it to you.   That's why.

304
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,090
The settlement money... I will pay for it with physical labor.

305
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,300
- I am saying I will pay for the entire ₩100,000,000 with physical labor. 
 - What?

306
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,630
I am an expert at footwork.

307
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,850
 Even so, do you think I will work with you?

308
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,670
Well, as you know,

309
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,230
as the writer of current affairs program 70-Minute Chase,

310
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,710
the number of cases that I interviewed until now

311
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,980
is 67 in total.

312
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,000
Detailed strategy and know-how based on experience

313
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,740
and the various connections nationwide—

314
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,440
 Ah, damn! I do have quite a lot of bills that haven't been paid.

315
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,720
It looks like I left my wallet at home.

316
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,410
Anyway, didn't you also need money?

317
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,000
That's why you wanted ₩100,000,000 from me as a settlement.

318
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,290
Of course,

319
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,390
there is nothing I can do if you don't want to...

320
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,710
Then, I will somehow try to come up with

321
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,130
the settlement money.

322
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,420
I will leave now.

323
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,480
 With that crap?

324
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,900
 I would rather starve to death.

325
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,820
It's for just this once.

326
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,940
With that one chance, prove that you are worth the ₩100,000,000.  Got that?

327
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,850
Deal!

328
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,180
I wouldn't know if she is the daughter.  They don't even look alike.

329
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,940
When they were out, she called the mom "Aunt."

330
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,010
How were they inside the house?

331
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,200
Inside the house...

332
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,970
 We will introduce the movie "Spring Flower" due to premiere this week.

333
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,060
 Even just for the transformations of these two actresses, there is much expectation.

334
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,930
 Here are Miss Kang Goeun and Miss Yoo Heesun.

335
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,880
 Both of you, please say hello to the audience.

336
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,240
 Hello, I am Kang Goeun.  It has been a while since I last greeted you.

337
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,040
 Hello, I am Yoo Heesun.

338
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,030
 Miss Kang Goeun, I believe it's your first time working with Yoo Heesun.

339
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,070
 How was it?

340
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,890
 I was happy throughout the shooting.

341
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,210
 She is kind, pretty, and even has a good personality.

342
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,490
 If I had a daughter like Heesun, I would probably go around bragging all the time.

343
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,920
 I really like her a lot, too.

344
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,740
 She really took a good care of me.

345
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,180
 She was like my mom.

346
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,810
 Don't these two look so lovable and don't they look like mother and daughter?

347
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,760
 Thank you.

348
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,160
Were you like this all day?  You really live an easy life.

349
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,590
- Ma'am, my bath water, please. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

350
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,630
And please get rid of all those,

351
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,870
so that I don't see them.

352
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,550
Yoonju must have been suffering inside.  It's so sad.

353
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,640
By any chance, does she have a close friend or places she visits often...

354
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,920
 She stayed inside her room all day and didn't even come out.

355
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,100
She hid food here.

356
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,820
Kim Yoonju.

357
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,260

358
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,150
I found it.

359
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,560
Boyfriend—

360
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,070
What are you, a pervert or something?

361
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,520
It seems that Yoonju has a boyfriend.

362
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,520

363
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,760
How can you tell?

364
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,330
"Fast Craft Workshop"?

365
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,000
What is this?

366
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,720

367
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,530
It looks like they hold events for couples there.

368
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:54,130
Recent history...  If I look at the recent history on the internet...

369
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,350

370
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,780
I knew it.  100-day celebration event.

371
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,570
 This human is kind of useful.

372
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,490
Gangrim Health Spa?

373
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,700

374
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
Let's go.

375
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,690
So mannerless!  What is that smell?

376
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:40,910
Snake alcohol, chicken soup without seasoning...

377
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,590
Why would they have those in a health spa?   Snake alcohol?  What are you talking about?

378
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,560
It's a 17-year-old viper snake alcohol.

379
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,630
It was distilled about... 2 hours ago.

380
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,310
If you are hungry, just say so.

381
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,650
What nonsense...

382
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,680
are you saying?

383
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,420
 Ah, it was so tasty...

384
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,190
 Humans.

385
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,120
 What do I do?

386
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,580
What are you doing, not going in?

387
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,460
You go by yourself.

388
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,860
Why?

389
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,300
Because I am the detective and you are the assistant.

390
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,060
You came all the way here.  Why don't you just come inside with me?

391
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,550
No, I don't want to.

392
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,730
What is wrong?

393
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,440
To be honest, I have anthropophobia. 
  (T/N: the fear of people)

394
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,830
Anthropophobia?  How does a detective have anthropophobia?

395
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,330
Of all the excuses, anthropophobia?

396
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,120
Is there a rule that a detective can't have anthropophobia?

397
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,610
And this kind of menial work should be done by an assistant like yourself so hurry up and go!

398
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,720
- No, but— 
 - I said hurry up and go.

399
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,630
Okay, fine then.  Boss, you just wait here.

400
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,860
I... will go in and quickly confirm and be back.

401
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,460
Okay.

402
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,950
 They say even crap can sometimes be useful.

403
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,500
Excuse me...

404
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,320
 17-year-old viper snake alcohol

405
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,920
Heol!  Wow.  17-year-old?

406
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,240
Does this even make sense?

407
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,160
 We have a customer.

408
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,150
How can I— Excuse me, wait just a moment, please.

409
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:11,710
Sure.

410
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,440

411
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,930
How can I help you?

412
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,220
Wait!  Wait just a moment, please!

413
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,460
Please leave.

414
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,930
Ah, wait!

415
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,410
Ah, excuse me!

416
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,250
It's strange.

417
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,870
When I said I was looking for someone named Kim Yoonju,

418
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:01,660
they told me they can't give out any information about a member to outsiders.

419
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,490
So,  I said I will join as a member.

420
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,630
But then they told me that I can't become a member.

421
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,990
Why not?

422
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,760
They said that I don't have any weight to lose or something like that...

423
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,980
It definitely is strange.

424
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,510
So, are you saying she is inside or not?

425
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,870

426
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,470
 How can I help you?

427
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,540
 I am sorry but Kim Yoonju is not here.

428
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,640
Call it the current affairs program writer's instinct...

429
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,690
She definitely is inside.  I am 100% positive.

430
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,370
We are going to have to go in to confirm.

431
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,620
I have already been exposed...

432
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,860
Why?  What?  I already told you that I have anthropophobia.

433
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,120
Ah, that's why...

434
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,330
They have something like this.

435
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,280
Through experience, overcome anthropophobia.

436
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,600
You might as well use this opportunity to earn money and get treated.  Wouldn't this be killing two birds with one stone?

437
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,890
And this is free.

438
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,480
 Damn!

439
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,860
Do you happen to have any BB cream?

440
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,820
Why would you need BB cream to go to a health spa?

441
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,860
- So, do you have it or not? 
 - No, I don't have it.

442
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,970
 I didn't even expect it anyway.

443
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,740
 But this is my food for emergency.

444
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,860
Boss,

445
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,470
what are you going to do with raw meat at the health spa?  It's not like you can grill it to eat.

446
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,740
Wait just a moment, please.

447
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,290
These are better, to eat in hiding.

448
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,890
You eat them yourself.

449
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,910
If you find Yoonju, please call right away. Okay?

450
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,310
So, while I, the president, is working, what are you, the temporary worker, going to do?

451
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,080
I, the temporary worker, will

452
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,510
go back to Yoonju's house and see if we missed anything.

453
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,010
It's only for a maximum of three days, so just hang in there.

454
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,380
Boss, fighting!

455
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,240
He should be okay.

456
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,150
Hello.

457
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,000
We would like to sincerely thank you for

458
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,110
joining our program.

459
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:29,600
For the next three days, we will be staying together.

460
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,950
Before we start, we will conduct a simple check on your belongings.

461
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,430
 But they didn't mention anything like this.

462
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,540
We will check your belongings, Sir.  Please give them to me.

463
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,220
Food items are not allowed so we will keep—

464
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,240
Ah, not this.  I need to keep this.

465
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,570
Please don't worry.  We will return everything when you leave the program.

466
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,860
If you return after three days, is that fresh meat?!

467
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,520
It would be old meat.  Freshness is the key to meat.

468
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,810
It's because you never know what might happen during the three days.

469
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,190
Everyone else says that but you don't need to worry.

470
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,230
It really is not for me but...

471
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,190
 All of you could be in danger.

472
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,450
Mr. Member, you have to trust us.

473
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,270
You need to throw away any material waste

474
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,900
so that you can treat an illness of the heart.   Do you understand?

475
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,700
 Why?

476
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,580
 Don't come.  Please don't come.

477
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,270
 Damn!

478
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,660
 No. No, no.

479
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,700
 No! No.

480
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,680
Oh!

481
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,660
 No, no!  Not there!

482
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,510
You must really like meat.

483
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,120
 I am ruined.

484
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,980
 I am totally ruined.  These humans!

485
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,100
 These humans, how are they going to handle things later?!

486
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,050
They really are cruel.  They confiscated all of that?

487
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,750
 - What do I do?  
 - This place is really famous.

488
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,870
Should we say this is hell's health spa?

489
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,750
Well, in our health spa,

490
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:16,570
the moment you enter, all communication with the outside is cut off.

491
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,670
We wish all of you luck!

492
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,300
 Okay, let's just endure for the next three days.

493
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,110
 Can you please raise the "BEFORE" card a bit?

494
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,200
You look upset.  Again, one, two, three!

495
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,350
It's too high.  Lower, please.

496
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,160
Mr. Member, have you never taken pictures before?   I am going crazy.

497
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,530
- One more time.  One, two, three! 
 - He is so good looking!

498
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,520
How can a human being look like that?  Is that a sculpture or a person?

499
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,580
Do you see those muscles, honey?  Do you see those?

500
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,770
Feel mine.  I have pretty good muscles, too.

501
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,940
Frontal shot.  We will do one more frontal shot.  One, two, three!

502
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,470
We don't just make you starve.

503
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,940
With balanced and nutritious food,

504
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,300
we take healthy care of the body and mind.

505
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,350
Please enjoy.

506
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,770
There is no meat and only grass.

507
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,910
 They are saying a zombie should starve to death.

508
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,600
 Where the heck is Kim Yoonju?

509
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,140
Please enjoy.  Please enjoy.

510
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,640
Aren't you eating?  You would need to eat at least a little if you want to endure.

511
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,210
Please have it.

512
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,850
This precious food!  Thank you.

513
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,400
 It's the same smell as the cologne I smelled on the scarf.

514
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,390
By any chance, do you know someone named Kim Yoonju?

515
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,660
Kim Yoonju?  I am not sure.  It's my first time hearing that name.

516
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,840
But why are you asking about the person called Kim Yoonju?

517
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,310
It's just that she recommended...

518
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,920
Ah, I see!   I don't know who she is but she really is a good person.

519
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,600
Thank you.

520
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,130
This is a diet supplement that will make you feel full.

521
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,150
Honey!  Were you eating well?

522
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,470
You've lost so much weight on your face.

523
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,470
  - Really? 
 - Did you get prettier?  Wait...

524
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,280
- By any chance, do you have the key? 
 - What key?

525
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,690
The key that will open your heart...

526
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,310
- Ewww. 
   - Oh, so cute!

527
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,890
 I smell something.   The smell of dislike.

528
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,570
 The thing that I asked you...

529
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,910
This is Yoonju's bank account book.

530
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,330
I checked and it seems that there was a withdrawal last week.

531
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,770
- A total of ₩30,000,000. 
 - ₩30,000,000?!

532
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,600
₩30,000,000?

533
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,140
If it was just voice phishing, it would be a relief.  But...

534
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,250
But if by any chance it's not...

535
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,260
My Yoonju... really would be fine, right?

536
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,840
Of course!  She will return soon.

537
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,700

538
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,140
- You didn't like it? 
  - No.

539
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,270
 I want to have meat.

540
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:17,840
 That's not her, either.

541
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,980
 Not this one, either.

542
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:30,370
The next location is this way, Mr. Member.

543
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,040
 This pigeon position

544
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,240
 opens up the right joint to increase the flexibility in the spine and the hip.

545
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,740
 Pigeon?  I want to eat it.

546
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,150
 Being here, I even have an appetite for pigeons.

547
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,330
The perfect pigeon position—

548
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,400
That... That...

549
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,400
You have a very flexible body, Sir.

550
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,370
 Can't everyone do at least this much?

551
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,530
What in the world!  Ah...

552
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:18,530
In my 15 years of doing yoga, I've never seen a position like this.

553
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,680
Sir, what is this position?

554
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,530
It's the zombie position.   It lets you experience such physical freedom

555
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,210
that you can't tell whether you are dead or alive.

556
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,850
Ah, doesn't... doesn't that...

557
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,810
Doesn't that hurt, Sir?

558
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,840
 How is this possible?  Let me see...

559
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,440
Thank you for the food.

560
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,740
That's not your rice...  This rice.

561
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,120
This rice?

562
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,620
Enjoy and eat a lot.

563
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,120
Honey, what's wrong?  Are you sick anywhere?

564
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,940
What could I have done wrong?  Ah, I didn't do the laundry this morning!

565
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,900
- I will do it tomorrow— 
 - It's okay.  I can do it.

566
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,700
Honey, you just eat comfortably.

567
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,520
It's just that I am uncomfortable because of you.

568
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,700
Dad, did you do something wrong?

569
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,210
I don't know.  What could I have done wrong?

570
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:39,190
Honey, you know Owner Park of the vegetable store across the street, don't you?

571
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,170
I heard they are hiring at the store.

572
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,490
I will have a nice talk with Owner Park so...

573
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,520
How did you know?

574
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,480
- Know what? 
 - That I've been to the movie studio.

575
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,550
That...

576
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:01,060
The only reason why you would wear a suit to go out is to visit the movie studio.  Isn't that right?

577
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,030
Please, throw away that suit.

578
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,770
And while you are at it, that movie making...

579
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,520
- give it up. 
 - What do you mean give—

580
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,870
Honey, I have a lot of talent in movie making.  That's why...

581
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,420
But why the heck is this kid out so late after getting fired from the broadcast station?!

582
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,460
Don't you know anything about it?!

583
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,560
I... I... I don't know.  How would I know?

584
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,140
Auntie is with Detective Unc—

585
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,870
Joonwoo! Joonwoo, eat roasted seaweed.  It's really tasty.

586
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,650
And you... you should stop watching that detective show. You seem to watch it too much.

587
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,690
- Detective... 
 - Ah, really!

588
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,170
If she is late paying this month's living expenses, too, I will kick her out of the house!

589
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,080
Ah, my blood pressure!

590
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,580
Is anyone here?

591
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,690
Is no one here?

592
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,430

593
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,920

594
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,080
Who are you?

595
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,760
Why are you coming out from there?

596
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,300
Boss, why aren't you answering your phone?!

597
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,830
 The person you are trying to reach is not answering.  After a beep...

598
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,130

599
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,040
 I am sleeping with the enemy.

600
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,640
 Do these humans know how scary a hungry zombie is?

601
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,540
 If I stay like this, all these humans here are going to be in danger.

602
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,290
I am going crazy.

603
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:36,450
 Diet supplement?

604
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,720
Are... Are you all right?

605
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,710
Apple... would you like some?

606
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:12,390
 That onion...

607
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,310
 She is beyond the point of being hungry and is now hallucinating.

608
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,840
If you are going to eat like that, why did you enter here?

609
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,730
It's because of Oppa.

610
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,430
Oppa told me if I enter here,

611
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,200
he will do everything I want.

612
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,490
You can't possibly mean that dried anchovy looking Oppa?

613
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,530
That Oppa brought you here?

614
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,490
Yes.  Oppa said...

615
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:15,160
let's come to the health spa for our 100-day anniversary.

616
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:21,160
 100-day anniversary event. It seems like they hold events for couples.

617
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,940
 Gangrim Health Spa?

618
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,130
 He certainly is unlikable.

619
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,830
That's right.

620
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,750
It should be okay to fill my stomach before I have to leave.

621
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,520
Come here.  Come here.

622
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,750
Come to your senses.

623
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,690
You ate all of this?

624
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,350
What are you doing late at night, Mr. Member?

625
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,760
How?

626
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,200
- Let's go, please. 
 - Where—

627
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,270
Oppa.  Oppa!

628
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,120
 Oppa!   Oppa!

629
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,460
Did you forget that

630
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,050
management is important?

631
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,860
Management, huh?

632
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,370
I can't put up with this crap anymore!

633
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Careful with your words.

634
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,040
Do you know how damn hard I had to work in order to bring the girls here?!

635
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,540
That's why I am giving you 30% of the profit!

636
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,530
30% is nothing!

637
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,710
Do you know how much they are worth?

638
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,230
You can get at least ₩500,000,000 per person.

639
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,210
Do you understand?

640
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,670
 What are they saying?

641
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,160
 We are starting the Fiery Kiln course in 5 minutes.

642
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,610
I am going now.

643
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:49,730
Let's talk after this.

644
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,650
Who's there?

645
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,810
 What do I do?

646
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,520
 Where are they going?

647
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,790
Please come in.

648
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,930
Yes.

649
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,190
In here, please.

650
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,790
For your next tour, as you can see, this is the fiery kiln.

651
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:59,870
For those of you who feel that you have a lot of poison and waste inside you,

652
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:02,780
you can say that this is the best course.

653
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,610
Guide them, please.

654
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,060
- Please enter. 
 - Okay.

655
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,680
You will feel refreshed.

656
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,490
 I can't even go back.  It should be okay, shouldn't it?

657
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,530
 Where is this place?

658
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,170
 Where the heck are we going?

659
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,440
 Do you believe?

660
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,210
 Do you want it?!

661
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,000
Faithfuls!

662
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,490
You shall be blessed!

663
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,380
 What is this place?

664
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:50,110
You shall be blessed!

665
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,300
 What the heck are these humans doing now?

666
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,370
- Do you want it more earnestly?! 
 - Yes!

667
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:03,900
I will, today, show you a miracle!

668
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,260
Since when were you not able to walk?

669
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,370
Since I was four years old.

670
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,460
He says he has not been able to walk since he was four years old.

671
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,570
I will show you a miracle so that the devil can be chased away.

672
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,270
In God's name, I order

673
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,810
the devil to be gone!  Devil, be gone!

674
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,490
Devil, be gone!

675
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:27,750
Devil, be gone!  Devil, be gone!

676
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,730
Devil, be gone!  There.

677
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,590
Try standing him up.

678
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,850
 What the heck are they all doing?

679
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,870
Devil, leave!

680
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,030
Get him back up again.

681
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,620
Do you want a miracle?!

682
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,210
Yes, a miracle!

683
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:43,650
Do you want a miracle?!

684
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,880
 They are all crazy.

685
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,350
Believe.  Believe in me!  Do you believe?!

686
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,240
I believe!

687
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,900
- Do you believe?! 
 - I believe!

688
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,770
Devil, be gone!

689
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,990
Come forward.

690
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,140
That's right!  Walk!

691
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,080
Walk!

692
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,690
Walk!  That's right!

693
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,500
 I have to get out of here fast no matter what.

694
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,890
You are watching a miracle.

695
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,950
That's right.  Walk.

696
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,850
Walk, walk.  That's right.

697
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,760
- Good! More! 
 - Darn it.

698
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:20,280
There is an intruder, running away to section 3.  Hurry up and catch him!

699
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,200
So you are talking about that cult leader Lee Gwangsik.

700
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,870
Yeah.  He uses the health spa as a cover to illegally lure people in.

701
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,640
Then rip them off in the name of offerings.

702
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,740
Do you know what else I learned?

703
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,900
 Why are you coming out from there?

704
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,880
There were all in it together.

705
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:52,220
Why didn't I know this earlier?

706
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,230
I shouldn't have made him enter there.

707
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,900
 Catch him!

708
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,290
 Where did he go?!

709
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,740
 Hey, that way!  That way!  You punk!

710
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,080
Excuse me!

711
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,470
Excuse me!

712
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,270
What is it this late at night?

713
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,470
We have something to confirm here.

714
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:26,100
We are a membership only spa, so outsiders are not allowed to enter.

715
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,630
Membership, my foot!

716
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,060
This place is related to the New Truth church, isn't that right?

717
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,930
I don't know what you are talking about.

718
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:36,590
We have no relation to any special religion.

719
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,970
Special religion?

720
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,940
A cult is not religion.

721
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,810
You people chased me out on purpose knowing that I am related to the broadcast station, didn't you?

722
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,960
Talk!

723
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,940
Just for a bit,

724
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,900
can we check something inside, please?

725
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,050
Did you bring a search warrant, Detective?

726
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,930
Please go back before I report you.

727
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:09,830
Hey, aren't you going to open this door?!

728
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,120
If you act this way, you will only be at a disadvantage.

729
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,650
Ah, I am about to go crazy!

730
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,330
 What are you doing?

731
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,800
 Run!  Run!  Faster!

732
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,970
He's there!

733
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,230
 That way!  That way!  What are you doing?!  Run fast!

734
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,910
Go!

735
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,510
Find him!

736
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,730
Where is he?

737
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,430
 - He's here. 
 - Here?  Here?

738
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,000
Open the door.

739
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,080
 No!

740
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,060
- Come out!
  - Damn!

741
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,280
How long are you going to do this?

742
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:12,670
But he is inside.

743
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,270
 Hurry up and open!

744
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,710
 What's wrong with my hand?

745
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:19,590
 So in the end, is this how my identity is going to be exposed to the humans?

746
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,700
I said pull!

747
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,160
- Pull. 
 - 1, 2!

748
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,190
 - Why is it like this?  
 - Hurry up and stand it up.

749
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,720
Stand it up!

750
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,100
Bring the tool.

751
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,660
 Tool?

752
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,630
Hit.

753
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,480
Hit.

754
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:54,060
Like an idiot... Move aside.

755
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,070
Aren't you going to come out?!

756
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,730
Just a moment.  I think I hear some noise.

757
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,680
Isn't this sound of an animal?

758
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,140
It seems to be coming from inside.

759
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,550
- Oh, gosh! 
 - Goodness!

760
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:53,740
Die!

761
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,490
Stand it up.

762
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,100
Here, stand it up.

763
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,270
Come out!

764
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,470
One, two—

765
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,880
Let him go!

766
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,330
Let him go!

767
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,700
 I...

768
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,330
 was murdered?

769
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,580
♫  I’m always afraid  ♫

770
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:42,230
♫  That I’ll hurt you without knowing  ♫

771
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:45,290

772
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:48,770
 I will distract them, so you get Yoonju out no matter what.

773
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:53,500
 That place is hell where once you enter, you cannot get out, even when you are dead.

774
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,140
 This person truly is a god who came from hell!

775
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,270
 You are not a human.

776
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,080
 You are a monster.

777
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,200
 Just accept your fate.

778
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,830
 You know it, too.

779
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,090
 That you cannot go back to being a human.

780
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:12,120
 I came back alive... to hell.

781
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,490
 Zombie Detective.

782
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,599
