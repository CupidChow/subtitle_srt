1
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,670

2
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,480
 Boss! Boss, you're in there. Right?

3
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,690
Open the door, Boss!

4
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,270
Boss, please open the door!

5
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,170
Go back for today.

6
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,160
You should've called me if you came back. I was worried.

7
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,450
It was you who ran from the health spa before, right?

8
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,870
You saw something in there, right?

9
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,980
It doesn't concern you.

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,180
Then what about Yoonju?

11
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,630
Boss, we have to see this to the end.

12
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,260
This isn't a simple runaway or missing case, a cult is also involved.

13
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,330
We have to find her quickly!

14
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,110

15
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,390

16
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,940
 Who killed me?

17
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,470
 Was it someone I knew?

18
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,580
 Just why?

19
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,530
 - Boss! 
 - Damn it.

20
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,520
 She's so loud.

21
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,060
 Boss, please open the door!

22
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,640
I know you're having a hard time,

23
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,830
especially as someone with anthropophobia.

24
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,110
 I can't even imagine it!

25
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,900
 So loud.

26
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,040
 It's amazing you're still alive.

27
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,460
B-Boss?

28
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,800
It's strange.

29
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,450
I definitely heard something inside.

30
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,470

31
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,100
 Boss Kim Mooyoung! Aren't you going to work?

32
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,500
What's that? Why can I suddenly hear her so well?

33
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,920
 What kind of detective is so irresponsible?

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,340
 If you're a detective, you should act like one!

35
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,700
 Solve the case you've been hired for!  Solve the case!

36
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,570
 Solve the case! Solve the case!

37
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,020

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,730
Boss Kim Mooyoung, aren't you going to work?

39
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,350
 How can a detective be so irresponsible?

40
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,750
 If you're a detective, act like one!

41
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,160
That crazy ass!

42
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,390
Solve the case! Solve the case!

43
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,810
- Solve the case! 
 - Solve the case!

44
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,560
Solve the case! Solve the case!

45
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,300
If you're a detective, act like one! Work on your cases to the very end!

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,560
Kim Mooyoung is causing embarrassment for all detectives.

47
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,160
Boss, please respond!

48
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,360
You can tell just by looking that she is a client who got ripped off.  That crazy free spirit...

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,680
She is a talent to be coveted.

50
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,920
 Solve the case! Solve the case!

51
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Seeing a woman like her

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,840
reminds me of my mother back in my hometown.

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,130
She would catch cows with her bare hands.

54
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,470
Mother...

55
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,460
 I want an answer!

56
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,560

57
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,900
Gosh, what's wrong with her?

58
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,870

59
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,510

60
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,170

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,790

62
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,470
She watches too many dramas.

63
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,900
Boss!

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,490
 What is she doing?

65
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,500
 What's this smell?

66
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,710
 Beef tripe?

67
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,080
Boss, you love beef tripe. Right?

68
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,150
This wonderful smell!

69
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,640
Your chewy, tasty beef tripe is here!

70
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,630
 There's a lot of beef tripe here!

71
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,510
 Would our boss like some?

72
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
 It looks so good!

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,970
 It's hot!

74
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,630
 I must resist.

75
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,500
 Devil, be gone. Smoke, be gone.

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,020
 Smoke, be gone!

77
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,460
It's the beef tripe you love so much.

78
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,850
It's so good.

79
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,820
It's really good.

80
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,830

81
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,510
A cult is not a religion, it's a scam.

82
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,490
How could a person do that to another person?

83
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,330
Didn't you know?

84
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,240
You were all always like that.

85
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,220
That place is a hell where even death can't bring you out once you enter three times!

86
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,420
 Don't you have a family?

87
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,530
You must have one of your own!

88
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,990
What about the family that's waiting for Yoonju to come home?

89
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,490
 You should think about how the client must be feeling, too.

90
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,320
Forget it. Just forget it.

91
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,530
I'll figure it out myself, if that's what it takes.

92
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,500
So...

93
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,220
You have a plan?

94
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,600
Of course.

95
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Don't come close. Stay right there.

96
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,590
Before that,

97
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,590
I have one condition.

98
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,270
One condition?

99
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,390

100
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,590
He can't take a single step outside the office with his bare face?

101
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,490
How great is his bare face?

102
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,190
One of these, please.

103
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,750
I guess this is popular among men too, these days.

104
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,620
This? We're sold out, so we can't sell anymore.

105
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,290
It covers the slightest blemishes perfectly. It's a monster cover.

106
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,760
Monster?

107
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,300
Don't come in, and just hand it over.

108
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,540
- This is No. 23, right? 
 - Yes.

109
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,500
One more.

110
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,700
By the way, you must really like chicken.

111
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,130
Well, it is important to take care of your health as a detective.

112
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,120
It's best when boiled! Can I come in now?

113
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,730
Stop overreacting and wait outside.

114
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,800
Is he an actor or something? Why is he so mysterious?

115
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,810
It's this man, right?

116
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,890
 I command you in the name of God.

117
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,250
 Devil, be gone! Devil, be gone!

118
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,800
It's him.

119
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,020
What about Yoonju? Did you find her?

120
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,060
She was completely entranced in the prayer.

121
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,170
 Show me the way!

122
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,240
 Please save me! Please save me!

123
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,780
I knew it.

124
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,530
If it's membership only and she even stayed there...

125
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,430
Something illegal has definitely happened in there.

126
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,630
Right, was there anything weird at the health spa?

127
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,850
I'm not sure.

128
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,440
I don't know.

129
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,900
Hold on.

130
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,100
What's this?

131
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,290
A diet supplement. They handed it out to the members.

132
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,260
- Hi! 
 - Hello.

133
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,020
Manager Kim, are you ready?

134
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,460
I have to prepare for the restaurant opening.

135
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,050
Must I go now?

136
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,630
Oh well, I am supposed to meet with the producer for Live Info Show next week...

137
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,560
He wanted a recommendation to a good beef tripe restaurant.

138
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,800
You're tired, right?

139
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,960
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

140
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,720
Bora, I'm trusting you.

141
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,990
I am Gangrim City's booby trap.

142
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,210
Once any guy falls for me,

143
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,600
he'll never be able to step out on his own.

144
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,340
I'm sorry to say this.

145
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,140
This isn't the FDA.

146
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,980
It won't be easy.

147
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,140
Let's see.

148
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,820
It definitely looks illegal.

149
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,030
Don't you think so, Nurse Kim?

150
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,650
Illegal.

151
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,620
Sounds good.

152
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,690
But, Oppa,

153
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,000
while you were in jail for habitual use of propofol,

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,670
who was the one that sent you the spending money while in jail?

155
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:33,290
It was me, me.  Even when I was struggling to make ends meet while working as a colon and anal surgery nurse!

156
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,880
I'm the one who sent it to you regularly!

157
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,650
Why are you bringing up the past?

158
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,600
You thought, if you met regularly with your parents

159
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,800
and rested for a year before starting a hospital,

160
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,830
no one would figure it out. Right?

161
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,060
I could upload on the hospital bulletin that you went to jail.

162
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,000
You want me to do that?

163
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,040
What, what, what's wrong, Nurse Kim?

164
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,170
You should kill that temper of yours.

165
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:16,440
So when would you like the analysis by? This may take a while. How long?

166
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,230
It's a good phone, too. You want the results by tomorrow?

167
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,600
If we find proof of that pill being illegal, we can get a warrant.

168
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,620
Then we could bring Yoonju out, too.

169
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,040
But the question is how long it will take.

170
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,600
That... That anchovy-looking guy scammed Yoonju, too. Right?

171
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Right. That anchovy-looking guy.

172
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,210
Where's Yoonju?

173
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,250
Not her.

174
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,350
Not her.

175
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,370
That's where you jumped?

176
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,320
Are you okay?

177
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,240
A man can withstand that much.

178
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,290
Anyway, when you enter the health spa,

179
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,240
there's an underground tunnel that leads to the worship room.

180
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,970
It is sort of a final destination for the people who were brainwashed at that health spa.

181
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,870
Of course, the room that leads there

182
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,320
is for the health spa staff only.

183
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,890
So,

184
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,370
what exactly is your plan?

185
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,210
In that case, my plan is...

186
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,140
To go back in there.

187
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,420
To go back... Do you mean me?

188
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,510
No, I can't. Never.

189
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,200
Boss, aren't you going to save Yoonju?

190
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,090
Then you can go in there again.

191
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,710
You're the one who knows that place best!

192
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,900
Boss, at times like this,

193
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,240
you have to move forward without looking back like you're insane.

194
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,210
What? Insane?

195
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,420
You can't go against insane people if you're not insane yourself.

196
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,650
So, you must be just as insane.

197
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,090
 I think she's insane.

198
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,600
Anyway, I'm not doing it. You figure it out.

199
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,330
Don't you like beef tripe?

200
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,690
Once this case is solved, you can eat as much beef tripe as you want.

201
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,840
 If you find and bring my daughter back,

202
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,220
 I'll give you double the amount I paid last time.

203
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,200
 If it's doubled...

204
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,030
 I can get at least 9,824 servings of beef tripe

205
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,200
 and 28,571 servings of chicken?

206
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,170
I know a really good beef tripe restaurant.

207
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,410
It is high in protein, low in calories and

208
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,690
has a lot of collagen so it's good for the skin.

209
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,690
The more you chew, the more savory it is.

210
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,700
And there's so much tripe inside, it's so light.

211
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,790
It's light like premium-grade beef?

212
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,920
Of course.

213
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,450
So, how does this work?

214
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:10,420
I saw it at your office. How this will work.

215
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,100
What are you doing?

216
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,820
- What's this? 
- Why do you look so surprised?

217
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,070
You look like you've never seen it before.

218
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,630
 I've never seen it before.

219
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,440

220
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,770

221
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,460
 Of course.

222
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,790
 A detective really is a detective.

223
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,590
How's this?

224
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,930
 Every day at 5:30 a.m., there's a produce truck that enters the health spa.

225
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,540
 I'm friends with the CEO there so I asked him for the favor.

226
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,510
 If you disguise yourself as a worker,

227
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,330
 you'll be able to enter the health spa.

228
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:15,050
 Be still, my heart.

229
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,480
 Oh right, I don't have a heartbeat.

230
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,090
 The delivery truck stays at the health spa for

231
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,790
 exactly 5 minutes.

232
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,530
 You must bring Yoonju out within five minutes, no matter what.

233
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,150
 Boss, you should stay with the other workers

234
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,220
 and go through this entrance.

235
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,970
 You will have to be careful because the security is very tight.

236
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Nice! Nice, nice.

237
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,560
Now we just need Yoonju. Yoonju...

238
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,550
Then, as you're with the other workers

239
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,980
on your way to the cafeteria,

240
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,290
I will be locating Yoonju on the mountain.

241
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,050
Yoonju...

242
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,590
Yoonju.

243
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,440
Where are you, Yoonju?

244
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,380
 Boss!

245
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,750
I found Yoonju.

246
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,800
If you leave through the opposite door where you came in, there's an exit.

247
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,680
Follow that hall and go straight to a red-brick building.

248
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,870
 Enter that building and take the stairs in the center to the second floor.

249
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:40,730
 It will be the second room on the left.

250
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,010
 Go to the left,

251
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,110
 and find the second room.

252
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

253
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,600
It was my left. Sorry.

254
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,720
 Boss, there are people going in your direction!

255
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,770
Excuse me.

256
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,610
Let's get out of here.

257
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,700
Hello?

258
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,630
Your family has been waiting. Please hurry and let's get out.

259
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,220
The people here are my family

260
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,670
and the leader is my parent.

261
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,500
She's not in her right mind.

262
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,620
Boss, you have 2 minutes and 30 seconds left.

263
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,070
Do you think that I don't know you are trying to take me to hell, you devil?!

264
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,780
The leader will not forgive you.

265
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,050
He will throw you into the fiery pit of hell!  Ah!!!

266
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,830
 Wow!  What's this now?!

267
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,810
 What's taking you so long?

268
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,790
 I got her out.

269
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,680
You just need to get in the car and it will all be over.

270
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,550
Wait!

271
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,310
You, take your mask off for a moment.

272
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,010
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

273
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,210
Ah, hello.

274
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,000
 Have you been well?

275
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,330
 The weather is very nice, isn't it?

276
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,450
 That's right, it is.

277
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,320
- Ah, are you alright?!
 - Ah, damn!  Let go for a moment.

278
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,490
Uh?!  You?!

279
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,540
You, the raw meat psycho. Right?

280
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,740
 Of all people, that unlikable...

281
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,390
What is this?

282
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:37,450
 The more I learn about it, the more surprised I am about my body.

283
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,270
 Boss, you have 30 seconds left!

284
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,420
 Danger always...

285
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,650
 comes from unexpected places.

286
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,160
 We don't have much time.  Why isn't he coming?

287
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,500
Oppa!  Oppa, are you okay?!

288
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,650
- What to I do?!  Oppa, are you okay?! 
 - Yeah, I am okay.

289
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,610
- What are we going to do? 
 - Oppa!

290
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,510
Why are you coming out of there?

291
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,660
Who is this woman?

292
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,390
- This is... 
 - Hey, what is that on your wrist?

293
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,580
This is a couple's bracelet to match with Oppa's.  Who the heck are you?

294
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,590
Oppa got it to match with mine.

295
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,640
- What are you talking about? 
 - Hey!

296
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,080
-  Yoonju. 
 - Hey!?

297
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,960
Honey!

298
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,540
Where do you get off talking informally to me?!

299
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
- Calm down. 
 - Let go at the count of three.

300
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,560
- One, two, three! 
 - One, two, three!

301
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,070
 Boss, unexpected situation!   A crowd of people are going there!

302
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,700
 Retreat for now!  Retreat!

303
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
You!  You, stop right there!

304
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,430
- Damn! 
 - You, where are you going?!

305
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,700
We are switching to Plan B.

306
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,830
Boss!   Boss!

307
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,630
You should tell... tell me what Plan B is...

308
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,540
Now I've seen everything!

309
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,650
Tell us.

310
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,390
 Boss, what happened?   Boss?

311
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,810
Hold on!

312
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
Stop right there!

313
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,820
Hold on!  Let me go!

314
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,020
Ah, sorry!  I am really sorry!

315
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,820
This!...

316
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,660
 The result of the pill's ingredient came out.

317
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,980
Visit World King Detective Agency!

318
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,510
Our president will find anything and everything for you!

319
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,670
I will find for you dog baby, cow baby, even pigeon baby!

320
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,890
We are open 24 hours so come visit anytime!

321
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,970
World King Detective Agency!

322
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,970
World King Detective Agency!

323
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,080
Gangrim City's hope for the future!

324
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,990
Gangrim City's hope for the future,

325
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,550
if you need anything,

326
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,850
tell me.

327
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,240
Wow, it's candy!

328
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,640
Hey, don't take it.

329
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,640
If you talk to him, you have to pay him.

330
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,050
What?

331
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,830
We are Mr. Kim Mooyoung's regulars.

332
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,360
- Hey, let's go. 
 - Yeah, let's go.

333
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,300
Why don't you give up on changing your image to impress the kids?

334
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,500
Kids nowadays are

335
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,990
too smart to fall for something like this.

336
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,410
I, Lee Sungrok,

337
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,960
can't hold back any longer.

338
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,560

339
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,050
Hey, you, Kim Mooyoung!

340
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,930
Listen carefully!  I, Lee Sungrok, am warning you!

341
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,770
If you mess around by price dumping or stealing clients again,

342
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,370
I will put an end to you!  Got that!

343
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,070
Boss, weren't those words too harsh?

344
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,020
This is all for Gangrim City, isn't it?

345
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,310
Don't provoke me!

346
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,980
I don't hear any sound, Boss.

347
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,370
Maybe Detective Kim is not inside?

348
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,080
What are you saying?!  It's more like he is trembling with fear.

349
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,070
Having disturbed the market ecosystem...

350
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,560
This bullfrog-like punk!

351
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,580
Who's the bull and who is the frog?

352
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,420
Of course, I am the bull and he's the frog!

353
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,130
Are you being sarcastic?

354
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,900
Don't you know bullfrog?!

355
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,250
In the morning,

356
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,810
there seemed to have been some trouble inside the health spa.

357
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,960
You don't need to worry about that.

358
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,420
It's all been taken care of.

359
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,980
So that the believers don't get agitated,

360
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,120
please be careful.

361
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,890
Yes, Sir.

362
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,100
Elder, how long do you think the people will believe me?

363
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,680
Make an injured one stand up

364
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,990
and heal the sick one...

365
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,290
I am sick of this!  Sick of it!

366
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,600
We need an innovative idea

367
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,880
that has never been seen anywhere.

368
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,910
If I could just show something like that during a testimonial meeting...

369
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,410
It doesn't matter 100 people or 1000 people,

370
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,800
or the entire world population,

371
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,590
it would be so easy to make them believe.

372
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,520
Leader, there is something I need to tell you.

373
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,490
What is that?

374
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,760
 A zombie always needs to watch the back of his head...

375
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,580
 Hallucinogen?!  They must be crazy!

376
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,650
It's all in the report.

377
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,680
- Then, you are telling me that this is drug? 
 - Yeah.

378
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,000
It causes severe hallucination.

379
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,840
This crazy bastard!

380
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,070
- I am leaving. 
 - What?  Hey!

381
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,110
There she goes again.

382
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,940
These nasty New Truth bastards

383
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,980
used this hallucinogen to completely brainwash people.

384
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,770
Ah, Team Leader!

385
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,160
You have to conduct a search and seizure right now!

386
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:33,160
Writer Gong, do you have any evidence that this pill is from the health spa?

387
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,430
If you at least have a witness who can testify or an eyewitness... then search and seizure... is possible...

388
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,940
A witness?  All you need is a witness?

389
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,690
You have one?

390
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,730
That witness...

391
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,410
cannot be... reached.

392
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,440
It was the same thing last time! We listened to you and arrested Lee Gwangsik!

393
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,860
Do you know how much trouble we got into with the chief?!

394
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,450
Team Leader!  Lee Gwangsik has ties to politicians, the press, and law enforcement.

395
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,640
They are all in it together!

396
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,590
- Let's go outside and talk. 
 - Ah, Team Leader!

397
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,640
Is our relationship worth only this much?!

398
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,580
I am really disappointed!

399
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,280
Disappointed?

400
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,130
I will look into it so just go home.

401
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,020
What is this?

402
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,320
It's a capsaicin sprayer for self-defense.  There will be an immediate result if you spray this, so carry it with you all the time.

403
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,400
Suddenly?

404
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,590
You know that if the New Truth people find out what you are doing, there is no knowing what they might do.

405
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,290
Cha Dohyun... you believe me.

406
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,250
Wait just for a little while.  I will somehow get the search warrant.

407
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,520
You are the best!

408
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,280
I will use it well.

409
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,520
You don't go around doing this to just any guy, right?

410
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,740
Hey, be careful, will you!

411
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,450
Where is this place?

412
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,060
 The smell that is most familiar to a zombie... the smell of a corpse.

413
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,320
 That place is hell where once you enter you cannot get out even when you are dead.

414
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,620
 Rumor has it that they even concealed the deaths of believers.

415
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,140
What the hell have they been doing here?

416
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,490
Mr. Kim Mooyoung, your father, your only blood relation,  passed away three years ago.

417
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:39,750
You only get one or two cases of work per year at your detective agency.

418
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,710
It must've been tough.

419
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,490
 The deceased Kim Mooyoung also must've had a hard time making ends meet.

420
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,350
You don't have any more sources for income,

421
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,290
so why did God let you live?

422
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,440
There are many ways to show your gratitude to God.

423
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,390
However, God does not believe what cannot be seen.

424
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,790
God is...

425
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:19,340
much more suspicious than what the humans know.

426
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,680
What is it that you want from me?

427
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,060
I think we will understand each other very well.

428
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,430
You got hit by a car going at 70kph (43.5mph) but got up fine.

429
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:02,910
You broke the window to escape but did not bleed a drop of blood.

430
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,890
Is that possible with a human body?

431
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:16,040
What is your real identity?

432
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,100
 Is he onto something?

433
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,760
In truth, my body does not have any senses.

434
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,030
You don't have any senses, hmm.

435
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:44,220
You don't feel any physical pain.  Is that right?

436
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,820
Yes, that's right.

437
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,670
Would it be okay for me to see it myself to confirm?

438
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,020
Confirm... what?

439
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,730
What... What are you doing, Sir?

440
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,100
A miracle is not something far away.

441
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,150
It seems that you, Brother, have found the best way to express your heart.

442
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,290
 What kind of bullcrap is this now?

443
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,170
Kim Yoonju.

444
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:22,950
What you, Brother, want is Sister Kim Yoonju, isn't that right?

445
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:31,010
If you help me, I will give you what you want.

446
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,120
Help... you?

447
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,870
That's right.  Let's pretend to be crazy and go in.

448
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,010

449
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,020
Boss?

450
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,950
Hello?  Boss, are you okay?

451
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,890
I am fine, so far,

452
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,410
but I got caught by them.

453
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,970
About that diet supplement... it was indeed a hallucinogen.

454
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,890
I saw it, too.

455
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,100
These jerks here are totally crazy.

456
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,410
What should we do?  I did tell the police

457
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,460
  but it may take some time...

458
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,060
Next Tuesday night at 8:00 p.m., there will be a testimonial meeting in the worship hall.

459
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,820
 I will distract them

460
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,460
so you get Yoonju out no matter what.

461
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,510
How are you going to do it?

462
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,240
I will take care of that so you just find Yoonju and get her out no matter what.  Got that?

463
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
How do I find Yoonju—

464
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,840
Hello?  Hello?  Boss?

465
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,830
Are you okay?

466
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,390
I don't have any feeling.

467
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,780
 Zombies don't have any pain or senses.

468
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,770
We seem to work well together.

469
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,400
Oh, Joonwoo, you are good at this!

470
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,010
Do it to my hand.  My hand.

471
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,000
 - It's cool. 
 - Oh, oh, oh!

472
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,690
No!

473
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,020
Please, please.

474
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,400
Just once.

475
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,910

476
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,610

477
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,740
 Our spiritual father is making his entrance!

478
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,260
 Fervently!

479
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,490
 Fervently!

480
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,850
- I am here. 
 - Let there be wild miracles.

481
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,220
- Please help us be wild. 
  - Let there be wild miracles.

482
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,160
 Let there be wild miracles.

483
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,100
 Let there be wild miracles.

484
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,320
 Let there be wild miracles.

485
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,600
 Spiritual father!

486
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,070
 Please!

487
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,120
Welcome!

488
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,310
Do you believe in miracles?

489
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,890
What is today?

490
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,970
It is the day the earth will perish!

491
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,760
But there is not a drop of rain coming down now,

492
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,140
and the weather is perfectly fine.  Why?

493
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,160
It's all because you have been praying hard

494
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,670
and gave looooots of offerings,

495
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:35,230
I, a god, changed that plan!

496
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,340
Fiercely!  Intensely!

497
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,790
Intensely!

498
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,130
If you believe in me

499
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,620
and pray and give lots of offerings,

500
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:54,720
I, a god, will save you!

501
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,210
Intensely!

502
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,900
 If I stay here any longer, even I will go insane.

503
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,290
Are you okay?

504
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,070
Please help me.

505
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:56,130
Please help me.

506
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,140
Wait just a moment, please.

507
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:12,110
It's okay.  It's okay.

508
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,820
Slowly.

509
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,640
Can you get up?

510
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,820
Get on my back, please.

511
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,080
God, I ask you to get the devil out of this body.

512
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,030
Come out from inside there!

513
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,840
Come out!

514
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,630
Devil, you can't stay inside there.

515
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,340
Come out!  I order you in the name of god!

516
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,880
Devil, come out!

517
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,820
Come out!  Come out!

518
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,560
Come out!

519
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,360
It hurts.

520
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,410
He said it hurts.  He can talk!  Oh, god!

521
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:56,950
Everyone saw it, didn't you?  A miracle occurred.

522
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,390
More intensely!

523
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,280

524
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,670
 Okay.  Now let's get out of here.

525
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:10,940
I will show you an even moooooore amaaaaaazing miracle.

526
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,560
He came from hell.

527
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,610
Please welcome him.  Cheers!

528
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,490
Oh, dear God!

529
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,180
 But this won't do.  I need to hurry up and get out of here.

530
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,240
Everyone, aren't you curious as to

531
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,190
why this Brother came from hell?

532
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,490
 I am curious!

533
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:39,990
Our brother here, when he was young, was deathly sick for 10 days after taking the wrong medication

534
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:46,900
and had a near-death experience of hell.

535
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:53,070
After the experience, he had high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea every day.

536
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,640
He was so weak that he would sway in the wind

537
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,840
and fall just after taking a few steps.

538
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,740
As you can see, he is no different than a living corpse.

539
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,090
 A living corpse?!

540
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:18,330
Today, I, a god, will let you escape from the physical pain!

541
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,470
Do you believe?!

542
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,940
 I believe!

543
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:28,340
Entrust your body to me!

544
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,130
Fiercely!

545
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,030
 Fiercely!

546
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,260
Brother, how are you feeling now?

547
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,400
Are you in pain?

548
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:59,230
Ah, it hurts!  It hurts!

549
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:02,090
Ah, I am in so much pain!

550
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,560
Brother, what are you doing now?!

551
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,530
 Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, scam for a scam...

552
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,640
 Show for a show, you punk!

553
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,820
Elder, the police are on their way.

554
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,360
 I ripped it.

555
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,150
Leader, it looks like a trap.  The police are on their way.

556
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,240
You need to get out quickly!

557
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,900
This ends today's testimonial meeting.

558
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,560
I am coming with a search warrant so wait just a little while.

559
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,650
Okay, they are all dead meat!

560
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,630
Dead meat!

561
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,210
 Lee Gwangsik, stop right there!

562
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,210
 That wench, how did she get in here?!

563
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,670
 Lee Gwangsik, stop right there!

564
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,320
Hey, let go!

565
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,370
When should I get up?

566
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,950
- Ah! 
 - Wait!

567
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,700
- Excuse me. 
 - Woah!

568
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,470
Are you okay?

569
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,440
Now, this sir, not the leader, is a god.

570
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,420
This sir is truly a god who came from hell!

571
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,450
He is a god!

572
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,160
He is a god!

573
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,600
He is a god!

574
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,140
I warned you.

575
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,090
That I will throw you into the fiery pit of hell if you piss me off one more time.

576
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:13,230
Do you think I will go to the fiery pit alone?!

577
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,010
This crazy—

578
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,060
Come here.

579
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:22,160
You are done for!

580
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,210
What's this?

581
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:32,060
Ouch!

582
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,390

583
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:35,450
What the–

584
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,840
Boss!

585
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,620
Hey, don't do it!

586
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:44,040
 It's not like I practiced for this moment but—

587
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,680
Don't do it!

588
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,040
Hey, don't do it!

589
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,810
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

590
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,010
Lee Gwangsik!

591
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:13,330
Why don't you just give up now?

592
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,210
It's all over now for you!

593
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:23,390
Over?  Says who?

594
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,750
The beginning and the end to everything...

595
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,640
I...

596
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,440
I decide!

597
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,210
Boss!

598
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,870
Boss, are you okay?

599
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,840
What do I do?!

600
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,360
Run away, Chairman Lee!

601
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,960
I will take care of it!

602
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,430
Boss!  Boss!

603
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:43,420
Since things have turned out this way, let's start over together.

604
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,610
I have some land in Gyeonggi Province as well.

605
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:53,500
You are special!

606
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,200
Because you are someone special

607
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,600
that I, a god, have chosen.

608
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,660
Special?

609
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,490
That's right.  I am special.

610
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,140
But I don't want to become someone special.

611
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,210
I want to become someone ordinary.

612
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:16,930
I might not have physical pain

613
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,750
but my existence alone gives me psychological pain.

614
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,310
Just accept your fate.

615
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:50,720
You know it, too, that you cannot go back to being a human.

616
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:06,540
That's right.

617
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,250
This is the real you.

618
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,770
You are not a human.  You are a monster.

619
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,020
What is this?

620
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:34,780
Sa... Satan?!  Ah!

621
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:37,920
 Boss, where are you?!

622
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,740
 Boss!

623
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,310
Boss!

624
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,310
Okay, I'll see you at the station.

625
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,530
- Hey, hold onto them tight! 
 - Yes, Sir!

626
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,520
Are you hurt anywhere?

627
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,300
Yoonju!

628
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,250
Let me take a look at you.  Are you hurt anywhere?

629
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,090
I am sorry.  I am sorry, my daughter.

630
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,260
What are you doing just standing there?

631
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,980
Detective Kim, do you know?

632
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:33,280
that you are a god to me.

633
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,760
And your new employee... she does good work.

634
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:57,500
 Do I... also have a family that's waiting for me?

635
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,630
How is your injury?

636
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:10,230
It's okay.

637
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,910
Let me see, please.  There is no way it would be okay.

638
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:15,580
I said it's okay.  There is no need to see.

639
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,720
You are fine after getting stabbed with a cane and fine after getting stabbed with broken window glass.

640
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,280
What? Are you a zombie or something?

641
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,990
♫  I can’t approach you  ♫

642
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,720
I am just kidding!  No need to look so serious.

643
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,650
From now, don't joke like that!  It's not funny at all.

644
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:36,380
♫  The feelings behind your face  ♫

645
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,540
And text me your bank account number.  I will send your salary.

646
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,920
Really?  Does that mean that the work I did is worth more than ₩100,000,000?

647
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,090
That's not what I am saying.  Work is work and settlement money is settlement money.

648
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,980
I am not a thug who bosses around his subordinate.  That's all I am saying.

649
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,380
That's why...

650
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:02,810
I think detective work suits me better than broadcast work...

651
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,490
so...

652
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,610
just think of it as paying that ₩100,000,000 in installments

653
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:13,020
and would you consider... working together... from now...

654
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,870
No, I wouldn't!  No, never!  Okay?

655
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,920
♫  So then I can know  ♫

00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:36,920
 He had committed embezzlement, assault, and attempted murder five years ago and caused disorder.

658
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,860
 The leader of New Truth Church, Lee Gwangsik, and those related have been arrested.

659
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,590
 They illegally manufactured hallucinogens

660
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:46,390
 and force fed them to the victims...

661
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,580
You get fired from the broadcast station

662
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,210
and this is what you do?!  Detective?!

663
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,100
I told you not to go around wasting time, didn't I?!

664
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,620
Honey, why is that wasting time?

665
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,240
She caught that bad punk.  It's something to be proud of.

666
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,680
Sister-in-Law, you really are great.  Respect.

667
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,850
Thank you.

668
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,380
That's right.  Auntie, you are so cool.

669
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,190
Thank you, our Joonwoo.

670
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,090
Eat a lot.

671
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,020
 Gangrim City Police is...

672
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:16,930
But... how is your boss?

673
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,570
Age?  Married?  Family relationship?

674
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,570
Is the office leased or is it month to month?

675
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,080
- Or— 
 - Honey, why are you asking those kinds of things?

676
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,060
You should have at least the basic information on the person paying.

677
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,680
Is he possibly a building owner?

678
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,910
- Is he a building owner?! 
 - That's what I was going to ask!

679
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,150
Why are you so impatient?

680
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:45,300
I don't know about a building owner but one thing for sure is that he is a good person.

681
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,640
Forget that. But the... the building, is that his... his?

682
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,300
No?   If he has everything, he is a good person...

683
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,350
So does he or does he not have a building...

684
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,210
I am kidding.

685
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,210
Who else?

686
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,490
Damn right!  Our team got them all!

687
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:03,550
- Bring it on! 
 - Yes!

688
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,040
That's right!

689
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,570
Hey, hear me out!

690
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,760
He is fine after getting hit by a car and fine after getting stabbed with a cane...

691
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,260
Is that a human?  That punk is not a human, I am telling you!

692
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,350
We can talk again when the drug wears off.

693
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,790
What...  What are you talking about?

694
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:29,060
Why... Why would I do drugs?  Drugs are so bad for you...

695
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,300
 Deposit completed.

696
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,650
 It looks like I don't need to worry about money for a while.

697
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:49,450
 This truly is Heaven.  Heaven.

698
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,140

699
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,590

700
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,410

701
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,990
What the hell is that punk?

702
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,480
Why the hell is he eating raw chicken?

703
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,560
Ah!  Don't come!

704
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,490
Stop right there!

705
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:15,200
You...

706
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,530
What are you?

707
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:28,390

708
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:34,910

709
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,450

710
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,390
 Zombies certainly do exist somewhere in the 21st century Korea.]

711
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,090
 What is wrong with being a zombie?

712
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:47,250
 Until I died... I was a human... just like everyone else.

713
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,960
 You're Kim Mooyoung, right?

714
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,240
 If you let that punk live, there could be a bloodbath.

715
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,040
 Mister, are you going somewhere far?

716
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,060
 - Kim Mooyoung?
 - In front of the detective office...

717
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,450
 Dad!

718
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,350
 I wouldn't know.  Since he came from hell, maybe he went back to hell...

719
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:07,630
 I came back alive... to hell.

720
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,240
