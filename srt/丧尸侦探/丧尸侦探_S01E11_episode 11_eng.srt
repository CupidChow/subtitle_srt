1
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,590

2
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,440
No Poongsik had been conducting illegal experiments on animals every night.

3
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,160
Since he is the director of an animal hospital,

4
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,330
no one would have suspected him.

5
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,500
Then, Kim Mooyoung knew all about No Poongsik's illegal experiments.

6
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,240
Yes.

7
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,540
Since he watched everything, including the disposal procedure.

8
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,040
 But that night, at that place,

9
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,410
 no one could have imagined that a person was buried there.

10
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,460
 As that drug seeped into your body,

11
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,830
you came back to life from death, it seems.

12
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,570
I think so.

13
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,980
 Hello.

14
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,090
 Is this HBS?  I would like to report something.

15
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,560

16
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,510
But why the heck did No Poongsik conduct these experiments?

17
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,770
You said that No Poongsik's daughter went missing, didn't you?

18
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,870
Yes.

19
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,080
She is thought to be the first victim

20
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,990
of a missing person's case that occurred in Gangrim City five years ago.

21
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:04,270
I think President Lee Sungrok might know something about the cases related to No Poongsik.

22
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,700
I am telling you...

23
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,280
This World King Agency that's been in business for 20 years...

24
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,520
To fall because of Kim Mooyoung...

25
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,360
Would I have to put up for sale even this building?

26
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,610
How long are you going to be like this?

27
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,930
You need to get a grip in order for us to accept clients.  Aren't you going to work?

28
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,200
It's because you haven't seen that Kim Mooyoung.

29
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,870
That punk was not a human.

30
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,260
 Don't come.  Don't come!!!

31
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,030
Not a human...

32
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,900
If not a human, then are you saying he is a ghost, goblin, or the grim reaper or something?

33
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,440
- What?  Say more. 
 - Eh?

34
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,160
Ghost, goblin, grim reaper.  Aren't there anymore?  Other than human...

35
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,220
Mermaid princess.

36
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,920
No, it wasn't any sort of fish.

37
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
- Nine-tailed fox. 
 - No, it didn't have any tail.

38
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,960
- Apparition? 
 - No, it didn't have that feel.

39
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,130
- Hong Kong Granny? 
 - It wasn't a granny.

40
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,080
Genie.

41
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,810
It wasn't blue.

42
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,930
Centaur?

43
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,890
No, they weren't a horse's legs.

44
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,340
- Zombie? 
 - Zombie—

45
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,810
Zombie?  Zombie.

46
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,300
Oh, damn!  That surprised me!

47
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,670
Do-Don't open it.

48
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,860
- Yes, coming. 
 - Don't open it!

49
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,860
- Acting so childish. 
 - I told you not to open it!

50
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,770
That punk! He really doesn't listen!

51
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,570
No!

52
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,650
President Lee.

53
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,230
About last time...

54
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,360
Anyway, since this is my first visit, I didn't want to come empty-handed...

55
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,070
Anyway, wh-what brings you here, sir?

56
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,260
Gosh, you surprised me!

57
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:34,220
We want to know about a missing person's case that occurred in Gangrim City five years ago.

58
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,300
Missing?

59
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,720
A missing person's case...

60
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,350
Are you talking about the "shadow" case maybe?

61
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,210
"Shadow" case?

62
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,490
There was a missing person's case in Gangrim City a while back.

63
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,920
Our agency was also asked to work on the case.

64
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,390
Of course, no one, including myself, was able to solve it.

65
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,750
What was that case?

66
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,170
The time was five years prior.

67
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:21,400
 Woman, man, child, or elderly, it didn't matter.  All disappeared, regardless.

68
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,040
 Gangrim City's mysterious missing person's case...

69
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,660
 But no one saw the face of the culprit.

70
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,560
 Only the shadow was seen.

71
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,880
I heard that the first victim of the "shadow" case

72
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,240
was the daughter of the director of the Gangrim animal hospital.

73
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,780
Yeah, she was Hyungnim Poongsik's daughter.

74
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,120
You are close to No Poongsik, aren't you?

75
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,260
No Poongsik?

76
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,630
Yeah, I've heard of his name, as a fellow citizen of Gangrim City.

77
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,500
But I haven't even met him.

78
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,620
Didn't you talk on the phone with Hyungnim Poongsik even yesterday?

79
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,910
- You mean Hyungnim Choongsik? 
 - Poongsik—

80
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,100
- Choongsik.  Ah, it's possible you could've heard it like that— 
 - Poong—

81
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,110
Ah, that's why you heard it like that.  Did you get poong in your ear?  Poong... 
 (T/N: "stroke" or "wind" in Korean.)

82
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,430
I will send you to see an Ear-Nose-Throat specialist.

83
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,430
Anyway, I have nothing more to say, so hurry up and go.

84
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,140
But are you feeling all right?

85
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,990
No Poongsik... It will be best for you to be careful around him.

86
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,420
Have a good day.

87
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,120
He has no idea what kind of jerk No Poongsik is.

88
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,530
Unless you see it for yourself, it would be hard to believe.  Even when you do see it for yourself, it's hard to believe.

89
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,950
Kim Mooyoung!  Are you gone?

90
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,130
You are gone, right?

91
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,690
Gosh, I was scared to death.

92
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:08,070
Wait a minute. Why is Kim Mooyoung asking about Hyungnim Poongsik?

93
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,860
Does he know something?

94
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,180
Kim Mooyoung came by, is that right?

95
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,740
Yes.  He asked about the Gangrim City missing person's case.

96
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,950
He seems to already know about your daughter as well.

97
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,870
I am not sure why Kim Mooyoung is digging up that case.

98
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,090
It didn't seem like he was asked to by a client.

99
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,570
What he wants to know—

100
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,110
Anyway, he came by with that intern.

101
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,670
I will be right back.

102
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,350
Please attend to business and come back, Hyungnim.

103
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,870
Doesn't it seem like Hyungnim is not in a good mood?

104
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,270
He just looks that way.  He is a good person.

105
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,150
- What was that?  What was that sound? 
 - What are you talking about?

106
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,070
Just now, this sound.  Is it a dog?

107
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,510
I didn't hear anything.

108
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,270
Uh, don't you hear this sound?

109
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,790
I hear your nonsense.

110
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,950
I think it's coming from here.

111
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,920
Boss, come back!

112
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
What if he gets mad?

113
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,490
Boss!  Should we take a quick look?

114
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,960
I don't think we're allowed to go in.

115
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,310
This place seems weird.

116
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,420
You scared me!

117
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,330
That surprised me.

118
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,290
Be careful.

119
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,890
That sound...

120
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,370
Don't open it.

121
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,060
Why is he locked up?

122
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,010
Boss, what is that?

123
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,790
Boss?

124
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,240
Damn it.

125
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,450
Did you want to prove you were a detective?

126
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,180
He sure has many suspicions.

127
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,620

128
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,180

129
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,310
If we don't have proof that No Poongshik killed Kim Mooyoung,

130
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,190
No Poongshik will have to confess on his own.

131
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,140
And this veterinary hospital has been closed for days now.

132
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,760
Where is he hiding?

133
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,810
What was that? What was that sound just now?

134
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,670
I couldn't eat breakfast this morning. I'll go get something from the convenience store.

135
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,660
If there isn't any raw chicken left in the refrigerator, I can get some more.

136
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,300
No, let me just come with you.

137
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,120
No, no. I don't want to hit you on the head in public.

138
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,520
Then, at least get it through a BOGO. 
   (T/N: BOGO - "buy one get one free")

139
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,280
Obviously.

140
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,060
I'll be back.

141
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,010
Oh right!

142
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,230
Give me your phone.

143
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,260
What do you want with my phone?

144
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,070
I suffered so much trying to find you in the alley last time.

145
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,160
What is that?

146
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,790
A location tracking app.

147
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,580
If I do this, we can know each other's location.

148
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,800
Location tracker?

149
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,930
I'll be back.

150
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,350

151
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:07,660
What is this? Isn't this for couples?

152
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,560
This is cool.

153
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,860
What's this now?

154
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,200
"'My Girl' is on the move..."

155
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,650
That— Why did she download this on mine?

156
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,820
♫   Even Heaven is on your side   ♫

157
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,830
- Thank you.

158
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,840
Come again.

159
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,450
- I hope you sell a lot! 
 - Thank you.

160
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,560
♫ Martini blue ♫

161
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,470

00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,390
♫ Oh, oh, oh, martini blue ♫

163
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,890
♫ I can't come out of your ocean ♫

164
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,190
Is your head in the clouds? Why didn't you respond when I called you?

165
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,640
You called me? I didn't hear you.

166
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,390
Gosh. What are those chickens for?

167
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,010
I thought you were supposed to be at work.

168
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,100
I don't think you plan on eating that at the office.

169
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,890
I'm going volunteering at an abandoned dog shelter with my boss.

170
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:25,490
Volunteering? If you have time to volunteer there, volunteer where I work.

171
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,630
 "My Man" has...

172
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,770
- My Man? 
  - sent you a message.

173
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,160
What is this? What was that?

174
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,030
Did you get a boyfriend?

175
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,580
No. I downloaded an app, but why is it making weird sounds?

176
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,720
Is it... your boss?

177
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,200
- My boss? Don't be ridiculous. 
 - Give it.

178
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,810
 Kim Mooyoung has sent you a heart.

179
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,850
 - I love you! 
 -   I love you? I love you?

180
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,420
- Sis! 
 - He loves you?

181
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,870
What's wrong with you?

182
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,390
- Wait! 
 - Hand it over!

183
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,660
Go deliver your stuff!

184
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,830
What is this? What are all these hearts?

185
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,330
Cancel! What—

186
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,930
Who is it?

187
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,970
Come in.

188
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,200
No Poongshik?

189
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,150

190
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,330
Wang Wei.

191
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,120
Yes?

192
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,740
Wang Wei...

193
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,990

194
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm Detective Cha from the Violent Crimes Unit at Gangrim Police Station.

195
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,530
We came after your call.

196
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:44,290
Are you sure it was this person who came by?

197
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,400
Yes, it was him.

198
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,160
He stayed for three days right by the memorial.

199
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,120
He didn't sleep a wink or go to the bathroom once.

200
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,670
I thought he was her biological son.

201
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,130
Thanks.

202
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,130
Kim Mooyoung attended the missing Kang Minho's mother's funeral service.

203
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,450
But they don't know each other at all.

204
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,840
Do you think Writer Gong might know something? She came to the funeral—

205
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,790
She probably came because their agency investigated Oh Hyungchul.

206
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,600
She didn't have any other family, either.

207
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,780
You know she has a big heart.

208
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,870
Do you think she really came solely because she was the victim of a case she was investigating?

209
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,330
About Writer Gong,

210
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,370
do you think she knows something about Kim Mooyoung and is hiding it?

211
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,220
It's not like that.

212
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,480
A detective only believes what they see.

213
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,430
Only what we see.

214
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,600
Boss!

215
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,190
Boss, I brought chicken that's bigger than your head...

216
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,080
So where the hell did he go in that short time?

217
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,360
What the— Why is it so clean?

218
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,270

219
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,820
Gangrim Veterinary Hospital?

220
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,910
No Poongshik?

221
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,830
♫ The night only gets lonelier ♫

222
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,270
♫ The words we exchanged through tears ♫

223
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,590
♫ I feel it inside ♫

224
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,910
♫ So many nights pass ♫

225
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,580
♫ But my heart only knows you ♫

226
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,990
♫ Though my tears fall sadly ♫

227
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,640
♫ You are the face I miss ♫

228
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,400
Is this possible?

229
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,970
I can't believe I succeeded.

230
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,210
What is this place?

231
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,920
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,020
Why did you kill Kim Mooyoung?

233
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,440
Did you kill Kim Mooyoung so you could continue this crazy shit?

234
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,760
Is that what you want to know?

235
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,280
What's important is that a zombie like you exists.

236
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,970
You can walk, talk, and think like a person.

237
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,930
You're a zombie with senses.

238
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,470
You crazy bastard.

239
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,630
Let me go. I said, let me go!

240
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,920

241
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,650

242
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,450

243
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,590
This is definitely the right place.

244
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,200
 Location tracker?

245
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,110
 I'll be back.

246
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,220
 Crap, if I'm not here when you're back or something happens,

247
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,500
 don't you dare poke your nose around uselessly.

248
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,990
 That will be best for me, understood?

249
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,550
Writer Gong!

250
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,460
PD!

251
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,720
You didn't have to buy this, you could've just come.

252
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,830
It wasn't that expensive, anyway.

253
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,420
So, you're curious about the Shadow case, right?

254
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,060
I reported that case.

255
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,960
It was really something. There was no evidence and no body.

256
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,360
The body was never discovered?

257
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,960

258
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,590
Yeah, here.

259
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,750
- These are all the victims of this case? 
 - Yeah.

260
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,930
The missing people generally had no family.

261
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,130
They were foreign labor workers or senior citizens and women who lived alone.

262
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,720
Then, adding the number of people who were never reported to be missing, there must be an overwhelming amount.

263
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,610
Right.

264
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,800
- This is the last known location of these missing people? 
 - Yeah.

265
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,870
They're all around the veterinary hospital.

266
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,960
In a way, that hospital is also a victim of this case.

267
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,360
- PD, can I take a picture of this? 
 - Sure.

268
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,630
Writer Gong, have you ever considered coming back to the broadcast station?

269
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,660
We're a bit short on staff for 70-Minute Chase.

270
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,160
I mean, you already caught the Santa culprit.

271
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,490
If I'm being honest, you're an extremely nosy person.

272
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,040
How many cases have you solved because of that?

273
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:05,150
PD, for me, rather than wrapping up a case officially,

274
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,190
I think I'm better suited to actually solving cases behind the scenes.

275
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,010
I won't have to hurt innocent people needlessly.

276
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,890
PD, I have to go.

277
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,990
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

278
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,310
- I'll call you. 
 - Okay.

279
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,220
Let me know if you change your mind! And take care of yourself!

280
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,970
Detective Kim, are you really a zombie?

281
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,360
But how— No... is this even possible?

282
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,990
There's a zombie in Korea?

283
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,310
Let's get out of here for now.

284
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,240
No.

285
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,250
Don't do this.

286
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,950
 This sound. No way.

287
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,020
Hey!

288
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,690
 It's another zombie.

289
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,690
 There are other zombies besides me?

290
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,850
What is that?

291
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,060
He... went after...

292
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,990
the human who turned him into a zombie...

293
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,740
and struggled to move his mouth to speak...

294
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,430
Could it be?

295
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,660
This is too hard. I'm stuck.

296
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,420
"It was you." Or not.

297
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:55,150
"You said it was you." No, he's already turned.

298
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,940
I need inspiration.

299
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,060
Inspiration!

300
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,290
 Dad!

301
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,650
Son!

302
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,410
- Hello! 
 - Hi.

303
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,090
Yeon Woo and Tae Yoon came here, too?

304
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,560
- You're hungry, right? 
 - Yeah!

305
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,820
- Should I make you guys spicy rice cake? 
 - Yeah!

306
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,100
Auntie, hello!

307
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,730
What are you doing here at this time? You can have lunch with us.

308
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,510
No, I have to go right out.

309
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,690
Have fun, kids.

310
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,770
- You should at least eat. 
 - Eat with us!

311
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,930
No, I'm okay. It's your favorite spicy rice cake!

312
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,940
No, thank you.

313
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,700
How could she turn down spicy rice cake?

314
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,770
Of course, we need fish cake.

315
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,590
I'll be back.

316
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,390
You're really not going to eat? It's your favorite

317
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,720
- spicy rice cake. 
 - I'm not.

318
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,590
I'm not eating.

319
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:17,080
Can we put ramen in it, too?

320
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,470
By the way, doesn't your dad go to work?

321
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,960
Nope, my dad works at home all day.

322
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,760
I want to be a movie director when I grow up, too.

323
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,140
That way I won't have to go to an office.

324
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,410
Guys, you don't know how amazing he is, do you?

325
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,290
Don't be like that, Sister-in-Law.

326
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,990
Did you guys see Busan Express?

327
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,500
The Gangshi's Back Hug?

328
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,770
Will You Marry Me?

329
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,890
Why did the Hong Kong Grandma Go to Hong Kong—

330
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:05,090
Sister-in-Law, please stop. They said they haven't watched them.

331
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,300
Brother-in-Law, stand straighter. What are you ashamed of?

332
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,150
To me, you're like Park Chanwook or Bong Joonho. 
 (T/N: famous movie directors in Korea.)

333
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,010
You really are the only person who knows how I feel.

334
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,290
Thank you.

335
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,770
Stop the crying.

336
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,110
Why the hell did you make a zombie?

337
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,160
Do you know?

338
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:13,140
That a wolf only loves one female wolf all his life.

339
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,230
 Honey, I will save you for sure.

340
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,840
 You have to live

341
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,200
 so that I may live.

342
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,420
 You can do it.

343
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,920
 Honey?

344
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,650
 Honey, can you hear me?

345
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,870
 You are alive.  Alive.

346
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,860
 What?  What do you want?

347
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,390
 Water?  Okay, wait just a bit.

348
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,810
 Honey, water!

349
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,340
 Honey.

350
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,090
 Honey?

351
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,000
 Honey.

352
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,230
 Honey...

353
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,660
I thought it then.

354
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,010
If only I could save my wife,

355
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,290
I could do any damn thing.

356
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,460
But still, you made a dead person a zombie?

357
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,350
Honey, we can go back to how it was.

358
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,080
You saw that there is hope, didn't you?

359
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,450
That crazy bastard.

360
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,080

361
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,700

362
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,690
He's in there for sure.

363
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,220
If he ran away, the hospital would be in chaos by now.

364
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,430
Ah, what should I do?

365
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,140

366
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,890
Why are you hesitating?

367
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,100
Ah, Noonim.  Hello.

368
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,870
Because you hesitate like that, you can't catch her.

369
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,040
What are you going to do now?

370
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,990
I am asking what are you going to do about Kong Sunji?

371
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,820
What are you talking about?  Did something happen to Sunji?

372
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,040
Ah, to be honest,

373
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,390
I think she is dating her boss.

374
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,400
Dating?!

375
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,350
Kim Mooyoung?

376
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,970
I heard with my own two ears

377
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,170
the two of them sending each other hearts as couples.

378
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,530
Ah, I am so upset!  I can't really do one-shot (bottoms up) with yogurt or anything...

379
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,360
Aigoo.

380
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,200
Yes, this is Gangrim Police Violent Crimes Unit.

381
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,540
Where?

382
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,720
Yes, we will be right there.

383
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,160
Senior, an unidentified body has been found at Chowol Mountain.

384
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,930
Oh, what in the world!

385
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,770
Ah, I will give you a call after work, Noonim.

386
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,260
Okay, do that.  Hurry up and go.

387
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,970
Let's go.

388
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,350
Ah, you keep working like that all the time.  When are you going to date?

389
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,970
But I wonder what's going on in Gangrim City.  I am so curious.

390
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,170
To live as a zombie...

391
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,920
do you know how painful it is?

392
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:33,560
To have an appetite when looking at a human,

393
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,330
how miserable, disgusting

394
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,570
and abominable it is?

395
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,030
That fact alone makes you want to die.

396
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:48,650
But you can't even die.

397
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,590
To a person you love so much,

398
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,320
do you want to make her feel that pain?

399
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,550
Being alive is what's important.

400
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,920
Alive, by my side.

401
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,450
At least, being alive

402
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:16,310
is better than being dead.

403
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,250
Even if it feels like hell.

404
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,840
 Detective Cha!

405
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,130
Ah, really!

406
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,090
Are you all right

407
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,790
Did the meeting between your family and the future in-laws go well?

408
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,140
We exchanged greetings and the meeting was over in exactly 3 minutes.

409
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,060
What does it matter if I get a special promotion, when I am a zero-point dad to my daughter?

410
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,880
What was the cause of death?

411
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,980
It seems that the bleeding due to a skull fracture is the direct cause of death.

412
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,320
But we will need to do an autopsy in order to find out whether it was an accidental death or a murder.

413
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,830
You said the body was buried at a hillside.

414
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,890
It's a murder case, of course.

415
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,800
Senior, we just got the result of the fingerprints analysis.

416
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,530
Yeah?

417
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,260
But it's a little strange.

418
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,450
What do you mean "strange"?  What is?

419
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,080
The victim's identity came back as Kim Mooyoung of the detective office.

420
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,770
- Kim Mooyoung? 
 - Yes.

421
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:44,070
Look at this.  The meter wouldn't be running at an empty building.

422
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,490
Should I go in?

423
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,440
 (Let's work together)

424
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,890
 (Do that! Pull it up!)

425
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,710
 (No, I won't do it.)

426
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,030
 (That...  go there.)

427
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,910
 (Pull it up.)

428
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,310
I knew it.

429
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,070
Boss.

430
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,370
Boss.

431
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,050
Boss!

432
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,290
What is this?  How did you come here?

433
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,250
What is that?!

434
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:03,280
I will explain later so untie the World King people first.

435
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,200
 (Go! Go! Go!)

436
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,400
 (Come on, go!)

437
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,710
Bend a little.

438
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,440
 (I can't because of my back.)

439
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,530
Don't get afraid and listen carefully.

440
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:28,230
Your boss is... a zombie.

441
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,890
I said he's a zombie!

442
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:35,110
I know.  You are hurting me.

443
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:36,160
Gosh, when I am so busy...

444
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,830
You know?  I can pull shoes out, dummy.

445
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:43,120
Hurry with Wang Wei! Untie Wang Wei.

446
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,250
She knew but worked with him?

447
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,380
What is this?

448
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,420
- Boss, are you all right? 
 - Yeah, I am okay.

449
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,590
Untie me.

450
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,300
Listen carefully.

451
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,080
If you are a detective, you cannot ever be shaken at any situation.

452
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,390
I understand.

453
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,770
We will report first.

454
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,790
Boss, why aren't you coming?

455
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,240

456
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,000

457
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,930
Kkotsoonee.

458
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,810
Kkotsoonee?  Then, he really experimented on animals?

459
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,210
No Poongsik!

460
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,260
My Kkotsoonee...

461
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,620
Boss, calm down.

462
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,280
A detective is not shaken in any situation—

463
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:06,240
Boss!

464
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,590
Why is he like that?

465
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:15,320

466
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:38,860
Hyungnim... you, how dare you do that to my Kkotsoonee—

467
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:43,060
What?

468
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:47,700
When I am trying to revive a dead person, is a mutt's life that important?

469
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,200
After I begged so much...

470
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,330
Sungrok, hunting is never done by the hunter himself.

471
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,810
It is done by the hunting dog.

472
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:04,180
You were a good hunting dog to me.

473
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,410
But what do you think happens when the hunting dog can't do its job?

474
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:11,790
Then, the hunting dog

475
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,860
is eaten as well!

476
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:27,450
That's right, you bastard.  Kill me as well, you bastard.

477
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:32,410
Me, too.  Kill me like you killed Kkotsoonee, you bastard.

478
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,420
No!  Wang Wei!

479
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,520
Go back!  Because of this bastard, you...

480
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:06,280
Go back, Wei!  You have to live!

481
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,520
Hurry, run away!  At least you should run away!

482
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,760

483
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,650

484
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,360
That dum—

485
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:48,010
What the heck is No Poongsik up to?

486
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,070
He was much crazier than we thought.

487
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,680
He did this crazy experiment because of his wife who became a zombie.

488
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,460
Are you going to pull that off tomorrow?

489
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,700
It's not working.  Why is this so hard?!

490
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,490
 Wait just a bit.

491
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,730
 It will soon be done.

492
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,940
Please, quickly.

493
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,000
Wait just a bit.

494
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:41,120
Don't look.  Stay still.

495
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,160
You understand me, don't you?  Let's calm down.

496
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,010
Boss.  Boss, this...

497
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,280
These look like they belong to the missing persons.

498
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,940
 - You are saying that all these people are the victims in that case, right? 
 - Yes.

499
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,880

500
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:55,780
No Poongsik had been illegally experimenting not only on animals but also on humans as well.

501
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,750
And...

502
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,320
in the end, the wife took care of the clean up.

503
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,030
 A monster was making a monster.

504
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,040
It looks like another food has crawled in here.

505
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:36,920
Then, shall we have a meal time in earnest?

506
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:56,790
Well, the zombie was on the wall for too long.

507
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,620
I told you to take it down already.

508
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,960
Gosh, you surprised me!

509
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,100
I told you I really don't like it.

510
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,510
Who?  Zombie?  Detective Kim?

511
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,640
Give me a glass of beer.

512
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:18,580
By chance, did you talk to Sunji today?

513
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,470
She's been busy lately, you know.

514
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,130
She's been looking into No Poongsik.

515
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,600
Thank you.

516
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,700
No Poongsik?

517
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,210
You are referring to that vet at the animal clinic?

518
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,180
If you're so worried, you should go.

519
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:39,500
What good is switching jobs from 70-Minute Chase to a detective agency?

520
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,550
She is still nutty as ever.

521
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:44,490
I bet she went to the animal clinic again today.

522
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,140
With her boss for sure.

523
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:53,100
What dreamy teamwork between the two.

524
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,440
You saw the way that kid was looking at me, right?

525
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,300
Why on earth are zombies flipping out whenever they see me?

526
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,850
A zombie's weakness is the back of their head.

527
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,650

528
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,720
Honey, eat up.

529
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,080
Wait a minute!

530
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:55,540
Let's not do that.

531
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:00,020
You can live sufficiently without having to eat humans.

532
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:03,320
Of course, it might be hard at first, but I was able to do without after much trying.

533
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,110
So, let's not live like this, please.

534
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:17,100
Oh, how unfortunate. (She) has tasted many humans already.

535
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:37,950
Get to your senses! She's not your wife but a zombie!

536
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,910
Not a human but a zombie that feasts on humans!

537
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:45,840
All (she) needs to do is be within my sight whether she's a human or zombie!

538
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,390
Sunji!

539
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,410
Kong Sunji!

540
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:17,220
Boss!

541
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,110
Boss!

542
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:03,130
 I... killed a zombie.

543
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,760
It's over.

544
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,280
Boss! Wake up, boss!

545
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,660
Boss... Boss!

546
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,800
I am also... I may also...

547
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,620
become a zombie then?

548
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:25,050
That's not true, Director Lee. Please come to your senses.

549
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,050
Director Ki—

550
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,970
One moment, please.

551
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:21,180
Wang Wei, thank you for the time (you spent with me).

552
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:25,100
Also, I'm sorry.

553
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,930
All you did was face hardship in Korea, thanks to me.

554
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,010
Boss!

555
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:39,330
When I pass,

556
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,930
you keep the World King detective agency.

557
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,320
Boss....

558
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,250
Guardian?

559
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,410
Would you like to accompany him?

560
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,560
No...

561
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,690
I will follow you in a taxi.

562
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,540
And perhaps if my boss has a seizure

563
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,340
or tries to bite you, cut his life short on the spot.

564
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,840
For your information, a zombie's weakness is the back of their head.

565
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:30,680
Don't worry. Nothing much will come of it. Won't you go on ahead to the office, Boss?

566
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:33,650
I will contact you if anything happens.

567
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:41,790
Kong Sunji!

568
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,180
♫  Another day passes...  ♫

569
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,670
- Hey Cha Dohyun. 
 - Are you okay?

570
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,790
- You aren't hurt or anything? 
 - I'm fine.

571
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,260
What's so fine? Why do you always insist that you're fine when you're not?

572
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,280
Why do you get mad over it?

573
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,800
Let's go to the hospital first.

574
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,140
Ah, I'm fine seriously.

575
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:59,250
Excuse me! Hurry, please!

576
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,180
♫  Even this deep darkness as time passes...  ♫

577
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:05,350
- Are you all right? 
   - Ah, yes. I'm not hurt anywhere.

578
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:06,500
 I'm really fine.

579
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,710
 Come on! Stay still.

580
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,900
♫  ...tells me that it'll be okay  ♫

581
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:11,290
 Never mind. Don't insist. I'm really fine.

582
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,290
♫  Heartbreaking through countless nights  ♫

583
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,490
  - Hang on a second. 
 - No, I'm okay.

584
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:21,140
♫  Heartbreaking through countless nights  ♫

585
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,500
Excuse me, senior.

586
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,070
There's something you should verify.

587
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,430
I will take care of it. Take off.

588
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,330
Roger that.

589
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,650
Let's go quietly, huh?

590
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,850
 Everything is befuddled.

591
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,500
 What should I do now?

592
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:58,070

593
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:11,350
What is this?

594
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,860

595
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,730
Kang Minho,

596
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:30,560
you are under arrest for the murder and kidnapping of Kim Mooyoung.

597
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:43,720

598
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,520
♫  A world without you   ♫

599
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,830
♫  Is nothing  ♫

600
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,850
♫  To me  ♫

601
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:08,640

602
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,200
 If someone were to come looking for me and ask about me, deny any knowledge.

603
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,860
 You and I were of no connection, understand?

604
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,010
 That was the boss then...

605
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,990
 The body at the time of discovery did not have the head or organs,

606
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:24,200
 so the police are investigating under the assumption that the probability of illegal human organ sales involvement is high

607
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,620
 The head (brains) is missing. Zombie has appeared.

608
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:29,660
 It appears (you) haven't been able to eliminate the hope of returning to being a human being.

609
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:33,770
 Don't worry. You will never be able to return to being a human being.

610
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:39,400
 The zombie had no business coming down to where humans lived in the first place.

611
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,730
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.

612
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,080
♫  When I quietly listen closely  ♫

613
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:46,700
♫  You come back...  ♫
