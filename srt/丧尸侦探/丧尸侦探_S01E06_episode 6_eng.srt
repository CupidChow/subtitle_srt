1
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,130
Detective Kim Mooyoung.

2
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,550
Are you really Kim Mooyoung?

3
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,430
What do you mean?

4
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,530
Are you really...

5
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,500
Kim Mooyoung?

6
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,380
I looked into your identification.

7
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,130
Fraud, forgery of private documents, and ID theft as well...

8
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,900
There were a number of names that I've been able to confirm.

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,590
 I don't think he knew Kim Mooyoung personally.

10
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:29,570
Well, things ended up that way due to my line of work.

11
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,060
I see.

12
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:44,600

13
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,950
We're indebted to you because of this New Church incident.

14
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,270
I look forward to working with you.

15
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,220
Within legal boundaries.

16
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,800
- Are you all right? 
 - Are you all right?

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,100
Why did you run all the way here? I told you I'd wait inside.

18
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,890
Exactly.

19
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,440
- Nothing happened, right? 
 - What could have happened?

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,060
You're off work now, right?

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,430
Let's have dinner together. A new restaurant opened nearby and it's pretty good.

22
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,130
- No, thank you. 
 - I insist.

23
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,110
Team Leader told me to make sure to treat you.

24
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,960
It's too bad, Dohyun. We have a lot of work to do.

25
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,980
You don't even any clients here. What are you talking about?

26
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,290
Because we don't have clients, we should work harder.

27
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,080
- Don't you think so, Boss? 
 - Right, we should definitely work harder.

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,860
I have no choice, then.

29
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,850
Let's grab a meal together next time.

30
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,260
Sure.

31
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,940
- Kong Sunji. 
 - Yeah?

32
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,150
Do you really have to work here?

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,350
You don't want to be a broadcast show writer anymore?

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,310
I don't have confidence in broadcasting. And I'll never have it in the future.

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,200
And I like it here. It fits me well.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,980
Even if it does fit you well...

37
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,450
Whatever.  It's not like you'll listen to me. Anyway, about your boss.

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm grateful he helped us out, but being a detective is illegal and he has a fake identity.

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,570
- Don't trust him too much. 
 - Don't worry.

40
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,650
The boss is a much better person than you can imagine.

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,600
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay.

42
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,900
 This is not safe anymore, either.

43
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:05,190

44
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,200
He's so rude; it's so annoying.

45
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,450
That woman over there. We thought she was scammed.

46
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,030
Turns out she's actually working under Detective Kim Mooyoung.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,030
That woman isn't normal, either.

48
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,340
Anyway, why would Detective Cha go to a private detective agency?

49
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,780
Police detectives and private detectives are rivals.

50
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,660
Memory loss?

51
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,220
It's different for all individuals.

52
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,310
It could be from shock after an injury to the brain.

53
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,560
It could also be from stress or a traumatic history they went through.

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,230
Then, are there any treatment methods to regain lost memories?

55
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:59,110
There are lots of methods, but nothing works for certain.

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,360
There are many patients who die without ever recovering their memories.

57
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,830
Really? They'll never regain their lost memories?

58
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,370
They erase their entire past because of their memory loss

59
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,190
and just start over completely.

60
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,410
Still, how could they do that?

61
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,870
They don't know who they were, what they did,

62
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,510
or who their families are.

63
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,720
Don't they want to know?

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
It's the only place they can return to.

65
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,020
But why do you want to know? Do you know someone with amnesia?

66
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,780
In a drama. It came out in a drama. Amnesia.

67
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,310
True. You can't have a drama without amnesia.

68
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,130
Exactly.

69
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,730
- Honey! Honey, wake up! 
 - Let go.

70
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,770
Honey, are you awake? Do you think you can go home?

71
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,210
Auntie, do you know me?

72
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,360
Auntie?

73
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,750
How could you call me that? You really don't remember?

74
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,410
You used to call me "Princess," "Cutie," or "Honey."

75
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,350
 - That's what you called me! 
 - I don't remember.

76
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,420
 I don't want to remember, either.

77
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,800
Secretary Kim, what are you waiting for? Move the chairman right away.

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,940
We must return to Gangrim Group immediately.

79
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,690
Who are you, sir?

80
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,250
Please help me. Please help me!

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,240
- Honey! You really don't remember? 
 - No way!

82
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,500
 I am the heir to Gangrim Group?

83
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,280
What is this?

84
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,440
 Could I also be an heir?

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,290
♫ Almost paradise. You're brighter than the sun ♫

86
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,810
 These are the proposals that were tabled while you were gone for a year.

87
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,620
♫  Your eyes looking at me  ♫

88
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,990
 How about the shopping mall?

89
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,400
 This morning, we purchased 7530 pyeong (≈267,941 sq ft.) in Gangrim City.

90
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,670
 - Begin the construction right away.
 - Yes, Sir.

91
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,460
 Wait!  Have your memories completely returned?

92
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,440
 Yeah, that's right. I regained all of my memories

93
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,690
 so don't even bring up the word "memory" in front of me or I'll make your working here a mere memory.

94
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,740
 - Understand? 
 - Yes, Sir.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,470
 - Is this all? 
 - Yes, Sir.

96
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,270
 This chicken.

97
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,780
 And that chicken.

98
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,350
 Get rid of all of these. I don't want to see a single raw chicken.

99
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,450
 Now!

100
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,110
♫  Can you feel my heartbeat? Heartbeat  ♫

101
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,400
♫   Heartbeat  ♫

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,980
♫  The heart that you stepped all over and left is still beating   ♫

103
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,890
♫  And it's beating for you  ♫

104
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,930
♫  No matter how hard I try to forget, no matter 
how many new people I meet  ♫

105
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,350
 My heart is beating.

106
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,030
♫  Why do I keep thinking of only you when I turn around?  ♫

107
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,830
♫  I don't want to do this anymore, I want to stop  ♫

108
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,810
 Wow, my skin is no joke!

109
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,810
 I said to get rid of the grass.

110
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,980
 Grass!

111
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,520
 Here is the special dinner you requested.

112
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,540
 - This is the meal I enjoyed all the time, right? 
- Yes, Sir.

113
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,080
 I ordered it the moment you arrived yesterday, and the beef tripe stew arrived this morning.

114
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,910
♫   Would he really come when I ask him to come?   ♫ 
   (T/N: OST from the Korean drama Jewel in the Palace.)

115
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,490
♫  Would he really leave when I ask him to leave?  ♫

116
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,320
♫  No, no  ♫

117
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,960
 I don't feel any senses or pain.

118
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,920
 That chubby piece of neck fat.

119
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,930
 It is calling to me.

120
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,180
 S-Sir! Sir! Sir, please!

121
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,420
 A soap opera is detrimental to one's mental health.

122
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,660

123
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,240
It's been a while, Hodoo.

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,920
Mister, it's okay for us to keep Hodoo here again, right?

125
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,960
You do know that from this moment the contract is automatically extended, don't you?

126
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,480
Yes!

127
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,720
Why are you smiling like that for?

128
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,220
You came back, didn't you?

129
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,660
I... was so worried thinking that you left.

130
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,520
Don't feed Damn Big Profit too much.  He really poops too much.

131
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,900
- Got that? 
 - Yes!

132
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,180
Hodoo!

133
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,990
- So cute! 
 - Cute!

134
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,250
- He's so cute. 
 - Look at him.

135
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,780
 My appetite has increased by a lot lately.

136
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,670
So cute!

137
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,860
My son...

138
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,430
How have you been?

139
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,280
Exactly when are we supposed to cut his nails?!

140
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,010
 He must miss his family so much.

141
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,710
 He is even envious of that dog.

142
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,990
Boss, I will help you.

143
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,400
- What? 
 - That's what you want, right?

144
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,910
Joonwoo is lucky.  He has a dog for a pet.

145
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,810
No, it's okay.  You don't need to.

146
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,660
I really want to help.

147
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,300
But still, it's not right, is it?

148
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,160
Is it really okay to do that?

149
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,330
Of course!  Just trust me.

150
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,010
Shall we get started right now?

151
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,300
This is what you meant by helping me?

152
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,180
Yes.  I saw it on the internet that if you do this you can hypnotize someone.

153
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,470
Then, you might be able to remember your past.

154
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,860
Okay, look at the watch, Boss.

155
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,770
Okay, from now,

156
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,020
you will enter the world of the subconscious with me.

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,200
There is a room over there.

158
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Please open the door to the room.

159
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,760
Please open the door.

160
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,960
Please open the door... the door...

161
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,800
the door...

162
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,150
How many times—

163
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,950
I knew it.

164
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,730
You keep opening the door!

165
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,220
Ah, gosh!

166
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,720
I must've fallen asleep.

167
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,360
This road...

168
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,250
Yogurt Lady!

169
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,080
Let me have a yogurt, please.  One that's good for constipation.

170
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Constipation?  Just a moment, please!

171
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,480
This is the best for constipation.

172
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,530
This is as good as an eight-lane road.

173
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,410
It will open up the intestines for sure.  Free pass!

174
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,470
- Really? 
 - Really.

175
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,250
Your older brother looks worn out.  You should take better care of him.

176
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,710
Younger brother?

177
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,700
I am younger!  I am 29 years old.

178
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,350
I'm 12 years younger than him!

179
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,090
You almost got me. Is this a dad joke or something?

180
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,070
People do tell me that I have a young-looking face.

181
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,040
Lady, how much is it for everything you have in here?

182
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,460
All of them?  Your generosity befits your looks!

183
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,700
Just a moment, please!

184
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,460
Give me ₩5,000 worth, please.  I am in such a good mood!

185
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,140
- ₩5,000?! 
 - Yes, please.

186
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,770

187
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,830
Detectives!   Thank you for your hard work!

188
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,960
Who do we have here!  President Lee of World King!

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,730
- Team Leader Hwang!  You've been well, haven't you?
 - Of course!

190
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,430
- And your intestines are doing fine as well? 
 -  No complaints.

191
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,420
Wang Wei, come give him one.

192
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,640
What is this?

193
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,970
I got you something small that doesn't count as a bribe.

194
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,090
- You didn't have to. 
 - Please have some.

195
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,690
What brings you here?

196
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,710
I am disappointed.  Must I have a reason to come and visit you?

197
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,280
I wanted to see how you were doing and what was happening in Gangrim City...

198
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,700
I just wanted to have a chat.

199
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,490
Please drink.

200
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,900
Detective Oh, why are you sitting on the floor?

201
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,880
Are you okay?

202
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,190
It's tasty, right?

203
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,010
- Sunbae, did you meet with Mr. Kim Mooyoung?
 - Yeah.

204
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,990
How did he seem?

205
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,420
He didn't seem like a bad person.

206
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,640
He seems to work hard, too.

207
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,780
We will just have to wait and see.

208
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,730
Then, is Writer Kong going to keep working there?

209
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,410
Who would be able to stop her?

210
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,280
It looked like they didn't even have much business.

211
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,630
- Isn't that right, President Lee? 
 - Oh, gosh!  Right.

212
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,590
You don't participate in any criminal activity nowadays, do you?

213
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,720
Trespassing and even illegal wiretapping.

214
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,640
Detective Cha, what do you see me as?!  I don't even get any parking violation tickets nowadays.

215
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,650
Is that true?

216
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,640
Yes, it's true. We have no business so the boss has no reason to even go out.

217
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,950

218
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,820
Are you all right?

219
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,720
Why is that you came here to get the dirt on Detective Kim Mooyoung but you ended up letting them get you?

220
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,520
Be quiet!

221
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,060
It looks like Kim Mooyoung even bought out Gangrim City Police.

222
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,680
Not bad...

223
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,980
What are you going to do now?

224
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,360
The more I dig, something definitely smells fishy.

225
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,870
Kim Mooyoung, is definitely hiding something.

226
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,240
My senses are telling me.  The great detective Lee Sungrok's senses are...

227
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,900
But are those senses reliable?

228
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,820
I have no way of knowing since I have never seen your senses get it right.

229
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,370
Wang Wei, don't you trust me?!

230
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,140
I am Lee Sungrok!

231
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,150
I am Lee Sungrok, number one detective in Gangrim City!

232
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,680
If I say something smells fishy then it is!

233
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,120
- Do you understand what I am say— 
 - Excuse me!

234
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,990
Would you please take your conversation outside?

235
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,040
Please follow him.  Oh, your behind...

236
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,870
Your behind!  Be careful, please.

237
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,150
Please look ahead while walking.  Leave the door open.

238
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,590
Please go.

239
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,510
So, these are the things you had with you when you woke up.

240
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,020
- Is that right? 
 - Yeah.

241
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,570
This is broken.

242
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,110
Did the time stop because of the shock when the watch broke?

243
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,910
1:12, is that the presumed time of death?

244
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,210
 Since that time, everything stopped.

245
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,720
Just by looking at it, you can tell that this is a limited edition or custom ordered.

246
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,880
I visited a few places already but no one seems to have seen it before.

247
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,430
Why don't we post it on SNS instead?

248
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,590
There might be someone among lighter collectors who know about this design or has an interest in it.

249
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,620

250
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,660
All done.

251
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,870
Let's wait for a bit.

252
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,820
Since the label is worn, it looks to be old...

253
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,770
Yet, all buttons are intact.

254
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,340
Seeing that even the sleeve cuff is clean,

255
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,760
you seem to have taken good care of it.

256
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,830
Were these buttons sewn on by you?

257
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,470
It doesn't look to have been professionally done at the cleaner.  Seeing that the sewing job is neat...

258
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,610
If this really is yours,

259
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,790
you were a very neat person or...

260
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,030
you had a family that took care of you.

261
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:57,260
♫  My old memories that the film broke  ♫

262
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,560
♫  Around the same place like a round earth  ♫

263
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,540
Family...

264
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,310
♫  Even in front of a difficult reality...  ♫

265
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,240
Then, isn't there anything you remember related to your past?

266
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,230
I had remembered the moment before my death.

267
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,000
The moment before your death?

268
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,610
♫  I'm living my life today  ♫

269
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,130
♫  I'll never hurt you again  ♫

270
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,890
♫  Even if everyone leaves my side  ♫

271
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,660
Why or who killed me, I really don't know.

272
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,290
After that, I don't remember anything.

273
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,820
Then,

274
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,320
because of the shock right before your death,

275
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,060
you might possibly have lost your memory.

276
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,370
♫  I'll never hurt you again  ♫

277
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,980
♫  Even if everyone leaves my side  ♫

278
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,940
Why?

279
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,540

280
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,610
Are you sure this is the right place?

281
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,490
Yes.  I am certain that we agreed to meet near here.

282
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,360

283
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,470
Oh, no.  He says it will be difficult to meet today.

284
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,400
Nothing we can do about it.

285
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,770
Mr. Hyungchul!

286
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,800
Oh, hello, Miss Writer.

287
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,370
Hello.  I heard that you got discharged from the hospital.

288
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,230
How are you feeling?

289
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,760
I am doing a lot better.

290
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,570
Daily routines are possible, too.

291
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,850
I heard that you quit the broadcast station job.  I am sorry.  It's because of me.

292
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,540
Actually, I now work at a detective office which is much better than being a broadcast writer.

293
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,700
A detective office?

294
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,130
Yes.  He is my boss.

295
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,350
Boss, this is Mr. Oh Hyungchul.  I had interviewed him for a broadcast program.

296
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,780
Hello.  I am Oh Hyungchul.

297
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,780
I am Kim Mooyoung.

298
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,010
This... If you ever need help, please call us anytime.

299
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,020
Our president is really good.

300
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,370
Kim Mooyoung Detective Office?

301
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,670
How long have you been working as a detective?

302
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,510
It's just that I don't remember seeing the office when I pass by.

303
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,360
It's been maybe about six months.

304
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,250
Ah, I see.

305
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,410
Are you coming back from somewhere?

306
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,210
It is uncomfortable but I still have to work to make a living.

307
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,810
I am sorry.  I need to take a call.

308
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,450
Please.

309
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,160
Hello?

310
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,670
Mom did?

311
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,190
I told you to stay by her side.

312
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,870
Okay.  I will be there soon.

313
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,180
Is something the matter?

314
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,790
My mom seems to have gotten lost in the mountain.

315
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,320
She has dementia.

316
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,370
Then, excuse me.

317
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,850
Just a moment, please!

318
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,420
We will help you.

319
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,060
No, that's okay.  I will try to find her on my own.

320
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,500
No, three is better than one.

321
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,140
Isn't that right, Boss?

322
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,970
 I let my guard down... nosiness of Crap.

323
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,020
It really is okay.  I will need to pay—

324
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,390
No, our president doesn't need it.

325
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,750
He can never just pass by someone in need.

326
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,230
Isn't that right, Boss?

327
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,020
So, where did you last see her?

328
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,510
At the entrance to Chowol Mountain.

329
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,970
Then, shall we hurry and go there first?

330
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,720
Hurry.

331
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,840
That nutcase, really!

332
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,330
- Grandmother! 
 - Mom!

333
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,880
- Grandmother! 
 - Mom.

334
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,970
We will go this way so Mr. Hyungchul, you go that way.

335
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,760
Yes, I will.  Thank you so much.

336
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:57,600
It will soon get dark and cold.  I hope we can find her soon.

337
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,060
Hey, Intern, you seem to be greatly mistaken about something.

338
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,480
I never work without pay.  This work we are doing now is total nosiness, understand?

339
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,840
Boss, why don't you think of this as an opportunity to be charitable with your talent.

340
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,360
Why waste that well-developed olfactory function?

341
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,580
If you save it and die, it becomes crap—

342
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,980
Crap?

343
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,280
Crap... no...

344
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,960
Grandmother!

345
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,670
That Crap, who is she calling crap?

346
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,750
Grandmother!

347
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,710
Grandmother!  Grandmother!

348
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,330
Grandmother!

349
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,050
Anyway, what did you interview that man for?

350
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,990
Ah, Mr. Hyungchul?  He was the eyewitness in the "Santa" kidnapping case.

351
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,140
That's right.  You said that you became unemployed because of that.

352
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,110
Also... he almost died because of me.

353
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,980
That's why I want to help him more, whatever it is.

354
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,540
We should have gotten some of the grandmother's things.

355
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,930
Then it would have been much easier for you to smell and find her.

356
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,190
Are you thinking of me as a dog now?

357
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,140
Of course not.  I respect your identity.

358
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,060
Grandmother!

359
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,410
She is oddly making me feel bad.

360
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,140
Do you really have to go this far?

361
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,590
If you know your enemy and know yourself, you can win 100 out of 100 battles fought.

362
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,200
You need to know your enemy to win.

363
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,510
I, Lee Sungrok,

364
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:55,360
will expose you, Kim Mooyoung.

365
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,200
Let's go.

366
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,810
Grandmother!

367
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,470
- Grandmother!
   - Why the heck am I getting hungry at a time like this?

368
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,890
Grandmother!

369
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,790
 It's a rabbit.

370
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,990
 And...

371
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,290
 What is this smell?

372
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,430
Ah, wait for me!

373
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,370
How is it that he doesn't get tired?

374
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,530
Boss, why aren't you coming?

375
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,940
I don't care where... I can't go any farther.

376
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,680
Hurry up and get up, please.

377
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,510
Wang Wei, you go first.

378
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,200
I am done.

379
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,970
Even still. We can finish. We can do this!

380
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,520
I used to...

381
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,000
be able to make several trips to this mountain...

382
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,350
Youth is enviable...

383
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,980
This is it for today.

384
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,650
How is he going to find the enemy's weakness when he lacks the energy.

385
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,000
The smell definitely was coming from somewhere around here.

386
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,110
Son!

387
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,210
Ah, Boss!

388
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,600
Grandmother!

389
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,950
I knew it!  Your nose doesn't fail.

390
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,580
Hurry up and help her before it gets dark.

391
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:46,720
 It is that smell... The smell of a rotten animal similar to that of all wild animals combined.

392
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,990
Bo— Boss.

393
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,940
Why?  What's wrong?

394
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,990
That's why I told you we shouldn't come.  You're no help!

395
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,430
If... I die here, I will receive workmen's compensation, right?

396
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,040
Are you all right?

397
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,930
Boss, your eyes...

398
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,790
Get up first.

399
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,770
Just count to 100, okay?

400
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:41,960
One, two...

401
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,450

402
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,790

403
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,880

404
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,040
 Ready.

405
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,540
 Fight!

406
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,860
- 22, 23...

407
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,150
Boss, are you all right?

408
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,580
 There is no pain.

409
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,880
 It's just... embarrassing.

410
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,110
I just slipped.  Keep counting.

411
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,440
Where was I?

412
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,670
 30, 31...

413
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,760
 32, 33...

414
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,610
This punk plays dirty by throwing a punch even before we start?!

415
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:54,960
50, 51, 52...

416
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,780
53, 54, 55...

417
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,950
56, 57, 58...

418
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,730
59, 60, 61...

419
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,790
Not yet.  Don't look.

420
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,420
Don't look.  Stay like that and keep counting.

421
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,910
62, 63, 64...

422
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,430
 Damn!

423
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,510
 Game Over.

424
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,470
99, 100.

425
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,570
Boss!

426
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,460
Boss!

427
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,860
Stay here just for a bit, please.

428
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Boss!

429
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,330
Boss!!!

430
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,580
Boss!!!   Boss!!!

431
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,160
Aren't you going to hold it straight?!

432
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,580
I am carrying it all by myself, you know.  It's so heavy.  It's killing me!

433
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,560
I am trying my best...

434
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,510
  This afternoon, in Gangrim City, on Chowol Mountain,

435
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,620
 a hiker caught a wild boar with his bare hands.  This is becoming the talk of the town.

436
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,310
 This hiker faced the wild boar...

437
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:26,400
It would be better to get caught by a human than get bitten by a zombie and dying.

438
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,540
How many geun  (T/N: 1 geun ≈ 600 grams)  would that be if you sell it at a market?

439
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,850
It probably is quite a lot, right?

440
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,330
It's fortunate (for the wild boar) that it wasn't caught by you.

441
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,830
Wow!  So cool!

442
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,140
 ... to this news, the citizens are...

443
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,750
Sunbae, is it even possible to knock down a wild boar with your bare hands?

444
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,840
That is odd when you can't kill a wild boar even with live ammunition.

445
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,470
Whoever it is that caught the wild boar, I sure would like to meet him.

446
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,050
 ... it is wise to get away.

447
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,610
 The captured wild boar

448
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,700
 - was missing a large portion of the intestines and flesh... 
 - Totally my style!

449
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,180
He's a beastly man!  Beastly man!

450
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,480
That's not a beastly man.  It's just a beast.

451
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,760
That's not a human.  Not a human.

452
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,840
Haven't I told you yet

453
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,220
that taming beasts is my hobby?

454
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,770
Please stop taking pictures.

455
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,840
Please lower the sign.

456
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,020
 Please lower...

457
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,290
 Show your face!

458
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,670
Detective Kim really is great, isn't he?

459
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,070
Does this even make sense?

460
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,900
He even catches wild boars now?

461
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,580
The way I see it,

462
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,830
I think rather than catching Detective Kim Mooyoung,

463
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,320
it would be better for you to catch a wild boar.

464
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,430
No, I think it would be better to catch you.

465
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,180
- Are you okay? 
 - Ah!

466
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,970

467
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,540
 Let me see your face!

468
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,180
Mr. Hyungchul!  Here!

469
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,820
Hello.

470
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,320
Where were you?  I was so worried.

471
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

472
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,720
I am sorry.  I am sorry.

473
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,910
It's a relief that we found her.

474
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,640
It could have been terrible.

475
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,500
I am sorry to be a bother.

476
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,730
And thank you so much!

477
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,350
You should thank my boss.

478
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:35,890
Thank you so much!  Thank you!

479
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,280
You're welcome.

480
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,810
Please hurry and escort your mother home and get some rest.

481
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,120
Then, I will be going first.

482
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,230
Get home safely, please.

483
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,110
Son. My son.

484
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,380
My son, where have you been?

485
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,420
Mom waited for you for so long.

486
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,050
Mom, why are you like this?

487
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,670
My child, how I missed you.

488
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,400
I am so sorry.

489
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,360
My mother is a little sick.  I will call you again.

490
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,660
- My child. 
 - Let's go, Mother.

491
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,850
Son...

492
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,500
Wait a moment!

493
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,810

494
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,750
Thank you.

495
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,730
Let's go, Mom.

496
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,350
Thank you.

497
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,260
I am home.

498
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,410
You're back, Sister-in-Law?  Come have some fruit.

499
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,170
Wait a moment.

500
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,860
- What is this? 
 - Oh.

501
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,700
- I went to a mountain. 
 - A mountain?

502
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,120
Who did you go to a mountain with so late at night, and why?

503
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,110
- My boss. 
 - Your boss?

504
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,800
This whole time, you were at a mountain with your boss?

505
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,420
It's not what you're thinking.

506
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,450
Like hell it's not. I met your brother-in-law when I went to a mountain!

507
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,400
Since then, I have never gone back to the mountains. Not even to the mineral springs —

508
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,370
My grip hardened without me realizing...

509
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,990
I'm tired.

510
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,070
I'm off to bed.

511
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,530
Kong Sunji, you stop right there.

512
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:01,510
I won't.

513
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,760
Good night.

514
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,600
Anyway, Honey, isn't it good if Sister-in-Law gets with her boss?

515
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,920
Are you being serious?

516
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,480
I am. If he's a private detective, he's basically a CEO.

517
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,980
Still, this isn't right!

518
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,890
Detective Cha is right there. Even if he is a CEO...

519
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:26,580
A de— detective as our Sunji's partner? Is that even appropriate?

520
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,870
What's wrong with a private detective? They're smart, have leadership, and free.

521
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,810
That's why you can't make it.

522
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,080
You think I don't know what "free" means?

523
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,270
Me?

524
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,720
Dohyun is the best match for Sunji.

525
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,150
He has a great personality, he's kind, he's the perfect match against Sunji's temper and better than anyone else.

526
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:53,940
On top of that, he has a stable job with a stable income.

527
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,450
He's the best!

528
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:59,010
Don't you dare say a word. I should close that mouth of yours.

529
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,110
Understand?

530
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,890
I am curious about how Dohyun feels.

531
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,290
- Stop! 
 - He likes her, I'm sure of it.

532
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,500
That boar, gosh...

533
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,650
 Are you okay?

534
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:43,540
What kind of zombie doesn't bite a human but saves them instead?

535
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,100
♫  The sky looks especially pretty today  ♫

536
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:52,520
♫  When I look at the sky right around this time, 
I think of you again  ♫

537
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,250
♫  I was just fine, as if nothing was wrong  ♫

538
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:05,440
♫  But then I break down over nothing  ♫

539
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:13,440
♫  It’s your favorite season again  ♫

540
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,090
♫  It makes me happy yet sad  ♫

541
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,170
 Son?

542
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,070
 I missed you so much.

543
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:40,060
 Do I also have a mother waiting for me to return?

544
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,760

545
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,860

546
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,440

547
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,050

548
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,860

549
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,460

550
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,930
Isn't that too petty?

551
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:29,850
Why do you maliciously add hate comments to something that is good for someone else?

552
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,580
How could a person be so spiteful?

553
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,030
S-Spiteful... What?

554
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:38,180
It means you are a disgusting man.

555
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:47,400
You should give up looking into Detective Kim Mooyoung. Don't ruin a good man's reputation.

556
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,880
First, you should look into your own self.

557
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,560
Yes, Sir. Please sleep comfortably, Mr. Rabbit.

558
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,720

559
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,010
There's definitely something.

560
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:12,940
I, Lee Sungrok, can feel it. I'm sure of it.

561
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,650
You plan on creating a global chain with that mindset?

562
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:21,270
You should go to Detective Kim Mooyoung and apologize right now.

563
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,710
Who's the one destroying the reputation of detectives here?

564
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,110
This hurts my pride.

565
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,070
He didn't say a single wrong thing.

566
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,670
 I met him in real life and he is not rude at all. 
(T/N: "Is not" is spelled the old-fashioned way)

567
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,520
 I feel like he'll be super hot in person.

568
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,930
Sexy muscular guy.

569
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,260
I like that.

570
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:53,260
"He is not rude at all..." 
  (T/N: "Is not" spelled the old-fashioned way)

571
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,260

572
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,730

(T/N: "It is" is spelled the old-fashioned way)

573
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,910
 It's 100% Lee Sungrok.

574
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:04,150
 Boss!

575
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,460
Boss!

576
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,170
I found a real one this time.

577
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,340
Why are you freaking out so early in the morning?

578
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,900
It's for real this time.

579
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,840
- What is? 
 - Your past!

580
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,720
I really got it this time!

581
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,770
What is it now?

582
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:31,690
Just how much do you think this place could help?

583
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:35,390
This is a trending place on social media these days.

584
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,680
They say it's so accurate.

585
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:44,740
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it...

586
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,230
Here.

587
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:55,640
You're not dead or alive, are you?

588
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,620
You're stuck between the line of life and death. What a terrible life you must have.

589
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,390
 - Amazing! 
 - She's not bad.

590
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,970
This auntie is spot on!

591
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,890
Not an auntie. I'm a celestial lotus fairy Victoria.

592
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,510
Right, miss.

593
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,800
Your lifespan is short. You should already be dead.

594
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,750
 She's awesome.

595
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,030
What must I do, Ma'am?

596
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,440
Can I go back?

597
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,940
Let's see... Let's see...

598
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,260
You want to go back, but you've lost the way.

599
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,560
There isn't a day the mother's eyes can stay dry, but there isn't a child to wipe those tears.

600
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,330
Oh, dear.

601
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,240
It's not that there isn't a solution, though.

602
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,890
If you want to find the way, you can use a talisman.

603
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:56,200
It will be faster with the beads, though.

604
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,920
You want to buy some?

605
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,200
How do the beads...

606
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,510
Here.

607
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:09,450
Stop right there. How dare you scam people into buying beads when they're emotional?

608
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,300
What? Do you have proof?

609
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,620
Proof? Do I look like a fool to you?

610
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,890
What is it? What's with you all of a sudden?

611
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:20,400
Your lips! They look strangely familiar.

612
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,080
What about them?

613
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,620
Are you, by any chance, the Baby Boy?

614
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:27,970
I'm not!

615
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,120
I'm Victoria, the celestial lotus fairy.

616
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,550
Three years ago, you scammed a ton of people and appeared on 70 Minute Chase as Baby Boy.

617
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,570
It's you, right?

618
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,770
I'm not!

619
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,430
Yeah, right. Hold on.

620
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,190
Come here. Stick close.

621
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,310
Wait...

622
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,290
It is you! I knew it, Baby Boy! Your hat...

623
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:55,690
See? You're Baby Boy for sure!

624
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:01,050
Yeah, it is me! I knew I would have bad luck today.

625
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,060
What kind of person are you?

626
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,220
Auntie, you...

627
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,980
 I wavered for a moment.

628
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,030
 I hoped she could help me find my past.

629
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,850
And these bells.

630
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,150
Yeah! You came with this last time and shook it all over the place.

631
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,170
Didn't you?

632
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,280

633
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,070
Deity? Where is the deity? Let him come out then.

634
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,680
Boss?

635
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,230
Boss, are you okay?

636
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,530
I don't think he's human.

637
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,700
Exactly. I told you to quit smoking.

638
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,240
He smokes too much so his throat is making a guttural noise.

639
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,330
I was wrong, Sir!

640
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,940
I didn't scam you on purpose!

641
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,970
Please forgive me, please!

642
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:16,290
Boss? Boss!

643
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:21,410
Don't scam people and live decently, got that?

644
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,560
Boss!

645
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,560
I was scared to death.

646
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,530

647
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,580
Are you okay?

648
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,690
That child... It was definitely her.

649
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,710

650
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,040
The kid who allegedly was kidnapped by "Santa."

651
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,870
Are you talking about Sori?

652
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,590
I am positive that I am somehow related to that child.

653
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:55,030
You are?  Anything else?

654
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,610
Do you remember anything else?

655
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,690
Are you sure about the stuffed rabbit toy?

656
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:08,020
I reviewed all the evidence related to the case,

657
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,100
but there was no stuffed rabbit toy, neither on the day of the crime nor when the body was found.

658
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,830
Okay.

659
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,770
There was no stuffed rabbit toy among Sori's things.

660
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:25,690
I didn't see any stuffed rabbit toy at the crime scene when I was reporting, either.

661
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,200
Boss, why don't we check it for ourselves.

662
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,400
Check it for ourselves?

663
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,330
Don't you remember?

664
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,570
I did the investigative reporting of the "Santa" kidnapping case for 70-Minute Chase.

665
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,790
That means I know as much as the police about this case.

666
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:52,020
If you see it for yourself, you might remember a new clue related to your past.

667
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,920
 Who is it?

668
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,340
Hello.  I... am Kong Sunji.

669
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,710
 Where are you from?

670
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,040
That is...

671
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:28,480
 We are from the security company.  We are here to conduct a security check.

672
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,870
 But the president is not here now.  Please come back another time.

673
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:34,300
Then, when would he be back?

674
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,590
 He's not in the country right now.

675
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,520
 He won't be back until next month.

676
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,700
Are you okay?

677
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,020
Yes.  I am fine.

678
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,810

679
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,870
So Ri... she's pretty, isn't she?

680
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,370
Do you know what she wanted the most for Christmas?

681
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,310
What was it?

682
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,240
It was her dad.

683
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,850
Sori's mom passed away early.

684
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:35,000
And her dad was always on business trips overseas and was never home.

685
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,210
Then, the kidnapping happened on Christmas Day.

686
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:44,300
She was counting the days and waiting for her dad.

687
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:52,880
In the end, she was not able to meet her dad.

688
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:16,070
 Being born as someone and dying... knowing why you died...

689
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:20,780
 and having someone who mourns and remembers your death...

690
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,990
 What kind of feeling would that be?

691
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:31,240
Why are you so hung up on this case when you covered so many missing persons' cases?

692
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,830
A month before Sori was kidnapped,

693
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,770
I personally interviewed Sori's dad.

694
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:43,920
After the interview aired, Sori was kidnapped.

695
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,430
Then...

696
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:51,060
The killer saw your program and kidnapped her?

697
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,560
If I didn't do the program,

698
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,730
if I gave up the interview when everyone was against it,

699
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:10,290
Sori probably would be living an ordinary life just like other kids her age.

700
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,450
Do you regret it?

701
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:27,180
That was the first time I regretted my nosiness.

702
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,700
Yes, Hello?

703
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,570
This is the City Hall, right?  I have something to ask.

704
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:50,660
The wild boar that was recently caught...

705
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,800
Yes.  Other than the innards and the flesh, how was the brain?

706
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,980
No, the brain.

707
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:04,080
Thank you.

708
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,040
I thought it was quiet for a while... but now he has shown up with a bigger appetite.

709
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,110

710
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:20,460
At this rate, maybe he will soon eat humans, too...

711
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,570

712
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,460
 No, no...

713
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:41,310
Senior, I looked for the pictures you were talking about.

714
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,370
That toy... I think it's this.

715
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,050
Let me see.

716
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,900
This toy wasn't found at the crime scene, right?

717
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,800
No, it wasn't found at the crime scene nor at the residence.

718
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,890

719
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,700
 Is this the stuffed rabbit toy you were talking about?

720
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,750
  Is this the toy?

721
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,200
  It is.  For sure.

722
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,990
But it wasn't found at the crime scene

723
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:50,910
and it wasn't found at the residence, either.  Then, where could the rabbit toy be?

724
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,380
The lighter!

725
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,520
He is somehow still alive.

726
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:11,940

727
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,780

728
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,530
 Your boss, I don't have a good feeling about the gleam in his eyes.

729
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,110
 Perhaps, is this the person?

730
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:24,100
 Yes, this is him.  Do you know Mr. Kang Minho?

731
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,340
 I might need to find someone.

732
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,210
 Do you find dead persons as well?

733
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,530
 Because a corpse disappeared.

734
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,590
 Did he just hire us to find a corpse?

735
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:34,090
 You really don't remember that day?

736
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:34,920
 That child, either?

737
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,860
 Please save me.

738
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,900
 If it weren't for you, that child could have lived.  You killed her.

739
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,910
 Why the hell did you do that?!  Why?!

740
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,850
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.
