1
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,800

2
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,140
 Excuse me for a moment.

3
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,980

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,640
 No!

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,890
 I got hit good on the back of my head.

6
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,430
Mister!

7
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,840
Mister, awake up!  Mister!

8
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Wake up, Mister!

9
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,360
911!

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
I don't think he is a pervert like you said.

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
Stop recording,  Mr. Producer!

12
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
Hurry up and help me!  Hurry!

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,020
Wait! Wait!

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,030
Mister.

15
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,370
Mister, wake up, please!  MIster!

16
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,040
 - Hello, we are at the rear of the elementary school.
  - What is this?

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,740
Why is his face so cold?

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,170
 - There is someone unconscious here.  Please come in a hurry.

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,390
He has no heartbeat.

20
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,850
What?

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,810
He must be dead.

22
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,200
Ah, Mister, please wake up!  Mister!

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,650
Mister!

24
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,490
 It's okay now.

25
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,710
Please. Please.

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,430
Check his pulse.  He's in arrest.

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,960
I think he passed away.

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,020
What do I do?!

29
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,360
- What should I do?!
 - Please calm down first.

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,260
 - What do I do?!  No, no.  What do I do?
 - My goodness.

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,670
 What do I do?

32
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,540
 Who am I?  Where is this place...

33
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,750
He is alive!

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,120
 What is this?  Did I faint?

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
 But I am a zombie though.

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,060
Are are you awake?  Have you regained your senses?

37
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,810
 - I need to get out of here.  
 - Please wait just a little while.  We will arrive soon.

38
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,000
 I am surrounded by humans, damn!

39
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,280
It seems to be broken.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,050
It seemed new.

41
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,390
 I let my guard down.  I didn't think I would get hit on the back of my head by a human?

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,750
Stay still, please!  We will arrive soon.

43
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,820
How much longer?

44
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,500
 Back of the head is fatal for a zombie.

45
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,490
 It's an arrest condition so get CPR ready first.

46
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,970
 Doctor, the patient's personal information is not coming up.

47
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,880
 Personal information?

48
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,100
 What should we do first?

49
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,580
 Let's start with close examination first.

50
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,630
 - Close examination? 
 - You should report to the police first.

51
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,340
 Police?

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,110
You are awake?  Have you regained your senses?

53
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,490
I... didn't mean to hit you on the head with the helmet on purpose.

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,220
It seems that there was some sort of misunderstanding.

55
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,490
 You avoid crap not because you are afraid of it but because it is dirty.

57
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,840
 Humans are just... crap.

58
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,760
I will pay for the cost of the examination so

59
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,030
why don't you get treated first and then we can talk.

60
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,140
And I—

61
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Ah, that's not it.  I want to give you my business card...

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,890
 Now, I am even afraid of crap.

63
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,350
I am...

64
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,530

65
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:59,570
As the Current Affairs Department writer, I am always conscientious and strive to keep the truth.

66
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,280
Please take into account that there was no ill intention in my behavior.

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,610
I ask for an agreement that shows your mercy and tolerance.

68
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,310
- Sir. 
  - Agreement, my foot!

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,700
 I will not have anything to do with you again!

70
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,390
Are you not feeling well?

71
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,640
I will go and bring the doctor.  Wait just a moment, please.

72
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,590
 Doctor!  The patient...

73
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,860
 The patient is awake.

74
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,240
What's this?  Where did he go?

75
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,100
- Where did the patient go? 
 - Where did he go?

76
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,880
 - He disappeared? 
 - Doctor!

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,580
 Even so, how could you just come back?

78
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,230
You should have made sure to get an agreement by having him get an examination or paying for the cost of hospitalization.

79
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,480
You know you can get sued for special assault.

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,840
No, forget about assault.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,270
It could go as far as involuntary manslaughter or attempted murder.

82
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,230
What, attempted murder?!

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,980
I really didn't mean to kill him.

84
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,250
Ah, I really thought he was a pervert!

85
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,150
But he wasn't a pervert.

86
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,060
 - Ah! 
 - On top of that, there are so many people who saw you throwing the helmet.

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,330
 You gave him your business card so he will probably call you.  Wait a while.

88
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,760
 Okay.  I got it.

89
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,440
 I heard that Writer Gong caused trouble again.

90
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,350
I've seen a helmet protecting a head,

91
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,470
but this is the first time hearing that a helmet was used to break a head.

92
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,450
I was wondering why it was so calm lately.

93
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,460
Don't you remember?  Last time, she got sued for assault when she tried to catch the "trench coat man" with her bare hands.

94
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,270
"Trench coat man" deserved the beating.  He was a real bastard.

95
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,200
To you, all men around Writer Gong seem to be bad punks, don't you?

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,960
It's my job to catch bad guys.  I am just doing my job.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,320
It must be nice for Writer Gong.

98
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,770

99
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,810
Ah, Noonim (older sister, formal).

100
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,810
This wench even breaks someone's head now?!

101
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,490
No, that's not it.  Sunji didn't break someone's head on purpose.

102
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:51,930
I should just—

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,420
That... That... was mine...

104
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,730
I am sorry.

105
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,810
A wife who left home, a mutt having an affair,

106
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,210
even your current girlfriend's past, we can find every last bit of information.

107
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,530
We are Gangrim City's number one detective agency, World King Detective Agency.

108
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,970
Fast and accurate!

109
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,120
Please visit World King Detective Agency!

110
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,480
We take all cases.  Our president will find them all.

111
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,710
I am the president!  I will give you a discount!

112
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,230
Mister, can you find a dog, too?

113
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,450
Young friend, we bill separately for counseling so

114
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,690
please call World King office to make an appointment and formally hire us.

115
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,120
Here.

116
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,140
Bring money.

117
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,090
Cheapskates!

118
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,650
Cheapskate?!  Ha!

119
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,230
Do you know how well detectives are treated in England?

120
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,990
If I was born in England, Sherlock would have called me Hyungnim (older brother, formal).

121
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,310
But I am looking for cows, dogs, and chickens instead...

122
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,460
That's why everyone here is looking down at me now!

123
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,570
Detective Kim?  Isn't that Detective Kim?

124
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,440
Awake or asleep,  I need to watch out for the back of my head.

125
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,730
Why did I get myself caught up with such crap?

126
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,930
Did I get a bald spot?

127
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,560
Hey!

128
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,740
Detective Kim!

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,730
 Close up, he doesn't look half bad.

130
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,330
 Would I look like this if I lose some weight?

131
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,050
 This human, does he know Kim Mooyoung?

132
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,690
Hey, Kim Mooyoung, you should say hello when you see someone.

133
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,550
 He thinks that I am Kim Mooyoung.

134
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,650
We are in the same business so we can at least exchange greetings.

135
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,790
 He does not know (Kim Mooyoung) that well.

136
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,280
That rude jerk!

137
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,640
Is it because he shaved?

138
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,720
He seemed strangely unfamiliar.

139
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,280
Where have I seen him before?

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,440
I am sure I saw him somewhere.

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,660
Hello.

142
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,560
Who might you be?

143
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,620
Excuse me for a moment.

144
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,460
I am selling makeup door-to-door.

145
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,470
I am fine.

146
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh, you are so good-looking!

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,100
Your skin glows!

148
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,200
Are you, perhaps, applying honey to your face?

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,550
You really are such a beautiful looking man!

150
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,190
But, maintenance is important in this state, you know.

151
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,400
This scar...

152
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,320
Don't you worry!  Don't worry.

153
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,270
Scar treatment... Regeneration effect...  Just try this cream.

154
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,520
Then, the dead skin comes alive!

155
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,870
No way!  Dead skin coming back to life...

156
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,130
Then, how much is this?

157
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,890
- ₩540,000. 
  - ₩540,000?
   ($540)

158
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,370
I will let you pay it in 48 months with no interest.

159
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,850
I don't have that kind of big money.  Please leave.

160
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,280
If not that, then how about this?

161
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,930
This is good, too.  I will sell it to you cheap.

162
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,110
Cheap?

163
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,080
Then...

164
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,490
Then, can this also act as BB cream?

165
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,820
B... BB.

166
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,620
It does not have the BB cream properties but this will also make you look bright.

167
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,700
If you put this on to go out...  that's the end.  The end!

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,290
It's okay.  I don't go out much.

169
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,370
What is this?!  You made it seem like you were going to buy it.

170
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,250
If you weren't going to buy, you should have said so earlier.

171
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,250
What a strange human!

172
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,000
But wait, she left this...

173
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,370
What? Sample? Might as well pull out the liver of a flea to eat. 
   (T/N: squeeze something out of nothing.)

174
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,570
I am starving after getting harassed by humans all day.

175
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,710
There is nothing to eat.  What am I supposed to eat?

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,710
 Unbelieving Hell!

177
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,540
 - Unbelieving Hell!
 - Unbelieving Hell!

178
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,530
 - Unbelieving Hell!
 - Unbelieving Hell!

179
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,930
Get lost, broadcast station jerks!

180
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,760
- Get lost! 
 - Get lost!

181
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,910
Stop the analysis broadcast of New Truth church!  Stop!

182
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,080
- Stop it! 
 -Stop it!

183
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,340
God will judge you for sure!

184
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,400
To Hell—

185
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Fall!  Fall!  Fall!

186
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,700
Fall!

187
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,820
70-Minute Chase, stop the analysis broadcast of New Truth church!

188
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,380
- Stop the broadcast!  Stop! 
 - Hey!

189
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,640
How dare you insult our president!

190
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,990
Either broadcast a corrected report

191
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,190
- or stop the analysis broadcast.  Until then, we are not leaving. 
 - We are not leaving!

192
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,010
Cut open my stomach?!  Cut it open?!

193
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,180
Cut open my stomach!  You can't go!

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,590
Let's cut open our stomachs!

195
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,850
- You can't go!!! 
 - Let's cut open our stomachs!

196
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,680
- Stop it! 
 - Stop it!

197
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,580
Mister, did you pay back a bit of your debt?

198
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,130
Mister, you even got a private loan to give an offering, didn't you?

199
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,920
Mister, with the offering that is like your blood,

200
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,820
that president built an overseas resort.

201
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,230
Ma'am, you live in a dorm because you can't afford the  monthly payments on a place, don't you?

202
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,920
That president purchased a villa in Daechi-dong in his mistress' name last month.

203
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,060
It's for people like you, men and women,

204
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,850
that we work so hard to broadcast.

205
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,090
Please wake up!

206
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,620
What do you think our president is?!  Don't damn our president!

207
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,540
- I am sorry. 
 - I am telling you that he is a fraud with a record, not a president!

208
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,190
Stop!  That's enough!

209
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,970
Do you think they will listen to you?

210
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,990
That's why somebody has to tell them until they listen.

211
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,610
Okay.  Let's go.

212
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,820
Did the eyewitness call?

213
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,960
- No. 
 - Hey!

214
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,210
The day after tomorrow is the broadcast.   If you still don't have the eyewitness, what are you planning on doing?

215
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,640
Last time you said you would get the interview and blew it as well.

216
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,070
This time, I will somehow convince him so

217
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,830
please wait for a little while.

218
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,210
I don't know.

219
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,140
Mr. Hyungchul!

220
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,040
It's because your interview is really necessary if we are to catch the culprit.

221
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,540
I ask you, please.

222
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,770
A lot of effort was put into getting this broadcast.

223
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,280
You just have to talk about what you remember.

224
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,580
Please, think about So Ri who passed away and just once—

225
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,930
What about the living?

226
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,880
Excuse me?

227
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,280
A dead person is important but not a living one?

228
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,200
Did you think about how hard it was for me since that day?

229
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,700
I don't want to get involved in this case anymore so please leave.

230
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,340
 I am hungry.  Am I going to faint again?

231
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,830
 That plump neck...

232
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,630
 is calling me.

233
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,810
A. E. I. O. U.

234
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,600
Ah, what a crazy punk!

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,110
 They say a person who can endure three times can avoid murder.

236
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,870
 Let's endure.  I shouldn't eat this.

237
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,490

238
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:45,170
 What is this?  A rice cake from the sky (a gift from above)?

239
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,730
Here.  This is for your booger smeared ₩500.

240
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,890
Heol!  What about my Hodoo?

241
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,240
If you want the body, bring more money.  It will be better if it's by this week.

242
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,610
Mister, how did you know that I was here?

243
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,190
 The smell of human sweat is overpowering.

244
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,690
Wash up!

245
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,060

246
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,470
Why do you always have those tissue tube rollers on your hair?

247
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,440
I want to save perm money.

248
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,220
Why do you always wear the same clothes?

249
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,890
Because this outfit looks the best on me.

250
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,790
- Don't you agree? 
 - Yeah.

251
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,040
It looks the best!

252
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,480
♪  In tears, she left and she left me alone without her love  ♪

253
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,110
What?  Why is the refrigerator like this?

254
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,940
Please enjoy.

255
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,480
Please eat a lot.  A lot.

256
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,290
I will help you.

257
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,990

258
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,170
I have to catch this bastard no matter what.

259
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,340
Of course, the living is more important than the dead.

260
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,690
But Mr. Hyungchul,

261
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,780
because of you, someone can be saved.

262
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,480
And...

263
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,870
like you, Mr. Hyungchul,

264
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,730
there could be some other eyewitnesses who witnessed the crime.

265
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,150
If those people

266
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,250
watch your interview through our broadcast,

267
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,220
maybe they can receive courage.

268
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,380
Please trust me and help me just once.

269
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,180
We have to catch the culprit for sure, right?

270
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,120
Please?

271
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,460

272
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,150
 The reason I let this dog live?

273
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,360
 Because this is the dog that lays golden eggs.

274
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,980
From now, you are going to have the value of ₩4,999,500.

275
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,920
You are in a different class than those mutts on the streets.

276
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
From now on, your name is Damn Big Profit.

277
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,850
Big Profit.

278
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,890
Is it tasty?

279
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,190
It looks tasty.

280
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,380
Don't look at me with those open eyes.

281
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,290
Don't look, I said.  Look away.

282
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,890
Don't look.  I will feel guilty.

283
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,880
I said not to look with those open eyes.

284
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,050
Look away!

285
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,060
 Hello, we're Daehan Tripe.

286
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,990
 We're doing a sampling event, so come and try some.

287
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,550
 Tripe free tasting?

288
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,350
 Please come try.  Try for free tasty...

289
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,740
 Come join our sampling event. It's chewy.

290
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,770

291
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:58,450
 Gnaw, chew and taste it.

292
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,960
 For the past year,

293
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,500
 the thing that helped me stay as a human

294
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,470
 was tripe stew.

295
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,390
 Finally, did the moment to welcome it arrive?

296
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,790

297
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,580
Will sunblock be okay, too?

298
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,510

299
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,520
Hello, everyone. Gangrim's Beef Tripe has finally opened. Please come!

The atmosphere... hot!  Beef tripe is hot, too!

316
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,680
Hot, hot, hot, beef tripe!

317
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,600
 It's going hot. Try some tripe, everyone.

318
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,690
 My face turned out very white, but it's okay. It looks natural.

319
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,290
 I am human. Human!

320
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,500
 It's beef tripe.  Chew, bite, taste, and enjoy!

321
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,050
Beef tripe.  Let's go to chew, bite, taste, and enjoy.

322
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,660
The special event is now over.

323
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,760
 We will move on to our main event.  Enjoy the show and—

324
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,730
And pay. Inside.

325
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,460
Please buy some beef tripe.

326
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,350
How cruel.

327
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,560
Wang Wey, let's go in.

328
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
But...

329
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,910
Excuse me, you may eat inside.

330
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,700

331
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,740
 I don't have money. Crap.

332
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,350
 What on earth?

333
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,040
 Are they zombies, too?

334
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,440
Why are you so late? We waited forever.

335
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,530
 Why would they wait for me?

336
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,710
Han Gyul, you're here?

337
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes.

338
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,830
 What's going on?

339
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,520
- Why did you stop putting on your zombie makeup halfway? 
 -  Makeup?

340
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,550
I think it'll be okay if we retouch it a bit.

341
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,650
We're really going all-out to promote this time,

342
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,810
- so your makeup... 
  - These humans...

343
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,100
should look more realistic...

344
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,840
Find another zombie.

345
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,510
What the heck? Why is he making a fuss when he's the one who came?

346
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,330
I'll give you guys beef tripe stew on the house, so you better do your best.

347
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,850
- Beef tripe! 
 - Beef tripe!

348
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,960
Beef tripe stew?

349
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,580
If it were someone else, I wouldn't have agreed to the interview.

350
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,220
Of course. With your help, we'll definitely catch the culprit.

351
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,010
Just comfortably recount the events of that day.

352
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,730
Okay.

353
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:31,260
That day, I went night-fishing.

354
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,140
 There was a man fishing next to me. After a while...

355
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,360
- Excuse me, could I borrow your light?   
- I asked if I could borrow his light.

356
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,090
I thought he was a bit off somewhere.

357
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,240
He didn't say a word,

358
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,210
but I could sense a murderous spirit.

359
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,200
If you saw the guy's face again...

360
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,840
would you be able to point him out?

361
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,590
Of course. I haven't forgotten his face once in the past year.

362
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,400

363
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,570
Wow, Boss. Did the sun rise in the west?

364
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,960
I can't believe you're buying me beef tripe!

365
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,910
If our World King Detective Office is to go global, you need to eat well.

366
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,140
Eat up.

367
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,700
- Thank you. 
 - We're going dutch.

368
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,520
I will not eat up.

369
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,880
Wang Wey! Wang Wey!

370
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,780
Manager Kim, we didn't eat any, so we're not paying.

371
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,430
Wang Wey!

372
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,010
Those little...

373
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,210
Did the interview go well?

374
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,050
Yeah. It'll be aired tomorrow.

375
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,480
I'm going to catch that Santa with my bare hands.

376
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,020
Detective Cha, you're ready. Right?

377
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,400
I'm also ready. Let's go.

378
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,190
Let's go.

379
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,640
Kim Bora!

380
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,370
- Guys, you came! 
 - Manager Kim!

381
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,420
Tada!

382
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,610
What's this?

383
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,090
Congratulations on your opening!

384
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,930
- Thanks. 
 - Congratulations.

385
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,630
Go sit there, that table.

386
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,150
You have so many customers.

387
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,710
It's nice.

388
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,230
Have you now gone from Nurse Kim to Manager Kim?

389
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,600
You can say that I am developing my natural-born ability.

390
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,920
I have 5 years of experience just with gastrointestinal endoscopy.

391
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,410
I can tell just by looking at the color and the length of the intestine how many polyps there are

392
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,680
and whether or not it has constipation.

393
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,280
What do you think?  Now you can trust me and eat, right?

394
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,550
- I feel like I can trust you. 
 - Right?

395
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,630
But why did I suddenly lose my appetite?

396
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,900
Bora, you're so cool.

397
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,350
Hold on.

398
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,420
I heard she got into trouble again.

399
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,030
Hopefully, they'll settle things well.

400
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,740
Someone might think she's responsible for the whole world.

401
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,570
Is she the Batman of Gangrim City or something?  Why does she get involved?

402
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,180
You should support her.

403
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,310
I should. She's my precious friend.

404
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,420
What about you?

405
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,110
Dohyun, when are you going to confess to Sunji?

406
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,360
Hey, I'm hungry. When's the beef tripe coming out?

407
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,320
Hm?

408
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,280
Three servings.

409
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,440
♫ Can you feel my heartbeat ♫

410
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,250
Yes, don't worry. It'll air tomorrow.

411
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,120
Okay.

412
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,100
Anyway, why isn't this guy contacting me?

413
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,080
He's probably fine.

414
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,370
I heard getting a part-time job isn't easy these days.

415
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,980
They're really working hard.

416
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,860
♫   I want to stop. No matter how many times 
 I try to stop myself, it's no use   ♫

417
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,900
♫  My heart is broken, why  ♫

418
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,910
♫  Listen to my heartbeat It's beating for you  ♫

419
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,210
♫  Listen to my heartbeat  ♫

420
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,550
Hello? Why aren't you dancing?

421
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,790
Hey?

422
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,870
♫  I don't know that it was over  ♫

423
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,450
What the hell?

424
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,320
He has no conscience if that's all he does and plans to get paid.

425
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,050
He's a zombie?

426
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,840
Shouldn't he do this much at the very least?

427
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,310
♫  I think of you every time my heart beats  ♫

428
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,820
♫  I have to forget, I have to forget to live  ♫

429
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,380
♫  I have to erase you or else I'll die  ♫

430
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,390
♫  Stop trying to get her back, she ain't coming  ♫

431
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,440
♫  She's gone, gotta be moving on  ♫

432
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,490
♫  She left and won't come back, she doesn't think
 of you anymore  ♫

433
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,550
♫  She has no clue at all   ♫

434
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,000
 I have sold my soul to humans.

435
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,180
♫  She already forgot me, completely erased me  ♫

436
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,880
♫  Why can't I do the same?  ♫

437
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,810
♫  Listen to my heartbeat  ♫

438
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:01,700
 Do you think I struggled for a whole year to do this kind of stuff?

439
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,350
 You think this is why I practiced my pronunciation? Is this what you want?

440
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,130
 I'm just doing it for your sake.

441
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,930
 I'll just do it, you freaking humans!

442
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,260
♫  My heart is beating  ♫

443
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,140
♫  Faster and faster  ♫

444
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,780
♫  My heart is beating  ♫

445
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,170
♫  Faster and faster  ♫

446
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,750
♫  Faster and faster  ♫

447
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,570
What's his deal?

448
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,090
How is he not getting tired at all?

449
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,510
From what I see,

450
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,050
he got extra pay last second.

451
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,290
There's no other explanation.

452
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,250
You hit him with a helmet and he passed out?

453
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:56,270
The dead would rise from their graves if they heard that.

454
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,650
Do you know why insurance is so expensive?

455
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,200
That's not fully cooked.

456
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,850
Insurance premiums would be half the price if it weren't for fake patients and con artists.

457
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,630
I came across a couple of con artists when I worked at the hospital.

458
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,930
They will never return your calls right away.

459
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,500
They come up with a settlement with brokers before contacting you.

460
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,100
The next time he calls you, he's going to rip you off for a ton of money.

461
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,330
No way.

462
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,110
Should I look into it?

463
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,480
Forget it.

464
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,400
He almost died because of me. Don't bother an innocent man.

465
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,000
This girl, seriously!

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,900
Sunji, those people are experts, professionals!

467
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,830
They'll drop everything at the opportunity to scam!

468
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,750
As if they are a bunch of hungry hyenas,

469
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,750
looking for humans to tear apart... Holy crap!

470
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,270
You guys finished? Your beef tripe's in the back.

471
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,960
Why do they look so realistic?

472
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:00,500
This is why I hate zombies. They're not just scary, they're actually scary.

473
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,990
- I think they're cute. 
 - Cute?

474
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,770
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you!

475
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,190
- Here. 
 - Thank you!

476
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,320
- On the house. 
 - Thank you so much.

477
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,470
Beef tripe stew.

478
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,580
- What about the other one?  Where is he? 
 - Uh?

479
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,730
- He was with us until just a moment ago.
 - Ah!!!

480
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,380
Eww!!!

481
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,830
What the heck are you doing now?

482
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,640
Is this guy crazy!  Why the hell is he eating it raw?!

483
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,020
- There... There... 
 - What's wrong?

484
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,930
Who the hell are you?

485
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,080
Hey, what do you think you are doing?!

486
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,130
Doyeon? Doyeon, are you all right?

487
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,680
Hey, what is going on?!

488
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,100
What... What's wrong?

489
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,260
 It's the past that my body remembers.

490
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,240
Are you okay?

491
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,160
You belong to the Police Martial Arts Special Unit and you are a Violent Crimes Unit Detective.  How do you let him get the best of you?

492
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,660
I am telling you this was not an ordinary martial artist.

493
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:06,150
He had short form and attacked the vital points precisely, like a killer.

494
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,480
You should stop watching movies.

495
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,720
A killer at a tripe stew restaurant?

496
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,560
Miss Owner!

497
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,630
Did you look into it?

498
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,760
- The part-time student worker who was scheduled to come here couldn't make it because he got sick. 
 - What?

499
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,590
Then, who was that man earlier?

500
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,750
I... I am not sure either.

501
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,390
 The innate nature of a zombie that was kept in check has awakened.

502
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,880
 I can no longer—

503
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,770
 How long must I live like this?

504
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,920
 Will I able to go back to being a human?

505
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,420
Sis, use words! Words!

506
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,390
Fess up!  Is it true that you broke the back of the head of someone?!

507
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:45,290
- Hear me out. 
 -  Rumors are spreading that there is a crazy wench in this neighborhood!

508
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,560
No, Sis, I really didn't know.  I thought that he really was a pervert!

509
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,510
Pervert or pervert's grandpa, why do you throw yourself into that situation?

510
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,220
It's just that you have to catch them red-handed.  Otherwise, they destroy the evidence.

511
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,290
What a load of crock!

512
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,060
You, cleaned out the refrigerator, didn't you?

513
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,110
You can't even afford to pay for the room and you have the nerve to clean out the refrigerator?

514
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:13,670
Sis, I really needed to interview someone so... I am sorry—

515
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:17,030
- Joonwoo... 
 - Sis, not that! Sis!

516
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,540
Why would you risk your life for a company that doesn't even pay for your insurances?!

517
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,040
Aren't you going to come to your senses?!

518
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
Don't you feel apologetic towards our deceased mom and dad?!

519
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,190
- Don't you even feel bad, you crazy wench?!
 - Sis!

520
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,190
- Why mention mom and dad?!
 - This—

521
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,750
How dare you talk back to me!

522
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,290
Come here!  Hey!

523
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,380
 - Hey!  
 - Joonwoo, let's eat.

524
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,270
Do you want eggs?

525
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,450
 Thanks to the water deer, I was able to avoid a crisis.

526
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:01,790
 To return to being a human, I can't get lax about joints exercise.

527
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,580
Detective Kim's body is no joke.

528
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,130
His shoulders are as broad as the Great Wall of China.

529
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,980
But are those scars or tattoos?

530
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,560
Thirteen.

531
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,330
President, did you get cupping therapy again?

532
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,100
That's right, I did!  What? Do you think you are going to stay young forever?!

533
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,670
You should maintain yourself well even now.  Damn, I lost the count!

534
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,950
Did you organize the ledger like I told you to?!

535
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,570
I did it long ago.  The office needs to have work in order for me to write a lot in a ledger.

536
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,910
I feel so bad about getting paychecks from you.

537
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,330
I feel worse since I am paying an employee when there is no work.

538
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:09,240
- Auntie!  Auntie! 
 - Yeah.

539
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,250
Mom said don't even think about coming in until you bring living expenses.

540
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,980
Auntie, the rumor spread all over my school.

541
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,340
After seeing you throw a helmet, the kids said they won't bother me.

542
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,470
Is that right?  That's good.

543
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:38,410
Joonwoo, do you know that uncle?

544
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,990
Ah, that detective uncle?

545
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,040
- That uncle is a detective?
 - Yeah.

546
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,090
 How did I do it that time?

547
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,660
Ah, that's right.  That's one way to do it.

548
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,770

549
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,910
 Sun cream won't do.

550
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:55,670
It should be okay.

551
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,690
What is this?

552
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,440
No way, not that crap?

553
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,850
Excuse me!

554
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,320
Sir!

555
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,260
What? That crap?  Why is she here?

556
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,230
 Excuse me.  Can we talk for a moment?

557
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,680
 Sir, it will only take a moment.

558
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,960
 Since you don't even have a phone, I came personally.

559
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,130
 Sir!  I can hear you inside!

560
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:49,290
 Sir, I know you are inside!

561
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,750
What is it?

562
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,170
You must be going somewhere.

563
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,690
Can we talk for a moment?

564
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,630
No, we can't.

565
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,450
 Crap... I really stepped on it good.

566
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:18,390
I didn't know that there was a detective office at a place like this.

567
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,400
What is this about?

568
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,870
Sir, do you know how shocked I was that day?

569
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:31,710
After you passed out, you had no heartbeat so I thought you were dead.

570
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,690
That day, I was flustered so I didn't ask you,

571
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,980
but by any chance—

572
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,240
 By any chance, did this human catch onto me?

573
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,840
You have cardiac arrhythmia, don't you?

574
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:50,690
That's all because of poor blood circulation.  Did you get a close examination?

575
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,740
I don't need any examination.

576
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,840
What do you mean you don't need it?!  Aftercare is very important after an accident.

577
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,000
You should know so why are you like this?

578
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,660
You are done talking, right?  If you are done, hurry up and leave.

579
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,000
So, you are not saying that you won't get an examination in the future either, are you?

580
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,860
I am not getting it!  Not getting it!  I said I am not getting it!

581
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,990
Please leave!

582
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,420
You know... with an accident...

583
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,370
usually the aftereffect is more fearsome and...

584
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,000
You might change your story later as well so...

585
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,970
So, what is it that you want to say?

586
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:37,440
If you really don't need to go to the hospital, why don't you write an agreement for me?

587
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,470
An agreement?

588
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,760
It's not that I don't trust you.  Really, really.

589
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,250
If you are physically fine, it's better to write an agreement for both of us and—

590
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,820
- Hello? 
  - We shall soon judge you—

591
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,020
So, Sir, this...

592
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,950
Please give it some thought and call me.

593
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:04,100
No, it's okay.  It's okay, so take—

594
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,260
Hey!

595
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,090
You...

596
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,870

597
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,370
 Crap needs to be avoided.  For sure!

598
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:44,480
Do you know what this is?

599
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,720
If I get it right, you are going to let me see my Hodoo for free. Right?

600
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,070
That's right.

601
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,630
- Cobra? 
 - Magician? 
 - Kung Fu Panda?

602
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,620
I don't think it's a dance...

603
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,370
I don't think it's a fire ball, either.  Ah!

604
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,380
 At last.

605
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:41,180
If you register, I will let you know! Ta... da...ta...

606
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,250
 I will let you know if you register.

607
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,380
He's going to let me know if I register?!

608
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,480
That thief!

609
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,870
And where am I going to find this?

610
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,090
 Would Santa Claus know what happened that day?

611
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,590
 December 25, 2018,

612
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,040
 Christmas, the day children all over the world earnestly await.

613
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,090
 But for one, Miss Sori, it was a nightmarish Christmas.    A suspicious person dressed in a Santa outfit—

614
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,820
That... That bastard, not even good enough to be beaten to death!

615
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,020
 Why did the killer commit such a horrible crime?

616
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,420
 And for what reason, did he cruelly force an innocent child

617
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,520
 to face deathly horror?

618
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,130
 The killer was meticulous and the only video that captured him

619
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,830
 only confirms that he was wearing a Santa outfit.

620
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:58,670
 Furthermore, the snow that fell overnight covered any clues or evidence that might be helpful,

621
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:02,670
 and served a pivotal role in helping the killer pull off a perfect crime.

622
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,420
 Four months after the kidnapping,

623
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,050
 Sori was found in a reservoir fishing ground

624
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,840
 as a cold corpse.

625
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,380
 Sori's father, Mr. K., is the president of a trading company.  One month prior to Sori's kidnapping,

626
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,410
 we had covered him on our program as well.

627
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,620
- Writer Gong is all right, isn't she?
   - Just one comment, please!

628
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,790
Of course.   She did what she had to as a current affairs writer.

629
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,980
 Due to the incident...

630
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,040
The problem is with the bastard who kidnapped (Sori) after watching the broadcast.

631
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,540
 Since the controversy arose, other companies felt nervous.

632
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,070
 Meanwhile, Sori disappeared without a trace.

633
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,300
 Police had deduced the culprit to be someone holding a grudge against Sori's father and have been investigating until now.

634
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,520
 However, even until now, one year after the crime,

635
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,520
 they have not been able to find the motive or clues.

636
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,540
 He was in his late 30s and even had a scar on his cheek.  If I meet him again, I would recognize him right away.

637
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,850
 Viewers, please watch carefully now.

638
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,700
 The montage you are about to see is

639
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,140
 the face of the killer who had on a Santa outfit and kidnapped and murdered Miss Kim Sori.

640
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:11,650
 Your reports and tips will become the critical clues to solving this case.

641
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,250
 To Miss Kim Sori, who has become a star in the sky,

642
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,220
 our condolences.

643
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,700
 In your next life, we hope that you can play to your heart's content and smile brightly.

644
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,240
 May you rest in peace.

645
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,920

646
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,750
MIster, what do you think you are doing?!

647
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,630
She should go in and sleep. It must be uncomfortable.

648
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,700
You are awake?!

649
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:52,570
- Did you eat? 
 - Of course I ate.  It's late, you know.

650
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:56,430
I saw the broadcast.

651
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,870
What about Santa?  Is it all over?

652
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,300
It's not over.  It will be over when he is caught.

653
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,540
Ah, that damned Santa!

654
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:15,820
You worked hard.  Go in and sleep.  You must be tired.

655
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,260
- Sis, you go in and sleep comfortably, too. 
 - Okay.  Hurry.

656
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,700
- Sleep well. 
 - Yeah.

657
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,040
 Mr. Hyungchul, the broadcast went well.

658
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,140
 Thank you so so much for the interview.

659
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:52,800
 Thanks to you, I am sure the killer will get caught.

660
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,000

661
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,650
It would be nice if lots of calls with information come in.

662
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,250
 - 70-Minute Chase. 
 - 70-Minute Chase.

663
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,340
 We are confirming it, too.  We will give you a call after the confirmation.

664
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,280
I wonder if we got any calls...

665
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:29,160
Writer Gong, we are ruined now.

666
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,190
What is the matter?

667
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,150
 This is HBS 70-Minute Chase.

668
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,200

669
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:50,100
Attack— Who... to Mr. Hyungchul?

670
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,490
Knowing that he was doing the interview,

671
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:57,190
the killer was watching.  What are we going to do now?

672
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,390
 Mr. Oh, the eyewitness in the Santa kidnapping case,

673
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:15,260
 was attacked early this morning.

674
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:17,950
 Mr. Oh appeared on yesterday's broadcast of 70-Minute Chase

675
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,210
 as an eyewitness to the crime.

676
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,820
 Police will be expanding the investigation based on the correlation between the two cases.

677
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:30,030
You are saying the attacker wielded a knife from behind, correct?

678
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,720
Yes.

679
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,350
Did you see the killer's face?

680
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,730
It was him for sure.

681
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,820
Sunji.

682
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,700
Are you okay?

683
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,210
I'm sorry.

684
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,710
I'm really sorry.

685
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,350
Because of me... I am sorry.

686
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,610
I am still alive so it's okay.

687
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:12,730
It's okay.

688
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,340
How dare you come here?!  Do you realize what you have done?!

689
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,890
He agreed to the interview because you begged him to and now look!

690
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,530
Because of you, he almost died!

691
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:30,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

692
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,300
I should have been more careful.

693
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,670
I am sorry, ma'am.

694
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,190
 Why did I do that?

695
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,640
 There were so many humans.

696
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,730
 I am crazy.  Crazy.

697
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,010
 Hold on.

698
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:14,260
 Hey, phone!

699
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,860
Eh?  You rotten punk!

700
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,330
You even lock your door and stay inside yet you don't answer my call?!

701
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,560
You ignoring me?!

702
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,590
 You've been depositing the rent money into my account regularly

703
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,530
 so why are you late by 20 days?!

704
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,510
That...

705
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,190
What?

706
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,950
I... I don't have the money right now, ma'am.

707
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,260
If you don't have money, get out!

708
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,490
If you don't pay by this week, I will break...

709
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,670
the office, got that?!

710
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,400
Yes...

711
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,390
Monthly rent?  Ah, jeez!

712
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:12,580
Where am I going to get the money for the rent?!   Damn, I don't have the BB cream, and I am hungry, too!

713
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,690
This damn money!

714
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,280
That's right!

715
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,730

716
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:39,350
 That's right.  Human or zombie, there is a way to survive.

717
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,540
 Stop drinking!

718
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,040
Ma'am,

719
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,130
I...

720
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,910
started the broadcast to save people.

721
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:10,290
But...

722
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:15,490
because of the broadcast program that I made, someone got hurt.

723
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:19,030
Not just once but twice.

724
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,140
I... am not going to broad—

725
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,140
No, I can't broadcast anymore.

726
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,330
What right do I have to broadcast?

727
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,340
I really should die.

728
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,240
Why do you live, Kong Sunji?

729
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,320
Why live?

730
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:20,580
- Hello? 
   - Hey!

731
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,420
 I told you jerks not to do the interview!

732
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,810
 Do you want to go to a fiery pit in Hell?!

733
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:32,420
Excuse me, can you please take me to that pit?

734
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,750
I am in so much pain that

735
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,480
I feel like I should at least go to hell.

736
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,790
So, please take me and—

737
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,130
 Settlement money from someone like her?!

738
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,480
 Wake up, I need to get that money.

739
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,010
Right?

740
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,850
That 70-Minute Chase nutcase?

741
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,470
I am with 70-Minute Chase but I am not a nutcase...

742
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,650
What are those humans?!

743
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,170
What are you doing?  Hurry up and get in!

744
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,650
Yeah, that's right.  Let's go.

745
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,140
- Let's go. 
 - Let's get you home.

746
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,330
That's right!

747
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,520
Those jerks dare to take my settlement money?!

748
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,330
Mister, Chowol-dong intersection...

749
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,270
Mister, don't you know that it's illegal to share a ride?

750
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,970
We should go to the police station right now!

751
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,470
- No, that's not it! 
 - Mister, please go to the police station!

752
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,180
- This police station, please! 
 - Why are you like this?!

753
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,370
 Stop doing that!

754
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,900
- Hold on to her! 
 - I am holding her!

755
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,320
What do you think you are doing now?!  Let go!

756
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,220
You! You!  I will properly teach you today

757
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,350
how great our president is!

758
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,200
President?  Okay, tell him to come.

759
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,690
We can drink together and just die together!

760
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,430
Let go!

761
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,310
Goodness, this...

762
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,910
Ah, this nutcase!

763
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,320
What?

764
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,040
What is that?

765
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,110
It looks like you hit someone!!!

766
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,150
 Oh my god!

767
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,450
 It's a person!

768
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,840
He's moving.

769
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:00,070
Did a god send him?!

770
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,650
What is that?!

771
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,320
Where did he go?  Where did he go?

772
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,090
He's not here.

773
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:55,640
Helmet.  Right?

774
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:00,140
What brings you all the way here?

775
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,650
Don't misunderstand.  I didn't come to save you.

776
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,700
Of course!  No one can save someone like me.

777
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,340
It's better to just give up.

778
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:13,540
Listen carefully.  I think after I got hit with the helmet that day, I became aggressive.

779
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:18,180
It's commonly called post-traumatic stress syndrome.

780
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,590
So, I think we need to come to an agreement like you said.

781
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:25,700
There is no better medicine than money for psychological damage.

782
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,900

783
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,310
And it's not only my brain that's been injured.

784
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:45,510
My stomach has already been ruptured.  Large intestine, small intestine, and duodenum...

785
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:49,560
all might as well be replaced.

786
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:56,970
Especially here... this heart.

787
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,810
The heart doesn't even beat.

788
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,380
It has become cold—

789
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,090
It's warm...

790
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:20,170
 This human... what the heck is she?

791
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:36,700

792
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:40,530

793
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,120
 Don't you need help at the detective office?

794
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,510
 I will pay the settlement money with physical labor.

795
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:49,650
 If you find my daughter and bring her back, the pay will be double what I paid you last time.

796
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:51,590
 We will take this case.

797
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:52,220
 We?

798
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,330
 It's a zombie noir.

799
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,540
 - Zombie noir? 
 - Yes, noir.

800
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,760
 We have to hurry up and catch that bastard.

801
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,570
 Like before,  he didn't leave any evidence at the crime scene.

802
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,120
 Why are you coming out from there?

803
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,830
 The zombie is taking revenge on the humans who made him that way.

804
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:05,970
 I am really about to go crazy.

805
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,300
 I will... today...

806
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,670
 show you a miracle!

807
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,920
 Do you want it more earnestly?!

808
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,710
 They were all in it together.

809
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,300
 Excuse me!  Hey!  Hey!

810
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,730
 Aren't you going to open the door?!  Hey!

811
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:28,360
 I came back alive... to hell.  Zombie Detective.
