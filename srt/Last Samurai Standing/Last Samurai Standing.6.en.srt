1
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,958
Not enough.

2
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,666
Not enough!

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,208
Kokushu the Manslayer.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,958
I haven't had enough fun yet.

5
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,166
Let's fight to the death.

6
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,916
The battle is over.

7
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,083
But we're samurai.

8
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,250
We fight on regardless.

9
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,666
It ends too quickly, huh?

10
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:10,166
These sons of bitches
with their rifles and cannons.

11
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,583
See?

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,291
That's all it takes.

13
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,208
It doesn't even feel like killing.

14
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,750
What a civilized weapon.

15
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,500
The age of the sword is coming to an end.

16
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,041
Manslayers like us are no longer needed.

17
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:38,125
That doesn't change who we are inside.

18
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,166
We'll always be manslayers.

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,333
I liked the way you killed back there.

20
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,000
Come and show me how you do it.

21
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,250
You feel like fighting me yet?

22
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,000
Kill me.

23
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,958
If you don't kill me now,

24
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,791
I'll hunt you down
for the rest of my life.

25
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,625
It's over now.

26
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
We'll meet again, all right?!

27
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,916
Kokushu the Manslayer!

28
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:56,333
The era of the samurai is over.
You just stay here until the day you die.

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,375
I wanna fight…

30
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:42,208
What a sorry sight you make,
Bukotsu Kanjiya.

31
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,000
You disappeared ten years ago,

32
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
then suddenly reemerged
for the Satsuma Rebellion

33
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,625
and even cut down your own allies.

34
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,208
How have you lived your life since then?

35
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,708
How have I lived my life?

36
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,500
I've been dead

37
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,541
this whole time.

38
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm going to give you another chance
to live as a samurai.

39
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,583
Huh?

40
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,333
HOKOKU NEWSPAPER
PARTICIPANTS WANTED

41
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,958
Hey! What's going on?!

42
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,000
LAST SAMURAI STANDING

43
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,750
TO TOSHIYOSHI KAWAJI

44
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,375
WE MUST DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE POLICE.
I AWAIT YOU IN TOKYO.

45
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,416
Lord Okubo!

46
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,125
Lord Okubo, please.

47
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,083
If we don't exterminate
the shizoku in this war,

48
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,250
they're sure to revolt
against the new age!

49
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,833
Please grant the police officers
permission to carry guns.

50
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,458
-I will not.
-Why?

51
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:33,125
How are we supposed to protect you
from a potential assassination attempt?

52
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,958
Take their swords away.

53
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,666
-I will allow no more than that.
-Mr. Okubo!

54
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,666
Heavy-handed oppression
will only result in more uprisings.

55
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,625
Recall what happened in Kyoto
at the end of the Edo period.

56
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:52,833
How many of our comrades fell
to the shizoku's swords!

57
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:59,375
If highly skilled samurai were to plot
our assassination, we couldn't stop them!

58
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:03,666
We need guns to protect Japan
in the coming era!

59
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,291
What good does it do
to use force against force?!

60
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,041
What do you think Japan needs
in order to grow strong as a nation?

61
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:17,041
-The people!
-It's the people I want to protect!

62
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,291
You cannot win public support by force!
Do you not understand that?!

63
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,791
Kawaji.

64
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,708
The shizoku will no longer be needed.

65
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,166
However,

66
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,583
unless we find a way to coexist…

67
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,166
this country has no future.

68
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,833
I… will not give up.

69
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:05,791
THE KODOKU PROJECT

70
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,750
Mr. Kawaji.

71
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Come in.

72
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,708
Excuse me, sir.

73
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,666
A telegram from Okubo for you.

74
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,750
To Toshiyoshi Kawaji.

75
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,750
We must discuss the future of the police.

76
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,250
I await you in Tokyo.

77
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,875
-Futaba.
-Yes?

78
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,458
Go join them.

79
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,833
-Is that all right?
-Yeah.

80
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,750
Thank you.

81
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,875
You sure?

82
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,125
We have two days until the rendezvous.

83
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,208
And besides,

84
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,583
these could be our last days together.

85
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,250
So that's how you look now.

86
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,208
How I look now?

87
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,583
Like a father watching his child.

88
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,041
Did having a family make you happy?

89
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,041
It did.

90
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,875
What's it like having a real family?

91
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,208
I'd sacrifice everything to protect them.

92
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,416
It taught me a way of life
aside from killing.

93
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,583
As for me…

94
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,833
if I knew every day would be like this…

95
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,750
I'd have been better off dying
in the succession match.

96
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,708
I've thought that many times.

97
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,250
Iroha.

98
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,250
You've got it wrong. I--

99
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,416
I know.

100
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,375
I know.

101
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,750
I'm going for a walk.

102
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,833
What do you mean,
if our siblings were in trouble?

103
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,416
Tell us the details.

104
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,625
Shujiro Saga and Iroha Kinugasa are bound
to get killed unless you do something.

105
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,083
You don't mean…

106
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,750
Gentosai?

107
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,625
Hey! Well done. You nailed it.

108
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,583
There's a festival on
at the shrine up ahead.

109
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,541
That's where the two of them are.

110
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,000
As well as Gentosai.

111
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:46,916
You…

112
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,708
Who are you?

113
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,708
Good question.

114
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,958
Lately, I'm not sure
even I know the answer.

115
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,750
Better hurry.

116
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,083
Kyojin.

117
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,375
What was that about? Who's Gentosai?

118
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,833
Shinnosuke, there are some things
you're better off not knowing.

119
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,000
But--

120
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:24,375
Since we're in it, we might as well enjoy
this game they call the Kodoku.

121
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,166
The eighth of the Kyohachi-ryu successors,
Iroha Kinugasa.

122
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,291
I found you.

123
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,583
It can't be…

124
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,708
All right. Let's get started.

125
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
Right!

126
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:53,958
Here we go!

127
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,416
Found you.

128
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:56,916
Kokushu!

129
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,458
It's about time we settled this!

130
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,166
Get back!

131
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,541
I knew it.

132
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,958
Nothing beats fighting you to the death.

133
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,916
You only kill for the thrill of it.

134
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,958
Look who's talking.

135
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,583
It's pathetic.

136
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,375
Everything is so pathetic!

137
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,833
And I'll destroy it all!

138
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,666
Stop it!

139
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,708
What's that, little miss?

140
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,041
Why do you kill innocent people?

141
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,458
You're no samurai!

142
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,833
Futaba! Stay back!

143
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,625
Then what is a samurai?

144
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,291
Answer me that,

145
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,166
little miss.

146
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,916
Don't, Bukotsu. Let her go.

147
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,416
If I killed this girl,

148
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,833
I reckon you'd fight me then.

149
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,583
No. Don't do it.

150
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,125
Don't do it!

151
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,083
Move it!

152
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,583
Take that!

153
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,333
Move! Out of the way!

154
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,875
You have no chance with that arm.
Just give up.

155
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,791
You're telling me to give up?

156
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,333
It's 'cause we gave up
that we ended up this way.

157
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,916
How did it feel to have your sword taken?

158
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,333
Have you been happy?

159
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,250
I've been happy.

160
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,375
Then why are you here?

161
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:09,791
In the end, the only way you can
prove it to yourself is to kill people.

162
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,458
You can't even save
a single person without killing, can you?

163
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,541
The era of the samurai is over?

164
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,541
I don't give a damn.

165
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,000
All we have to do

166
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:31,166
is build it all over again!

167
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,541
Move!

168
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,333
I found you.

169
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,791
Kokushu!

170
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,500
Enough of this!

171
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,416
Take that!

172
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,583
Run!

173
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,708
That was a good move.

174
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,541
But you're done for.

175
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,541
Any last words?

176
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,041
If that's all you've got…

177
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,625
you won't be able to defeat my brothers.

178
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,875
You can rest assured.

179
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:41,458
Everything shall soon perish.

180
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,333
The fourth of the Kyohachi-ryu successors,

181
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,125
Shikura Adashino.

182
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,208
I can't believe he dodged that too.

183
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,500
And now the third,

184
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Sansuke Gion.

185
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,166
You monster!

186
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,375
Sansuke.

187
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:45,875
In time with me.

188
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,000
Got it.

189
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,000
He's way too strong.

190
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,083
Run!

191
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,166
Iroha! Let's move!

192
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,958
Move!

193
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:06,500
Move!

194
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,416
Kokushu the Manslayer…

195
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
I am…

196
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,708
happy.

197
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:25,833
Shujiro!

198
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,708
Shujiro!

199
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:24,916
The first participant
to reach Chiryu-juku was…

200
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,083
number 277, Kamuykocha.

201
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,500
Yes! Splendid!

202
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:36,750
His long trip from Ezo was worth it.

203
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,916
And number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya,
has been eliminated.

204
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,083
-What did you say?
-Killed by number 108, Shujiro Saga.

205
00:35:44,166 --> 00:35:46,833
Well, well.
That's Kokushu the Manslayer for you.

206
00:35:46,916 --> 00:35:49,666
It's a shame to lose
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher.

207
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,583
It only means that
yet another specter has vanished.

208
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,458
For us, it's something to celebrate.

209
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:01,666
I agree.

210
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,708
Of course.

211
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:06,333
Organizer. It's almost time.

212
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:16,333
I have duties to attend to,
so I shall be taking my leave for now.

213
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,208
Of course.
The Superintendent General is a busy man.

214
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:20,333
So,

215
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,291
the time has come.

216
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,458
I hope you continue to enjoy
the Kodoku, gentlemen.

217
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,916
I've already telegrammed them
the meeting place.

218
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:55,750
Good. Keep the rich bastards entertained.

219
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:57,208
Understood, sir.

220
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,291
Come in.

221
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,791
Excuse me, sir.

222
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,625
It seems Kawaji returned from
his business trip a little while ago.

223
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,541
I'll go see him right away.
Get the carriage ready.

224
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:26,625
Yes, sir.

225
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,958
You still can't get hold of Shinpei?

226
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:33,625
No, sir. I sent someone to his home,
but he didn't seem to be back yet.

227
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,041
Should we ask the police
to conduct a search?

228
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:42,750
No. Have the Home Ministry staff members
split up and try to find him.

229
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:44,250
Yes, sir.

230
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:37,750
What are you--

231
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,000
It's been a long time, Lord Okubo.

232
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,833
Hanjiro! You're… alive?

233
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,333
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

234
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,000
but Kawaji is not headed this way.

235
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,666
What do you mean?

236
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:13,708
I have a message from him instead.

237
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:16,125
"Farewell."

238
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,916
What is…?

239
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,166
Just what is going on?

240
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,583
OKAZAKI-JUKU

241
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,333
Where do you think Iroha went off to?

242
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,916
Knowing her, she'll be just fine.

243
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,583
Extra!

244
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,166
Extra!

245
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:38,833
Extra!

246
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,166
Extra!

247
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,500
Shujiro, this is…

248
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,458
Lord Okubo was killed?

249
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,375
But why?

250
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,000
This is no coincidence.

251
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,541
What?

252
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,833
The Kodoku's involved with this.

253
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,541
Are you Mr. Saga?

254
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,625
Who's asking?

255
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:13,250
A message from Mr. Maejima.

256
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:16,625
"I am returning to Tokyo for an emergency.
Keep heading for Tokyo."

257
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,083
That's all.

258
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,791
Understood.

259
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,500
Goodbye, then.

260
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:28,458
Futaba.

261
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,083
We'll get to Tokyo as fast as we can.

262
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:36,500
All right.

263
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,750
Look out! A carriage is coming!

264
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,458
Don't move too much.
It'll open up the wound.

265
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:39,875
Thanks.

266
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,791
Hey, you two.

267
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,750
I just had a dream.

268
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:03,000
About when we all lived together.

269
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,250
Sansuke and I were bickering
like we always did.

270
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,541
Shikura-nii was strong.

271
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,750
We all used to smile back then.

272
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:21,625
Yeah.

273
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,041
We sure did.

274
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:28,875
If we had the succession match back then…

275
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,958
I'd be dead.

276
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,708
It's thanks to Shu-nii running away…

277
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,166
that I'm still alive now.

278
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,708
But until we defeat Gentosai…

279
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,416
we can't move forward.

280
00:44:16,541 --> 00:44:18,291
We'll take him down,

281
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:21,583
all of us siblings together.

282
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,375
That bastard…

283
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:30,333
We can't beat him
unless we're all together.

284
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:37,750
You're right.

285
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:40,708
We just gotta do it.

286
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,583
Yeah.

287
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:46,041
Let's start by getting
all the siblings together.

288
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,541
At Shimizudani in Kioi-cho…

289
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,291
He actually did it!

290
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,833
Organizer is truly a formidable man.

291
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,833
This will allow us to focus on the Kodoku.

292
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:12,875
Indeed.

293
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:16,291
We still have
many remarkable participants left.

294
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,708
The weak ones are gone.

295
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,416
Only the strong remain now.

296
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:34,458
CHIRYU, OKAZAKI, HAMAMATSU, SHIMADA

297
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,333
Well, gentlemen.

298
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,750
I hope you continue to enjoy the Kodoku.

299
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,583
Cheers.

300
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:45,708
-Wait for me.
-Run!

301
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:47,291
He's right behind us!

302
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,625
Let's play some more.

303
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,791
Well, lucky me.

304
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:01,125
I was short on tags.

305
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:10,791
Good.

306
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,333
That should be enough.

307
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,000
You wanna fight too, sir?

308
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:20,375
Come on, why not?

309
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,958
It's fun.

310
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,625
Really? You couldn't kill them?

311
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,958
I even gave you their location.

312
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:12,250
Keep killing each other
until only one is left standing.

313
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,666
LAST SAMURAI STANDING

314
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,416
END OF CHAPTER ONE
