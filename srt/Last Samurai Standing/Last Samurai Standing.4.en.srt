ACROBATIC SHOW
FEMALE KNIFE THROWER

2
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,041
Stop doing that and pour me a drink!

3
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,416
-That's right!
-Yeah!

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,416
How long are you gonna keep
throwing those?

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,208
Come here and drink with us!

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,083
Nobody throws knives anymore anyway!

7
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,875
You've got a pretty face.

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,208
Take your clothes off and sing for us!

9
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,166
Damn right!

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,125
Show us your beautiful fair skin.
Pretty please!

11
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,666
CIVILIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT

12
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,833
Bravo!

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,458
That's impressive!

14
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,458
-I want a big one.
-Me too.

15
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,541
I can't deal with this without good food.

16
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,333
Can you raise my pay?

17
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,000
The customers don't like it,
so stop your whining.

18
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,500
Iroha.

19
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:18,041
Why don't you sell those knives instead,
or start selling your body?

20
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,458
I don't mind paying for it.

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,500
What? What's that face for?

22
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,583
Huh?

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,375
Have you forgotten who took you in?

24
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,666
I'm talking to you.

25
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,416
So you were alive.

26
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,125
I'm glad.

27
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,500
I didn't expect you
to be a traveling entertainer.

28
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,291
It was hard to find you.

29
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,750
I'm surprised you didn't get angry.

30
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,083
The old Iroha
would've slashed them all to death.

31
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,291
I'm used to it.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,208
What about you, Sansuke?

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,625
Well.

34
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:07,041
I'm pulling a rickshaw every day
to feed my wife and daughter.

35
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,916
I see. You have a family now.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,833
Yes.

37
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,291
And you? What did you do
after you left the mountain?

38
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,666
Many things.

39
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,166
I moved from place to place,
hiding from Gentosai.

40
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,708
And the others?

41
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,416
Fugoro and Shichiya
were killed by Gentosai.

42
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,625
He's been searching
for the surviving Kyohachi-ryu.

43
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,250
Iroha.

44
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,375
If we don't do something,
both of us will be killed.

45
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,250
I already found Shikura and Jinroku
and convinced them.

46
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,750
They're in the army now.

47
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,125
What are you trying to do?

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,416
We'll use this to draw Gentosai out
and kill him ourselves.

49
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,708
Unless all of us attack together,
we won't be able to kill him.

50
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,000
Iroha.

51
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,916
This is our fate.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,958
Sorry to keep you waiting.

53
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,958
And now, to discover
the true identity of Kodoku,

54
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,958
it's time for
the great strategist Kyojin--

55
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,083
Just get to the point.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,958
We're running two experiments.

57
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,750
For the first one,

58
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,000
we'll hand over a participant
with a wooden tag to the police.

59
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,125
Once detained, they'll be held there
until the end of the game.

60
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,916
They're basically out of the game.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,625
Normally, you can't
kill someone who's in jail.

62
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,541
So the question is whether Kodoku
would still make a move?

63
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:25,666
Correct.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,083
Whether they would defy authority
to silence someone,

65
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,250
or at least stop short
of interfering with the police…

66
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,916
This will show us how far
the Kodoku organizer is willing to go.

67
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,458
And for the second one,

68
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,875
we'll find out
where the dead bodies disappear to.

69
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,125
-Disappear?
-Yes.

70
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:50,791
Dozens of people are killing each other
along the Tokaido Road.

71
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,666
Surely there should be a dead body or two
lying there on the side of the road.

72
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,833
However…

73
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,375
We haven't seen any dead bodies
that were killed in battle.

74
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,791
Exactly.

75
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:11,083
You know that the Kodoku
are monitoring the participants?

76
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,416
Well, they won't follow us inside.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,291
But the Kodoku are watching us.

78
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,833
So they're the ones
who dispose of the dead bodies?

79
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,791
Yes. They must be taking them somewhere.

80
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,625
Which means?

81
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,375
They have manpower and hiding spots

82
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,041
to dispose of bodies across different
locations without getting caught.

83
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
Excellent answer.

84
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,333
If we can find
where the dead bodies are taken,

85
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,041
maybe we can figure out
who is behind this game.

86
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:47,041
So? I'm quite a strategist, right?

87
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,416
So? Where do we start?

88
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,291
First, we hunt for a candidate
to hand over to the police.

89
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,875
Why would the zaibatsu
procure over 100 rifles

90
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,958
and make the shizoku kill each other?

91
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,791
Since the Meiji era started,

92
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,333
they've made a fortune
through government work.

93
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,666
What do they possibly gain
from doing something like this?

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,833
Using money as bait
to force the shizoku to kill each other…

95
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,916
Couldn't it be that their slaughter
is the very goal itself?

96
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,708
A grudge against the shizoku.

97
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:05,125
They have long been tormented
by the shizoku's unreasonable extortion.

98
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,625
According to the zaibatsu,

99
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:12,625
the four in question
have been on leave since a week ago.

100
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,583
No one knows their whereabouts,
and they're not at their homes.

101
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,041
Find them immediately.

102
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:19,958
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,708
Lord Okubo, if I may,

104
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:25,916
taking action against the zaibatsu
could affect our nation's economy--

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,166
Shinpei.

106
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,541
If they're the ones
pulling the strings behind this,

107
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,500
it will be considered high treason.

108
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,250
We must deal with this at once.

109
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,958
-Kawaji.
-Yes, sir?

110
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,125
I want you to bring them here.

111
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,875
I will locate their whereabouts
as soon as possible.

112
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,250
-I'll start analyzing the telegrams.
-Yes.

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,916
KUWANA-JUKU

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,250
Come, come!

115
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,375
Grilled clams, Kuwana's specialty!

116
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,541
Come and get your grilled clams!

117
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:09,708
We've got horse mackerels, clams,
bigfin reef squid, and delicious sake too!

118
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,708
You must be tired from traveling.

119
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,833
Would you like to take a short break here?

120
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,458
Thank you very much.

121
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,541
Customers coming in!

122
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,416
Welcome! A group of four coming in!

123
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,291
Please go ahead!
We have a table in the back!

124
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,916
Miss, fetch us some tea and skewers.

125
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,833
Tea and four plates of skewers!

126
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,958
Okay, one bowl of mixed rice!

127
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,958
One flying squid!

128
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,916
Look at that guy.

129
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,458
He's not even hiding his wooden tag.
That's some confidence.

130
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,750
They're participants too.

131
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,916
I saw them at Tenryuji Temple.

132
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,875
Which one should we go for?

133
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,625
Don't mess me around!

134
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,541
I'm sorry!

135
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,291
Useless, clumsy idiot!

136
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,416
I'm really sorry! I'm sorry!

137
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,791
Shut it!

138
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:21,958
I'm sorry…

139
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,916
Let's go with whoever leaves first.

140
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,041
That won't be necessary.

141
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,291
Who are you?

142
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,875
So there was one more than I thought.

143
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,416
"One more"? Hmm?

144
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
What exactly do you mean?

145
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,333
Huh?

146
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,916
Most participants pass by this teahouse.

147
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:12,416
So I took the liberty of setting a trap.

148
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,666
Isn't it a violation of the rules to
tell non-participants about this?

149
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,833
It's not a violation if I hire them
without giving them the details.

150
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,583
So much for a strategist.

151
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,250
This is nothing.

152
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,708
As for the girls…

153
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,666
Do as you please with them.

154
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,416
Okay, carry on.

155
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,958
YOKKAICHI-JUKU

156
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,750
Yokkaichi's known for Banko ceramics!

157
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,291
Come take a look!

158
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,250
Lower-intermediate.

159
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,833
A beginner.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,625
Pre-intermediate.

161
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:39,791
Hey, you.

162
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,958
You're a participant, aren't you?

163
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,166
Have you seen a guy with a girl in tow?

164
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,625
No.

165
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,083
Goddammit.

166
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,291
After years of waiting,
this is what I get?

167
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,625
A bow, huh?

168
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,958
What's fun about shooting arrows
here and there from so far away?

169
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,791
It's no different from a gun.

170
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,750
This tool is used
to make offerings to the gods.

171
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,583
It does not compare.

172
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,791
To hell with the gods.

173
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,041
What a joke.

174
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,125
My dear!

175
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh no! Open your eyes, please!

176
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,708
You monster… Please! Wake up…

177
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:02,958
If gods were real…
the world would be different.

178
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:21,583
Good.

179
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,416
Let's play.

180
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,083
Die, you bastard!

181
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
Girls! Go for the girls!

182
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,708
If you take their wooden tags,
I'll triple the pay!

183
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,458
Move!

184
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,125
Look who's caught now?

185
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,333
What the hell's going on?

186
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,833
This isn't what we were told!

187
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,625
You can't leave. I'm paying you!

188
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,708
Hey!

189
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,875
Go! Hurry the hell up!

190
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,958
Come on, go!

191
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,000
Die!

192
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,916
Someone! Go get the police!

193
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,500
Out of the way!

194
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,750
It's an offering to the gods.

195
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,791
That's enough.

196
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,375
Do I know you from somewhere?

197
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,666
The police are on their way here.

198
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,708
Yeah?

199
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,208
So what?

200
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,208
Those on the organizer's side
have high expectations for you two.

201
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,375
Having you eliminated will spoil the game.

202
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,541
You think I'll get caught?

203
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,583
I can go ahead and cut you down here.

204
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,583
Be my guest.

205
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,750
If you think you can win
against this many rifles.

206
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,916
I've lost interest.

207
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,291
The times have changed.

208
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,333
There's no place left
for the samurai to live.

209
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:10,500
You went through hell
after the war, didn't you?

210
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,916
Bukotsu Kanjiya?

211
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,125
It's none of your damn business.

212
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,583
All right, then. Which one is it gonna be?

213
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you going to make us do?

214
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:02,250
We're going to give one of you
to the police with your wooden tag.

215
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,666
What?

216
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,125
What? Wait a second…

217
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,791
If you do that--

218
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,083
Kodoku will kill you,
or the police will protect you.

219
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,416
One or the other.

220
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:14,791
What?

221
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,916
And the one who isn't given to the police?

222
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,333
We grab his wooden tag,
and he drops out right here.

223
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,791
Hand me over to the police!

224
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,000
I-I'll go!

225
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,083
What?

226
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,083
I'm the one who's going.
You keep your mouth shut!

227
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,166
Well, I'm afraid you're
dropping out here, young man.

228
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:43,000
Please. I'll do anything!

229
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:46,500
Just accept it.
You've killed plenty already too.

230
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,375
I haven't killed anyone at all!

231
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,541
Even at Tenryuji Temple,
I just picked up a tag someone dropped.

232
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,083
I'm sure… No lies, please.

233
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm not lying!

234
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,708
This man threatened me.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,041
He told me he'd at least keep me alive.

236
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,625
Stop lying!

237
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,750
I come from a poor family.

238
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,500
I joined because I wanted
to help my father's business.

239
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,000
But then…

240
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,416
It was a killing game…

241
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,458
and I just couldn't do it.

242
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm begging you.

243
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,791
Please… Please spare my life!

244
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,333
You heard what he said.

245
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,541
I guess you win.

246
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,375
But you're gonna
lend me a hand in return, okay?

247
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,333
Thank you.

248
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,625
Thank you!

249
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,750
What?

250
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,583
Wait a minute.

251
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:17,750
I can help you out too--

252
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,000
Shujiro, you guys go and check
where the dead bodies are being taken.

253
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:21,916
Okay.

254
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,166
Oh, and you, Iroha.

255
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,833
Here.

256
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:28,875
What's this?

257
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,291
It's a smoke ball.

258
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,333
I don't need this.

259
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
Just keep it with you.

260
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,375
I'll call the police here.

261
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:41,333
Use the commotion
to shake off the Kodoku watchers first.

262
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,958
All right!

263
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,875
Let's get this mission underway.

264
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,875
Come in.

265
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,125
The analysis results came out.

266
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:04,291
Just as you suspected,
they're communicating by telegram.

267
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,875
DOMESTIC TELEGRAM RECORD

268
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,291
Since May 5th, the day of
the reported incident at Tenryuji Temple,

269
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,375
telegram correspondence
has drastically increased.

270
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,375
NUMBER OF TELEGRAMS
MAY 5TH: 156

271
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,541
What else?

272
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,625
We can't figure out the content

273
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,083
since they're corresponding in code.

274
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,166
However,

275
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,083
we did find out
where these telegrams originated.

276
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,125
Where?

277
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,250
-Show him the map.
-Yes, sir.

278
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:42,041
The southern foot of Mount Fuji.

279
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,791
The map suggests there's nothing there.

280
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,291
MOUNT FUJI
SHIZUOKA TELEGRAPH OFFICE

281
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,083
The zaibatsu's stronghold.

282
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,291
Kawaji. Head there immediately.

283
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,333
"Clash between shizoku
in Yokkaichi City on Tokaido Road…"

284
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,458
Gentlemen.

285
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:27,291
What is it?

286
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,541
The government is taking action.

287
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,458
What?

288
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,416
I wouldn't worry about it.

289
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,916
There is no way they can reach us here.

290
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:42,750
We have a guardian angel
on our side, after all.

291
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,250
Oh, yes. You're right about that.

292
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,208
Well said.

293
00:23:57,708 --> 00:24:00,375
Thank you for earlier.

294
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:07,458
How old were you
when you started training, Iroha?

295
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,583
All of the Kyohachi-ryu
were abandoned as children.

296
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,750
We don't know our real ages.

297
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,208
Were there any other girls?

298
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,791
No.

299
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,083
I was young

300
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,958
and the weakest of them all.

301
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,750
You were the weakest?

302
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,583
It was a long time ago.

303
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:50,666
What should I do to be as strong as you?

304
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,250
You don't have to…

305
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,250
and there's no need.

306
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,291
No matter how skilled
you get at using a sword…

307
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,375
it won't bring you happiness.

308
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:20,333
He's here.

309
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,541
Ow! That hurts.

310
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,416
No need to be so rough!

311
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,708
H-Hello, sir.

312
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,083
He's the suspect for the teahouse murders.

313
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,125
You've got it wrong.

314
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,833
We'll hold him in jail.

315
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:46,750
Yes, sir.

316
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,375
-Let's go!
-Ow, ow!

317
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,916
I can't wait to see what happens.

318
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,375
-No!
-Silence!

319
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,500
POLICE BRANCH OFFICE

320
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:11,458
You stay quiet in here.
We'll interrogate you later.

321
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:12,583
Hey! Wait.

322
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,708
Please.

323
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,083
What about a guard?

324
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:20,875
Shouldn't you have one?

325
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:24,291
What? You're scared of ghosts?

326
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,041
That's not it.

327
00:26:28,625 --> 00:26:30,916
Hey, wait! Wait!

328
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Wait! Don't leave me alone!

329
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,916
Let's go.

330
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:26,875
108

331
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:38,416
We're from the Police Bureau.
Your chief knows we're coming.

332
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,958
Seems like they took the bait.

333
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:46,333
-Huh?
-What's your name, young man?

334
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,708
I'm Shinnosuke Sayama.

335
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,916
Shinnosuke, hold these for me.

336
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,041
Huh?

337
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:54,708
Wait!

338
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:04,375
The time is 2:17 p.m.
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

339
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,416
We're here to examine the suspect
who was just detained.

340
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,041
Sir, he's in the detention cell
in the basement.

341
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,333
Let me show you the way.

342
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,541
Hello, sir.

343
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,583
Hello.

344
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,458
I'll join them for the examination.

345
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:48,875
Yes, sir.

346
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,833
Isn't this place…

347
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:14,333
At 2:17 p.m. by Kuwana-juku,
number 108, Shujiro Saga was eliminated.

A bank.

355
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,166
That guy…

356
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,833
Are you here to interrogate me?

357
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:16,041
Listen to me.

358
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:20,583
I didn't kill anybody.
I can explain everything.

359
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,958
Some crazy people
ordered us to kill each other.

360
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,000
They threatened to kill us if we escaped.

361
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,708
Put me under police protection.

362
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,291
Please. Keep the Kodoku away from me…

363
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,625
What's going on?

364
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:42,750
Wait! No, wait--

365
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,666
So 108's body is in here?

366
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,666
Yes, sir.

367
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,916
Seems that a rat has slipped inside.

368
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,291
Who's there?

369
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,291
I'm Takayama
of the Police Bureau's Fourth Division.

370
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,291
I don't recall any subordinates
with that name.

371
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,583
Oh, you're from the Police Bureau too…

372
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,125
You're not fooling anyone.

373
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,375
Kyojin Tsuge.

374
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,708
Do you really think you can escape?

375
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,500
Come now.

376
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,916
Don't waste time and show yourself.

377
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,583
Kokushu Saga.

378
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,500
Hanjiro Nakamura.

379
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,416
Please, call me Sakura now.

380
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,083
I saw how Ando was cut down
at Tenryuji Temple.

381
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,125
I suspected it was you.

382
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,083
I've been secretly rooting for you.

383
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,500
I thought you died that day.

384
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:42,833
Life is unpredictable, isn't it?

385
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,083
I…

386
00:37:48,458 --> 00:37:50,666
I have always looked up to you.

387
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,083
Just tell me one thing.

388
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,625
What is it that you are trying to achieve?

389
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:02,916
I cannot answer that.

390
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:10,708
When two old friends reunite,
they either share drinks together…

391
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,750
or they kill each other.

392
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,375
It's one or the other.

393
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:36,375
Our analysis shows that the location
they were sending the coded telegrams to

394
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,500
was the Nihonbashi Telegraph Office.

395
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,250
So we tracked the individual
who picked up the telegrams…

396
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,541
and found out where they went.

397
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,541
Where?

398
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,708
The final destination…

399
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,958
was the Home Ministry's Police Bureau.

400
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,666
Gentlemen.
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

401
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,875
We've been waiting for you, sir.

402
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,208
It took you rather long, Organizer.

403
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,291
Indeed.

404
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,291
Home Minister.

405
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,916
I cannot be sure if I should say this…

406
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,083
What is it?

407
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,791
Can we really trust Kawaji?

408
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,166
Once again, I would like to thank you all
for agreeing to this game.

409
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,625
It's all for the good of this country.

410
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:21,416
If it's money you need, don't hesitate.

411
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,041
Thank you very much.

412
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:30,291
Eradicating the specters
is a huge project for our nation.

413
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:33,208
A great cause
that we cannot afford to fail.

414
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:40,000
Let us be the ones
to fulfill this duty, shall we?

415
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:00,958
For the future of this country.

416
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:26,583
70 REMAINING

417
