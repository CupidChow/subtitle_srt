1
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:17,791
950 YEARS HAVE PASSED
SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST SAMURAI

2
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:25,541
WITH ONE BATTLE,
THEY VANISHED FROM HISTORY

3
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,166
Charge!

4
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Charge!

5
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,875
It's over!

6
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,791
Raise the cry of victory!

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,583
Send up the smoke signal!

8
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,541
What was that?

9
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,000
What's happening?

10
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,041
Enough! It's over!

11
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:29,583
It's already over! Cease fire!

12
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,291
Stop…

13
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,666
Enough!

14
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:00,416
Stop!

15
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,833
Shino.

16
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,541
-Let me take over.
-I didn't mean to wake you.

17
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,041
Toya, get me a hand towel.

18
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,041
Okay.

19
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,208
Here.

20
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,750
Father…

21
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,708
It hurts.

22
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:08,916
Rin.

23
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,500
It's going to be okay.
You'll feel better soon.

24
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm sorry. I tried not to catch it.

25
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,875
Don't blame yourself.

26
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:27,666
Thank you.

27
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,166
FUCHU, KANAGAWA

28
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,666
Enough! It's over!

29
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,541
It's already over! Cease fire!

30
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,041
Ten years since the Boshin War.

31
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:04,125
Under the new government's modernization
policies, samurai became "Shizoku,"

32
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,833
stripping them
of their privileges and employment.

33
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:14,916
Meanwhile, lives were devastated
by a widespread outbreak of Cholera.

34
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,625
Mama!

35
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:35,958
Mr. Saga.

36
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,916
You keep bringing me worthless things.
What am I supposed to do with them?

37
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,500
Forgive me, but please--

38
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,083
Don't do this to me.

39
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,166
It's already been two years
since the Sword Abolishment Edict.

40
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,958
You know the days
of the sword are long gone.

41
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,333
Mr. Saga, don't make this more difficult.

42
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,666
I'll take any price.

43
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,333
Once the cholera passes,
I'll repay your kindness. I swear it.

44
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,000
So please, I'm begging you.

45
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,625
Shino and Rin…

46
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,166
Is it really that bad?

47
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,458
Go and fetch some sugar and salt for him.

48
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,791
Of course.

49
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,791
I don't need your sword.

50
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,833
Take it back with you.

51
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,500
Thank you.

52
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,666
What a time we're living in.

53
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,625
How did things end up like this?

54
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,291
It wasn't there yesterday.

55
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,500
PAWN SHOP

56
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,791
It says it's in Kyoto.

57
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,375
"The opportunity to win 100,000 yen."

58
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,541
-A hundred thousand yen?
-What nonsense.

59
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,125
Can it be real?

60
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,666
No way a martial arts tournament
would pay 100,000 yen.

61
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,166
Still, 100,000 yen? That's…

62
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,916
Enough for ten generations
to live in luxury.

63
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,250
A martial arts tournament, huh?

64
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,500
-Hey, gimme one.
-Me too.

65
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,208
PARTICIPANTS WANTED
ASSEMBLE AT TENRYUJI TEMPLE IN KYOTO

66
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,458
"Those who excel in the martial arts."

67
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,708
"Tenryuji Temple."

68
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:37,166
"A hundred thousand yen."

69
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,500
This is no ordinary
martial arts tournament.

70
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,416
I wonder.

71
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,833
Hey!

72
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,916
What's going on?

73
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,625
What's the problem?

74
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,875
-Nothing to see here.
-Hey, what is this?

75
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,625
Can we really win 100,000 yen?

76
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,625
How does it work?

77
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,125
-No concern of yours.
-Hand it over.

78
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,000
You're just as guilty for taking it!

79
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,208
Rin!

80
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,250
Rin!

81
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,833
Rin!

82
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,375
-Rin!
-Rin!

83
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,458
Rin!

84
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,958
Rin!

85
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,208
Father…

86
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,791
I couldn't protect Mother and Toya.

87
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,125
I'm sorry.

88
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,083
Rin!

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,041
Rin!

90
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,333
Rin…

91
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,125
Rin…

92
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,333
Forgive me.

93
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:41,750
ASSEMBLE AT TENRYUJI TEMPLE IN KYOTO
AT MIDNIGHT ON MAY 5TH

94
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,458
Shujiro?

95
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,458
Shino.

96
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,541
I'm sorry, but I'll be gone for a while.

97
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,375
I've found a job
that could bring in some money.

98
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,708
With this money, I can save you
and everyone in the village.

99
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,083
Will you draw your sword again?

100
00:13:58,541 --> 00:13:59,833
I wouldn't do that.

101
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,500
Don't worry.

102
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,083
Please stay safe.

103
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,666
I promise I'll return.

104
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,583
I know.

105
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,000
KYOTO

106
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,791
Yes, come in!

107
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,791
Flowers for sale!

108
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,208
Flowers for sale!

109
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,666
-Flowers for sale!
-Get them while they last!

110
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,541
That thing in the newspaper is tonight?

111
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,041
Yeah. I heard it's part
of a government sword hunt.

112
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,083
What is it? Can we go see?

113
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,791
It's not safe. Don't you go near
Tenryuji Temple today.

114
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,125
Why not?

115
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,041
Welcome.

116
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:08,958
Come in.

117
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,916
Sir Saga?

118
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,250
Yahei, it's been a long time.

119
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,291
A long time, indeed.

120
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,750
I don't suppose…

121
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,083
You too?

122
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,708
Are there others like me?

123
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:28,750
Yes.

124
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,750
We've had a few guests of a similar sort.

125
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,541
Do you know anything?

126
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,500
Survivors of the old shogunate forces

127
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:47,125
are gathering comrades, seeking revenge.

128
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,875
But they're just rumors.
I can't be certain.

129
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,958
I see.

130
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,041
Mr. Saga… May I?

131
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,458
Come in.

132
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,750
You're going, then?

133
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,333
Yes.

134
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:44,750
Kyoto somehow feels different tonight.

135
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,333
Just like in those days,

136
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,916
there's a stench of blood in the air.

137
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,041
Please be careful.

138
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:15,125
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

139
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,041
Someone's here.

140
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,583
Are you here to participate?

141
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,958
Open the gate.

142
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,250
You may enter.

143
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,125
Man, this is a mess.

144
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,500
They're blinded by fortune.

145
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,625
They might start fighting
before this thing even starts.

146
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,791
Oh, forgive me.

147
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,083
I talk too much when I get nervous.

148
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:52,583
I'm a former samurai of the Kaga domain.
Kouemon Tachikawa.

149
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,458
The Kaga domain?

150
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,375
The newspaper made it
all the way to Kanazawa?

151
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:01,541
I asked around about that today.

152
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:06,083
Seems it was distributed countrywide,
from Hokkaido to Ryukyu.

153
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,875
To go to so much effort…

154
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,250
Perhaps there's some truth
to the 100,000 yen after all.

155
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:11,250
It is time.

156
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,625
We shall now begin.

157
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:20,416
First of all, thank you all
for assembling here today.

158
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:24,625
My name is Enju.

159
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,250
You are about to compete--

160
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,833
or rather, play a game,

161
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,666
that will challenge
your mind, skill, and body.

162
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,666
Of course,

163
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,458
you may doubt the promise
of great wealth from a game.

164
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:49,583
You may question if such a sum
as large as 100,000 yen truly exists.

165
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,666
What's that jar?

166
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,250
With this much gold,
you could live in luxury for a decade.

167
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,708
But the amount you will win

168
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,666
far surpasses this.

169
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,833
The question is,
how do you obtain such a sum?

170
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,125
But wait.

171
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,791
The thing is,

172
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,625
once you hear the means,

173
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,958
you cannot withdraw from the game
under any circumstances.

174
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,208
What do you mean?

175
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,458
Now, I'm going to count down from 30.

176
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,750
If you no longer wish to participate,

177
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,791
please leave before I finish counting.

178
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,833
Thirty.

179
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:08,750
Twenty-nine.

180
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:10,791
Twenty-eight.

181
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:12,875
Twenty-seven.

182
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,583
-I'm not quitting now!
-Twenty-six.

183
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,250
Twenty-five.

184
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,250
That's enough.

185
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,875
Stay where you are.

186
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,458
I'm Ando from the
Kyoto Prefectural Police, Division Four.

187
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,083
An-Jin the Rushing Gust.

188
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,750
The Fourth Division?

189
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:50,541
But since you're standing here,
you are a participant as well.

190
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:53,000
Seems you don't know who I am.

191
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,541
Of course I know you,
An-Jin the Rushing Gust.

192
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,666
Had you been born earlier,

193
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,541
the manslayers and Shinsengumi
wouldn't have stood a chance.

194
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,333
Or so you boldly claim.

195
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:05,000
It's the truth.

196
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,416
I'm arresting you for violating
the Sword Abolishment Edict.

197
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,166
Don't be so serious. It's just a game.

198
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,166
Who's the organizer? Where are they?

199
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,208
No idea.

200
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:20,333
Put your hands out. Or I'll cut you down.

201
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:25,916
So, you won't be participating?

202
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,208
Well, that's too bad.

203
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:32,791
Cut the crap.

204
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:58,916
My apologies for the interruption.

205
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:05,166
I shall resume counting.

206
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,416
Twenty-four.

207
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,000
Twenty-three.

208
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:15,750
Twenty-two.

209
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,666
-I'm not turning back now.
-Twenty-one.

210
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,291
-This is bad.
-Twenty.

211
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:21,583
Nineteen.

212
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,500
-Are you going to stay?
-Eighteen.

213
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,125
-I can't do this!
-Seventeen.

214
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,125
-Don't give up now!
-Sixteen.

215
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,958
-I'm going to play!
-Fifteen.

216
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,041
Me too!

217
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,458
-Fourteen.
-If I give up now and go home…

218
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,166
-Thirteen.
-It's for the money!

219
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,166
Twelve.

220
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,375
Eleven.

221
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:38,958
Ten.

222
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,291
Nine.

223
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,291
Eight.

224
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,291
Seven.

225
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,583
Six.

226
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,666
Five.

227
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:49,416
Four.

228
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,541
Three, two, one.

229
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,625
Excellent.

230
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,625
Your courage is truly admirable.

231
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:30,250
MAP OF TOKAIDO ROAD
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

232
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:34,500
The game you are
about to participate in is called

233
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,250
"Kodoku."

234
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,500
And every game comes with rules.

235
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,750
Write your name on this.

236
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,291
Your name, please.

237
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:47,083
I shall now explain the rules in detail.

238
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,750
Wear this around your neck.

239
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,666
Rule one.

240
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,333
Your destination is Tokyo.

241
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:58,291
Rule two.

242
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:01,000
This is Tenryuji Temple's main gate.

243
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:03,000
Seki, Ise Province.

244
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,375
Chiryu, Mikawa Province.

245
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,583
Hamamatsu, Totoumi Province.

246
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,750
Shimada, Suruga Province.

247
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,875
Hakone, Sagami Province.

248
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,958
Shinagawa, Musashi Province.

249
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,791
You must pass through
all seven checkpoints.

250
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:19,958
Write your name.

251
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:21,416
Wear the wooden tag.

252
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,291
Rule three.

253
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,083
If you do not have enough points,

254
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,666
you cannot proceed to the next town.

255
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,791
Wear this around your neck.

256
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:32,958
Rule four.

257
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,083
You must not speak
of this game to anyone.

258
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,166
Rule five.

259
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,083
You must arrive in Tokyo

260
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,458
no later than June 5th,
one month from today.

261
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,208
Rule six.

262
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:50,291
Withdrawing from the game is forbidden.

263
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:56,083
If your wooden tag is removed
from your neck for ten counts,

264
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,250
it will be considered a withdrawal.

265
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,958
Rule seven.

266
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,291
Anyone who breaks the rules--

267
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:09,750
Get me outta here!

268
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,958
Ten.

269
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:16,625
Nine.

270
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:17,541
Eight.

271
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,875
Seven.

272
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,000
Six.

273
00:29:21,083 --> 00:29:21,958
Five.

274
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,291
-Four.
-Open the gate!

275
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,708
Three.

276
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:26,791
Two.

277
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,666
One.

278
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:49,791
Rule seven.

279
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,666
Anyone who breaks the rules
will be punished accordingly.

280
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,791
This is madness.

281
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,708
Nobody said anything about getting killed!

282
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,208
Silence!

283
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,208
Did I not confirm
your intent to participate?

284
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,041
You all chose to join this game
of your own free will.

285
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,750
For 100,000 yen.

286
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:57,416
Once again, 292 people
have gathered here today.

287
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,791
Each of you has been given a wooden tag
that is worth one point.

288
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,083
Which means each of you
already has one point.

289
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:09,708
To pass through Tenryuji Temple,
you need at least two points.

290
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:17,291
And you'll need thirty points
at the final checkpoint, Tokyo.

291
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,833
So, how do you earn points?

292
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,375
Seems some of you already understand.

293
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:34,166
This can't be real. Is he serious?

294
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:41,583
You may use any means necessary.

295
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,416
A fight for the wooden tags.

296
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:04,916
I see many among you who survived
the age of turmoil as samurai.

297
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,541
You are precisely the ones who deserve
the right to claim this fortune.

298
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:17,333
I ask that you demonstrate
the pride and strength of the samurai.

299
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,416
Should we team up?

300
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,458
Some of these guys
are here with their buddies.

301
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:29,333
Better than going solo, right?

302
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,583
Besides, I'm pretty good with a sword.

303
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,833
After ten counts,

304
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,250
the game will begin.

305
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,791
Why is there a child here?

306
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,375
Ten.

307
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,333
Nine.

308
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:56,458
Eight.

309
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,583
Seven.

310
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:00,875
Six.

311
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,208
Five.

312
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,416
Four.

313
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,666
Three.

314
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,083
Two.

315
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,416
One.

316
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,750
I shall be waiting for you in Tokyo.

317
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:21,958
Or rather…

318
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:32,291
In Edo, the city that vanished long ago.

319
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,791
Let the game begin!

320
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:55,791
Come on!

321
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,208
That's one point for me.

322
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,541
Die!

323
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:26,458
Hey!

324
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:37,833
Die!

325
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:49,916
Sakura.

326
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:55,458
Does it bring back memories?
Of the old days?

327
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,500
No.

328
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:12,208
Congratulations.

329
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,291
Show me your wooden tags.

330
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,583
Ukyo Kikuomi.

331
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,833
You're the first.

332
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,000
No wonder they call you
the "Guardian God of the Court Nobles."

333
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,083
What's the point of all this--

334
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:31,000
I'll be waiting for you in Tokyo.

335
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,125
Confirmed.

336
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:39,583
Well then…

337
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:41,875
Safe journey.

338
00:37:58,166 --> 00:37:59,333
Father!

339
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:12,541
I, um… Thank you, sir.

340
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,083
Do you intend to survive?

341
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,791
I want to live.

342
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,583
I want to live so I can save my mother.

343
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,791
I'll keep you safe
until we get out of here.

344
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,208
Don't leave my side.

345
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,541
I won't.

346
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:30,333
Hey, he's got a kid! Stop there!

347
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,333
Let's go.

348
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:48,500
I got one!

349
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:13,791
Over there!

350
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:26,958
It's mine!

351
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,875
Give it back!

352
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,416
-Yes!
-Give it to me!

353
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,541
-Ten.
-Give it back!

354
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,625
Nine.

355
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,041
Eight.

356
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,166
Seven.

357
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,208
Six.

358
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,583
Give it!

359
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,583
Five.

360
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,083
Four.

361
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,208
Three.

362
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,208
Two.

363
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:50,833
One.

364
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,750
120

365
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,333
Grab on.

366
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,416
That's my tag!

367
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,208
Hang on!

368
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,500
Give it!

369
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,083
Let's move.

370
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,875
So it's not you either.

371
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,083
Excuse me.

372
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,958
We have our first to make it through.

373
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,250
Number 19, Ukyo Kikuomi.

374
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:33,083
He's truly living up to the name,
"Guardian God of the Court Nobles."

375
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,750
"Former" Guardian, I believe.

376
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,250
Seems he's been through a lot.

377
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:40,083
Still, his swordsmanship is impressive.

378
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:43,291
Definitely a performance worth watching.

379
00:42:43,375 --> 00:42:45,583
Well, this is just the beginning.

380
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,416
The real entertainment is yet to come.

381
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,250
This way.

382
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,791
What is your name?

383
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,708
Futaba Katsuki. And you, sir?

384
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,541
Shujiro Saga.

385
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,375
What?

386
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,375
Now you just need to make it to the gate.

387
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,000
Wait, what about your wooden tag?

388
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,750
Now, now, calm down.

389
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,833
I've got no intention of fighting you.

390
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,958
I'm just going to pick it up.

391
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,041
Don't come slashing at me out of nowhere.

392
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,208
Here. Take it.

393
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,208
What do you want?

394
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,583
Why are you holding back?

395
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,333
"Kokushu the Manslayer."

396
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,208
Something psychological?

397
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:08,916
Insomnia. Heart pounding. Shaky hands…

398
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,958
Plenty lost their minds
after the Boshin War.

399
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,791
But if you're planning
to survive with that little miss,

400
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,583
you'd better start killing.

401
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:26,833
Well, it's up to you.

402
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:28,916
Wait.

403
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,041
Thank you.

404
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,333
Hang in there. I'm rooting for you.

405
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:47,958
254

406
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,208
We're running straight to the gate.

407
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,458
Okay.

408
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,916
You go first. Hurry!

409
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,666
Go!

410
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,083
You bastard.

411
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:49,458
Bastard!

412
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:30,833
Well done.
Please show me your wooden tags.

413
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,166
Thank you for helping me.

414
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,791
We're going to a friend's inn. Stay alert.

415
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:52,750
Confirmed.

416
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,083
Safe journey.

417
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,125
It's started to rain.

418
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,500
It certainly has.

419
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,833
Number 108, Shujiro Saga,

420
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:51,208
and number 120, Futaba Katsuki,
have made it through.

421
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,166
Shujiro Saga,
the Kokushu the Manslayer, huh?

422
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:58,916
With a child in tow.

423
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,666
Now this is getting interesting!

424
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:06,125
May I have a moment
of your time, everyone?

425
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:08,750
What is it? It was just getting good.

426
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,291
A letter from the organizer has arrived.

427
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:19,291
Allow me to read it for you.

428
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:29,750
"To all who have agreed to this Kodoku,
I extend my deepest gratitude."

429
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:36,750
"The samurai are capable
of nothing but swinging swords."

430
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:43,666
"They mistook privilege for strength."

431
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,458
"They remain blind to the truth
that the world has moved on without them."

432
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:53,250
"They live on in vain
as fools who have lost all meaning."

433
00:50:54,875 --> 00:51:00,958
"Now let us enjoy this game
and bring ruin to the ghosts

434
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:05,916
who still call themselves samurai."

435
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:19,750
Stop!

436
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:37,458
It's been a while, hasn't it, Kokushu?

437
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,416
Bukotsu Kanjiya.

438
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,291
Has it been ten years?

439
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,333
I've wanted to see you all this time.

440
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,166
I thought I would find you if I came here.

441
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:54,750
Come on…

442
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,875
Kokushu the Manslayer!

443
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:23,291
128 REMAINING
