1
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,750
Kyohachi-ryu School,
the origin of swordsmanship.

2
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:17,833
Its legend was believed
to have ended long ago.

3
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:24,916
Yet eight successors lived on,
silently immersing themselves in training.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,208
Don't screw with me!

5
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:57,833
What's wrong, Iroha?
Is that all you've got?

6
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,000
Shut up, Sansuke!

7
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,500
You win, Shikura.

8
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,416
If you were playing seriously,
it'd be a different story.

9
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,708
Another one for me.

10
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,416
Huh? You're going
for another round, Jinroku?

11
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,166
You've had, what, ten bowls?

12
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,291
Amazing.

13
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,291
By the way, I heard Satsuma
and Choshu have joined forces.

14
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,291
I wonder if the Edo shogunate
or the anti-shogunate will win.

15
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:58,125
Obviously whichever side
knows how to use us effectively.

16
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,083
-Right, Shu-nii?
-Yeah, that's right.

17
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,000
Can we join the war too?

18
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,083
That's for Master to decide.

19
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,916
I can't wait to fight.
We've trained so hard all these years.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,750
Oh, please.
Any side Sansuke joins is gonna lose.

21
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,291
Come on, Iroha. You're the one who cries
when I beat you in training.

22
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,208
What?

23
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,583
Look who's talking.

24
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,875
-You tripped earlier too, remember?
-Huh? I didn't trip.

25
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,416
I know.

26
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,333
I don't have much time left.

27
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,541
It's tomorrow.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,166
There is something I must tell you all.

29
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:21,083
You have endured harsh training together
for nearly ten years.

30
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,416
But…

31
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,416
that ends today.

32
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:37,583
The Kyohachi-ryu School shall be
passed down to a single successor.

33
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,208
Only one person can inherit it.

34
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,916
You must kill each other.

35
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:56,125
You will begin tomorrow
when the sun reaches due south.

36
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,166
You must forget that you are siblings.

37
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,583
No one is allowed to flee.

38
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,041
This is our fate.

39
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,875
We all knew it would come to this.

40
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:26,708
Listen,

41
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,458
why don't we leave the mountain?

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,208
We could live somewhere secluded,
where Master won't find us.

43
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,000
-As long as we're together--
-No.

44
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,416
Gentosai will come after us.

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,583
Master was just trying to scare us.

46
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,625
No, he's out there.

47
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:44,833
I once saw him talking with Master.

48
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,958
That man… is a monster.

49
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,375
Ever since we mastered
the art of the Kyohachi-ryu School,

50
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,791
we have known this day would come.

51
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:58,708
This…

52
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:02,083
is our fate.

53
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,583
Yes.

54
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,083
We have no choice.

55
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,375
Shu-nii…

56
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,666
What should we do?

57
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,083
Well, well…

58
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,125
So, how many casualties on our side?

59
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,541
We lost 15.

60
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,750
Kokushu the Manslayer
is absolutely insane.

61
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,125
What did the organizer say?

62
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:31,500
The rules do not explicitly forbid
killing our troops, so the game continues.

63
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,916
How unexpected.

64
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,250
Shujiro Saga has already been informed.

65
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,708
A total of 192 participants
have been eliminated.

66
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,041
Also, number 19, Ukyo Kikuomi,
the first to leave Tenryuji Temple,

67
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,041
has been eliminated.

68
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,416
What a shame.

69
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,208
Reportedly, he lost in a duel
against Bukotsu Kanjiya.

70
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:59,416
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher.
He looks like another promising player.

71
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,875
Gentlemen, if you're ready,
shall we begin?

72
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,625
Of course. That's what
we're all here to enjoy, isn't it?

73
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,375
Now then, allow me to explain
the betting process once more.

74
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,625
What you'll be predicting is

75
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,250
which participant will be the first
to pass through the next post station.

76
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,791
Our opening bet is on
the first participant to pass Seki-juku,

77
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,208
after crossing the Suzuka Pass.

78
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,541
Place your bets, everyone.

79
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,541
My bet's on number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya.

80
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,500
The Suzuka Pass is no easy path.

81
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,833
You won't get through a fight this fierce
without his level of skill.

82
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,916
Number 200, Naoto Yoshida.
Number 201, Shoji Yoshida.

83
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,750
Oh, yes…

84
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,083
The spear twins.

85
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,041
Mr. Sakakibara likes to be unconventional.

86
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,583
Their spear work
at Tenryuji Temple was exceptional.

87
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,041
A solid bet, I'd say.

88
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,458
Number 33, Kyojin Tsuge.

89
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,875
Oh? As for me,

90
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,333
I'll go with number 108, Shujiro Saga.

91
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,083
All bets are now on the table.

92
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,708
Let us proceed with the first round.

93
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,708
Please enjoy to your heart's content.

94
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,541
SUZUKA PASS, MIE

95
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
The mountain pass begins here.

96
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,958
You won't get to Seki-juku
without crossing it.

97
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,500
There will be a lot of participants here.
Stay close.

98
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,375
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,875
What's the matter?

100
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,791
"Kokushu the Manslayer,"
a man who knew only how to kill.

101
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,625
What has your life been like, Shujiro?

102
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,875
I…

103
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,291
I grew up in the mountains
with my siblings.

104
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,208
Siblings?

105
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:33,125
We were all orphans taken in by Master.
We shared no blood ties.

106
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,666
And there,

107
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:40,666
we learned nothing but how to kill.

108
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,666
Did you live there all your life?

109
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,416
No. After that, I cut down men in Kyoto
as a bodyguard for the Satsuma domain.

110
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:58,375
I kept killing through the war,
and before I knew it…

111
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,166
they were calling me
Kokushu the Manslayer.

112
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,916
Stay alert.

113
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,583
You survived Tenryuji Temple?

114
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,250
You? You're with a child
and can't even draw your sword.

115
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,875
Naoto!

116
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,833
Futaba, run!

117
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,583
Futaba!

118
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,750
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

119
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,625
Is this…

120
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,833
Someone's nearby.

121
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,000
I've been waiting
a long time for you, Shujiro Saga.

122
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,458
Iroha!

123
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,750
Stop! I won't fight my little sister!

124
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,375
Save your words!

125
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:52,541
Do you have any idea
what happened to us because of you?

126
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,166
Can you imagine what your own
brothers felt when you left them behind?!

127
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,250
Since I left the mountain,

128
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,666
I've lived every day as if I were dead.

129
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,166
I'm sorry.

130
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Move back!

131
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,708
Iroha!

132
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,375
Come.

133
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,416
Iroha, go in front!

134
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,375
Defend yourself. Unless you want to die.

135
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,208
Get closer!

136
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,958
Surround them! Closer!

137
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,250
-Move up!
-Closer!

138
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
No! Get back here!

139
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,458
Gojiro!

140
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,916
Stay back! Keep your distance!

141
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,416
Aim for the brat!

142
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,333
That brat! Go after her!

143
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,416
Take down the brat and the woman!

144
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,291
Who is he?

145
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,708
He's gonna kill me!

146
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,250
Sheathe your sword.

147
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,166
Why did you help us?

148
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,041
Among our people,

149
00:17:56,333 --> 00:18:00,000
taking the life of a child
is believed to be the greatest evil.

150
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:05,166
We honor those who shield children
and do not wish to fight them.

151
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,583
Why would we believe you so easily?

152
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,208
Wait…

153
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,833
Thank you.

154
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,458
May I ask your name?

155
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,666
Kamuykocha.

156
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,583
As long as that child is with you,
I will not strike.

157
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,625
Kamuykocha…

158
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,250
-He's Ainu.
-Ainu?

159
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,125
The indigenous people of Hokkaido.

160
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,208
I saw them at the Battle of Hakodate.

161
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,541
So it's true that the newspapers
made it all the way to Hokkaido.

162
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,833
We can pass through Seki-juku with these.

163
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,916
More participants
will be coming from behind.

164
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,125
We need to hurry.

165
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,666
Iroha,

166
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,291
take this one.

167
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,166
If you really want to kill me,

168
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,958
then do it in Tokyo.

169
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait.

170
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,875
I'll go with you.

171
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,916
There's still something you need to do.

172
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,666
You can't just walk away from it.

173
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,958
All right.

174
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,541
Is one enough?

175
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,541
Carrying too many is risky. Let's move.

176
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,500
Yes.

177
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,875
Come in.

178
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,750
Pardon the intrusion.

179
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,708
I'm here to report
on the investigation progress.

180
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,916
The Kyoto Prefectural Office

181
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,708
has discovered bloodstains
and dismembered human remains.

182
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,166
They reported numerous eyewitness accounts

183
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,458
of sword duels involving individuals
believed to be shizoku.

184
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,333
Furthermore, the location
of the eyewitness accounts

185
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:14,458
has been gradually shifting over time,
from Shiga to Mie.

186
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,458
You're saying the shizoku
are fighting with each other as they move?

187
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,666
Indeed.

188
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,291
And…

189
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,250
they appear to be
heading toward Tokyo from Kyoto.

190
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,000
At least that's how it looks.

191
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,041
So they're moving toward us?

192
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,791
There's more.

193
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,458
The reports say numerous gunshots
were heard at Tenryuji Temple.

194
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,666
Lord Okubo.

195
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:42,291
A large number of shizoku armed with guns
and swords are approaching Tokyo.

196
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:46,958
Which implies that discontented shizoku
are plotting a civil uprising--

197
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,166
If they were plotting a civil uprising,
they wouldn't need to cut each other down.

198
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,125
But sir…

199
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,083
I understand.

200
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,958
If ignored, it may escalate
into a national crisis.

201
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,083
Kawaji, track down the source
of the guns immediately.

202
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,708
Maejima, analyze all telegram
communications from the past month.

203
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,333
-There might be traces left behind.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,041
TENRYUJI TEMPLE

205
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,166
SEKI

206
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,083
SEKI-JUKU

207
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,958
REQUIRED POINTS: THREE

208
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,958
We're almost at the exit.

209
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,375
There should be someone here
to check our tags.

210
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,166
No need to be so wary.

211
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,458
I am Tsurubami,
in charge of overseeing your passage.

212
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,833
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

213
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,875
Now, your wooden tags, please.

214
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:02,000
Shujiro Saga, three points.

215
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,458
Futaba Katsuki, three points.

216
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,041
Iroha Kinugasa, five points.

217
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,916
You are all cleared to pass.

218
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,958
This is for you, Miss Kinugasa.

219
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,416
This red tag counts for three points.

220
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,250
In exchange, hand over three tags
other than the one around your neck.

221
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,083
Tsurubami, was it?

222
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,791
Yes.

223
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,750
What is the purpose of this game?

224
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:32,875
I cannot answer that.

225
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,333
Let me put it another way.

226
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,791
Who are you people?

227
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:39,583
I cannot answer that either.

228
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,125
That said…

229
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:49,250
I believe you and Kinugasa
are well acquainted with "Kodoku."

230
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,833
What are you implying?

231
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:56,583
Three bugs.

232
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,125
Well then, may your journey go well.

233
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,208
Gentlemen,

234
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,166
we've confirmed all participants
have passed through Seki-juku.

235
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,250
And the result?

236
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,750
The first participant to reach Seki-juku…

237
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:46,166
was number 33, Kyojin Tsuge.

238
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,250
Yes!

239
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,958
Looks like I've won this round.

240
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Darn it!

241
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,958
Well, I'll be damned.

242
00:25:58,458 --> 00:26:00,333
No surprise for a former ninja from Iga.

243
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,833
Morosawa, maybe we went a little too far
taking a long shot, huh?

244
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:06,750
It's only the first round.

245
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,833
We've got plenty
of chances left to recover.

246
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,083
I see.

247
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,916
And then there's number 277, Kamuykocha.

248
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,958
I never expected
the Ainu to join this game.

249
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,083
Well now, this is getting unpredictable.

250
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,625
Honestly, I can't be
thankful enough to the organizer

251
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,500
for providing us with so much fun.

252
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,166
Much obliged.

253
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,083
Now then, let us proceed
with the second bet.

254
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,583
Our second bet is on the first participant

255
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,500
to pass through
the next checkpoint, Chiryu-juku.

256
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,958
YOKKAICHI-JUKU

257
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,458
You must be Mr. Saga.

258
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,083
We've been expecting you. Please, come in.

259
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:22,458
I knew you'd show up.

260
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:26,833
No surprise. A seasoned warrior
like you has a sharp sense of survival.

261
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,250
Why did you choose Yokkaichi?

262
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,416
I told you I'm a strategist, remember?

263
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,458
The Suzuka Pass is no easy path.

264
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:37,541
Bringing along a girl who can't even
fight must've been a pain, huh?

265
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:42,041
I figured it must be about time
you're hoping to form an alliance.

266
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,000
What's this?

267
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:50,333
Not just the little miss, huh?
You've got quite the beauty tagging along.

268
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:53,666
-Quiet.
-Don't count on it. Kyojin here.

269
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,416
Pleased to meet you, Iroha Kinugasa.

270
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,541
How do you know my name?

271
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,791
Like I said, I'm a strategist.

272
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,291
Kyojin.

273
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,875
I do not trust you.

274
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:14,833
However…

275
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,083
I came here to improve
my chances of survival.

276
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,125
Do you know what Kodoku really means?

277
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,625
Three bugs, right?

278
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,166
Yeah.

279
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,916
This is how you write Kodoku.

280
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:45,333
A hundred insects are sealed in a jar
and made to fight to the death.

281
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,041
Only the last one left alive
becomes a god

282
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,083
and gains the power to slaughter all.

283
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,250
You know your stuff.

284
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,625
Once, Iroha and I…

285
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,041
were bugs inside that jar.

286
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,750
So this is your second time?
You two lead quite the life.

287
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:28,166
Well, anyway, if this really
is that type of Kodoku,

288
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,375
it means only one person
will survive to the end.

289
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,958
Are you prepared to kill

290
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,791
those you once fought alongside?

291
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,833
I've got someone I need to save.

292
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,916
But…

293
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,166
It doesn't mean I'm going to play
this game on their terms.

294
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:06,791
Looks like I was right
to reach out to you.

295
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:13,375
We're allies now, Kokushu Saga.

296
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,500
What's that?

297
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:23,125
It's called a handshake.
You just grab each other's hands.

298
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,458
It's a foreign greeting.

299
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:28,041
It means, "I'm not holding anything
in my hands and I trust you."

300
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,833
You too, little miss.

301
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:46,916
I'm Futaba Katsuki.

302
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,250
A pleasure.

303
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,333
What is it?

304
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,833
Making us kill each other like this…

305
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:58,958
What does the organizer really want?

306
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,208
Even offering such a huge sum of money.

307
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:06,708
Exactly. That's the real problem.

308
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,125
If we don't learn
what they're really after,

309
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:12,500
we'll end up dancing
in the palm of their hand.

310
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,291
So you've got a plan?

311
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,541
That's why I brought up
the idea of an alliance.

312
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,541
What exactly are you planning?

313
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,458
We're going to find out
what this Kodoku really is.

314
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,208
And to do that,
I want to run an experiment.

315
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,791
An experiment?

316
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,708
Well, I'll explain the details tomorrow.

317
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:41,041
Something to look forward to.

318
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:44,041
Make sure you get a good rest today, okay?

319
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:55,833
KODOKU

320
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,250
You must kill each other.

321
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:45,791
Shu-nii.

322
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:49,625
Where are you going?

323
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,166
The bathroom.

324
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,583
No…

325
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,416
Gentosai?

326
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,791
Why are you traveling with that child?

327
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:54,208
We met at Tenryuji Temple
and have been traveling together since.

328
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:55,458
That's all.

329
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,041
You really think she can survive this?

330
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,750
After leaving us behind,

331
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,708
is this some kind of atonement?

332
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:34,458
Iroha,

333
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,458
what happened after I left?

334
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:40,833
Please tell me.

335
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,833
Master…

336
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,583
He feared the techniques
of Kyohachi-ryu School might be leaked.

337
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,541
So he tried to kill us all.

338
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,166
Ikkan-nii…

339
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,500
He stood up to Master so we could escape.

340
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:14,958
Thanks to him, we were able
to get off the mountain.

341
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,416
We were scattered.

342
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:25,875
Just because I am a woman,
I wasn't allowed to hold a sword.

343
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,250
I've spent my life

344
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,250
running from Gentosai.

345
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,791
Everything that happened

346
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,750
is all because you ran away back then.

347
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,375
Please forgive me.

348
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,291
Why did you join Kodoku?

349
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,500
My wife is suffering from cholera.

350
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,166
My daughter is dead.

351
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:31,583
It's only a matter of time
before my son becomes sick too.

352
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,250
But I don't have the money for medicine.

353
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:35,333
I see.

354
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,125
So you're a father now.

355
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,458
And you, Iroha?

356
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:48,125
Why did you join Kodoku?

357
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,166
You told me I still
have something I need to do.

358
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm not sure if I want to involve you.

359
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:05,500
I need to think more.

360
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,375
Iroha.

361
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,125
I ran away back then.

362
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But I have no intention of running

363
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,375
from the suffering I caused you all.

364
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,041
And yet,

365
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,250
getting to see you again, alive…

366
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,625
is something I'm truly grateful for.

367
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,083
We need two more to pass through Chiryu.

368
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,791
I guess we should win them now,
while there are plenty around.

369
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,666
There's a ferry at Miya-juku.

370
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,083
The participants are bound to--

371
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,708
Your face.

372
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,208
What?

373
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:53,166
Maybe I was wrong.

374
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,125
What's this guy mumbling about?

375
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:49,583
Not here either…

376
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,166
Gentosai.

377
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,666
Any leads?

378
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes.

379
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:38,708
Enter.

380
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,333
-We've identified where the guns are from.
-Where?

381
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:47,833
When we looked into the records
from the smuggler we arrested recently,

382
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:52,208
we confirmed that a large shipment
was brought in from Britain to Yokohama.

383
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:01,166
The shipment contained
over a hundred Snider rifles.

384
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:07,041
Impossible. A lone smuggler couldn't
possibly afford that many rifles.

385
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:10,750
Right. It seems he had clients.

386
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:12,708
Who?

387
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,416
Mitsui.

388
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,625
Sumitomo.

389
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,208
Yasuda.

390
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,291
Mitsubishi.

391
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,833
Behind this incident…

392
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:41,083
are the four powerful zaibatsu
supporting the Meiji government.

393
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,958
95 REMAINING

394
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,750
