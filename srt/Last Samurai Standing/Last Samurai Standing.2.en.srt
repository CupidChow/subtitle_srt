1
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,416
Kotaro. Are you okay?

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,250
Can you drink some water?

3
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,625
-Miss Futaba?
-Yes?

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,083
Am I going to die?

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,916
Don't worry.

6
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,458
My mother is praying to the gods.

7
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:10,708
One, two, three, four.

8
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:15,750
One, two, three, four.

9
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,666
One, two, three, four.

10
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,541
Futaba?

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,041
What's the matter?

12
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:34,666
Mother.

13
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,333
Will cholera really ever end?

14
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,916
Father is already gone,

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,708
and the people in town keep dying.

16
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:54,000
And yet, we're still praying to the gods.

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,083
Futaba.

18
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,958
Everything that happens in this world
is arranged by the gods.

19
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:05,750
That is why all we can do is pray.

20
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,208
As long as we keep praying,

21
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,875
the gods will protect us
from any war or plague.

22
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,083
Let us have faith.

23
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,583
Shall we prepare dinner?

24
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,500
Okay.

25
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,375
Mother?

26
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:54,083
Mother!

27
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,750
Mother!

28
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,208
What's wrong, Kokushu?

29
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,291
It's not you I want!

30
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,666
Let's go!

31
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,500
Over here!

32
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,208
Go, Futaba! Go!

33
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,375
Go!

34
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,666
Draw your sword.

35
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,833
You're done babysitting, right?

36
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,458
Oh, come on.

37
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,166
Are you bullshitting me?

38
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:14,125
Have you turned into a gutless bastard,
Kokushu the Manslayer?

39
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,333
How have you been living since then?

40
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,375
Those government bastards are selfish.

41
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,625
They told us to fight and kill.

42
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:44,541
But when they no longer need us,
they tell us to abandon our swords.

43
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:49,541
That's why I'm grateful to the one
who came up with this game.

44
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
I can go back to the way I was back then.

45
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,833
We shouldn't hesitate to do so.

46
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,375
Come on.

47
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
Draw your sword!

48
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,958
Much better.

49
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,625
There's Kokushu the Manslayer.

50
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,583
What's wrong, Kokushu?

51
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,458
That's better.

52
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,833
What the hell are you doing?

53
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,583
Shujiro!

54
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,750
We're not done yet!

55
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,291
Sir Saga, what happened to you?

56
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,666
Come, get inside.

57
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,583
Please rest.

58
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,333
Thank you for helping us.

59
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,583
Not at all. Let me know whatever you need.

60
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:17,875
What you have done for me
is much more than I could ever repay.

61
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,500
That was a long time ago.

62
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,250
Well, then. I'll excuse myself.

63
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,666
Still sharp.

64
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,166
You saved me back there.

65
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:53,791
Thank you.

66
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,541
Thank you for saving me as well.

67
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,583
I'll take you as far as
the Tokaido Road in the morning.

68
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,375
You take your wooden tag off and run.

69
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,875
It's against the rules.

70
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,333
Your life is more important than rules.

71
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,375
I won't stop.

72
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,750
Don't you get it?

73
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,875
A child cannot survive.

74
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,500
But I can't afford to run away.

75
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:31,625
If I run, there are lives I cannot save.

76
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,625
Cholera?

77
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,625
Who's there?

78
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,583
Calm down.
I have no intention of fighting you.

79
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,708
Why are you here?

80
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,333
Why don't we talk face-to-face?

81
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,875
I'll enter with my hands up,
so don't start slashing at me, okay?

82
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,375
Did you miss me?

83
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,333
What do you want?

84
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,166
Put your sword down first, will you?

85
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,125
If I wanted to kill you,
I wouldn't come through the front.

86
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,333
Come on. You too, miss.

87
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,625
You're so stubborn, Kokushu the Manslayer.

88
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
How do you know that name?

89
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:41,041
Never mind how I know.

90
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,708
What's more important
is why I came here, isn't it?

91
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:51,666
You see, I'm here with
an incredibly good deal for you today.

92
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,625
What is it?

93
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,583
I want you to form an alliance with me.

94
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,125
An alliance?

95
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,750
What's your intention?

96
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,708
Don't you think this "Kodoku" game
seems rather suspicious?

97
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,875
What do they gain by making
skilled fighters kill each other?

98
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,583
Why do they make us travel to Tokyo?

99
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,708
Do they really intend
to reward someone with 100,000 yen?

100
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,250
Who is behind it all?

101
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,041
I'm sure you are curious too.

102
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,333
The other participants
said that the government officials

103
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,916
might be using it as a way
to seize the swords.

104
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,708
If that was all,
they could have killed us at the temple.

105
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,875
They wouldn't need
to bother with all this.

106
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,708
That's true.

107
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,625
I heard that the survivors
of the old shogunate forces

108
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,708
are gathering skilled warriors
for revenge.

109
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,083
There's also a rumor that foreigners

110
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,000
are trying to incite a civil war
to crush Japan.

111
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,666
But none of these rumors
have been verified.

112
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,583
We don't know
what the organizer is scheming.

113
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,708
Or what they'll be launching
at us going forward.

114
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,916
What we do know

115
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,125
is that whoever's pulling the strings
has serious power.

116
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,791
That's why joining forces

117
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,833
would enable us
to gather more information.

118
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,375
If we can find out who they are,

119
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,041
we'll get closer to the 100,000 yen.

120
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:41,291
So? Feel a little more like listening now?

121
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,083
Will this mess be taken care of?
I hope there's no problem.

122
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,791
It'll be back to normal by morning.
No one will notice anything.

123
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,916
And? How many are there remaining?

124
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:01,416
One hundred and twenty-eight participants
have passed through the gate.

125
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,750
That's more than I had estimated.

126
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,916
True to form, the samurai
are stubborn to the last breath.

127
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,250
Still, the stench of blood
is overwhelming, don't you think?

128
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,416
The organizer will join you all later.

129
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:22,208
Until then, please relax
and enjoy the estate at your leisure.

130
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,583
After leaving Tenryuji Temple,

131
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:38,041
we pass through Seki in Ise Province,
Chiryu, Hamamatsu, Shimada,

132
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,083
Hakone, and Shinagawa.

133
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,708
I calculated the number
of wooden tags needed to pass

134
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,416
against the number of participants.

135
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:49,666
There are 292 participants.

136
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,958
And the number of tags required

137
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,000
to pass the final checkpoint,
Shinagawa, is 30.

138
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,708
Which means?

139
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,666
It's possible for more than one person
to reach Tokyo.

140
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,833
That's right.

141
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,208
A maximum of nine people can reach Tokyo.

142
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,958
The 100,000 yen may be divided
among those nine people,

143
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,166
or perhaps they will be
ordered to do something more.

144
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,458
We don't know the organizer's goal.

145
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,291
That being said,
if nine people can make it to the end,

146
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,708
there's no issue with the three of us
teaming up and heading for Tokyo.

147
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,708
So? Not a bad idea, is it?

148
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,000
Why us?

149
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,750
You are different
from the other participants.

150
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,500
Besides, as long as
this little miss is with you,

151
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,333
you won't betray me, will you?

152
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,333
You mean that if I betray you,
you intend to kill her?

153
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,875
That's correct.

154
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,041
She's a hostage, so to speak.

155
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:09,750
Although, a time may come
when you'll have to kill this little miss.

156
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,916
Well, take your time.

157
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,666
There's an inn called Uzuya in Yokkaichi.

158
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,208
If you're willing to form an alliance,
come to that inn on the third evening.

159
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,333
Oh.

160
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,458
One piece of advice.

161
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,375
It's not that you cannot kill.
You simply choose not to.

162
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,000
A manslayer is a manslayer for life.

163
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,291
You are still a killer, Kokushu Saga.

164
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,333
I'll see you again.

165
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:52,916
Wait.

166
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,916
Tell me one thing.

167
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,291
Why did you join Kodoku?

168
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,791
Well, I wonder.

169
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,208
Maybe I just wanted to see it for myself.

170
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,458
The end of the samurai.

171
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,291
I'll be expecting good news.

172
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,666
Get some rest.

173
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,833
Mother. Have some water.

174
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,833
Futaba…

175
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,833
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,416
I'll take care of everything.

177
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,416
Please.

178
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,958
Please.

179
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,666
Please. I only need a little.

180
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,375
Please save the children.

181
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,583
No one in this town has any money left.

182
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,833
No one's gonna believe this stuff, right?

183
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:31,833
No chance.

184
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,625
What's this? You want money?

185
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,666
Yes.

186
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,583
Take it.

187
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,125
I can't deal with this crap.

188
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,708
HOKOKU NEWSPAPER
PARTICIPANTS WANTED

189
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,791
You! Begging is prohibited.

190
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,541
Hey!

191
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:59,250
Miss Futaba.

192
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,458
I feel sick.

193
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,625
It'll be okay.

194
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,958
The gods are protecting you.

195
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,583
Keep fighting.

196
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,666
Kotaro?

197
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,625
Kotaro!

198
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:08,708
A ritual dance?

199
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,583
Yes.

200
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,541
What were you praying for?

201
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,500
For everyone to fulfill their lives

202
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,583
and ascend happily to heaven.

203
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,125
My mother taught me.

204
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:43,416
She took care of children
who had lost their parents.

205
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,500
But now,

206
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,875
she is bedridden with cholera.

207
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,458
The villagers left behind

208
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:57,666
are also suffering
from cholera and poverty.

209
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,000
Shujiro.

210
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,041
I need money.

211
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,750
But I'm weak.

212
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,958
I cannot stay alive by myself.

213
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,291
So I'm begging you.

214
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,500
Will you please take me with you?

215
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,375
I'll do whatever it takes.

216
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,458
Even if later it means…

217
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:40,166
you have no choice but to kill me.

218
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,083
I want to do everything I can
until the very end.

219
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,958
Please, I beg of you.

220
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,208
I also have family I want to save.

221
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,791
We will survive this, Futaba.

222
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,083
Yes.

223
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,166
I appreciate your help.

224
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:42,583
Here. Take these with you.

225
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:50,416
That sword of yours
carved a way into a new era.

226
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:54,750
Thanks to you, townsfolk like us
have been able to live in peace.

227
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,375
I can't thank you enough for that.

228
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,541
But the times have changed.

229
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,083
Please.

230
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,083
Thank you for everything.

231
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,666
I wish you both luck with your swords.

232
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,833
HOME MINISTRY, TOKYO

233
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:39,750
Enter.

234
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,625
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

235
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,708
Kawaji. Take a seat.

236
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,625
Home Minister.
What is this matter of concern?

237
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,875
Here.

238
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,083
HOKOKU NEWSPAPER
PARTICIPANTS WANTED

239
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,291
We seized this in Tokyo recently.

240
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,916
I'm aware of this.

241
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,875
I was going to investigate it
a little more before reporting it to you.

242
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,541
One hundred thousand yen
is an enormous sum of money.

243
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,458
Yes.

244
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,166
Last night, we confirmed

245
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,750
many shizoku wielding weapons
had assembled at Tenryuji Temple in Kyoto.

246
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,208
We're still unable to get in touch with
Jinbe Ando, who infiltrated the event.

247
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,541
Are the shizoku scheming a rebellion?

248
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,875
We don't know their goal yet.

249
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,500
However, the shizoku,
doomed remnants of the samurai,

250
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,625
have started something in Kyoto.

251
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,875
Behind them is someone
with enough financial power

252
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:39,041
to distribute a fake newspaper
throughout the country.

253
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,333
Those are the facts.

254
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:43,375
We don't know what may happen

255
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,958
if funds gather under the shizoku
dissatisfied with the new government.

256
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,250
We must launch
an investigation immediately.

257
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,875
Maejima, the shizoku are like
tigers without fangs now.

258
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,083
-We need not be afraid--
-We must not underestimate them.

259
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:59,708
Just how much damage do you think
we suffered in the civil war last year?

260
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,875
Our nation has just been reborn.

261
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,875
Should there be another civil war now,

262
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,000
it will diminish our nation's strength,

263
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,125
and we will be swallowed by the West.

264
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,541
Kawaji.

265
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,125
Contact the Police Bureau to investigate.

266
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:19,916
Find out who is behind this
and what their purpose is.

267
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,791
-I want every detail.
-Yes, sir.

268
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:38,750
Didn't you hear me?

269
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:43,666
I asked if you saw a samurai
with a little brat passing this way.

270
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,291
Useless.

271
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,666
Please, have mercy. I beg you!

272
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,791
Have mercy.

273
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,333
Brute!

274
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,250
Don't attack non-participants.

275
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,625
Who the hell are you?

276
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,375
Ukyo Kikuomi.

277
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,000
Yeah?

278
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:10,291
So you're the famous
Guardian God of the Court Nobles.

279
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,291
Hurry and leave now.

280
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,250
I've heard rumors about you.

281
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,958
What a pitiful creature.

282
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:21,291
Serving your master so well
only to get ditched so easily.

283
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,333
That means you and I are the same.

284
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,375
Silence.

285
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,708
Don't count me
among the vile breed you belong to.

286
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:37,250
Let's play.

287
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,750
Enough of your squirming about,
you twitchy bastard.

288
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,416
What's wrong? Is that all you can do?

289
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:14,083
Are we done here?

290
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:19,458
I don't have the time
to fight someone like you.

291
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,583
Mr. Ukyo! You cannot see Lord Kazanin!

292
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,291
Mr. Ukyo!

293
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,041
Lord Kazanin.

294
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:41,041
What do you mean
by abandoning the Kikuomi family?

295
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,416
I'm eating.

296
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,625
We, the Kikuomi family,

297
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,750
have risked our lives many times
to save you court nobles.

298
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,875
This is how you repay us?

299
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:59,041
The samurai who have been stripped
of their swords have no use now.

300
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,791
The government took away
your property too, didn't they?

301
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:09,041
If you bow your head,
I might consider hiring you as my servant.

302
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,708
You insolent bastard.

303
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:13,833
Don't move!

304
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,125
Put your hands down!

305
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,333
Hurry up and take him away!

306
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,583
Don't touch me!

307
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,166
I'll leave on my own.

308
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,458
He should know his place.

309
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:46,750
My Lord, we cannot go on any longer.

310
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,416
We have sold off everything we can.

311
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:55,333
All we have left… is this.

312
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,791
We've been deprived
of our purpose to live.

313
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,833
Now our country
asks us to sell our pride as well?

314
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:08,708
We have endured long enough.

315
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,500
In order to protect our honor,

316
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:17,458
we have no choice but to commit seppuku.

317
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,333
I understand well…

318
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,916
what you have in your hearts.

319
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,458
The Kikuomi family…

320
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:34,500
shall be restored by my hand at any cost.

321
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,750
My Lord.

322
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:05,541
You survived too.

323
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,750
I have a favor to ask.

324
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,000
Don't come any closer.

325
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:16,916
What?

326
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:22,125
No, wait! We don't want to fight anymore!

327
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,000
We're going to abandon Kodoku!

328
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:31,250
We just want you to join us!

329
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:33,875
What are you saying?

330
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,583
We were tricked into this. Weren't we?

331
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,291
Yeah! That's right! We've been tricked!

332
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,750
Some of the participants
are as strong as monsters.

333
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,166
All the wooden tags
we grabbed were taken away!

334
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,500
The 100,000 yen is all a lie!

335
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,875
So, please. Join us.

336
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,708
I'm begging you.

337
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,333
Please, join us.

338
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,500
You can't drop out
once you've joined the game.

339
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,583
You'll be killed
if you break the rules.

340
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,666
No.

341
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:12,083
Even for them,

342
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:15,625
it would be impossible
to attack so many of us.

343
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,541
Wouldn't it?

344
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:22,875
Why do we all have to kill each other?

345
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:29,541
Just for this?

346
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,916
All I wanted was some money.

347
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:44,791
I only wanted to feed
my children enough food!

348
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,083
Don't do it. Stop.

349
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,958
They're watching us.

350
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,333
I want to go home.

351
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,250
Don't. Don't take it off.

352
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,250
Don't do it. Don't do it! Stop!

353
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:26,791
It's over.

354
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,916
Are we done here?

355
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,458
Don't take it off.

356
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:20,625
-Home… I want to go home.
-Don't.

357
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,291
Wait. Don't take it off! Wait!

358
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,833
Don't!

359
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,083
107

360
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,791
It's okay.

361
00:38:34,375 --> 00:38:36,791
It's safe. Come on, take yours off too!

362
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,541
Wait. Wait!

363
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,916
-If you…
-Stop. Wait!

364
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,708
Take yours off too--

365
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,666
Why?

366
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,916
It's so cruel.

367
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,750
"Anyone who takes off their own
wooden tag will be punished accordingly."

368
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:08,041
Is it clear to you now?

369
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,416
To hell with you.

370
00:40:49,166 --> 00:40:53,041
What makes you think you're superior?

371
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,916
You think you can do anything
to the samurai

372
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,666
because we are useless now?

373
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,375
What's wrong with you?

374
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,333
Mr. Sakura, sir.

375
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,333
What should we do?

376
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,416
Report to the organizer.

377
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,666
Understood.

378
00:42:56,458 --> 00:43:00,166
Kokushu the Manslayer has awakened.

379
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,166
This…

380
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,666
is who I used to be.

381
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,583
What?

382
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,333
All I knew was how to kill people.

383
00:44:25,583 --> 00:44:27,041
That wasn't enough.

384
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,541
Not enough at all.

385
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:32,208
There you go.

386
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,458
117 REMAINING
