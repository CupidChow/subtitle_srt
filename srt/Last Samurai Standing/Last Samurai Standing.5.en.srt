1
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:13,666
Specters.

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,250
They cling to their decaying privilege…

3
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,541
and their swords.

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,416
They are too arrogant…

5
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,458
to accept defeat.

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,166
They steal from the powerless.

7
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,958
They mourn their lost dignity.

8
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,666
Raise the cry of victory!

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,583
The fools dare to rebel.

10
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,333
Smoke signal confirmed.
It's a victory for our allies.

11
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,958
Open fire.

12
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,125
Sir?

13
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,875
Fire.

14
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,833
Our units are still behind enemy lines--

15
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,458
Fire now!

16
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,541
Commence firing!

17
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,708
Aim!

18
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:26,750
Fire!

19
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,083
Stop! Stop it!

20
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,000
It's over!

21
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,583
Stop!

22
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,500
Those fools…

23
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,000
are the least fit for the new age.

24
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,125
Such specters…

25
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,666
must be eradicated.

26
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,500
Gentlemen, apologies
for keeping you waiting.

27
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,875
You've given us
such an amazing opportunity.

28
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,041
We're the ones who should be thanking you.

29
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
Indeed.

30
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,083
Have you heard
of our family motto, Organizer?

31
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,250
No, I'm afraid I haven't.

32
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,958
"Never lend money to the shizoku."

33
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,916
No one has suffered more
from their lawlessness than we have.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,541
Every time we lend them money,
they walk away with it.

35
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,833
I don't know how we've survived.

36
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:43,375
Number 159, Tekkan Ikeuchi,
fell at Kuwana-juku.

37
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,083
Reportedly, he was killed
by number 66, Bukotsu Kanjiya.

38
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,416
Bukotsu the Savage Slasher again?

39
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,833
-He's a beast, through and through.
-Absolutely.

40
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,916
But he only cares about killing,
not about making progress.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,208
Hardly worth betting on.

42
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,125
He's nowhere near being
the first through Chiryu-juku.

43
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,166
Exactly.

44
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,208
-He can't die without entertaining us.
-I couldn't agree more.

45
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:10,166
The real fun of Kodoku is just beginning.

46
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:15,750
We've prepared plenty of entertainment
from start to finish.

47
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:22,458
So let us savor the downfall of those
pathetic specters together, gentlemen.

48
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,625
MITSUI BANK

49
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,708
Do you despise guns?

50
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,500
They are what buried us samurai
as the dead.

51
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,916
No one is to blame for our fall.

52
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,958
The times have merely changed.

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,833
The times…

54
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,458
Lower your guns.

55
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,250
He can't focus.

56
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,208
Move aside!

57
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,833
-What is it? What happened?
-I heard a gunshot!

58
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,458
Stop right there.

59
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
Stop! Stop!

60
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,083
Wait! Hey!

61
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,875
Head to the front! Don't let him get away!

62
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,375
Time to move!

63
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,833
Wait!

64
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,750
Hey!

65
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,750
Wait! Come on!

66
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,416
Even if you keep
pushing forward like this,

67
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,750
there's no happiness
waiting for any of you.

68
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,666
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,458
You don't need
to understand what it means!

70
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,166
This is the end of the road for you,

71
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,041
Kokushu Saga!

72
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,541
Shu-nii!

73
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,041
Come on!

74
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,250
We shall meet again in Tokyo.

75
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:21,791
Enter.

76
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,583
We have news
from Superintendent General Kawaji.

77
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,791
Apparently, they found nothing
at the foot of Mount Fuji.

78
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,041
It was empty.

79
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,791
Thank you.

80
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,666
Lord Okubo, regarding what Maejima
mentioned before…

81
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:44,750
Concerning Kawaji?

82
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,958
Yes.

83
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,375
Kawaji is an honorable man.

84
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,125
-But still--
-To maintain order in this country,

85
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,708
Kawaji traveled
as far as Europe on a study tour

86
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,583
and established the Police Bureau himself.

87
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,250
I do not believe that man would betray us.

88
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,583
Those documents…

89
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,291
May I borrow them?

90
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,333
Can you crack it?

91
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,833
I don't know.

92
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,875
But I can try.

93
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:24,625
I want to do whatever I can.

94
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,958
Handle them carefully.

95
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,083
We have no idea
where the enemy might be hiding.

96
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,083
Thank you, sir.

97
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,666
The one who killed Akayama
and attacked me wasn't a fake.

98
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,458
He was a real police officer.

99
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,750
Which means whoever's running Kodoku

100
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,833
is connected to the Police Bureau.
Or perhaps--

101
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,208
Someone inside the Police Bureau.

102
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,666
That's what I'm thinking.

103
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,291
So the Police Bureau and Mitsui Bank.

104
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,875
It might not just be the bank.

105
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,416
What do you mean?

106
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,000
The zaibatsu that runs the bank
could be connected too.

107
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,333
When you look at it that way,
it all starts to come together.

108
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,875
The Police Bureau
monitors the participants

109
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,875
and disposes of any dead bodies.

110
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:36,708
The enormous costs needed for that
are covered by the zaibatsu.

111
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,541
But one thing doesn't make sense.

112
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,958
Jinbe Ando, who died first
at Tenryuji Temple,

113
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,875
was from Kyoto Prefectural
Police Department's Fourth Division.

114
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,125
That's right. Even the police station
Kyojin snuck into--

115
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,958
So it's only the central Police Bureau
that is involved.

116
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,333
Wait, but why would the police…

117
00:13:55,416 --> 00:14:00,875
I have no clue.
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

118
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,666
Kodoku isn't just a simple game

119
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,583
where the survivor walks away
with 100,000 yen.

120
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:13,250
Even after reaching Tokyo,
something is bound to happen.

121
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,541
If one of us
wants to be the last one standing,

122
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,791
there's a chance
we may end up killing each other.

123
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,833
Even if you're the last one left,

124
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,375
there's no guarantee you'll return alive.

125
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,458
How could they?

126
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,333
But even so,

127
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,208
I'll keep moving forward.

128
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,500
With the little miss in tow?

129
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,875
Maybe this is as far
as you can go with her.

130
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,416
I'm going.

131
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,083
Futaba…

132
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
Stay quiet.

133
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:16,000
Are you forgetting the one trump card
only you can play,

134
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,916
Kokushu Saga?

135
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,916
During the war, you were connected
to some big names in the government.

136
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,500
How would you know that?

137
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,833
That's our only shot
against the zaibatsu and the police.

138
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:40,666
If you really care about her,
you might want to think this through.

139
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,083
I'll be back by noon tomorrow.

140
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,250
Take care of Futaba while I'm gone.

141
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,500
Got it.

142
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,875
That kind of swing won't help you.

143
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,708
Even still. I want to become stronger.

144
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,375
I don't want…

145
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,791
to drag everyone down anymore.

146
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,166
Strength isn't just about the sword.

147
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,291
You're weak right now.

148
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,041
You're a girl.

149
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,333
Still a child.

150
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,166
But that's just for now.

151
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,583
You have to discover
a strength that is unique to you.

152
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,500
NARUMI TELEGRAPH OFFICE

153
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,750
How can I help you?

154
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,583
I'd like to send a telegram.

155
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,708
Yes, of course.

156
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,041
Please write the recipient's name
and the message here.

157
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,875
SPECIAL EXERCISE BY THE POLICE BUREAU

158
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,208
Come in.

159
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
-Sorry to interrupt, sir.
-What is it?

160
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:47,583
We've received a suspicious telegram
addressed to the Home Minister.

161
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,791
Kokushu Saga…

162
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,791
I'm going to the telegraph room.

163
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,458
I'll do it myself. Everyone out, please.

164
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:10,791
Yes, sir.

165
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,375
We've received a response.

166
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,208
What does it say?

167
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,708
It says, "Details, please."

168
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,833
Who's the sender?

169
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,000
It's from Hisoka Maejima.

170
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:36,916
How is that possible?

171
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,125
He's the closest aide
to the Home Minister!

172
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,666
Would you mind stepping out?

173
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,875
It's better you don't know.

174
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,791
Oh, right.

175
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,750
Critical incident at Tenryuji Temple.
Has it been confirmed?

176
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:19,833
Report of shizoku gathering received.
Are you one of them?

177
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,750
I am one of them.

178
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,750
There is a child
present among the shizoku.

179
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,791
Requesting assistance.

180
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,041
Still investigating.
Requesting full details.

181
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,291
Rule four.

182
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,500
You must not speak of this game to anyone.

183
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Provide protection,
and details will follow.

184
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,333
Police involvement is suspected.
Any information?

185
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:59,541
Matter of national importance.
Details follow after protection.

186
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:08,791
Meet in Okazaki in three days.
Protection to follow there.

187
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,291
Understood.

188
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,333
Apologies for startling you.

189
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,833
Could you send this one too?

190
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,000
Of course.

191
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,250
Thank you.

192
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,541
TO: SHINO SAGA
FROM: SHUJIRO SAGA

193
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,208
Wait for me. Take care.

194
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,250
I will return without fail.

195
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:53,875
Kokushu Saga seems to be
one of the participants.

196
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,458
Kokushu, you say?

197
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,125
Yes, sir.

198
00:21:57,791 --> 00:21:59,291
So he's alive.

199
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,666
He's requesting protection for a child.

200
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,458
Any other details?

201
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,458
When I questioned him
about police involvement,

202
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,125
he wouldn't give a clear answer.

203
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,416
But he called it
a matter of national importance.

204
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,833
There's more.

205
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,666
The Police Bureau
is mobilizing over 150 police officers

206
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,250
and conducting exercises in secret.

207
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,875
The Police Bureau is proceeding with
something without informing us.

208
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,041
There is no doubt.

209
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,166
Kawaji is the head of the Police Bureau.

210
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,625
No one else
could maintain ties to the zaibatsu

211
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:35,333
and exercise this much freedom
in controlling the police.

212
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,791
Lord Okubo.

213
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,375
I…

214
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,041
I will not give up.

215
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:53,083
Once Kawaji returns,
I will speak with him myself.

216
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,208
In the meantime, speed up
deciphering the coded telegrams.

217
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:59,458
Without evidence,
he'll talk his way out of it.

218
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:03,000
Understood. I'll be on my way
to meet Kokushu myself.

219
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,916
Make sure to stay alert.

220
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,250
Yes, sir.

221
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:34,041
FIREARMS - EQUIPMENT
WESTERN POLICE SYSTEM

222
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:38,625
FORMATION OF A MODERN STATE POLICE

223
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,458
TRAINING IS NECESSARY FOR EMERGENCIES

224
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:45,791
Ru… Ru… Ru… Ke…

225
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,583
One…

226
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:50,791
Eleven…

227
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,666
Eleven…

228
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,583
Sorry for the wait.

229
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:41,666
All right then, let's move.

230
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,083
We're probably the last ones left.

231
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,083
Most of the participants
have probably passed Chiryu by now.

232
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,000
Better catch up,
or there won't be any wooden tags left.

233
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,375
Right. Let's move.

234
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,458
SEKI

235
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,708
CHIRYU

236
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:21,208
CHIRYU-JUKU
REQUIRED POINTS: 5

237
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,416
We've been expecting you all.

238
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,250
Saga, Katsuki, Kinugasa,
your wooden tags, sir and ladies, please.

239
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,791
Tsuge, Sayama, this way, please sirs.

240
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:49,541
Shujiro Saga, eight points.

241
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,541
Futaba Katsuki, seven points.

242
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:55,916
And Iroha Kinugasa, eight points.

243
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,666
You are all cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

244
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,208
Kyojin Tsuge, seven points.

245
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,083
You are cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

246
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,666
This blue tag counts for five points.

247
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,791
Please hand over
five points' worth of tags.

248
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,416
Sayama, your wooden tags, please.

249
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,916
No…

250
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,750
Futaba, let's go.

251
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:39,833
Shujiro!

252
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,291
-If we give him some of ours…
-Why bring him further?

253
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:45,958
He won't make it out alive.

254
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:49,125
No! Please, help him!

255
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:52,458
We're barely able to survive ourselves.

256
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,250
He's a fully grown man.
He made the decision to come here.

257
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,291
It's his life, and he should take
full responsibility for it.

258
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,625
Futaba.

259
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:23,916
Thank you.

260
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:41,125
I don't know what's going to happen.

261
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:47,125
I might be killed as well.

262
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,666
But…

263
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,041
If I turn my back on a life
that's right in front of me,

264
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:59,833
then even if I survive,

265
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,333
I won't be able to hold my head high

266
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,916
in front of my mother.

267
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:15,291
All you're doing is prolonging a life
that is already doomed.

268
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,958
Sayama doesn't have what it takes

269
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:21,041
to be one of the nine
who might have a chance to survive.

270
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,416
He might find another way to stay alive.

271
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,000
That's irrelevant.

272
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,250
Oh, well. I guess she wins.

273
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:21,000
Shinnosuke Sayama, five points.
You are cleared to pass Chiryu-juku.

274
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,666
Thank you, Futaba.

275
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,875
Thank you!

276
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:37,416
Thank you!

277
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,541
May your journey go well.

278
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:54,916
Shujiro…

279
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,750
I'm sorry.

280
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:03,750
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you, and yet…

281
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:05,708
No,

282
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,916
you're right, Futaba.

283
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,375
We can't save everyone.

284
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,291
But if I turn my back
on someone I can help,

285
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,708
I'd be too ashamed to face my wife.

286
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,750
Oh, and Futaba, nice work.

287
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:20,458
Yes.

288
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,750
Tsurubami let it slip.

289
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:27,333
If we make it into the final nine,
we might have a chance to survive.

290
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,625
You're right. He did say that.

291
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm sure the nine who make it to Tokyo
will be made to do something.

292
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,791
But that doesn't necessarily mean
only one of them will make it out alive.

293
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:46,958
Still…

294
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:51,750
Why would the Kodoku
tell us something like that?

295
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,958
They're not exactly on our side,
but maybe they feel sorry for us.

296
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,083
Well, not us.

297
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:01,291
You, Futaba.

298
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:07,625
Who knows? You might be the one
who holds the key to Kodoku, Futaba.

299
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,208
I've finally found a bit of hope.

300
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,375
And it's thanks to you, Futaba.

301
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,333
So? What was that about a samurai?

302
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,416
I saw a samurai with a sword.

303
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,208
He had a girl with him.

304
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,708
Kokushu,

305
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,375
you won't get away this time.

306
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,833
All right, I guess this is where we split.

307
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:28,875
Huh?

308
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,458
After the mess we made
at the police station,

309
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,500
Shinnosuke and I might be
on the wanted list by now.

310
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,041
What?

311
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,208
We'll split up for now

312
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:40,166
and go in two groups
until the dust settles.

313
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,083
-Will you two be okay alone?
-Who do you think I am?

314
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:44,416
You watch your backs too.

315
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,833
We'll find you later.

316
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,125
Come on, Shinnosuke!

317
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,666
Wait. Hold on, Kyojin!

318
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,958
We should get going too.

319
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,333
EUROPEAN CIPHER MANUAL

320
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:40,375
To maintain order in this country,

321
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:42,833
Kawaji traveled
as far as Europe on a study tour

322
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,708
and established the Police Bureau himself.

323
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,375
N, K…

324
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:06,416
W, D, A, C…

325
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,166
L…

326
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,083
I…

327
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,625
Good evening, Shinpei.

328
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:54,833
Mochizuki…

329
00:35:56,375 --> 00:36:00,250
What brings someone from the Police Bureau
to the Home Ministry?

330
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:04,666
Still working at this time of night?

331
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,000
You shouldn't have underestimated us.

332
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:16,166
Did you think we'd leave
the Home Ministry's elite unwatched?

333
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,500
What are you really after?

334
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:22,250
That's not for you to know.

335
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,166
Almost made it.

336
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,416
Too bad.

337
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,250
REPORT TO KAWAJI
SAKURA AND SHUJIRO FACE-TO-FACE

338
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,833
TO TOSHIYOSHI KAWAJI

339
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,791
Looks like there won't be
any more developments today.

340
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,791
Suppose it's about time to take some rest?

341
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:22,708
Yes. Everyone, please rest well
in your bedrooms.

342
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,250
I believe the results
from Chiryu will be in by tomorrow.

343
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,541
Well then, see you all tomorrow.

344
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,541
The Yoshida twins really are pathetic.

345
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,916
-Okubo's secretary has been taken care of.
-Good.

346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,541
Still, things are getting a little hectic
at the central government.

347
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,500
Maejima suddenly changed his schedule
and is heading for Okazaki.

348
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,958
Evidence suggests he exchanged telegrams
from Tokyo with a Kodoku participant.

349
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:51,250
Who did he contact?

350
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,000
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

351
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:00,250
Pardon me.

352
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:05,708
Gentlemen, we have a bit of a situation.z

353
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,041
Okubo may have learned that you
and the Police Bureau are involved.

354
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,875
What do you mean?

355
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:19,291
If that's true, we could be--

356
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:23,708
Please rest assured.
It's all going as expected.

357
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:26,083
I have a plan.

358
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,625
How on earth did the central government
find out who we are?

359
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:34,791
It seems one of the participants leaked
information to Maejima via telegram.

360
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,666
What? Isn't that against the rules?

361
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,000
Number 108, Shujiro Saga.

362
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:43,833
Kokushu the Manslayer… Is he disqualified?

363
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,541
He won't be disqualified for that.

364
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,791
But Organizer--

365
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,708
Easy now. Let's all stay calm.

366
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,833
According to reports,

367
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:57,000
some rather intriguing participants
are starting to join Shujiro Saga.

368
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,250
How about we let

369
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,333
the specters fight each other

370
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,708
to the death in Kodoku?

371
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,916
A festival…

372
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,791
Got a moment to chat, Gion Sansuke?

373
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,125
Who are you?

374
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,458
Oh, who knows?

375
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:07,375
I've got no intention of fighting you,
Shikura Adashino.

376
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:16,000
You guys are looking
for your siblings in Kodoku, right?

377
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,791
Shujiro Saga and Iroha Kinugasa…

378
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,208
Oh, and Jinroku
was there too if I'm not mistaken.

379
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:25,958
What do you want from us?

380
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:28,750
I wonder…

381
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:32,916
Would you be interested
if your siblings were in serious trouble?

382
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,541
Excuse me, which way is Chiryu-juku?

383
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:51,416
-Pardon me?
-I think I got lost.

384
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,958
Tell us the details.

385
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,708
63 REMAINING

386
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,583
