Subtitle distribution Magico.club Team
Taken, Katerina2020, Suri, Trelokomeia
And the brains in the blender

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
Sit here and don't make a sound.

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,720
Oh, my goodness,
are you smoking again?

6
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:43,140
- I thought you cut it off.
- And I thought you were gonna bring me a witness.

7
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,390
In particular I remember someone
making a big deal out of it.

8
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,888
Something came up.

9
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,607
Doesn't it always come up?

10
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:54,936
So you have no evidence
to hold my agent.

11
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:56,030
Come on.

12
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,806
Because you're like that,
you know how these jobs go.

13
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,653
In such a case
of industrial espionage,

14
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:06,490
your government is not cooperating
because they're profiting from it.

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,016
So we have no choice.
We have to catch the thief.

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,350
All this, you don't do
just for Harrison.

17
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,360
What's really going on?

18
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,681
Cunning fox.

19
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,360
Okay, but on one condition.

20
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:31,779

22
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,640
- Okay.
- Okay?

23
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,241
I bought you some time.

24
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,120
You have 2 weeks
to find the killer,

25
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,129
and bring the files
that he was going to give to Helmes.

26
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,110
Listen well. You must
we have to use Harrison.

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,400
We want to cooperate
to take a serious shot at Helmes.

28
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Okay.

29
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:24,054
Do you wear contact lenses?

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,075
Your eyes are blurry.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,840
- Were you crying last night?
- Of course not.

32
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,180
Since it affected you.

33
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,300
This is no time for tears.

34
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,505
I told you not to call
to take cases personally.

35
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,155
That's how mistakes are made.

36
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,867
Yeah, what's up?

37
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,460
What, the National Intelligence Agency
won't allow it?

38
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,301
What the hell are you talking about?

39
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,939
Okay.

40
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,148
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WISHES
TO OUR NEW LEADER

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,240
Arum.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,810
Doo Le...

43
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,610
Sophie...

44
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,950
Yeah, Sophie.

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,430
Our little bride.

46
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,820
Our friend.

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,460
How did this happen to her?

48
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,680
INFORMANT

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,350
SOFI IF

50
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,156
ECLIPON

51
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:57,330
The unthinkable happened.

52
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,290
Yeah, but even though it happened.
they didn't even mention it on the news.

53
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,470
Sophie was known.
They wrote articles that she was a genius

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,110
and that she was the youngest scientist,
in charge of the National Chemistry Department.

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,110
Look at this report
to her death.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,675
"The genius scientist, Sophie Anne,"

57
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:19,764
"dead from an overdose
of opioids."

58
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,136
Are they referring to Sophie?

59
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,063
I can't find this article anymore either,
they deleted it.

60
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,244
What's the matter?

61
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,180
You said someone was after her.

62
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,507
Maybe he was murdered.

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,600
But the media
are talking about an overdose.

64
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,408
"Sophie started the opioid
while she was studying."

65
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,572
"On the eve of her wedding,
she was seen drinking heavily."

66
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,310
What website is this?
Who wrote it?

67
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,880
Chon Gook-Gill?

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,140
I'll give him a hand.

69
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,250
Wait, my cell phone.

70
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,020
Hello,
News Party office there?

71
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,990
I want Huang Chun Gil...

72
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,300
Excuse me, can I talk
with Chon Gook-Gill, please.

73
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,509
How?

74
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:04,366
Is it missing?

75
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:07,700
- We have a directive from headquarters.
- What is it this time?

76
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,327
Not to mention
that her death,

77
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,725
occurred under unclear circumstances
because it makes sense.

78
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:17,140
They prefer to be seen
like an overdose at a party.

79
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,080
Doesn't that make sense?

80
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,450
There will be reactions
from other countries,

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,550
that the international project manager,
wanted to sell research secrets.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,590
That's why they want to cover it up.

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,820
How will they cover something like that?

84
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,640
If no theft report is made
then the thief will get away with it.

85
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,280
Damn them.

86
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:44,796
Okay.

87
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,560
The dead do not speak.

88
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,280
Now it's a race
to put the puzzle together.

89
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,660
Yong-gu, did you find anything?

90
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,750
Anne Sofie, South Korea.

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,990
PhD in Physics, USA,
and a degree from the Institute of Technology.

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,110
While residing in the United States,

93
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,040
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAMME
FOR TURTLE INFORMATION

94
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,090
was selected as chief scientist
for Ekosan,

95
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,052
that investigates energy
nuclear fusion.

96
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:13,507
- I read her thesis...
- What do you know about physics?

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,611
Chief, Yong-gu
may seem stupid,

98
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,640
but he's the smartest of us all.

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,890
- He is a graduate of the Institute of Technology.
- Really?

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,721
To write a thesis
in nuclear fusion,

101
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,050
you have to be diligent,
dedicated only to research,

102
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,579
so I don't know
because he was selling secrets...

103
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:35,140
Don't you read comics?

104
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:38,960
The bad guys are scientists
who want to destroy the earth.

105
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,086
Like when they get their doctorate
they become evil.

106
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,945
We must not let
the mad scientists out.

107
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,170
That's why I'm so afraid of them.

108
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,790
And that's why I don't let
Yong Gu working outside.

109
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,860
You recognize the perverts
from the well-manicured nails.

110
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,470
A skilled spy,
is a mommy in disguise.

111
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,600
What better cover...

112
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,990
by a scientist
dedicated to research?

113
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,210
How he got into trouble
with industrial espionage?

114
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,630
Our job is
to unlock its secrets.

115
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,200
Secret?

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,900
Yeah, I think Sophie
had a big secret.

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,670
What secret could he have had?

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,908
Another man? Debts? Family?

119
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:35,310
A man with financial issues,
or financial issues about a man.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,312
A man with family issues,
or a family with a man issue.

121
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:42,540
No, Sophie wouldn't have
that kind of trouble.

122
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,540
You're wrong.
There is no man without secrets.

123
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,830
Your life may depend
on a secret.

124
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,290
But this secret
was so big,

125
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,145
who couldn't stop it
from getting out.

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,160
In a way,
it caused her death.

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,920
You mean the secret of
killed her?

128
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,030
Maybe not.

129
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,160
- All Sophie knew was research.
- People like that are easily manipulated.

130
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,860
She was always the best student,
a genius to her peers.

131
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,830
Her parents had a tutorial
in Decie-dong.

132
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,270
Thanks to their daughter's reputation, they attracted
many students and made a lot of money.

133
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,990
But her father,
lost a lot of money in a real estate scam.

134
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,490
TRAINING.
REAL ESTATE TAX

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,610
That's when Sophie,
she was asking everyone for a loan.

136
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,300
SOFI IF

137
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,814
He even published a book,
and started lecturing.

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,526
Wait a minute.

139
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,590
Then it didn't start
her own company?

140
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,990
Find out where he got the money.
Check her parents' finances.

141
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,860
Debts do not always push
to selling secrets,

142
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,820
- but we have to take it into account.
- What about her husband? Him?

143
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:03,130
They went to the same university.
His alibi checks out.

144
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,900
He has left the country.

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,329
Return to the USA
when his wife died?

146
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,660
NAME: CHEN LEE, CHINA

147
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,770
What? Is he back?

148
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,530
Really?

149
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,245
Who is doing this? It's cold.

150
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah, okay.

151
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,310
When the wife is murdered,

152
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,840
the husband becomes a prime suspect.

153
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,050
Why would he do that?

154
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:31,070
His family has money.

155
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,550
Do you think it was a crime of passion?

156
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,270
The one who was watching her.

157
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,400
Someone was following Sophie.

158
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,110
- There is no proof that he did it.
- So Ra will bring the evidence,

159
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,944
that he picked up in Jeju
and the crime scene.

160
00:09:45,994 --> 00:09:48,938
Find if the formula
is related to other hypotheses.

161
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,388
And look at this.

162
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,990
Find as many calls as possible
to this mobile phone.

163
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,970
I didn't find anything,
he must have had another cell phone.

164
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,890
Chi Hun, which email
was Sophie communicating with you?

165
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,570
Dr. Philip Yoon has her e-mail.
He approached us first.

166
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,730
Philip and Sophie
were colleagues.

167
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,341
Can you find him?

168
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,792
- Yes.
- Okay.

169
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,040
Check everyone who
who had a relationship with her.

170
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,620
Speaking of which...

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,080
we have someone very interesting,

172
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,300
too close to us.

173
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,316
NAME: KANG ARUM

174
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,000
You chose the photo,
Yong-gu?

175
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,152
Change it.

176
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,170
The other side is better.

177
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,260
What did you say?
Did you meet Chi Hun?

178
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,939
Why?

179
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,840
You broke up with him and said
you'd never speak to him again.

180
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,570
You said you'd never see him again.
Why did you two meet? And especially in Jeju.

181
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,470
I wouldn't meet him
under normal circumstances.

182
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,910
How was it? Was he the same?

183
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:09,653
He was at work,

184
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,770
and he had a huge smile.

185
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,823
- Good thing it works.
- He was working with his body.

186
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:17,730
Work is not shameful.

187
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,403
He was sweating a lot.

188
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,610
Sophie's bachelor party.

189
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,310
He was a male stripper.

190
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,101
- What?
- Don't you have any pictures?

191
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,296
To laugh after so many tears,

192
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,540
is not good for health.

193
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,880
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:52,821
But I can't get my head around it.
What the hell was Chi-Hoon doing there?

195
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,971
Always appears
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

196
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,640
So he ruined my life too.

197
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,940
But he has to stay away from you.

198
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,780
Now where is he?

199
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:07,423
After the divorce, Arum started
her own company and remarried.

200
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,090
NAME: CHION DE CHION,
DEREK HION

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,672
She married him?

202
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:16,992
He's a diplomat.
He's handsome, he's got a degree and money.

203
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:19,842
And I would have married him
if I were a woman.

204
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,510
After she dumped Chi Hoon,
she found the man of her dreams.

205
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,630
After she took her junior
when she married Chi Hun.

206
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,100
Chon Chi Hoon.

207
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,602
- Investigate your ex-wife.
- What?

208
00:12:41,652 --> 00:12:44,090
That's who Sophie saw before she died.

209
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,390
He was also on stage
of the crime.

210
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,872
In a way,
he's the prime suspect.

211
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,970
This is absurd.

212
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,970
- I was with her all that night.
- You were?

213
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,490
Think about it.

214
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,510
Wherever he went,
bad things happened.

215
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,810
Did you feel that something
was wrong?

216
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,217
Feel what?

217
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,208
Since when did Interpol
is based on instinct?

218
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,220
Why don't you pick a suspect
by lot?

219
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,480
Always listen to your instincts.

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,710
When you fall in love,
do you research everything?

221
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,308
When you face her,
your heart rate goes up.

222
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,930
That's when the control starts, no, wrong,
that's when the sparks fly.

223
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,280
And if your instincts
is wrong?

224
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:27,755
Love begins...

225
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:32,241
when you realize
that you've ceased to be rational.

226
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,590
So to love,
I mean in an investigation,

227
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,760
you have to turn around
when your instincts betray you.

228
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,300
It's a wonderful thing.

229
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:51,291
Please get authorization for this.
I will not participate.

230
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,280
Chon Chi Hoon.

231
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:59,350
What was the last message
you got from your source?

232
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,820
I want to invite you to my party.

233
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,170
Before you meet the VIP at the wedding,
you have to find the bride.

234
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,910
I'll show you where the VIP is
and where to find your gift.

235
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,430
He was going to show you the wedding VIP
and a special gift.

236
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,980
What does it refer to?

237
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,411
VIP

238
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,140
Probably some guy in charge
Helmet agent.

239
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,400
Why? Because he invited
that agent.

240
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:28,500
- One guest was Agent Helmes.
- Then what's the gift?

241
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,890
Hidden archives of Project Ekosan.

242
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,960
So Sophie called
Chi-Hun to the party,

243
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,482
to verify his identity.

244
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:40,340
And his ex-girlfriend was there
when Sophie suddenly disappeared.

245
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,310
He was also at the scene of the murder.

246
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,430
But mostly,
she was a guest at the wedding.

247
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,280
That makes her very suspicious.

248
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,020
- I'll start with the guest list.
- Start with your ex-wife.

249
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,920
He knows something, I'm sure.

250
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,920
It has nothing to do with this.

251
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,840
Okay, let's say
he doesn't know anything.

252
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,160
But if a vital secret
was accidentally revealed to her,

253
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,480
while he was at the crime scene
without his knowledge?

254
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,750
Then it will be in danger.

255
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,212
Who will he ask for help?

256
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,880
Arum hates me.

257
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,070
Great, you won't have any sparks.

258
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,150
- Yong Gu.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,491
You wanted an outside job?
Help him.

260
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,510
- Sit down, chief.
- Really? Yeah.

261
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,690
Chief, I told you
he's a scientist.

262
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,410
We are running out of time.

263
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,180
Since So Ra is coming.
She can help him.

264
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,727
Putting Yong-gu on the case,
we make Chi Hoon more cautious.

265
00:15:54,777 --> 00:15:57,600
Lately it has been unstable.
He's lost a source.

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,790
He took it badly
last time too.

267
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,790
Then it was very bad,
because that's when she got divorced.

268
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,310
But they didn't break up
for that reason.

269
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,358
But why would it happen
the same thing again?

270
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:12,420
I'm beginning to feel sorry for him.

271
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,800
It doesn't make him look
that he has a history?

272
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,982
That makes me more nervous.

273
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,180
- Find out what's going on in the nuclear lab.
- They're not allowed to talk about the project.

274
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,480
You can always find someone chatty.

275
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,034
Use your persuasion.
You're a spy at last.

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,490
What did I miss?

277
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,140
FRIENDS

278
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,050
What I did wrong
and I couldn't protect her?

279
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,310
I could have saved her.

280
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,660
Sophie asked me for help.

281
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,289
Last time
he picked you up at the hotel.

282
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,880
The ultimate message.

283
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,340
He may have told you
something important.

284
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,882
Don't tell anyone,
keep it to yourself.

285
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,710
Do you understand?

286
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,700
Don't trust anyone.
Even the one next to you.

287
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,120
"Do not trust
the one who is next to you?"

288
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,530
You son of a bitch.

289
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,080
I knew it was you.

290
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,050
You.

291
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,660
It was you, wasn't it?
You killed Sophie, didn't you?

292
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,760
I didn't kill her.

293
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,710
- I'm not that kind of trash.
- Yes, you are.

294
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,240
That's you.

295
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,110
You scare me.

296
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,591
Pil Ho, get a grip.

297
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,840
Phil Ho.

298
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,716
Take this one.

299
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,527
What do you take me for?

300
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,360
Why would I kill the woman
you loved, buddy?

301
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,403
It's very evil,
I would never do it.

302
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:18,811
That's why we are not moving forward
on this job.

303
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,720
The good heart is a bomb
ready to explode.

304
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,440
We end up dead.

305
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,517
Are you telling the truth?

306
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,990
Look, I just pawned
my expensive watch.

307
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,370
You know how important
the watch was to me, wasn't it?

308
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,265
When a man
sells his watch,

309
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,900
then surely
he's broke.

310
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,520
It was like selling my kidney,
when I pawned my watch.

311
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,679
If I had made a deal with Sophie,
I wouldn't be in this situation.

312
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,715
Did you really leave Felix?

313
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,470
Phil Ho, I have nowhere to go.

314
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,965
You're my last hope.
I need your help.

315
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,033
Because your hands
are sweaty?

316
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,885
Do you have hyperhidrosis?

317
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,828
They are my tears.

318
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,730
- You really didn't?
- Damn it.

319
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,195
If you think I did,
then come and forget about me.

320
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,890
If you find out who did it,
then I'll seriously consider your offer.

321
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,910
Don't worry.

322
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,519
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch
who killed Sophie.

323
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,066
Let's avenge her death.

324
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:02,740
Thank you, Phil Ho.

325
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,460
That's how friendships work.

326
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,480
Give and take.

327
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,330
I did it
to get my money's worth.

328
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,073
Now we're even.

329
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,370
The security camera
wasn't working that day.

330
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,896
Yesterday we called
someone to fix it.

331
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,673
You called your ex-girlfriend
after you got back?

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,350
Don't call her an ex.

333
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:05,880
And what should I call her?
The one who broke up with you a long time ago?

334
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,580
Don't say anything.

335
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,564
Your wife never knew,

336
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:12,554
that you were a spy
during your marriage?

337
00:22:12,604 --> 00:22:14,354
- No.
- Is she stupid?

338
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,550
I was careful.

339
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,120
I wonder how he would react
if he found out now?

340
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,095
Having a good time?

341
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,800
We are not private detectives
looking for the dirt on the world.

342
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Awesome.

343
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,160
You've never been here before?

344
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:45,728
Why would I come?

345
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:47,721
It wouldn't be surprising.

346
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,530
Some people when they get drunk,
they go to their ex-girlfriends.

347
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,687
I can imagine you drunk
visiting your ex-wife.

348
00:22:53,737 --> 00:22:56,900
Or be sober
and suddenly you're in her house.

349
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,670
General Kim
cut off his horse's head,

350
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,110
when out of habit that
he went to his courtesan's house.

351
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,410
Too bad about the horse.

352
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,790
- I guess he missed his courtesan.
- A general beheaded a horse.

353
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:10,776
What's your conclusion?

354
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:12,065
What?

355
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,050
What are you doing in my car?
I haven't paid it off yet.

356
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,130
Would you send the car to the junkyard?
You still owe on it?

357
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,430
Why would I throw it away?

358
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,950
Breaking up with someone
is no different from this.

359
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,987
Like flying a car
that you haven't paid off yet.

360
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,740
Like the general
who cut off the horse's head.

361
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,740
What kind of person does that?
Do you still have feelings?

362
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,790
No.

363
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,170
I cut off the horse's head.
That's what I did.

364
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,900
And now what do we do?

365
00:23:50,201 --> 00:23:51,570
Follow her.

366
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,920
- Yes, darling.
- Did you call me?

367
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,660
It's very strange.

368
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,240
I read a strange article about Sophie,
and when I picked up the paper,

369
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,940
I was told that the columnist
went on vacation.

370
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,380
And that her fiancé
has returned to the United States.

371
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,540
I can't find her parents.

372
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,180
Is this reasonable?

373
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,400
I guess they're all probably in shock.

374
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,750
Are you driving and talking on your cell phone?

375
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,920
Don't exaggerate.

376
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,530
You must be tired of crying.
Maybe you should have taken the day off.

377
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,707
No, I have to work.

378
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,370
Although it was cancelled
Sophie's wedding,

379
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,870
I have other marriages
on my schedule.

380
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,300
Don't worry.

381
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,030
I'm going to meet Mrs. Kim.

382
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,930
I'll see you at home.

383
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:46,422
Okay.

384
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,170
HARRISON YONGK

385
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,980
E'I'LI

386
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,350
Hey, Ailey, I called you.
because I can't find Harrison.

387
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,890
We were supposed to meet today.

388
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,263
Sudden business trip?

389
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,330
Okay?

390
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,430
Yes, I'll wait to eat
for skewers from your little hands.

391
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:23,671
Thank you.

392
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,819
Yeah, see you.

393
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,370
You learned it from a book
to follow a car?

394
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,626
What book?

395
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,970
"Become a spy in 100 days"?
Then he says how to go undercover?

396
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,222
Or "Think like a CIA agent
and acted like the KGB"?

397
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,217
- Which one?
- I do what I can, you know.

398
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,650
Not to be detected,
or miss the target.

399
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,900
- Zero to two.
- Better to miss the target?

400
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,990
No, you only get one chance.

401
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,268
The target may be headed
to the most important appointment.

402
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,910
So don't ever lose him.

403
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,718
Your ex-girlfriend, she's in there
in circulation all the time.

404
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,307
But it does not violate the C.O.C.
That's her style.

405
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,540
It is tender but also rough.
She is cold and generous.

406
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,140
When he passes by,
he does so at a controlled speed.

407
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,400
They say that life goes on.

408
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,040
That's life.

409
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,110
Do you want to die?

410
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,030
Watch where you're going,
do you want to die so badly?

411
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,550
You won't live long
if you drive like that.

412
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,530
She's tough. Hard as a rock.

413
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,100
Speed up.

414
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:03,680
We're not going for a walk in the country,
just step on the gas a little bit.

415
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Okay.

416
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,144
Does she like paintings?

417
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,070
Not exactly.

418
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,720
What a beautiful painting.

419
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,653
She likes to watch
her reflection.

420
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Okay.

421
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,099
- What are you doing?
- Parking properly.

422
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:57,219
Get in.

423
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,770
You're still here?

424
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,924
Shall I go in?

425
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:04,570
Find out why he came here
and who he will meet.

426
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,000
Who when,
where, what, how and why.

427
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
Report everything to me.

428
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,950
I will evaluate
your performance, right?

429
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,269
You're lucky.

430
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,819
The gallery is a public space
and you won't arouse suspicion.

431
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,110
Why didn't anyone tell me
that I was going undercover?

432
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,004
What is this?
Is this the '80s?

433
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:34,990
There is no way
I won't impress you.

434
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,370
Isn't it perfect?
Just as I expected.

435
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,410
Yong Gu.

436
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,912
When are you going to impress me?

437
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,004
He met with a woman.

438
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:34,520
Which woman?

439
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,741
Hello, Mrs. Kim.
I'm Kang Arum from Arum Bridal.

440
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,861
It must be the director.

441
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,410
How did it happen?

442
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,540
They tried to kill me,
by greasing the stairs.

443
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,014
- Excuse me?
- They tried to kill her,

444
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,386
greasing the stairs.
He broke his leg.

445
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,980
Yong Gu,
I'll break yours too.

446
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,440
Someone wants to kill me.

447
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,920
- Excuse me?
- I'm going ahead with the wedding.

448
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,440
design my wedding dress,
please.

449
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,250
A wedding dress discreet,
but also with character.

450
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,083
Okay, we'll fix you up
a beautiful wedding dress.

451
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,360
Do you like
a special design?

452
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,735
Door-to-door sales?

453
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,474
Arum sells her a wedding dress.

454
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,710
This woman reminds me of something.

455
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,830
You said she's the manager?

456
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,510
GALLERY DDK

457
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,080
KIM DONG RAN

458
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,400
That's her, Kim Dong Ran.

459
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,970
She is the daughter of the founder of DDK.
Her name is Kim Dong Ran.

460
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:48,040
She's the secret illegitimate daughter
of his father and his second wife.

461
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,245
Catering in the "Dawn" programme
was a great success,

462
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:54,071
and with the stepson
brother Kim Dong-taek,

463
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:58,680
competing for the company.
It's like the Hong Gil Dong of the rich.

464
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,925
That's why she's so authoritarian,
like any typical millionaire.

465
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,390
Do you know my half-brother?
We look alike, he just has a moustache.

466
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,930
You mean Mr. Kim Dong-Tek?

467
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,620
No, she knows him.
but my husband does.

468
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,670
They met in a shop
and became friends.

469
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,950
But my brother
doesn't have any normal friends.

470
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,660
- Excuse me?
- He hangs out with psychopaths.

471
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,470
Are your wedding dresses nice?

472
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:39,620
If you want some
a specific plan...

473
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,680
I don't like wedding dresses.
They're so white and pompous.

474
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,580
Like a cake you can't
you can't eat more than one bite.

475
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,920
They are indeed very sweet.

476
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,550
I hate sweets.

477
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,340
Well, draw something
that will suit my style.

478
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,510
I want a wedding dress
that represents who I am.

479
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,100
Okay, I'll do my best.

480
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,270
What size shoes do you wear?

481
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,390
Thirty-seven.

482
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,860
Your legs are swollen.

483
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,474
Take them off for a while.
You'll feel more comfortable.

484
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,031
But who is she?

485
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:35,751
They fit me perfectly.

486
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:48,234
They are my favorites.

487
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:51,213
See you next week.

488
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:52,750
Okay.

489
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,640
Right, it must be difficult
to live with constant attention.

490
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,610
He tries very hard
to sell her wedding dresses.

491
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,990
Now he's going for ramen.

492
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:30,250
Very strange, this woman,
she really scared me.

493
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,740
She told me they want to kill her.
And she seemed to be telling the truth.

494
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,070
So the rumours are true.

495
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,810
Her half-brother,
is from the father's first wife.

496
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,219
Despite the drugs and illegalities,
the father supports him.

497
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:48,239
But the sister is going to have a huge wedding
and the husband is a millionaire,

498
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,148
something he doesn't like.

499
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:53,189
She's spreading the word that she's going to get
father's company.

500
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:54,609
I don't understand.

501
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:59,645
He wants me to design the wedding dress,
when my brother is a friend of my husband's?

502
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:01,977
Never mind that she insulted him.

503
00:34:02,097 --> 00:34:04,259
What right did he have to do that?

504
00:34:04,379 --> 00:34:06,720
I was furious at what he said.

505
00:34:07,554 --> 00:34:09,183
She didn't like the plan.

506
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,044
- What? Why?
- He found it cloying.

507
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,470
I'm exhausted.

508
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,390
How I did
on my first mission?

509
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,159
I recognized the person he met
and did a quick check.

510
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,148
But nothing important came up.

511
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:38,018
Why not?
Is the choice of wedding dress unimportant?

512
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:39,507
Excuse me?

513
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Look.

514
00:34:42,587 --> 00:34:45,770
You want me to see where you're pointing.
Is there a moon tonight?

515
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,830
No, see if it's
her nails are painted.

516
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:53,082
When you watch a woman
pay attention to every detail.

517
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,432
HUANG SO RA

518
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,180
Chon Chi Hoon.
You're the best.

519
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,580
What is this?

520
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,578
Who's the dancer?
Wait a minute, is that you?

521
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,240
- Let me see it.
- Give it back.

522
00:35:22,417 --> 00:35:27,125
Did you take dance lessons?
I bet you had a teacher.

523
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,110
Yes.

524
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:40,330
Chang Du Bong
pawned his watch?

525
00:35:40,592 --> 00:35:42,442
Find out where he is in Jeju.

526
00:35:43,122 --> 00:35:45,482
I'm looking for it. See you.

527
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,880
- Where are you going?
- To gather information.

528
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,701
- In her shop?
- Yes.

529
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,972
You said he hates you.

530
00:35:56,092 --> 00:35:58,456
I can charm
a woman if I want to.

531
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:01,180
No, you can't.
Let's reconsider.

532
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,409
See you.

533
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,830
There's something strange
about Sophie's death.

534
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:17,270
I called her lab.

535
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,333
- And?
- I mentioned the article,

536
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:22,110
that said he got
an overdose of opiates.

537
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,270
And I asked them why
they didn't do something about it.

538
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,540
And what did they say?

539
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,962
That there is no
a person responsible for this.

540
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,838
The one you spoke to
was definitely the one in charge.

541
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
I agree.

542
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,550
The death of Sophie
is a mystery.

543
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:41,831
A leading scientist dies
under mysterious circumstances,

544
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,740
and someone wants to cover it up.

545
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,580
It's like a horror story.

546
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,510
Whoever tries
to know the truth...

547
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,950
He will be in mortal danger.

548
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,660
I was scared.

549
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,578
Director Kang,
you have a visitor.

550
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:01,710
- Did I have a date?
- He's a man.

551
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,060
Did you call a courier?

552
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,685
It's called Chon Chi Hoon.
He says you know him.

553
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:21,230
What are you doing here?

554
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,867
You got the good one.
You own the building, too?

555
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,774
It's the bank's.
I own the toilet.

556
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:31,137
I'm impressed that you called
a loan to buy it.

557
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,790
Hey, Doo Le.

558
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,280
How dare you come
in my shop?

559
00:37:44,782 --> 00:37:45,932
Come with me.

560
00:37:46,467 --> 00:37:47,917
I said, come with me.

561
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:54,350
It'll be done to the poor woman.

562
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:05,067
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

563
00:38:05,187 --> 00:38:07,060
Nice suit.

564
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,930
Leave it. Don't touch him.

565
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,620
She reminds me of my mother-in-law.

566
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,162
He was telling me how much they suit me
about evening suits.

567
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,309
Is your mother all right?

568
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,290
It's fine. We just broke up.
her blood pressure stopped rising.

569
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:29,802
You haven't told me what you want here.

570
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,273
I saw the article.

571
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,920
For your friend.

572
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:50,570
I know that night
you did everything you could.

573
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,161
But Chi Hun...

574
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,860
there's something strange.

575
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,760
The article states that he died
from an opiate overdose,

576
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,900
and her fiancé
returned to the United States as a fugitive,

577
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,040
and I can't find her parents.

578
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,410
From the laboratory of
they're not saying anything.

579
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,760
I was with her
the day it happened.

580
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,470
And I saw her right away
after her death.

581
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,320
How did you get there?

582
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,930
Sophie called me crying.

583
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,925
I should have gone earlier.

584
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Did he call you?
What did he say?

585
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,690
He asked me for help.

586
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,930
He told me that someone
someone else was helping her.

587
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,250
Anyone else?

588
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,570
I don't know.
It was like he was delirious.

589
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,785
It sounded like she was being chased.

590
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,685
What others
had she invited to her wedding?

591
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,180
I know about some
friends from college.

592
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,585
Doule, and...

593
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:56,283
- My husband.
- Your husband?

594
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,983
My Sophie met him.

595
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,053
She had invited me to a party
and that's where I first met him.

596
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,340
What? Does it bother you that I mention him?

597
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,180
I am a progressive man.

598
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,370
Why would it bother me?
I'm not old-fashioned.

599
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,345
I don't care at all
if you are or are not a progressive.

600
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,680
When are you coming back to Jeju?

601
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,103
I'm not coming back.

602
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,910
- You're not going?
- No.

603
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:29,450
- I'm going to write my book here.
- Where here?

604
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,150
You got a place to stay?

605
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:36,868
Since you brought it up.
Can you lend me some money?

606
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
- What?
- Only 40,000 euros.

607
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:45,815
Chi Hun is very confident.
Although I don't know why.

608
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:48,120
Wait a minute.

609
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,050
Who's that?

610
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Mrs.

611
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,680
Where's Director Kang?
Her appointment is here.

612
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,300
I'll go.

613
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,540
Welcome.
Arum is in a meeting.

614
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,750
What? We had a date.
I'm in a hurry.

615
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,280
Houses,
are very expensive in Seoul.

616
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,635
You're crazy.

617
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,800
Yes, things are happening today.

618
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,050
What's going on?

619
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,338
I completely forgot.

620
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,640
How did this happen to me?
Hang on, I'll be right back.

621
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,547
Wait for me here.
I'll go get a pair of sharp scissors.

622
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,240
Good evening.

623
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,010
The Director
is in the dressing room.

624
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,650
What a romantic man.

625
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,250
APPLICATION INSTALLATION

626
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,433
DO YOU WANT TO INSTALL
THE ARUM LOCATOR?

627
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,630
LOCALISATION INSTALLATION
THE LOCATOR IS INSTALLED

628
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,338
INVITATION TO THE WAKE
OF THE LATE SOPHIE ANN

629
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,540
Come on in.

630
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,460
Only here can
a man can relax.

631
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Yes.

632
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,457
Have we met?

633
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,630
Do I remind you of anyone
a friend from the army?

634
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,230
I'm often told.

635
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,210
- What corps did you serve in?
- I was in the Special Forces.

636
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:25,710
- As a doctor?
- As a shooter.

637
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,960
Very impressive.

638
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,300
How you become
a sniper in the army?

639
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:37,970
You have to aim well.
I trained in marksmanship.

640
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,390
I was an interpreter in the army.

641
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,960
You should speak good English.

642
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,230
I smoke American brand,
but I don't know English.

643
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:53,970
I always wanted...

644
00:43:55,161 --> 00:43:57,776
- to learn how to shoot a gun.
- Like this?

645
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,710
I can teach you.

646
00:44:02,308 --> 00:44:04,112
Is it possible?

647
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,920
Come to the shooting range
in Jongnum.

648
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,600
Are you a freelancer?

649
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,080
How did you know?

650
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,050
You're struggling with your tie.

651
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,190
I find ties stuffy.

652
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,528
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

653
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,630
When arrested
the accused in a trial,

654
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,322
they don't let them wear the tie.
You know why?

655
00:45:00,835 --> 00:45:01,835
Why?

656
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:04,309
So they don't kill themselves.

657
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:09,110
So the men carry
a potential weapon around their necks.

658
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,990
I feel safe
when I wear a tie.

659
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,420
Especially when he's tying me up
by my wife.

660
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,760
When he looks at me
and ties my tie,

661
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,866
it's like looking at her
kissing me.

662
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,953
I like it very much.

663
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,474
I see you're married.

664
00:45:48,785 --> 00:45:50,710
- Hello? Hello?
- What are you doing?

665
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,170
Why don't you go out?
That man came.

666
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,590
- Your ex-husband.
- I know.

667
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,707
- Did you see him?
- Yeah, I saw him.

668
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,768
Does he know who you are?

669
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:03,220
I hope not.

670
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,472
You had a fight?

671
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,140
Not yet.

672
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:08,809
Wait for me.

673
00:46:15,644 --> 00:46:18,210
I have to go.
It was nice talking to you.

674
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,944
And me.

675
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,190
Congratulations on your wedding.

676
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,988
- See you at the photo shoot, have a good trip.
- Bye.

677
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,250
- What did Chin Hu say?
- He asked me for $40,000.

678
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,570
I don't believe it.

679
00:47:11,118 --> 00:47:14,322
He wants me to give him the stuff,
that he didn't get after the divorce.

680
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:15,933
You still have them?

681
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,590
It's only
some old albums and stuff.

682
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:22,829
They keep these at their parents' house,
why do you still have his albums?

683
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,880
It just happened.

684
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,343
Do you really think he's here for a loan?

685
00:47:28,988 --> 00:47:31,110
Do you think he came
because he still loves me?

686
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,010
You're both joking.

687
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,940
You were here?

688
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,860
Your husband came in, and I said to him.
he'd find you in the dressing room.

689
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,290
You came without warning?

690
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,169
Welcome.
Long time no see.

691
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,312
- Last week I was here.
- You were?

692
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,720
- Looking for something?
- What?

693
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,410
Does this?

694
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,290
There it was.

695
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,030
I'm a forgetful person.

696
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,199
I thought I'd cheer you up.

697
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,230
I was worried about you.

698
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,587
How the meeting went
with Kim Dong Ran?

699
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,025
I left barefoot.

700
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,680
Let's have dinner tonight.

701
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,180
I'm sorry, but I have plans.
Go somewhere with Du Le.

702
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,200
You're leaving now?

703
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,582
I came to see you and you're fine.
I'm leaving.

704
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,560
- Hey, Doo Le.
- Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

705
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,410
They used it
for strangulation?

706
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:19,414
I was worried about you,
but you weren't crying after all.

707
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,379
I've told you before.

708
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:25,050
Here we are like the smiling ones
postmen.

709
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,653
I can't receive
brides with tears.

710
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:31,280
We tell the bride only good news,
before her wedding.

711
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,020
What's the matter?

712
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,520
See you later.

713
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,333
BEST ESCAPES

714
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,420
Jesus.

715
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,715
CHON CHI HUN

716
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,194
Sucker.

717
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,159
But you're not?

718
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,300
How long has it been?

719
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,622
Are you all right?
I was living abroad.

720
00:51:26,471 --> 00:51:28,371
That's why I haven't seen you in a while.

721
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:32,060
Your girlfriend comes here often.

722
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,330
- My girlfriend?
- The girl you brought the other day.

723
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,450
No way.

724
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,310
It's her.

725
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,783
Now she is a very good shooter.

726
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,020
KANGRAK DONG CHURCH

727
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,090
Hello, Mr. Park Sang-wan.

728
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,781
I am a recruiter for GV.
My name is Chon Woon Sang.

729
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,750
I was surprised by your email.

730
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:32,560
I didn't know Sophie
was so appreciative of my research.

731
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,510
I talked to Sophie
and I asked her,

732
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,378
to suggest the best
in nuclear fusion,

733
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:42,214
and the first to mention,
was you.

734
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:46,420
GV is an up-and-coming company
with capital,

735
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,320
The compensation package
will be very competitive.

736
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:53,210
He wrote you a letter of recommendation
before her death.

737
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,360
Dr. Anne Sophie...

738
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,350
I admired her a lot,

739
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,240
but in the factory
there was a shortage of staff.

740
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,190
That's why I, too.
I was thinking of going elsewhere.

741
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:11,112
- He tried to help me...
- Dr. Anne Sophie,

742
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:13,780
is a
a very caring man.

743
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,830
I guess...

744
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:18,020
was a caring man.

745
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,657
He had a big heart.

746
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:22,420
Dr. Sophie.

747
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,290
Her death
is a loss to the country.

748
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,993
- How sad.
- The bastards.

749
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,380
He died, and they...

750
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,936
I mean the people in charge
of the laboratory.

751
00:53:33,986 --> 00:53:37,506
I never liked them,
but why are they so malicious?

752
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,270
They do not accept requests for interviews,
related to her death.

753
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,180
And let me accept that.

754
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,354
They also ban scientists
to speak to the press.

755
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,850
That makes me nervous. And the employees
following orders, one of the same.

756
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,720
What did Dr. Anne Sophie do wrong?

757
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,290
It's tragic that he died
so young.

758
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,313
The world is a very cruel place.

759
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,335
To see
if they'll come to the memorial.

760
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,411
You arranged the memorial
and sent out invitations, didn't you?

761
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,650
Yes.

762
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,870
I felt I had to
to say goodbye properly.

763
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,370
That was the right thing to do.

764
00:54:15,965 --> 00:54:18,680
That's why I sent an invitation
to her colleagues.

765
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:21,770
I already had their phone numbers.

766
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:27,690
- I'm sorry.
- You have to wash it.

767
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,840
It doesn't matter, it doesn't burn.

768
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:32,580
- It burns.
- Excuse me.

769
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,180
Don't worry,
I'm going to the bathroom anyway.

770
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,350
Excuse me.

771
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,040
Good.

772
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,810
Do you think the VIP
we're looking for will come?

773
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:52,030
Someone important is coming.

774
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,000
- Who?
- Someone I met in church.

775
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,700
CURRENT POSITION OF THE ARUM

776
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:56,490
Excuse me.

777
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,950
You're Park Seung-hwan, right?

778
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes, sir.

779
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,920
Thank you for coming
to the memorial service.

780
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,340
I had to come.

781
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,610
But yet, very few came.

782
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,710
The lab didn't let
the staff to attend.

783
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:21,375
Only a few of her neighbors
and a talent scout.

784
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,440
I wonder where they're sitting.

785
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,760
I have something to ask you.

786
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,610
It's something I couldn't
I couldn't ask over the phone.

787
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,280
Sophie had problems
with anyone?

788
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,910
He always behaved professionally
around everyone.

789
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,020
Of course, that's what it was like.

790
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,310
But...

791
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:51,414
in case someone was provoking her
trouble?

792
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,520
- Was she being followed?
- What?

793
00:56:57,736 --> 00:56:58,770
I don't know.

794
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:01,280
She spent all her time
in the workshop

795
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:03,530
and then go straight home.

796
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,760
He had no time for meetings.

797
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,280
He certainly didn't.

798
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,340
Did anything strange happen...

799
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,290
before the wedding?

800
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,590
Before the wedding?

801
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,644
Did he have any visitors?

802
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,630
Yeah, I remember something.

803
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,250
Something strange happened.

804
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,430
- What?
- You asked me to house-sit for her

805
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,900
when they were on their honeymoon.

806
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,010
So I went to her house
to tell me what plants to water.

807
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,960
And it struck
her landline phone.

808
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,030
Nobody has a constant these days.
But she had one.

809
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,480
It was dusty.

810
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,820
As if he rarely used it.

811
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:51,890
When he answered, he went outside.

812
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,120
I was out in the garbage too.

813
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,910
It looked like he was cheating.

814
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:58,800
It was very strange.

815
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,396
Who would come to see her
a few days before the wedding?

816
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:05,096
- Doesn't that seem strange to you?
- Absolutely.

817
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,340
- Did you see who it was?
- No, I didn't make it.

818
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,740
But I remember the sound.

819
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,300
- Was it a sports car?
- Yes.

820
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:20,470
Lives in a quiet neighbourhood
and the noise was too loud.

821
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:33,628
SOFI IF

822
00:59:56,229 --> 00:59:57,580
Hello, Mr. Park?

823
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,450
I'm Sophie's friend.

824
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,870
Do you make
Sophie's door?

825
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,570
I think you should come here.

826
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,180
Okay.

827
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,400
Who are you?

828
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,290
It's here, right?

829
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,010
CURRENT POSITION OF THE ARUM

830
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,590
What are you going to do?

831
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:14,610
You there.

832
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,760
Go and help her.

833
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,330
Do you need an ambulance?

834
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,730
Call the police,
please.

835
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,530
Don't be in a hurry.

836
01:03:43,374 --> 01:03:44,374
Yes.

837
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,250
Chin Hoon's ex-wife
is brave.

838
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,250
Although he was bleeding
he treated it like a man.

839
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:55,720
Okay, I'll be back.

840
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,590
I was driving like I was holding a formula
on a country road.

841
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,354
The guy was a pro.

842
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,904
Most likely to
he had a fake license plate.

843
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,140
- How's Arum?
- Yong-gu took her to the hospital.

844
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,540
Looks okay.

845
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,540
You have the guest list
for the wedding?

846
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,390
Hurry back to the office.

847
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,670
Rest.

848
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,470
Okay, thanks.

849
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,920
Please?

850
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:49,990
Where are you?

851
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,210
- Hospital. I'm shutting you down.
- Hospital?

852
01:04:53,444 --> 01:04:55,650
- Why?
- If it's not urgent, I'll see you.

853
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,992
It's urgent.

854
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:58,042
What?

855
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:03,020
It's about that loan
I told you about.

856
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:06,520
Can I borrow it?
And 30,000 euros again is possible.

857
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,830
No, I'll give you 40,000.

858
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,330
But I'm gonna hit you
for every 10 euros.

859
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,300
When you come to pick them up
come in an ambulance.

860
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:24,662
Looks fine to me.

861
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:27,730
Come here.

862
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,310
Do you eat flowers?

863
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,520
AN ERROR OCCURRED

864
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,400
Emergency.
The radiator's broken.

865
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:12,510
Excuse me.

866
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,110
Yes.

867
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,850
Did he go there?

868
01:06:26,447 --> 01:06:27,447
Done.

869
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,970
WIFE

870
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:03,060
I have a meeting.

871
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,260
Sorry, I'll call you later.

872
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,900
Excuse me.

873
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:16,940
Do you know where I can find
the pretty boy who brought me here?

874
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,790
I didn't see him.

875
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:22,060
Is he gone?
I never got to thank him.

876
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:25,240
Did he leave his number at all?

877
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,620
I don't know.

878
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:27,980
Okay.

879
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:32,120
A good-looking pretty boy.

880
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,820
Over here.

881
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,110
What's going on?

882
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:42,400
You said you saw a sports car
that night, right?

883
01:07:43,588 --> 01:07:49,138

IN THE NEXT EPISODE

890
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:22,810
- Don't treat her like a suspect.
- Get Arum.

891
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,797
We must protect
the witness.

892
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:27,120
What kind of karma is this?

893
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,960
They are not finished
Your troubles are over.

894
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,890
Don't be like that, please.

895
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:35,590
If I told her my real job
would we still be together?

896
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,000
I have a responsibility.

897
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,970
It is not only fate that unites us,
but also separates us.

898
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,645
I'll handle it.

899
01:08:41,765 --> 01:08:44,883
A sheriff?
Would he save Sophie?

900
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:46,190
Who could it be?
