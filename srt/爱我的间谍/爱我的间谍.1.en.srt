00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,799
Really?

360

Why didn't I notice that?

361
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,441
Wrap things up there.
The target is in the elevator.

362
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:29,906
Here.

Excuse me.

368

371

- Restroom?
- This way.

372
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,577
Min-sung is on the run.

373
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,637
Grab Jade Ryu.

374
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:36,205
Watch Elevator number four.

375
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:42,269
Five, four, three...

376
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,632
Ji-hun, he's on the third floor.

377
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:17,068
Gosh.

378
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,027
They are fighting over there.

379
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:04,291
We've got Min-sung.

380
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,265
[Thanks.]

381
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:39,819
Yes, I explained it.

382
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:42,291
There were no damages to the property.

383
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:43,828
Okay.

384
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
What?

385
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:04,943
Excuse me.

386
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,819
You don't have to get up.
I'll take a seat.

387
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:18,897
Thanks for what you did for me.

388
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,050
Don't mention it.

389

Are you all right?

390
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:30,594
Yes. You recovered my tablet

391
00:33:30,664 --> 00:33:32,187
so we're fine.

392
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,563
Are you sure you're fine?

393
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:36,698
Did you have a drink?

394
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:39,374
I just got started.

395
00:33:45,548 --> 00:33:46,901
That's a wedding dress.

00:33:57,084 --> 00:33:57,886
Wow.

399
00:33:57,956 --> 00:33:59,910
I've never met
a wedding dress designer before.

400
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:01,614
You're single, I see.

401
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,140
Come to see me when you get married.

402
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,643
I'll give you a big discount.

403
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:07,387
I'm planning on staying single.

404
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:11,467
Most of the grooms who come
to my shop say that, too.

405
00:34:11,537 --> 00:34:15,977
You know, it's those guys
who cry at their wedding.

406
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:17,470
Crying tears of joy.

407
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,286
That's a glamorous dress.

408
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,099
Those are fake pearls, right?

409
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,628
I'm going to throw it out.

410
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:31,783
What? Why would you?

411
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:35,060
It got torn.

412
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,065
Just like my heart.

413
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,823
Last year,

414
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,784
one of my clients canceled a dress order

415
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:44,862
after she found out the truth
about her fiance.

416
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:48,791
She told me before leaving that

417
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,432
she never wanted to see
another white dress again.

418
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:55,847
I called her to see how she was doing

419
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:57,731
and she told me she couldn't walk.

420
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:00,388
Her feet would hurt

421
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:03,655
whenever she tried to walk.

422
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,331
Her dream was shattered into tiny pieces

423
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:09,568
and it felt like she was walking
on top of them.

424
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,590
I think I know how that feels now.

425
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:19,371
I'm sorry for her.

426
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:24,182
I'll buy that dress.

427
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,421
It's expensive.

428
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:30,762
Don't they give out discounts
for scratched refrigerators?

429
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,184
But you said you'll stay single.

430
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:36,630
I'm going to give it to a celibate person.

431
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:45,690

00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,765
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

433
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:50,872
Hi, Ji-hun!

434
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:04,062
We hold free group weddings
for migrant workers

435
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:09,705
and couples who can't afford to
hold a wedding.

436
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:14,807
Someone donated this dress
a long time ago.

437
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:17,372
I added the lace frills and beads myself

438
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,850
to make it prettier.

439
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,895
So my friends send me
lace patterns to help out

440
00:36:22,965 --> 00:36:25,852
whenever they go on a trip abroad.

441
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:30,502
I've married 17 couples so far.

442
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:35,032
You sewed this yourself?

443
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,103
Yes.

444
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:38,861
You're a better seamstress than I am.

445
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,111
I have something to show you.

446
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:47,791
I don't know if you'll like it.

447
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:50,738
It's beautiful.

448
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,392
It's from Belgium.

449
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,945
- Made in Belgium?
- Yes.

450
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,221
Shall I try it on?

451
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,095
Would you like to?

452
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:00,671
Let me help you.

453
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:03,146
Now, stand still.

454
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:08,158
I didn't expect to sell
that dress to a Catholic nun.

455
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,535
It was like selling a fridge to an Eskimo.

456
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,342
Thanks.

457
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:16,817

Well, promise to buy an expensive dress
from my shop someday.

00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:22,941

00:37:24,394 --> 00:37:26,068
So you're a travel writer?

461
00:37:26,138 --> 00:37:29,125
No wonder you know about
these hidden places.

462
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:33,746
But I don't bring just anyone here.

463
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,685
Is that your pickup line?

464
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,577
Yes.

465
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,263
What's the success rate?

466
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:44,590
Honestly, it's much harder to pick up

467
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,286
a girl on a trip than at a nightclub.

468
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,616
In that case, you would have better luck

469
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,721
picking up a girl at a club
while traveling.

470
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:55,816
I've already tried that.

471
00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,692
You should get a different job.

472
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,917
I wish I could.

473
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,429
A travel writer doesn't make a lot.
And traveling can be grueling.

474
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,117
You get hungry and lonely.

475
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,284
The worst is when you get sick on a trip.

476
00:38:09,848 --> 00:38:11,531

00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,733
There are good times.

542
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:14,740
Life isn't always pleasant.

543
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,143
When it gets tough,

544
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:17,797
we're trapped in a dark place.

545
00:43:18,218 --> 00:43:20,062
But my husband is someone

546
00:43:20,122 --> 00:43:23,349
who will always stay by my side.

547
00:43:24,342 --> 00:43:26,496
He's earned my trust.

548
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:28,932
That's why I married him.

549
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:32,851
What if Derrick is the darkness?

550
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:35,256
Oh, my!

551
00:43:36,078 --> 00:43:38,784
Oh, gosh. This can't be happening.
I was so careful.

552
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,077
What should we do?

553
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:42,813
I'll get this fixed somewhere.

554
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,540
Where? You would have to go downtown.

555
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,762
I know a place.

556
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,168
I'll go straight to
the bachelorette party after I'm done.

557
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:52,345
Okay.

558
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:05,074
A source is very precious to an agent.

559
00:44:05,134 --> 00:44:07,008
Even though you have no blood relation,

560
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,937
the source is risking his or her life
for you.

561
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:15,067
- I know.
- You can't afford to make a mistake.

562
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:16,137
You aware of that?

563
00:44:19,086 --> 00:44:20,990
Protect your source.

564
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,473
Don't make the same mistake twice.

565
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:26,252
Be mindful to not trust

566
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:31,243
your source completely.

567
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:33,478
When you're dating someone?

568
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:37,123
- Don't cheat.
- When you're investigating a case?

569
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:38,155
Watch out of double spies.

570
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:41,036
- When your gut tells you it won't work.
- Then follow your gut.

571
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:43,281
Bingo.

572
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,342
Don't mess up.

573
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,908
You have to perform well for my sake.

574
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,359
Right.

575
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,097
Look for some smugglers.

576
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:00,971
I heard some smuggle bigshots.

578
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:43,137
Hi, Ji-hun!

579

How have you been?

580
00:45:47,507 --> 00:45:49,681
I was in town, so I dropped by to see you.

581
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:51,335
I'm glad you came.

582
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,861
I have something to ask you about.

583
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:57,740
You mentioned how there was a guy
stealing money from migrant workers.

584
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,293
He offers to smuggle them into Japan.

585
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:03,252
Is he still causing problems?

586
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:05,317
He stopped showing up since last year.

587
00:46:06,129 --> 00:46:07,823
I heard that he went to Busan.

588
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:10,647
Busan?

589
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:24,110
Goodbye, Reverend Mother.

590

591

Yes?

Oh, it's nothing. Take care.

593
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:34,149
Take care of yourself. I'll visit again.

594

Still, don't eat your hair.

What brings you here?

606
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:39,597
A wedding.

607
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,710
You already had a wedding.

608
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:41,892
Not mine.

609

So what are you doing here?

00:48:50,602 --> 00:48:52,807
Writing another travel book
that nobody buys?

612
00:48:52,877 --> 00:48:55,934
I wrote a new book. Do you want one?
With my autograph.

613
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:00,805
Your signature on the divorce papers
was enough for me.

614
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:02,309
Don't be like that.

615
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:04,684
Foreign couples stay as friends
after a divorce.

616
00:49:04,754 --> 00:49:06,959
You should've married a foreigner then.

617
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:10,146
Forget it.
There's no way to get through to you.

618
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:11,686
You were so full of yourself.

619

What? We had good communication.

620
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:18,666
That only happened twice
during our entire marriage.

621
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:20,546
The time we got married
and when we got divorced.

622
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,096
I regret that it even happened once.

623
00:49:27,596 --> 00:49:29,230
I should've just kept to myself.

624
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,435
Yes. You should've stayed away from me

Okay. I won't stay out too late.

I expected you to have changed a little.

that Harrison works for Helmes.

720
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:38,889
Who is the source?

721
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,046
Who do you think it is?

722
00:55:50,846 --> 00:55:53,221
The scientist you're in love with.

723
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:55,356
She's leading the EcoSun project.

724
00:55:55,426 --> 00:55:57,186
You invested a lot of time
to bring her over.

725
00:55:57,231 --> 00:55:59,055
She's the Interpol informant.

726
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:03,204
Why would she?

727
00:56:03,785 --> 00:56:05,339
She's getting married.

728
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,057
Marriage can change people.

729
00:56:09,468 --> 00:56:12,315
She's not going to put up
with your threats anymore.

730
00:56:12,385 --> 00:56:14,249
She devotes her life to pure research.

731
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,715
The money you pay her
only compounds her guilt.

732
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:21,706
[E-Ticket, Sophie Ahn]

733
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:23,099
[Arrival: Singapore]

734
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:53,168
I don't believe it.
Sophie would never do such a thing.

735
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:56,806
She did far more than you could imagine.

736
00:56:57,257 --> 00:56:59,402
She took research money from you

737
00:56:59,472 --> 00:57:02,298
but tried to sell the artificial sun
technology to the highest bidder.

738
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:04,714
- Really?
- Yes.

739
00:57:04,784 --> 00:57:09,054
Then she got cold feet at the last minute
and went to the Interpol.

740
00:57:14,616 --> 00:57:16,972
I don't believe it. I refuse to.

741
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,134
How can I believe what you say?

742
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,995
We got an offer from her, too.

743
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,325
Buddy, could you get your hands
on that technology?

744
00:57:27,395 --> 00:57:30,031
I'll pay more for it than anyone else.

745
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:33,730
Selling it will provide the seed money
for our business venture.

746
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,735
Who else knows about this?

747
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:43,843
Everybody will find out soon.
It's just a matter of time.

748
00:57:43,913 --> 00:57:46,068
I can't guarantee she'll be safe
for much longer.

749
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,828
You know where she is, don't you?

750
00:58:05,822 --> 00:58:07,356
- Buddy.
- Yes.

751
00:58:07,426 --> 00:58:08,288
You look tired.

752
00:58:08,358 --> 00:58:10,553
Me? I'm fine.

753
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:15,534
Get some rest.

754
00:58:45,041 --> 00:58:46,535
An arrow lock pattern?

755
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:50,093
I'll change mine to that one, too.

756
00:58:50,163 --> 00:58:52,518
Love is about facing the same direction.

757
00:58:54,844 --> 00:58:57,500
Be careful so it's not
in the opposite direction.

758
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:03,624
In that event, it'll go that way.

759
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,004
Knowing a password doesn't mean
you unlock any secrets.

760
00:59:08,956 --> 00:59:10,249
I don't care about secrets.

761
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,075
Having lots of secrets brings wealth.

762
00:59:13,135 --> 00:59:15,661
You can keep separate bank funds.

763
00:59:16,914 --> 00:59:20,211
But don't let me find your darkest secret.

764
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:26,696
I told you I disliked marriage.

765
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:28,648
So do I.

766
00:59:29,492 --> 00:59:31,116
Choosing to...

767
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,729
marry someone is the worst mistake
that even ordinary, nice folks make.

768
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:39,976
Then why do you design wedding dresses?

769
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:44,326
It makes me love
wedding dresses even more.

770
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,606
Because I know that marriage is hard work.

771
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:52,084
So I want to dress the bride
with something beautiful.

772
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:57,336
My mother made hanbok dresses.

773
00:59:57,917 --> 01:00:00,262
Hanbok wedding dresses to be exact.

774
01:00:00,322 --> 01:00:02,988
She married my dad
who wasn't a good provider.

775
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,827
But she hated it
when people told her that.

776
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:09,223
She rejected those comments.

777
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:12,029
When she sewed hanbok dresses,
she wished good luck to the bride.

778
01:00:12,099 --> 01:00:14,284
So that made her a spreader of luck.

779
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:19,165
I understand

780
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:22,412
my mom better
after I started designing dresses.

781
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,520
Wishing good fortune to others

782
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:29,438
makes me happier.

783
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,295
Look at the sun.

784
01:00:32,365 --> 01:00:36,394
I can never own it.

785
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:42,809
But I want it and can feel it right now,

786
01:00:44,573 --> 01:00:47,800
so it's shining for me. Right?

787
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,618
We both hate the same things.

788
01:01:01,561 --> 01:01:02,814
How does this sound?

789
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:05,390
Instead of doing what we like,

790
01:01:06,342 --> 01:01:09,129
how about we do
what we don't like together?

791
01:01:52,026 --> 01:01:53,038
Why you...

792
01:01:56,135 --> 01:01:58,861
Is it that you didn't change
or couldn't change?

793
01:02:01,357 --> 01:02:03,662
Are you sure it was Doo-bong?

794
01:02:03,732 --> 01:02:07,341
Yes. He's the guy who worked
at the casino two years ago, right?

795
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:08,794
He came to exchange US dollars.

796
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,741
Who was he with?

797
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:15,449
They were young guys.
I think they were Chinese.

798
01:02:21,252 --> 01:02:24,309
[Doo-bong didn't go down to Jeju
to pick oranges.]

799
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:27,176
[About your source...]

800
01:02:27,236 --> 01:02:30,834
I think your source
contacted Doo-bong, too.

801
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:34,863
If your source was in possession of
valuable technology,

802
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:38,121
it would be smarter to sell it
to a rival firm than to go to Interpol.

803
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:42,300
[Your source hasn't called yet, right?]

804
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:45,828
It's easy to read what they're thinking.

805
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:47,823
You should look for Doo-bong first.

806
01:02:48,905 --> 01:02:49,997
Hold on.

807
01:02:52,623 --> 01:02:54,728
- The source contacted me.
- You received a message?

808
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:55,798
Yes.

809
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:59,890
"I would like to invite you
to my bachelorette party."

810
01:03:00,311 --> 01:03:02,091
"I'd like to invite you
to my bachelorette party."

811
01:03:02,115 --> 01:03:05,894
"On the day of the wedding,
before meeting the VIP,"

812
01:03:05,964 --> 01:03:07,958
"you need to find the bride first."

813
01:03:09,672 --> 01:03:11,586
"I will be waiting for you, Sheriff."

814
01:03:11,647 --> 01:03:12,869
Sheriff?

815
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,573
Dress code...

816
01:03:15,024 --> 01:03:18,121
I have to get dressed as a sheriff?

817
01:03:19,344 --> 01:03:20,898
But why?

818
01:03:36,463 --> 01:03:38,888
Good evening. Thank you.

819
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:48,149
There's a sheriff coming. Let him through.

820
01:03:58,673 --> 01:04:00,508
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

821
01:04:00,578 --> 01:04:01,750
You look so pretty.

822
01:04:01,811 --> 01:04:03,454
- Thank you.
- You're such a pretty bride.

823
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:04,457
Thanks.

824
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:06,641
- I'll talk to you later.
- Later.

825
01:04:21,215 --> 01:04:23,069
Oh, the dress code.

826
01:04:40,478 --> 01:04:41,932
I'm exhausted.

827
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:44,107
Do we get off soon?

828
01:04:44,918 --> 01:04:47,093
- There's one hour left.
- An hour?

829
01:04:47,163 --> 01:04:49,138
- Did you do your shift?
- Yes, I did.

830
01:04:49,198 --> 01:04:50,391
Take more rest.

831
01:05:12,782 --> 01:05:14,235
I hope I don't meet someone I know.

832
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:33,358
Where is the bride?

833
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:35,804
Go check the VIP room.

834
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,506
I have to find the bride.

835
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:58,115
Sophie!

836
01:06:07,726 --> 01:06:09,480
Do you know...

837
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:11,320
- Where is the bride?
- Sorry?

838
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:14,401
- Where is the bride?
- Where is the bride?

839
01:06:14,612 --> 01:06:17,068
- I don't know. Sorry.
- I don't know. Sorry.

840
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:29,947
I can't make it

841
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:31,899
to your wedding tomorrow.

842
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:33,304
Is that why you're here?

843
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,377
I'm talking about you.

844
01:06:34,447 --> 01:06:35,499
Your cover is blown.

845
01:06:38,025 --> 01:06:39,248
- What?
- Why...

846
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,656
Why did you betray us, Sophie?

847
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:57,339
Sheriff, dance with us.

848
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,973
Dance for us.

849
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,451
- I'm not a...
- Oh, yes. You can do it.

850
01:07:26,114 --> 01:07:28,339
I'll cover your tracks.
So give me the files.

851
01:07:29,322 --> 01:07:31,496
I'll take care of it. Let me help you.

852
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:32,789
Your life is in danger.

853
01:07:33,271 --> 01:07:34,563
I'll help you.

854
01:07:38,252 --> 01:07:39,252
Over here!

855
01:07:40,026 --> 01:07:41,349
Get him out of here.

856
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,603
He's a stalker.

857
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:50,239
Sophie!

858
01:07:52,103 --> 01:07:53,557
Sophie!

859
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,333
Sophie!

860
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:18,253
Where's the bride?

861
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:19,405
Who is that?

862
01:08:20,157 --> 01:08:21,861
He looks kind of familiar.

863
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,715
Where's the bride?

864
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,613
Sophie?

865
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:35,792
The bride!

866
01:09:04,167 --> 01:09:06,291
Sophie?

867
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,943
Oh, no.

[That's how we met again.]

we fell in love with each other.]
