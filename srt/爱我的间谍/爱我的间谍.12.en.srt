He killed Sophie.

That was Arum, wasn't it?

Doo Le, where are you?

Yes?

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
Arum?

20
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:29,529
And where are you?

21
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:31,886
Okay, I'll find out.

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,320
Wait there for now.

Arrest Chon Chi Hoon.

27
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,070
Okay.

28
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,670
I see.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,700
I'll call Detective Kim.

30
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
Thank you.

31
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,160
Accused
of stealing a necklace.

32
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,930
Necklace?

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,480
So they intend to
to go after Arum?

34
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,250
What happened?

35
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,800
Have we been robbed again?

36
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,040
Did you call the police?
Did you get him?

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,400
- Yes, it's Arum.
- What?

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,920
Arum was arrested.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,360
I'm going to the station.

40
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,077
What?

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,810
- These are not real.
- How?

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,250
If they were real,
I wouldn't have to work again.

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,220
What happened?

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,318
What has Arum gotten herself into now?
Why?

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,330
Chi Hun is smart.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,930
He will understand that something is going on and from the
our breathing. We can't lose him.

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,990
Yes, Chi Hun.

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,260
We're almost there.
Get out.

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,590
- Bess.
- Chief, you came too?

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,400
Once in, press it.

52
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,200
- Have you heard anything?
- Get in.

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,250
Bess.

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
What's the matter?

55
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,240
- What are you doing?
- Start.

56
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,934
- What's the matter?
- Go ahead.

57
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,379
- Chief.
- If you want to know why,

58
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,610
explain why you joined
into the secret system of the Helmes.

59
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,273
What are you talking about, Chief?

60
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
So Ra.

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Sir.

62
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,930
- Don't hit the brakes.
- I have to stop first.

63
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,780
Pull over, I'll drive.

64
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,630
Sir.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,780
Sit down.

66
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,350
Wait.

67
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,130
Get him.

68
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,900
Stop it.

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
Open the door.

70
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,700
Get him.

71
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,100
Damn him.

What?

75
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,010
Will he be imprisoned?

76
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,720
We found the stolen necklace
in her shop.

77
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,720
We can't leave her.

78
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,750
But you know,

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,670
the bridal house
is not a pawnshop.

80
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,630
Is there anything else going on
in this case?

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Detective.

82
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,680

It's me.

What are you doing?

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,940
Arum?

92
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,050
He will be imprisoned.

93
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,220
The necklace they found
was stolen.

94
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,660
Someone called
that they'd find it there.

95
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,360
Someone did it on purpose
this to Arum.

96
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,450
What's the matter?

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,180
Listen carefully.

98

You were right.

99
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,470
Our team is leaking.

100
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,370
They're trying to trap me.

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,350
I think you do too.

Both of us.

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,350
Both of us are in danger.

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,750
- Chi Hun.
- My informant.

105
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,790
Please
take care of Peter.

106
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,910
Peter?

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,100
That was your informant?

108
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,700
Peter's dead.

109
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,720
Take care of Arum for me.

Stay there, I'm coming.

112
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,190

113
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,810

118
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,980
Derek,

119
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,500
if you ever find
Sophie's killer,

120
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,800
can you kill him?

121
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,840
Did you really love her?

122
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,036
She had very little of it.

123
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,830
I would have made her unhappy.

124
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,900
Yes, Chief Ban?

125
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,380
Chi Hun did this?

126
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
No.

127
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,470
No, I don't know.

128
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,110
That night,

129
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,907
the night we became murderers,
fugitives and thieves,

130
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,066
I had a feeling,
while I was in prison.

131
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,570
Some invisible karmic relationship,

132
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,897
had tied us together.

133
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,397
But in the end,

134
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,360
he would have taken us away.

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,590
NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICE

136
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,990
No, that doesn't mean we have to
we have to take over Ekosan.

137
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,140
Why...

138
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
How?

139
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,327
Did we sell them? No.

140
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,000
We did not sell secrets,
why is he mad at us?

141
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,520
Okay, I get it.

142
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Listen.

143
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Listen.

144
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,310
He hung up on me?

145
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,240
You scoundrel.

146
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,590
Now he wants to mess with me?

147
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
What?

148
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,530
Did you come to brag?

149
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,630
The Ekosan is
a big headache for you, isn't it?

150
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,590
Let's be pragmatic.

151
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,140
The six-point agreement was destroyed.

152
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,629
This ship has sailed.

153
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,530
He's gone.

154
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,450
It automatically goes to number 2,
which means the US takes over.

155
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,270
Where does it mean it's time
to start sharing what you know.

156
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,220
So that's why you came
to my humble office?

157
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,420
Well, look at you.

158
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,930
You said the deal was ruined,
why should we give it to you?

159
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,130
Even if you take it, it's worthless.

160
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,940
Even the hacker couldn't
to find the code.

161
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,420
It's all over.

162
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,310
They're still pushing me for Harrison.

163
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,660
Is he still alive?

164
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,208
Do whatever you want.
Give him to us or keep him.

165
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm hungry.

166
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,468
I'll order Chinese.
You want anything?

167
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,860
I heard you have a leak.

168
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,180
I heard about your spy.

169
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,930
So the CIA
is doing some work.

170
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,860
A word of advice.

171
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,290
Disband the team.

172
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,690
Now the CIA is getting involved
in our affairs.

173
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,450
I'm starving.

174
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,320
If you want to protect
your people,

175
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,070
you have to take them away,
as far away from here as possible.

176
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,490
I'm getting closer, with Harrison.
Let me handle this.

177
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,180
You're in charge of Helmes,

178
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,300
I'll take care of Ekosan.

179
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,890
Okay?

180
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,050
I'm a mess, aren't I?

181
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,050
No.

182
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,290
It's the blur effect.

183
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,990
I saw Detective Kim yesterday,

184
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,460
and I talked to a lawyer.
I told him everything.

185
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,640
And what did he say?

186
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,980
Did Chi-Hun find anything?

187
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,930
Don't worry while you're inside.

188
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,100
- I'll take care of it, don't worry.
- Darling.

189
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,260
They say that love
and sneezing are not hidden.

190
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,189
Also,

191
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,888
you can't hide
that you've been crying all night.

192
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,080
All this happened because of me.

193
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,200
I can't stay any longer.

194
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,600
Your eyes will swell
if I stay here any longer.

195
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I've got to get out of here fast.

196
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,730
Don't tell my mom
that I'm in jail.

197
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,350
He still has bad memories
of my father in prison.

198
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,750
Now I find myself
and I'm in his position.

199
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,140
What a life she has.

200
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,920
I became a seamstress like my mother,
and I went to prison like my father.

201
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,480
I hope my ancestors
to forgive me someday.

202
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,930
Don't forget to pay
the bills.

203
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,470
When I get out of prison,

204
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,940
Bring me tofu
from my favorite restaurant, okay?

205
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,840
I had more to tell you.

206
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,340
How long did he stay?

207
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,060
Visiting hours are over.
Don't you have anything to tell me?

208
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,490
I have.

209
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,080
Tell me what it is.

210
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,350
I love you.

211
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,120
I love you.

212
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,430
I love you.

213
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,880
All right, that's enough.

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,200
I have one more.

215
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,740
Okay, now go.

216
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,050
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,760
- Chi Hun.
- Call me if anything changes.

218
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,050
Okay.

219
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,600
They found a stolen necklace
in Arum's shop.

220
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,520
He is now in prison.

221
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,170
What the hell is going on?
Chi Hun is following her example.

222
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,670
You didn't know?

223
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,610
These two are made
for each other.

224
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,360
Chi Hun was meeting secretly
with Agent Pil Ho in Montevez.

225
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,670
- What?
- Where's Pil Ho?

226
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,210
- We can't find him.
- Since when?

227
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,610
Chin Hun
met with Phil Ho...

228
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,180
No way.

229
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,020
Was he leaking secrets to Pil Ho?

230
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,820
Because all the elements
is against him?

231
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,120
So Ra, ask Du Bong
if he knows where Pil Ho is.

232
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,120
From now on, you're fired
from Interpol's Asia Bureau,

233
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,490
and you will not receive
other support.

234
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:35,557
- Chief.
- But, Chief...

235
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:49,690
That was my first job.

236
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,680
I couldn't even manage
to get my parents a present.

237
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,510
Don't talk.

238
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,690
I used my savings
to pay the hacker.

239
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,120
He can't
The Chief can't do this to us.

240
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,990
We don't know yet
if the leak is Chi Hoon.

241
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,130
We should have caught him yesterday.

242
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,230
So suddenly, it can disappear,
as if he were a ghost.

243
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,950
That's why it's
our best agent.

244
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,420
Where are you going?

245
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,280
Let me see Mr. O.
I ordered a surveillance device.

246
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,850
Can I at least open
a research office.

247
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,040
- Are you measuring it with this?
- You said you didn't have time for gold digging.

248
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,410
Hold still.

249
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,420
I think you're a size 17.

250
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,046
What size are you?
Let me measure you.

251
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,070
Give it to me.

252
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,060
It hurts.

253
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,250
It is difficult.
Wait.

254
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:56,850
You cut off my circulation.

255
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,340
- It's not coming out.
- It hurts.

256
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,390
Wait.

257
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,230
There you go.

258
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,480
Now you have a ring.
It's a ring.

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,590
I told you I was in pain.

260
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,620
I wasn't expecting a ring,
but not a scar.

261
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,192
There is a snack in such a shape.
It has sesame seeds on it.

262
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,680
I'll blow you.

263
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,370
Yes?

264
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm ready.

265
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:49,633
When you arrive, a CIA agent
contacted by So Ra,

266
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:51,833
will take you to a secret prison.

267
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
No.

268
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,380
I have to, because you're in it.
in this situation, I'll take responsibility.

269
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,620
Okay.

270
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,360
I'm ready to go.

271
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,610
I'll come back alive.

272
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:31,826
PERSONAL INFORMATION
PETER, BECK PIL HO

273
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,350
Everyone's looking for you, Chi Hun.

274
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,550
Our team,

275
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,050
is broken
and suspended.

276
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,720
I sat up all night,
looking for cell phone codes.

277
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,330
It can't have changed.

278
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,010
That's the strange thing.

279
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,445
All elements were set up
to make you look like the leak.

280
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,265
BANKING TRANSACTIONS

281
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,479
Why you met in secret
with Beck Pil Ho?

282
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
Pil Ho has disappeared.

283
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,580
Right now,
you're the prime suspect.

284
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,290
Don't miss the phone
I gave you.

285
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,380
I'll only call you there.

286
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,780
I found it when I was looking
for the electronic signal from Helmes.

287
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,280
I erased the code
of this phone.

288
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,060
It's going to be harder to find
than Helmes' boss.

289
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,410
But you have to limit
your calls to three minutes.

290
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,340
Why do you trust me?

291
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,480
My mother
goes to a certain psychic.

292
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,300
She was told that this year
I'm getting a promotion.

293
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,719
That means my boss,
which is you, gets the first promotion.

294
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,540
You use
scientific methods?

295
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,340
I heard the psychic
and I joined the police.

296
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,980
I'm curious about one thing.

297
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,520
In this chaotic situation,

298
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,520
- are we back where we started?
- No.

299
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,110
We are close to the end.

300
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,980
I collected data on card transactions,
phone records, bank transactions,

301
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,330
of the team and me. I also checked
Derek, Pil Ho and Kim Dong Tec.

302
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,520
MX24 APARTMENT HILLLY

303
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,920
Hilly's apartment?

304
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,527
He's next door to that company.

305
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,790
How I burned my tongue
drinking coffee?

306
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,860
What?

307
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,550
Turn on the lights.

308
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,570
It's you.

309
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,340
The bastard with the coffee.

310
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,033
CHELMES

311
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,680
Helmets.

312
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,550
How do you have that?

313
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:06,447
I'm your best customer,
for 10 years. Bring me some coffee.

314
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,840
The second account
is yours.

315
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,940
TRANSPORT 4 BILLION

316
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,980
- But you have to work only with me.
- What exactly do you want?

317
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,986
New identity
for me and my wife,

318
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,236
and transfer our money out.

319
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,511
Transfer us
with our money, safely.

320
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,810
And do not update
Tinker about this.

321
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,950
- That's not how we work.
- You will be audited.

322
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,970
Interpol will come.

323
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,740
Better to book
for now.

324
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,210
Find out where Tinker is.

325
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,900
And one more.

326
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,340
He looks tough.

327
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,590
What did he do?

328
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,220
He killed a friend of mine.

329
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,040
What?

330
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,540
Oh, my goodness,
you're Chi Hun's uncle.

331
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,930
And I met you in Kangwon.
You helped me then.

332
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,450
It's you. But why...

333
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:46,757
Why you are here
all three of you?

334
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,210
He can't.

335
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,950
- There.
- Here?

336
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,080
Yes.

337
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,530
Be careful.

338
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,580
No, here.

339
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,000
- Here?
- Yes.

340
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,260
I'll shoot when you're ready.

341
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,080
1, 2, 3.

342
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,800
I'll call an ambulance.

343
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,160
You weren't talking about me,
were you?

344
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,700
That's why you were there.

345
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:38,240
Chi Hoon has disappeared?

346
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,190
Didn't Derek tell you?

347
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,340
No.

348
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,980
He didn't mention it.

349
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,250
He wouldn't do it
so I wouldn't worry.

350
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,030
But, you know,

351
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,260
that Chi Hun
is not the leak.

352
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,160
We'd like to believe him...

353
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,760
Since you all know
it's not him.

354
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,830
Where is Chi Hun now?

355
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,300
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

356
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,120
- It has no specific address.
- We know.

357
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,830
What happened to Chi Hun
has something to do with my accusations.

358
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,760
Someone set us up.

359
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:24,290
All of you know well
Chi Hun.

360
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,207
You believe him.

361
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,370
You always helped him.

362
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,440
Please believe him...

363
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,190
And we are
in a difficult position.

364
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:53,210
Hang in there.

365
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,980
We will contact
if we hear anything.

366
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,720
Mrs. Huang So Ra.

367
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:03,894
Wait a minute.

368
00:33:05,496 --> 00:33:09,674
Were you acting
to help Chi Hun?

369
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,922
Then I found you two together.

370
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:23,235
I'm a former Girl Scout,
so I like to help others.

371
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,260
I see.

372
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,940
Sure.

373
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,530
So that was it.

374
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,980
Now I know,

375
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,620
but I can't
I can't do anything,

376
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,220
- locked up in here.
- I said go away.

377
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,990
While you were in a relationship,

378
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,010
did you care about your family?

379
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,330
Get lost.
I can't believe I married you.

380
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,680
You know it?

381
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,879
Why..

382
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:09,186
Why didn't I suspect it was an act?

383
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,273
No.

384
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,333
I really didn't suspect him?

385
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,050
Leave before dawn.

386
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,630
I never want to see you again.

387
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,111
For both our sakes.

388
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,520
After our love is over,

389
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:45,889
our marriage is over.

390
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,590
I finished it,
without suspecting anything.

391
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:55,198
I should have stopped
suspecting him of cheating on me,

392
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,457
when I ended the marriage.

393
00:35:57,044 --> 00:36:01,018
Chi Hun knew exactly
what I needed

394
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,591
at that moment.

395
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,280
I needed a husband,

396
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:11,280
that I could
I could break up with no regrets.

397
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,700
And Chi Hun...

398
00:36:21,654 --> 00:36:25,532
was happy to play his part.

399
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,130
Wait.

400
00:36:36,568 --> 00:36:38,418
Do you have to pretend like that?

401
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:42,990
You've already given her reasons
for her to divorce you. Be proud.

402
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,390
But I don't want Arum
to regret her decision.

403
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,450
Why should he regret it?

404
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:51,813
He's probably smiling
after the divorce is signed.

405
00:36:53,495 --> 00:36:54,495
Chi Hun.

406
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:57,073
If...

407
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,660
If something goes wrong
on our next mission...

408
00:37:02,756 --> 00:37:05,862
That of course will not happen.
But you never know.

409
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:11,030
Arum will always remember you
as a bad husband.

410
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:12,938
Is that what you want?

411
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,690
I'd rather be called a bad husband.
He'll be less upset.

412
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,499
It's not what you think.

413
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,386
You son of a bitch, eat this.

414
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,202
How pathetic am I?

415
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,370
What part
to shed tears of repentance...

416
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,396
Doo Bong has disappeared.

417
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:23,220
- Find him anyway.
- Okay, I will.

418
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,271
And...

419
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:27,616
Tinker's back.
and contacted us.

420
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:30,550
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

421
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,570
He's asked us to evacuate two people.

422
00:38:45,428 --> 00:38:47,728
It's so difficult
to meet you.

423
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,665
You've changed a lot.

424
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,339
Thank you.

425
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:02,948
We will visit you,
as soon as this is over.

426
00:39:02,998 --> 00:39:06,821
Thanks to your wife, the marriage and
my son's birthday was wonderful.

427
00:39:06,871 --> 00:39:08,171
See you later.

428
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,170
Say hello to your superiors.

429
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,020
I am always grateful to them.

430
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,510
I should go.

431
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,500
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,030
For Chi Hun...

433
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,340
Why didn't you tell me?

434
00:39:48,796 --> 00:39:50,385
How did you find out?

435
00:39:50,435 --> 00:39:53,516
Don't you know that the news
circulates in prison?

436
00:39:59,636 --> 00:40:01,342
I didn't want you to worry.

437
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,044
Of course I was worried.

438
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,447
Someone
is trying to destroy us.

439
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:09,668
See what happened to me
and Chi Hoon.

440
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:11,168
We fell into the trap.

441
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,740
Look at yourself first.

442
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,690
You and me.

443
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:19,620
What are you talking about?

444
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,430
We cannot escape
from this on our own.

445
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,680
We have to catch
whoever killed Sophie.

446
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,008
And the person who set me up
and Chi-Hun too.

447
00:40:32,588 --> 00:40:34,088
Aren't we gonna get him?

448
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:39,326
Let's just...

449
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,880
How about we escape
and hide on an island?

450
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,660
You can't say that
right now.

451
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,020
You want us to escape?

452
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:56,487
How can you call it
when I'm here?

453
00:40:58,266 --> 00:40:59,266
My love.

454
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,130
For some reason,

455
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,611
I feel like...

456
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:10,380
you're hiding something from me.

457
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,450
You said that
you're completely honest.

458
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,100
But things are getting worse.

459
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,244
I was locked up in prison.

460
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:24,635
Tell me.

461
00:41:25,796 --> 00:41:27,446
Why am I in jail?

462
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,390
I think you know why.

463
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,050
I'm doing the best I can,

464
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,471
to the best of my ability.

465
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,525
I know.
That's the problem.

466
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,810
We all do our best
we can,

467
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:55,425
but look where we are.

468
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,630
I've been thinking about it all night.

469
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,005
Leave the thoughts,
you must repent.

470
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:22,706
You're guilty without money
and innocent with money.

471
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:25,306
Then you'll rot here
for the rest of your life.

472
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,969
The person who will help us...

473
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:32,649
Is there a person
who can help us.

474
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:38,683
Ma'am, you have a call from Mrs. Bee
of Arum Bridal House.

475
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:39,909
I'll take it.

476
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,470
Yes.

477
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
Yes.

478
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,848
What?

479
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:50,945
Are you blackmailing me?

480
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,890
Is this Arum's idea?

481
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,100
Arum likes prison food.
She seems to want more.

482
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,077
What have you got for me?

483
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,906
1 BILLION,
INVESTMENTS IN HUAGONS

484
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:10,893
- What?
- Mrs. Bee.

485
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,980
Mrs. Kim Dong Ran is here.

486
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,940
I'm sorry you came all the way out here.

487
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:24,660
Let's say I bought the necklace.
Although it's not my cup of tea.

488
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:28,510
It will not be recorded as stolen.
I'll pay for the necklace and say,

489
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,300
I left it for safekeeping.

490
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,450
I know the owner
of the mall where the show was held.

491
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,250
Thank you.

492
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:40,778
But if Arum disappoints me
after all I'm going through,

493
00:43:42,055 --> 00:43:44,775
then you're going to jail too.

494
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:49,326
You cannot view the security footage.
The owner will be angry with me.

495
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,810
My Zacharias is gone.

496
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,610
DOG SEARCH

497
00:43:55,025 --> 00:43:56,025
Oh, look at that.

498
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
You call your dog Zachariah?

499
00:43:58,767 --> 00:44:00,269
I haven't seen him in days.

500
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,712
He won't have eaten.

501
00:44:02,762 --> 00:44:05,350
We can't
We can't let this happen.

502
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:45,710
Vodka Martini.

503
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:48,030
Whipped not stirred.

504
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,530
Here's your martini.

505
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,510
Chi Hun has disappeared,
while Arum is in jail.

506
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,110
Now we can't
we can't find another one.

507
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,632
Beck Pil Ho.

508
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,057
Chi Hun was meeting secretly
Beck Pil Ho.

509
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,338
Do you know where it is?

510
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:17,431
I don't know.

511
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,040
Helmes doesn't make any moves,
doesn't she?

512
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:23,208
If they did, I wouldn't be here.

513
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,900
If your team has a leak,

514
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:29,810
then I was exposed.

515
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:33,040
I can't deny it.

516
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:38,625
- The safety of Arum is at stake.
- I know. Helmes is warning us.

517
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,880
But...

518
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:48,414
in this business they get rid of you
if they expose you.

519
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,760
It seems that
you're a valuable agent.

520
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,130
I think that this
will be our Joker.

521
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,330
Do you trust Chi Hun?

522
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,640
Yes.

523
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,640
Why?

524
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:23,282
Why he is still in love
with my wife.

525
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,760
So...

526
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:30,230
even hanging out there,

527
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,780
will never give up
my wife.

528
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,000
What about me?

529
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,750
Do you think that even
trust you?

530
00:46:43,678 --> 00:46:46,980
You haven't given me
the slightest bit of information.

531
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,000
Chi Hun might want to see
Arum. When that happens, call me.

532
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,850
So is Beck Pil Ho.

533
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,810
Get me one of them.

534
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,150
If you bring me the boss,
even better.

535
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:09,490
- Mother.
- Are you all right, son?

536
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,070
You should have called.

537
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,970
I was going to bring you.

538
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Who comes to the airport anymore?
He didn't have to.

539
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,980
You don't rent the house.

540
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,230
You have to hang it up
on the wall.

541
00:48:35,211 --> 00:48:36,661
When did you take it?

542
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:40,390
On our first anniversary.
It's not long ago.

543
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,960
You will take photos
on every anniversary?

544
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,880
You will not have space
to hang them all.

545
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
When will Arum be released from prison?

546
00:48:51,726 --> 00:48:52,876
Very soon.

547
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,067
She's a real businesswoman.

548
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,160
He managed to get himself imprisoned.

549
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,510
Did you come here because of Arum?

550
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,430
Why should I worry
about someone else's child?

551
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,830
You're good enough for me
and I can spare you.

552
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,420
Mother.

553
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,530
Darling.

554
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,510
How did you get out?

555
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,380
I came to surprise you.

556
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:26,320
Doulee brought me home.

557
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:30,690
But when did you come, Mother?

558
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,760
I just came from the airport.

559
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:36,018
I had to come
after I found out what had happened.

560
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,653
Did you tell her?

561
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,504
Actually...

562
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,400
It was hard, wasn't it?

563
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,160
You look very thin.

564
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,810
You must eat tofu now.

565
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:51,980
Derek, do you have tofu in the fridge?

566
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:55,847
Arum only eats it
at her favorite restaurant.

567
00:49:55,897 --> 00:49:57,980
I'm sorry I worried you.

568
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,190
That's what happens in business.

569
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,506
I was kidnapped once
by the Miami mob.

570
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,190
Really?

571
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,330
Yes.

572
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,100
A true businesswoman
goes to hell many times over.

573
00:50:13,105 --> 00:50:17,426
Let me hug you,
sweetheart.

574
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,960
Mother.

575
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:33,040
I'm glad he's coming back
so soon.

576
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,970
I was nervous.

577
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,940
Boss.

578
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,780
Boss.

579
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,730
No garnish?

580
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,980
Garnish.

581
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:48,880
He wiped his mouth and ate.

582
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,720
How to eat it
after wiping your mouth?

583
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:06,080
Did Chi Hun come here?

584
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,970
Why are you bringing him up now?

585
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,760
Tell me what this is?

586
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,410
Kim Dong Ran asked questions
but I didn't know what to say.

587
00:51:18,103 --> 00:51:21,248
This one will save us.

588
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:22,999
But we are already saved.

589
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:29,026
Your mother-in-law called me
while you were in prison.

590
00:51:29,076 --> 00:51:30,726
He told me not to tell you.

591
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,530
Darling.

592
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,800
Your mother sent me money.

593
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,790
Hatziliki?

594
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:41,950
No.

595
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,210
He bought me an apartment
and gave me the titles.

596
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:48,730
He did it through
through her investment firm.

597
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,550
You told her
that things were difficult?

598
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:54,100
- No.
- But then,

599
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,250
how did he know about my finances?

600
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,720
I told her.

601
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:01,749
Why did you do that?

602
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:06,118
I don't like to borrow money
from your family.

603
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:08,114
It was your fault.

604
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,880
Okay, excuse me.

605
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,020
What am I going to do?
It's hard to return the titles.

606
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,820
I'll talk to my mother.

607
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:22,369
Did you hear anything else?

608
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:26,382
I'll call you after work.

609
00:52:27,002 --> 00:52:28,302
Don't leave early.

610
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,267
No, it's okay.

611
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,717
Let me call you.

612
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:34,861
THE SHAPE OF AN ARUM

613
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,116
INVESTMENT DOUBLE

614
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:02,200
Mother, where are you?

615
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,520
To a dentist.

616
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,800
My tooth hurts.

617
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:11,030
Hello, sir.

618
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,700
- Can I see the video?
- Yes.

619
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,700
And the parking lot.

620
00:53:21,897 --> 00:53:25,127
I need full control,
since I haven't been to a dentist in a while.

621
00:53:25,177 --> 00:53:27,780
You should have told me.
I was going to take you.

622
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,880
Mother.

623
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,950
I know you like Arum,

624
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,460
but because you sent her
so much money?

625
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,110
I want us to be friends.

626
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:39,096
We are family.

627
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:42,773
Come home soon,
you must be tired.

628
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,270
Thank you.
Let me see the list...

629
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,910
Where are you?

630
00:53:59,004 --> 00:54:03,171
I'm getting some communication
in the same area, 3 kilometers.

631
00:54:01,011 --> 00:54:03,180
PUBLICATION
JONGBU PORT

632
00:54:03,855 --> 00:54:04,980
Where are they?

633
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:09,583
I'm here to see Du Bong,
he wants to see me.

634
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,640
Wait till the boss gets here.

635
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,790
Okay.

636
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,130
Where's Du Bong?
We have an appointment at 7:00.

637
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,120
Did you hurt your finger?

638
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,220
That must have hurt a lot.

639
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:02,540
He had a bruise on his fingernail.

640
00:55:43,727 --> 00:55:47,520
PUBLICATION
JONGBU PORT

641
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,660
Doo Bong.

642
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,010
Why is Doo Bong here?

643
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:28,988
CN RA

644
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,260
Why doesn't he answer?

645
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,560
Where's Du Bong?

646
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,630
Come on, So Ra.

647
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,080
I heard he's coming with me
a companion.

648
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:45,470
Boss.

649
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,810
Wait.

650
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:52,680
Damn it.

651
00:58:02,117 --> 00:58:03,270
Chi Hun.

652
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,670
I found this file
on Mr. Kang's computer.

653
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,010
You know he's not talking
good English.

654
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,250
But the file is in English,

655
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,550
and has many files
in English.

656
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,410
He's a suspect, so I'm sending him in.

657
00:58:17,214 --> 00:58:21,710
The spy has a specific request.
New identity and transfer to the US.

658
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:24,560
- What else?
- I don't know.

659
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,480
It's in the Purple Meadow file.
He'll be here to pick him up in an hour.

660
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,230
Open it.

661
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:53,630
Don't do that with your face.
Stand still.

662
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,310
Nice pictures.

663
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,560
Who are you?

664
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,010
I'm part of a gang
that cheats.

665
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,290
You're a bad boy.

666
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,970
If such a handsome boy
does bad things,

667
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,080
then I will have
more competition.

668
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,820
Chang Du Bong.

669
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:55,111
- Why did you slap the kid?
- Jenny.

670
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,580
Huang Jae-sun.

671
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,690
My feelings for you
were real.

672
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:11,716
- If we hadn't met like this...
- That's the only way we could have met.

673
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:16,723
It traumatizes me when they say it
when women break up with me.

674
01:00:16,773 --> 01:00:17,873
Get over it.

675
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:22,448
In this job...

676
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:24,892
there are no friendly separations.

677
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,320
There are, if one of them dies.

678
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:50,490
It burns.

679
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,600
I like the smell
of burning flesh.

680
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,330
Jenny.

681
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,130
Jenny, I'm sorry.

682
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,550
So Ra.

683
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,000
Yong Gu.

684
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,020
Run, quick.

685
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,300
Run.

686
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,020
So Ra.

687
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,310
I'm fine.

688
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,080
Don't talk.

689
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,180
You fool.

690
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,700
Where are you?

691
01:02:18,587 --> 01:02:19,587
CURIER

692
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,840
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

693
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,440
Did you eat?

694
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,480
I bet you're Korean,
to ask me that.

695
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,300
Did you eat tofu?

696
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,060
The one you like.

697
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:04,897
How come you remember that?

698
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:08,980
My grandmother used to say
that a good memory,

699
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:10,560
brings only tears.

700
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:14,876
Did they drop the charges?
How did you get out?

701
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,730
I went out to find you.

702
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,238
Your team
came to find me in jail.

703
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,970
What?

704
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:27,441
The uncle who came to our wedding,

705
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,263
the handsome man
I met in Gangwon,

706
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:34,463
and also...

707
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:37,749
the girl you cheated on me with.

708
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,390
They are looking for...

709
01:03:40,497 --> 01:03:43,005
for you,
they say you're a traitor.

710
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,780
Where do you live?

711
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,300
What are you going to do now?

712
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:52,820
- I have to catch the real snitch.
- Alone?

713
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,870
But nobody trusts you.

714
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,440
You trust me.

715
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:04,113
I don't even trust myself.
I don't know at all.

716
01:04:06,372 --> 01:04:09,272
Since you came back into my life,
every day,

717
01:04:11,192 --> 01:04:13,570
it's like a roller coaster.

718
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:15,040
I am speechless.

719
01:04:23,048 --> 01:04:24,398
If I don't ask you,

720
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,070
I'm going to regret it.
for the rest of my life.

721
01:04:29,192 --> 01:04:30,692
Tell me the truth.

722
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,040
If you lie to me about it,

723
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,690
then you're not human.

724
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,950
Tell me the truth.

725
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:45,426
Was it an act?

726
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:51,168
When I caught you and So Ra together.

727
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,170
What are you talking about.

728
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:59,180
You weren't cheating on me, were you?

729
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:01,350
But you saw us together.

730
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,990
Yes, I saw you.

731
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:04,210
I saw you.

732
01:05:06,663 --> 01:05:07,685
Then,

733
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,587
I thought it was proof
that you were cheating on me.

734
01:05:11,637 --> 01:05:14,137
But now,
I realized the truth.

735
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:16,730
I was wondering,

736
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:20,600
because you let me see all this,
when you knew what I was going through,

737
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:22,723
at that time.

738
01:05:25,348 --> 01:05:26,348
Then,

739
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,500
I needed a reason
not to feel bad about leaving you.

740
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,350
And how could you...

741
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,260
How could you present
yourself as a bastard?

742
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,680
Tell me.

743
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:50,770
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

744
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,670
Who is doing this on purpose?

745
01:06:02,498 --> 01:06:06,640
Because of you,
I got very dry skin.

746
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:08,890
Because I was crying so much.

747
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:15,510
I was crying so much,
until I was dehydrated.

748
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,700
I had just managed
to restore my humidity levels.

749
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:22,680
And you're making me cry again.

750
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,550
You want to do this to me?
You do?

751
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,180
I'm not crying because I hate you.

752
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,300
I'm sorry.

753
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,720
I'm crying because I'm sorry.

754
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,380
Do you know how much this whole thing
is breaking my heart?

755
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:53,150
Of course I do.

756
01:06:54,491 --> 01:06:55,841
I know you're sorry.

757
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:03,440
Don't cry.

758
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,879
Why did you come back into my life?

759
01:07:08,370 --> 01:07:09,370
I'm sorry.

760
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:12,770
What are you apologizing for?
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

761
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,070
You always were.

762
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,820
Then I really hated you.

763
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,650
I wanted you out of my life.

764
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,210
But...

765
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:28,692
I didn't really hate you,
I hated myself.

766
01:07:29,255 --> 01:07:31,936
I was disgusted with myself.

767
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,330
But I couldn't live like that.

768
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,988
That's why I had to leave you.

769
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,200
I'm sorry.

770
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,330
Where I left you
when you had nothing.

771
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,020
That's why I pay
for my sins.

772
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:50,310
No.

773
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:53,430
You didn't do anything wrong.

774
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,690
I pay for my sins.

775
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,230
Because I didn't stay
with you to the end...

776
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:08,073
