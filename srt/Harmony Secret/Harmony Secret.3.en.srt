1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Guess we’ll have to
pretend to date for now.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,040
Then make him believe you're with a girl.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,440
Why would she go that far?

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,720
Khun Ai planned it
so she’d be alone with you.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,000
You don’t see through her games.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,200
You don’t have to worry
about me all the time.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,160
Does your dad even know
you came to see me?

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,880
Does he know you like girls?

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,400
You’ll find out I’ve got way
more tricks up my sleeve.

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,680
What are you doing?

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,160
Black Manhattan.

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,320
It’s for a classy girl...

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,720
sweet with a tangy twist...

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
but also mysterious.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,680
Intriguing.

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,960
Me? Mysterious?

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,600
I’m pretty much an open book.

18
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Not open enough.

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
I mean your heart.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,720
Maybe someone just needs
to open it for you.

21
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,560
You.

22
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,760
You.

23
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,720
Neither of us got what we wanted today.

24
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Next time, then.

25
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Let’s give it another shot.

26
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,720
Maple.

27
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes, P'G.

28
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,120
Sorry for calling so early.

29
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,880
There’s an urgent doc you need to sign.

30
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,640
Will you come sign it at the office
or should I bring it to your place?

31
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,760
Um... I’ll head to the office.

32
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Something urgent?

33
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,240
Yeah.

34
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,120
That’s a shame.

35
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,400
Last night we barely got started...

36
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,520
and you passed out
before anything happened.

37
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,200
Guess that Black Manhattan I made...

38
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
was a little too strong.

39
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
You’re really wearing that to the office?

40
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,240
Isn’t it a bit too sexy?

41
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
You can wear my clothes instead.

42
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Borrow them or keep them,
I don’t mind.

43
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,680
Seriously.

44
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,800
Are you being nice to me...

45
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,360
or are you setting me
up to owe you again?

46
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,880
You can’t say “again.”

47
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,960
Because the last time I owed you...

48
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
you already got your payback.

49
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,760
With that kiss in the car.

50
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Let’s just say I didn’t help you this time.

51
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
Call it a kind gesture instead.

52
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,440
A kind gesture worth tens
or hundreds of thousands?

53
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,640
Isn’t that a bit much
for someone you just met?

54
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,560
We just met, sure.
But you’re special.

55
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
No matter how much,
I’d still give it.

56
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,320
I’d rather not.

57
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
I’ll return it to you myself.

58
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,800
Since we’re going to see
each other again anyway.

59
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
I haven’t even gotten
the answer I want yet.

60
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,640
So, where’s the outfit?

61
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,000
Go take a shower and relax first.

62
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Blow-dried like this...

63
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Do you like it?

64
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
If you do, I can do it for you every day.

65
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,000
I really can.

66
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,320
And if you want to know if I mean it...

67
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
you’d have to move in with me.

68
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Are you crazy?

69
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
Are you blushing?

70
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Why would I blush?

71
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,000
They say women...

72
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,280
often say the opposite of what they feel.

73
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,040
I know...

74
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
right now you’re thinking about...

75
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,360
what it would really be like living with me.

76
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,600
Am I right?

77
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,160
Okay, I’ll stop teasing you.

78
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,760
You know what?

79
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,080
Normally, a workaholic like me...

80
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,320
wouldn’t waste time like this.

81
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,760
I even get my hair washed at the salon.

82
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,360
So you’re saying...

83
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,280
everything you said and did for me...

84
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,240
was because I’m that special to you?

85
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,880
Something like that.

86
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,320
You're quite the smooth talker.

87
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,600
So...

88
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,040
is the customer starting
to get interested yet?

89
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,840
No idea.

90
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,720
But I do know it’s time
for me to head to the office.

91
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,160
All done.

92
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,840
Hold on.

93
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,920
Your hair’s perfect.

94
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Now your skin needs that dewy glow.

95
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,760
All done.

96
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,600
Thanks.

97
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,760
Someone told me...

98
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,800
you brought a girl into your room.

99
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,880
Who is she?

100
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,280
One of Dad’s spies, huh?

101
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,040
Who is it this time?

102
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
Which bodyguard?

103
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
Why is it that everyone around me...

104
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,080
is someone I can’t even trust?

105
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Well, if you didn’t do anything...

106
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,080
then no one would
need to report back to me.

107
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,280
So?

108
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,840
Who did you bring here?

109
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
A friend.

110
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,040
A friend?

111
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,400
Which friend?

112
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,040
Do I know them?

113
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,160
How much can they be trusted?

114
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,480
You trusted them enough
to bring them here?

115
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
Why aren’t you answering?

116
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,599
It’s just a simple question.

117
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,040
No need for you to come
all the way here, Dad.

118
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,640
A phone call would’ve been enough.

119
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,880
I had to see it for myself.

120
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,160
So I know exactly...

121
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,720
what you’re really up to.

122
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,440
I wouldn’t do anything
to cause you trouble.

123
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,040
You don’t have to worry.

124
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,280
Worry about you?

125
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
I’m not worried about you.

126
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,840
I’m worried about the company.

127
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,800
About our reputation.

128
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
About my image...

129
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
that I’ve built my whole life.

130
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,280
This is my personal life.

131
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,920
Don’t you dare say that to me.

132
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,600
It reminds me of your mother.

133
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,200
You said you wouldn’t bring her up.

134
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,000
So why did you?

135
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,240
Then stop acting like her.

136
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,760
If you didn’t, I wouldn’t have.

137
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,840
Mark my words, Aiwarin.

138
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,360
I’ve already been let down
by your mother once.

139
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,480
Don’t make me disappointed in you too.

140
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,080
I don’t care that much...

141
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,040
about the filthy woman
you dragged into your bed.

142
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,920
But if one day...

143
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,720
news breaks out
that the heir of Orienna...

144
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,360
is acting out and being reckless...

145
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,080
I’ll cut you off for good.

146
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Watch me.

147
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
Stay here for now.

148
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
Wait till he leaves.

149
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,000
Then you can go.

150
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,960
Okay.

151
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Please prepare three sets of
the documents and cc the Chairman.

152
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,880
Khun Mae.

153
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
Go to your office right now.

154
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,640
What’s going on, P’G?

155
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,960
Don’t ask right now. Just go.

156
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,960
Okay.

157
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
Get me outfits like the ones
Maeveeka usually wears, ASAP.

158
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,600
Right now!

159
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,520
What’s this all about, P’G?

160
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
You told me not to worry.

161
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
So I tried not to worry.

162
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,080
But now you’ve gone and messed up.

163
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,120
The outfit you’re wearing is
from Andromeda’s new collection.

164
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,320
That collection hasn’t been released yet.

165
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,640
The only one who’s supposed
to have it right now...

166
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,120
is the brand ambassador, Aiwarin.

167
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,280
And she already wore
that outfit in a press interview.

168
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,800
Have you even thought
about what would happen...

169
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,360
if someone sees you in it
and posts it online?

170
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,200
I’m sorry, P'G.

171
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,960
Please be more careful next time.

172
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,640
Can you do that?

173
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
I won’t make the same mistake again.

174
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
I’ll end this as soon as I can.

175
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,560
Can I ask you one thing?

176
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,960
If you’re going to see her again...

177
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,080
let me come with you.

178
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
I’ll keep my distance.

179
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Just in case something happens,
I’ll be there.

180
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Someone told me...

181
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,440
you brought a girl into your room.

182
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,640
Who is she?

183
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
This is my personal life.

184
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,920
Don’t you dare say that to me.

185
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
It reminds me of your mother.

186
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,320
You said you wouldn’t bring her up.

187
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
Then stop acting like her.

188
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
If you didn’t, I wouldn’t have said it.

189
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,520
I’m sorry, Ai.
I really am.

190
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,840
But I have to go now.

191
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Be a good girl, okay?

192
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,760
Yam, call an urgent team meeting.

193
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,000
I’ve read the
marketing analysis you sent over.

194
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,320
I think we need to talk.

195
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,560
Weren’t you taking today off?

196
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,360
I changed my mind.

197
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,480
Sitting around drives me crazy. I hate it.

198
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,080
Mae, may I come in?

199
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,080
I heard you went to a friend’s
party last night. Did you have fun?

200
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,720
It was nice, Dad.

201
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,720
I just want to remind you...

202
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,040
try to cut back on the partying for now.

203
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,320
Or better yet, put it on hold entirely.

204
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,120
At least until the bidding period is over.

205
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,000
I don’t want people saying...

206
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,000
you’re not serious about this competition.

207
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,360
Mae...

208
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,800
You haven’t forgotten, have you?

209
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,760
There are people waiting
to see us fall over this.

210
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,440
If we lose...

211
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,360
I haven’t forgotten, Dad.

212
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,200
I’ll do what you said.

213
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,680
Good.

214
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,120
Hearing that puts my mind at ease.

215
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,560
Now go get some rest.

216
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,200
Wait, Dad...

217
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,360
Would you feel terrible...

218
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
if,

219
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,880
What if I fail this project?

220
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,600
Failure isn’t even an option.

221
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,640
Because I believe in you.

222
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,040
You’ll succeed no matter what.

223
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
And I’m not the only one...

224
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,160
waiting to be proud of you.

225
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,080
Your mom’s waiting to see it too.

226
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
I’m sure of it.

227
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
Mae...

228
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,600
Before your mom passed away...

229
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,960
she entrusted you to me.

230
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,560
We both loved you...

231
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,880
and had the highest hopes for you.

232
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,400
And we both believe...

233
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,920
that you can do it.

234
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Is this Maevika’s car?

235
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,040
She’s already gone. We should be
the first to get the bid envelope.

236
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Take the stairs.

237
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,400
Who?

238
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,960
You.

239
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
I’m coming too.

240
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,320
Me too.

241
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
- Khun Maevika, may we have a quick interview?
- Hello.

242
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,320
How confident are you about this bidding?

243
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,280
100% confident.

244
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,200
Orienna seems pretty confident too.
Aren’t you feeling the pressure?

245
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,600
Today, it all comes down to the bidding.

246
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,480
Hurry! Maevika’s still giving an interview.

247
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,800
We still have a shot.

248
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,280
The representative from
Superior is the first to arrive.

249
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,000
Why aren’t you going in?

250
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,320
The first company to get the bid envelope...

251
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,360
gets a head start.

252
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,760
What kind of advantage?

253
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Beats me.

254
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,360
But many companies believe in good omens.

255
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,800
They want to kick things off
on a winning note...

256
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,200
by being the very first to purchase
the bidding documents.

257
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,280
Maybe it’s so they can study
the TOR ahead of the others.

258
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,000
Just a few minutes earlier…

259
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,080
probably doesn’t make much difference.

260
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,760
Besides, making the first move...

261
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,040
doesn’t guarantee a win.

262
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,520
Orienna, feel free to go ahead.

263
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,960
I’m in no rush.

264
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
- Khun Maevika, over here.
- Please look toward this camera.

265
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,080
This camera too, please.

266
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,040
Good day, sir.

267
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,400
I really admire Superior...

268
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,080
for choosing someone young like you
to lead the bidding.

269
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,880
It doesn’t just add
excitement to the event,

270
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,840
but also pushes many companies
to reflect on themselves.

271
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,040
See what’s still stuck in the past.

272
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,080
It’s really nice to hear you say that.

273
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,000
Before this,

274
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,120
people kept doubting me,

275
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,360
saying I might be
the reason Superior loses.

276
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,080
I doubt they really meant it.

277
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,000
They were probably just trying
to mess with your head.

278
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,600
Don’t let it get to you.

279
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,000
Just focus on doing your part well.

280
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,880
Your work will speak
for itself soon enough.

281
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,400
Thank you.

282
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Come on.

283
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,920
Let’s take a photo.

284
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,800
- Look this way.
- Over here, please.

285
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,720
Right this way.

286
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,480
Over here too, please.

287
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
And this camera, please.

288
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,760
Looking good.

289
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,680
Khun Rachen.

290
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,080
Good evening, Khun Maevika.

291
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,760
Khun Rachen, you're ignoring me.

292
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,440
Aren’t you stepping out of line a bit?

293
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Sorry about that, it’s just that,

294
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,800
I noticed Direk
is heading the project,

295
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,360
so he’ll probably get
more time with the bidders.

296
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,639
But I’m just one of the small competitors.

297
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
It’s rare we get to meet.

298
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,400
So...

299
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,120
Please give me a chance.

300
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,560
Hello.

301
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Hello.

302
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,880
Khun Rachen.

303
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Vice Chairman of Great & Glow Company,

304
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,920
a major importer of
consumer goods in Thailand.

305
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,000
Khun Mae, you seem
to know me quite well.

306
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,840
Well, there’s no one in the country
who doesn’t know you.

307
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,000
I know you like everybody else does.

308
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,480
In that case...

309
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,200
I hope it won’t be long

310
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,640
before we get to really know each other.

311
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Come on, let’s take a picture.

312
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,360
This way, please.

313
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,560
Over here.

314
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,040
Nice.

315
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,240
- This camera too, please.
- Lovely. Beautiful.

316
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,000
- Yam.
- Yes?

317
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,160
Take the documents to the company first.

318
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,480
In case Dad asks.

319
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,120
I’ve got a headache.
I want to rest a bit.

320
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,280
I’ll catch up once I feel better.

321
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,200
Understood.

322
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm taking the dress back to her car.

323
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,280
You don’t have to come, G.
Just wait here.

324
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
I'll call you once I’m done.

325
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,040
But,

326
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,280
It's just returning a dress. No big deal.

327
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,440
Hello, Khun Aiwarin.

328
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
Long time no see.

329
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Yes.

330
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
Why wait till now to say hi?

331
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,440
You acted like
we didn’t know each other

332
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,520
back in the bidding room.

333
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,440
Or were you scared they'd find out

334
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,640
what you did to me?

335
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,400
If you’re trying to say

336
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
I did something,

337
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,240
you’ll need proof.

338
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,520
If you don’t have any,

339
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,920
then it never happened.

340
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,640
And I’ve got nothing to be afraid of.

341
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,960
The reason I didn’t greet you

342
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,000
is because someone else
caught my eye more.

343
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,720
That’s all.

344
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,040
If you plan to approach Maevika

345
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,600
the same way you once did with me,

346
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,600
then forget it.

347
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,360
Because that girl isn’t so easy to fool.

348
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,720
You sound like you know her well.

349
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,080
I don’t owe you an answer.

350
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,000
And I don’t have to listen to you.

351
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,040
You're hooked, aren’t you?

352
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,520
Sneaking around like this.

353
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,560
It’s kind of thrilling, huh?

354
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,120
I saw you talking to Rachen just now.

355
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
You two knew each other before?

356
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,680
And... back in the bidding room,

357
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,240
you seemed pretty close to Rachen.

358
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,000
Not just him, there's also Direk.

359
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,960
You’ve got quite the charm, don’t you?

360
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,560
Don’t change the subject.

361
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,120
I heard you two mention my name.

362
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Well...

363
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,160
It’s nothing, really.

364
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,040
Just be careful with that guy.

365
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,080
As a rival...

366
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
and as a man.

367
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,960
Because he’s not like the others you’ve met.

368
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,640
Trust me.

369
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,440
I won’t, unless I know the reason why.

370
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,160
Fine, then.

371
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,920
My spare keycard to Orienna,

372
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,520
You can use it to get into my room.

373
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,320
And it’ll also give you
access to all VIP zones.

374
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,240
Meet me tonight at the floating pool.

375
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,920
We’ll talk about this then.

376
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,760
Mae.

377
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,480
Oh, G.

378
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,360
I was just about to call you.

379
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,000
Is something up?

380
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,320
You still haven’t returned the dress.

381
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,400
Let’s put that on hold for now.

382
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,840
There’s something more important.

383
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,960
We’re going to Orienna tonight.

384
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,480
Once we’re there, we’ll split up.

385
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,760
I’ll take the VIP entrance.

386
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,880
You go in through
the regular guest route, G.

387
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,880
Okay.

388
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,240
Wait, Mae.

389
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,600
This is a listening device.

390
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,400
It’s how we’ll dig secrets out of her.

391
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,000
Wanna come for a swim?

392
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,800
Maple.

393
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,600
I’m here about Rachen.

394
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,240
Aiwarin.

395
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,560
Just call me Ai. I prefer that.

396
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,240
It feels more like me.

397
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,840
It's about Rachen.

398
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,400
Alright then.

399
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,600
Rachen and I

400
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,600
met last year.

401
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,040
It was during the joint project
between Orienna and Great & Glow.

402
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,240
We were both invited to Boston for it.

403
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,160
Mr. Barry’s project was so exhausting.

404
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,880
We were lucky that
Great & Glow and Orienna

405
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,840
were the two Thai companies chosen
to manage the space together.

406
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,440
But I’ll be honest with you.

407
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,440
I’m not really a fan of working with others.

408
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,560
What are you trying to say?

409
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,920
I want Great & Glow to have full
control over the commercial area.

410
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,440
If you agree to withdraw from the project,

411
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,200
I'll compensate you

412
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,120
as much as you want.

413
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,440
Are you trying to bribe me?

414
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,800
Not at all.

415
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,000
Just making an offer.

416
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,240
I figured someone as smart as you, Aiwarin,

417
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,040
wouldn’t say no.

418
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,400
You're right.
I am smart enough to know better.

419
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
After that,

420
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,400
I was attacked two or three more times.

421
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,640
And every time...

422
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,080
It always happened when I was alone.

423
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,400
Luckily, I got out every time.

424
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,200
When I came back to Thailand,

425
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,720
everything just... stopped.

426
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,840
Then why didn’t you go to the police?

427
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,640
I had no evidence.

428
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,800
They didn’t leave a single trace.

429
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,280
That’s why I’m telling you,

430
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,960
you have to be careful.

431
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,600
We never know what

432
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,080
Rachen might do next.

433
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,640
I care about you.

434
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,640
But if you stay close to me,

435
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,320
I’ll keep you safe.

436
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,240
So...

437
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,320
are your doubts about Rachen gone now?

438
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,760
If so...

439
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,880
let’s figure out your answer next.

440
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,680
You still don’t have one, do you?

441
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,560
Yes.

442
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,080
Okay. I’m coming down now.

443
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,680
Can you check the
guest’s room number for me?

444
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,880
Please check this room number.
We’ll bring them a new keycard.

445
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,840
Did you see the woman when it dropped it?

446
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,720
He’s not sure.

447
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,200
Wait, hold on a second.

448
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,720
Is something going on?

449
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,320
I’ll come back and tell you, Yam.
I gotta run.

450
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,240
Hey! No, you can’t!

451
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,720
You have to tell me now!

452
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,000
So, What happened?

453
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,400
Spill everything.

454
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,440
Thanks for helping me out just now.

455
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,080
You saw that, huh?

456
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,720
And I’m sorry too.

457
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,680
About that day in the restroom,

458
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,680
I hurt you. I didn’t mean to.

459
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,480
So mysterious.

460
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,440
So intriguing.

461
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,320
Let’s stop here.

462
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,960
I think I have my answer.

463
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,680
Are you sure...

464
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,720
about the answer
you think you’ve found?

465
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,200
If so...

466
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,880
how about the two of us...

467
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,280
give this a try?

468
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,160
You’re the first person

469
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,720
who’s made me feel like

470
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,760
I want to take it seriously.

471
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,440
You,

472
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,520
But we’re rivals, remember?

473
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,320
-And then there’s that whole thing.
-I know.

474
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,240
I haven’t forgotten.

475
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,160
But do you remember

476
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,400
what I once told you?

477
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,520
If I wanted to follow my heart,

478
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,720
then I wouldn’t care

479
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,960
what happens after this.

480
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,800
I want to focus

481
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,680
on what’s right in front of me.

482
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,640
Okay.

483
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,040
I’ll be with you.

484
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
But...

485
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,560
you can’t let anyone know about this.

486
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,080
If you’re cool with that,

487
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,720
then I’m cool with it too.

488
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
Deal.

489
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,160
Ready to have fun with Khun Ai?

490
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,440
Let’s go!

491
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,120
Today was such a blast.

492
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,880
Khun Ai’s so glad to be dating Mae.

493
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,640
If Mae can bring
Andromeda onto our project,

494
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,360
when Khun Ai’s already
the brand ambassador,

495
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,600
it’d be like Superior
slapping Orienna in the face.

496
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,880
You,

497
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,280
Feeling smug now
that you’ve got the upper hand?

498
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,120
Come stand in the middle.
(Yam wanna be in it too!)

499
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,520
You little rascal.

500
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,320
I haven’t even clicked yet.

501
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,800
(Then strike a pose already.)
Oh, really?

502
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,920
(He’s being closely looked after.)

503
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,160
Feeling refreshed now?

504
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,040
Perfect.

505
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,920
(Let me try a sip too.)

506
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,440
(They’re getting ready for the next scene.)

507
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,480
(Teasing because it’s love.)

508
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,320
(That gaze is way too sweet.)
