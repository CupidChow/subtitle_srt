1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,480
This is Khun Aiwarin.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,080
If what Khun Mae wants
to discuss with Ann is business,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
then Khun Ai should be in the loop too.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,200
Does it feel good,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,280
having the upper hand over me?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,440
I wonder if Khun Mae
has forgiven Khun Ai yet.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,240
If not, that’s alright.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,520
As long as Khun Mae takes Khun Ai’s hand

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,280
and goes with her, that’s enough.

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,080
Then the two of us will win together.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,680
So how should we do it?

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,240
(Khun Maevika is
here to see Khun Rachen)

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,240
Yam knows very well

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,320
that Khun Ai feels
so much for Khun Mae.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,520
But it’s clear we can’t trust her.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
Mm.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
To be honest,

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,480
it’d be better if Khun Ai
stepped back from her.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,160
This relationship is nothing but a risk.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,360
And if anyone were to find out,

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,840
it’d be even more dangerous.

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,520
I’m sorry for meddling
in your personal life, Khun Ai.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
- But this is…
- I know.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,280
Don’t worry about me.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,160
I’m not the kind to do
anything without a plan.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,400
I’ve drawn my own line,

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,680
how far this thing between us can go.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,520
If the day really comes

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,479
where I have to choose
between Orienna and her,

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,880
I’ll still have to choose Orienna.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,520
How’s the Andromeda deal going?

32
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
All settled.

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
We’re the only one
they’ll shake hands with, right?

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,920
Out of courtesy, yes.

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,240
But Ai never asked them to do that.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Why not?

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,920
Hmph.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,520
Just one word from you and they’d agree.

39
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,360
But if we don’t say anything first

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,000
and they change their mind,

41
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,840
we’ll take the hit.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,480
Forget it.

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Andromeda…

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
isn’t the only deal in our bidding plan.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,640
But it is an important one,

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,240
because it’s the Thai brand
the world is watching.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,880
I think you should talk to them yourself.

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,480
And the progress on the other matters?

49
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,640
Everything’s moving along smoothly.

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
That’s it?

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
Is that all the heir of Orienna can say?

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,840
Truly disappointing.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,279
Put more of yourself into this, Aiwarin.

54
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,480
Anything that doesn’t affect the work,

55
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,760
let it go.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,400
Don’t think

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,520
that just because you’re my child
I’ll let you do as you please.

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,520
I put you in this position.

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,040
I can send you back to
where you came from just as easily.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,360
I understand, Father.

61
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Being your daughter,

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,120
it’s not as glamorous
as everyone thinks.

63
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,120
Or as you try to make everyone believe.

64
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,480
I’ll try my best.

65
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
That’s all.

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,880
If you’ll excuse me now.

67
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,240
Khun Yollada, you’re not
in a hurry to leave, are you?

68
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,760
Saying it like that,

69
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,880
it sounds like Sir got something in mind.

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Do you have anything
to tell me about your boss?

71
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,080
I feel that right now Aiwarin

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,240
isn’t very focused on the bidding.

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,440
You’re her closest aide.

74
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,080
You should know
what’s going on with her.

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,880
Lately Khun Ai has seemed stressed.

76
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
So she might have lost focus at times.

77
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,800
But Khun Ai is very dedicated to her work.

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,640
It just might not take shape as quickly

79
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
as you’d like, sir.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,600
Is that so?

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Yes.

82
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
Since you started working at Orienna,

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
have you gone back to see your family?

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
- Mom…
- Come here. I told you to come here.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,040
Go.

86
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
- Hand over the money.
- I don’t have any.

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,200
- No, Mom,
- I said let go!

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,400
- Mom!
- I said let go!

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,440
- Mom!
- You brat.

90
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Yam.

91
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,800
I told you to get me money.

92
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,040
Hah? If you can’t bring me money,

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,480
don’t bother being my daughter.

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,000
And don’t call me your mother.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
And if you can’t get money,

96
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
then be a whore, sell yourself.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
Stop it, Dad!

98
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,960
- Dad!
- Let me go!

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
- Dad!
- Where’s the money?!

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,680
- I don’t have any.
- Where’s my money?!

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,520
- Dad, I’m begging you,
- Give me the money!

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Dad!

103
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,720
Hand over the money, damn it!

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,280
No answer means you haven’t.

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,280
By now, they must miss you so much.

106
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,720
They must wonder how you’re living.

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,640
How happy you really are.

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,480
Or should I send word to them myself?

109
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,080
Sir…

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,240
Today I’ll turn a blind eye.

111
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,240
I’ll take your word for now,

112
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,440
for the sake of your loyalty to Aiwarin.

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
But from here on, when I ask,

114
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
think carefully.

115
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,360
Will you keep hiding the truth

116
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,880
to protect Aiwarin,

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,800
or will you speak the truth

118
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,320
to protect yourself?

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,760
Are you alright?

120
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,000
Come on, let’s get you to a hospital.

121
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,960
No money.

122
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,160
Don’t worry about the medical bills.

123
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,320
I’ll take care of everything.

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,960
No, that’s not it.

125
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,960
I just thought, if I go to the hospital,

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,960
they’ll definitely come and find me.

127
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,400
I’ve decided to run.

128
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,040
So I have to run far away,

129
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
where no one can reach me.

130
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
Don’t, not yet.

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
Then why don’t you come
to Bangkok with me?

132
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,600
There, I can look after you.

133
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,320
I won’t let anyone hurt you again.

134
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,200
Sir…

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,080
Then allow me to get off here.

136
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,760
Thank you.

137
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
So?

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
Done with work yet?

139
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,440
If you don’t have plans after this,

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,800
come have a drink with me.

141
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Where at?

142
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,800
Hey.

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,680
Are you alright?

144
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,160
I’m here.

145
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,960
That’s enough, you’re drunk already.

146
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,280
No. Not nearly enough.

147
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,080
What, are you trying
to drink yourself to death?

148
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
If drinking could really kill me,

149
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,720
that’d be perfect.

150
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,800
Hey.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,520
Get up properly.

152
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,480
Time to go. Get up.

153
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,160
Come on.

154
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,480
Hey.

155
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Let’s get you to your room.

156
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,160
Hey.

157
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
Hey.

158
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,040
Let me wipe you down a bit.

159
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
Hey.

160
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
How are you feeling?

161
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,480
Want me to wipe you down?

162
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
No, it’s fine.

163
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you.

164
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,080
For looking after me.

165
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
No need to thank me.

166
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
You’ve taken care of me too.

167
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,480
You know,

168
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,080
ever since I was born,

169
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,080
besides Khun Ai,

170
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,480
you’re the only one

171
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
who’s ever done this for me.

172
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,400
Khun Ai,

173
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
she’s such a good boss, isn’t she?

174
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,600
Not just a good boss…

175
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
But Khun Ai is like…

176
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,080
the light in my life.

177
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,840
Without her,

178
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,880
by now,

179
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,720
I wouldn’t have survived to be here.

180
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
If I had to die

181
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,640
to protect her,

182
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,840
I’d be ready to do it.

183
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,480
Let me wipe you down a bit.

184
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
Didn’t you say you’d wipe me down?

185
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Uh…

186
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,080
- Hey,
- We’re both women.

187
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,640
It’s no big deal.

188
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,240
Still not asleep?

189
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
Why aren’t you answering your phone?

190
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,320
Put more of yourself into this, Aiwarin.

191
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Anything that doesn’t help the work,

192
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
just let it go.

193
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,680
Honestly,

194
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,080
it’d be better if you stepped back from her.

195
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,480
This relationship is nothing but a risk.

196
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,640
And if anyone were to find out,

197
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,160
it’d be even more dangerous.

198
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,920
Shit…

199
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,640
Where are you going?

200
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
I’m going to shower and get dressed.

201
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,280
It’s time for work.

202
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,800
Can’t you take a day off?

203
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,480
No, I can’t.

204
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,000
Khun Ai has a lot on her mind right now.

205
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,920
I should be by her side and support her.

206
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
Same goes for you.

207
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
Khun Maevika probably needs you too.

208
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,560
Hey.

209
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,280
What is it you’re really trying to say?

210
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,480
You do know,

211
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,400
that our bosses

212
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,240
are in a relationship?

213
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,680
I know.

214
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,800
And no matter
what happens between them,

215
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,600
in the end,

216
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,160
their relationship won’t last anyway.

217
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,480
And then…

218
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,800
it’ll be just like us.

219
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,480
You shouldn’t get involved with me again.

220
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,760
You…

221
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

222
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,200
Last night you acted like you wanted me.

223
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
You’re the one who called me over.

224
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,360
And now you’re telling me to stay away?

225
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What kind of person are you really?

226
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,640
You just…

227
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,480
don’t hold on to it too tightly.

228
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
What happened between us,

229
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,800
it was just a moment of weakness.

230
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,720
If you decide to forget it,

231
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,360
you’ll forget eventually.

232
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,960
(Are you asleep, Khun Ai?)

233
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,320
Sorry…

234
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,480
I just had a lot on my mind.

235
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,880
(Khun Ai)

236
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,840
What are you thinking about?

237
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,800
About you.

238
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,720
Will you meet me tonight at Anthea Bar?

239
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,680
The meeting is ready, Khun Ai.

240
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
Alright.

241
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,680
Then I’ll see you tonight.

242
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,680
Okay.

243
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Our presentation plan is now

244
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,880
over 80 percent complete.

245
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,080
As for the partners we’ve lined up,

246
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,720
most of them have agreed.

247
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,200
The only thing left is…

248
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,880
the profit numbers
we need to consider carefully.

249
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
Do you already have
something in mind, Khun Mae?

250
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Which numbers will we use as the base?

251
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,160
I’ve got it.

252
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,360
I’ll use the winning bid figures

253
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,000
from the airport duty-free
concession seven years ago.

254
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,760
But we’ll add today’s inflation rate on top.

255
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
Then we should set the numbers

256
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,280
at double that benchmark.

257
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Wouldn’t that be too high?

258
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Exactly.

259
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,920
It could be too risky for us.

260
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,680
Why are you so confident, Khun Mae?

261
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Because off-airport duty-free

262
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,720
customers aren’t limited
by time like they are inside airports.

263
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,200
So…

264
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
they’ll have a greater chance to spend.

265
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,880
And besides, this project

266
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,200
will get full government support.

267
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,560
Because it’s a government initiative.

268
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,480
If the private sector comes in and fails,

269
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
that means…

270
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,440
the government’s stability
will be shaken too.

271
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,760
And lastly…

272
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,720
I believe

273
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,560
our competitors are
thinking the same way.

274
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,960
And they’ll give
it everything they’ve got too.

275
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
In that case,

276
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,840
if everyone agrees with me,

277
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,720
let me wrap it up then.

278
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
I’ll use Roy’s numbers

279
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
as our reference point.

280
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,720
And we’ll add on top of that,

281
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,520
following the formula I proposed.

282
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That makes it twenty-four billion.

283
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,400
Back then, Roy’s bid
twelve billion and won.

284
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,880
After factoring in multiple points,

285
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
this is the most reasonable figure.

286
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
And the other competitors,

287
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,200
are they also using Roy’s
numbers as their base?

288
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,080
Most likely, yes.

289
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,320
Because that’s the most
tangible figure to work with.

290
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,320
Then that means nothing guarantees

291
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,440
that twenty-four billion
will be the highest bid.

292
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,520
That’s to be expected.

293
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,440
In the end, it all comes down to the floor.

294
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,760
Then we’ll need another approach.

295
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,000
What approach?

296
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,480
Go figure it out.

297
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,800
There isn’t really any other way,

298
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,160
unless someone gets
the inside scoop from a rival

299
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,520
about what their bid will be.

300
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,400
Then we just bid higher than them.

301
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,680
Fine.

302
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,960
I told you, I don’t care about the method.

303
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,560
There’s only one thing I care about,

304
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
we have to win.

305
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,720
So, to sum up,

306
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,000
we should try other ways first.

307
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,080
And if we truly have no choice,

308
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,800
then we’ll use this way.

309
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,480
That concludes today’s meeting.

310
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,600
Thank you, everyone.

311
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,120
Khun Ai, Khun Ai,

312
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,560
I never knew

313
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
that you smoked.

314
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,320
Not often.

315
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,720
Only sometimes.

316
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,720
It’s just…

317
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
waiting for you leaves my mouth idle.

318
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,880
Idle, huh?

319
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,720
Well, it’s not idle anymore.

320
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
A special cocktail,

321
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,440
for Khun Mae.

322
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,360
Such a pretty color.

323
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,600
What’s it called?

324
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,600
Try it and see.

325
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,920
It tastes sweet,

326
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,960
but there’s bitterness too.

327
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,040
It’s called "Beautiful Trap."

328
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,200
Or rather…

329
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,280
a trap that’s beautiful.

330
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,960
At first glance it seems sweet,

331
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,280
but deep down it’s bitter.

332
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,080
It’s another drink

333
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,920
that Khun Ai likes.

334
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,600
You like it even though it’s bitter?

335
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,240
Even with its bitterness,

336
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,040
its beauty

337
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,960
makes us captivated,

338
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,080
to the point where…

339
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,280
we forgive any bitterness it carries.

340
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,840
Khun Ai,

341
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,520
you manage to surprise
me every time we meet.

342
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
I can’t wait to see

343
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,520
what you’ll surprise me with next.

344
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,320
Then don’t wait.

345
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,280
Last time,

346
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,159
you took me to explore the real world.

347
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,960
This time…

348
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,400
you want me to live in a dream instead?

349
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,239
It really does feel like a dream.

350
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,760
And it’s such a beautiful dream,

351
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,199
so good I don’t want to wake up.

352
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,520
Exactly.

353
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,560
If we could just stop time here,

354
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,560
that’d be perfect.

355
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,520
How far along is Superior
with their bidding plan?

356
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,880
Do they already have their numbers?

357
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Yes, they do.

358
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,240
And what about Orienna?

359
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,680
They’ve got theirs too.

360
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,280
For Superior,

361
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,560
apart from Orienna,

362
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,080
is there any other bidder
we should be concerned about?

363
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,600
Great & Co.

364
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,680
We already know that’s one
we need to watch closely.

365
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,600
You seem to know Great & Co.
quite well, Khun Mae.

366
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
Well…

367
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,400
didn’t you once warn me about Rachen?

368
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,600
Other than that…

369
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,000
there’s no company worth worrying about.

370
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Chamelo is a newcomer,

371
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,080
just entering the field to test the waters.

372
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,000
They don’t have any real strengths to win.

373
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,600
As for Siam Ariana,

374
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,360
even though they’ve won
major concessions before,

375
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,480
but their management system is outdated.

376
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,720
That could be used as a weak point to attack.

377
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,520
And that "someone" you mean…

378
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,480
surely you don’t mean you, Khun Ai?

379
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,360
Can’t say for sure.

380
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,160
Just don’t do that to me, alright?

381
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,160
What do you mean?

382
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Well…

383
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,080
spreading damaging rumors about Superior

384
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,280
to cut down a rival.

385
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,120
Do you really think, Khun Mae,

386
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
that people who are together

387
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,200
would hurt each other just because…

388
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,760
they want to win in business?

389
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,040
No one ever knows.

390
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Even now,

391
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,880
I still believe

392
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,600
Orienna is the most dangerous rival of all.

393
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,000
Always toying with my heart.

394
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,560
How so?

395
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
By…

396
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,720
doing special things for me,

397
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,360
things no one else has ever done.

398
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,680
And now,

399
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,320
I’m already hooked on you.

400
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
In that case,

401
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,880
Superior is the scariest rival for you, Ai.

402
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,360
Because its leader

403
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,480
drives you crazy,

404
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
to the point you keep thinking,

405
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,400
if you could be together again,

406
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,240
what you could do to impress her next.

407
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,600
What are you doing?

408
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,680
It helps us see the stars clearer.

409
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
Oh.

410
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,760
Wow, where’d you learn that?

411
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,400
From my own school.

412
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,760
Father.

413
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,520
Father.

414
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,920
Father!

415
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,920
Maid!

416
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,480
Someone, call an ambulance!

417
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,760
Quickly!

418
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,880
Father, Father!

419
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,800
Father! Maid!

420
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,800
Did you call yet?

421
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Quickly maid.

422
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,600
Khun Maevika,

423
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,880
the doctor would like to see you.

424
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
How are you feeling, Dad?

425
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,000
I’m fine now, my dear.

426
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,360
Gave you quite a scare, didn’t I?

427
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,040
At first, yes, I was terrified.

428
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,200
But when the doctor said you woke up,

429
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,360
I felt so much better.

430
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,720
Doctor,

431
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,480
so what exactly happened to my father?

432
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,080
Khun Nuttakorn has arrhythmia,

433
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,560
a condition where
the heart beats irregularly.

434
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,080
This can be triggered by many causes,

435
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,000
and it often happens without warning.

436
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,840
Some people may
even collapse from shock,

437
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,400
just like what happened
to Khun Nuttakorn.

438
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,960
So…

439
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
is it very dangerous?

440
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,800
If untreated, yes, very dangerous.

441
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,880
But please don’t worry.

442
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,640
We’ll make sure
Khun Nuttakorn gets the best care.

443
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,440
What do I need to do from now on?

444
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,720
Just avoid triggers
that could bring on the symptoms,

445
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,160
like stress or anxiety.

446
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Now, if you’ll excuse me.

447
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,840
Mae.

448
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,000
Why are you crying, dear?

449
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,040
Didn’t the doctor just say
there’s a way to treat it?

450
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,560
But I’m still scared, Dad.

451
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,840
I’m scared something might happen to you.

452
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,440
But I don’t see it that way.

453
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,640
When it’s time to die, we all must die.

454
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,960
But I want to hold on a little longer,

455
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,240
long enough to see

456
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,160
you win the bidding.

457
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,880
You do know, Mae,

458
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,160
that I made you lead Superior in this auction

459
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,440
not just because I want the concession.

460
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,240
I believe it’s the shortcut

461
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,520
that will make everyone in the company

462
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,200
accept you.

463
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,480
You must become the leader of Superior

464
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,720
when I’m no longer here in this world.

465
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,040
Mae,

466
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,000
promise me, dear.

467
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Promise me you’ll do it.

468
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,240
Yes, Dad.

469
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,560
What should I tell Khun Maevika,
Khun Nuttakorn?

470
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,040
Just tell her it’s something serious.

471
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,600
Make it sound worse than it is.

472
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,760
But…

473
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,840
Doctor,

474
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,000
if you cooperate with me,

475
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,560
the new hospital building
that’s being planned,

476
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,800
I’ll give it my full support.

477
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,360
Are you sure about this?

478
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,200
Yes.

479
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,840
I’m sure.

480
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,600
May I ask…

481
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,880
what makes you so certain?

482
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,840
Because I asked myself,

483
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,760
if one day,

484
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,840
something happened that kept us apart,

485
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,200
what would I do?

486
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,680
And I already know the answer:

487
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,360
I’d do this.

488
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,000
The one thing we both want the most.

489
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,920
And I’d give it my all,

490
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,520
as if it were the last day.

491
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,120
Do you like it?

492
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Do I really have to say it?

493
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,160
Of course, I want to hear it.

494
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
If I say I do?

495
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,080
Then I’ll do it again.

496
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
And if I say I don’t?

497
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,400
Then I’ll keep doing it

498
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,360
until you like it.

499
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,960
So which answer is it?

500
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,760
You always seem to have
the upper hand over me, Khun Ai.

501
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,720
Not at all.

502
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,160
If anything, I’m the one
at a disadvantage.

503
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,760
Especially after today,

504
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,840
you’ve made me feel
even more for you, Mae.

505
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,160
If one day…

506
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,720
that day really comes,

507
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,800
the day you spoke of,

508
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,160
the day we can’t see each other again…

509
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,880
you wouldn’t want that, would you?

510
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,280
Who would?

511
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,600
It takes so long to find someone

512
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,960
who makes you truly happy,

513
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,560
who gives your life meaning.

514
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,160
That’s never easy.

515
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,040
But…

516
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,280
no one really knows

517
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,280
what tomorrow will bring.

518
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,960
Shall we make a pact?

519
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,160
That whatever happens from here on out,

520
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,880
it’ll only be…

521
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,680
because we no longer feel
the same for each other,

522
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,320
not because of the bidding results.

523
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,160
No matter how the results turn out,

524
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,200
we won’t let them decide

525
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,640
what happens between us.

526
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,280
Just us two, okay?

527
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,680
Alright?

528
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,800
I promise, Mae.

529
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,880
Hello, Khun Rachen.

530
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,920
Shall we meet tomorrow?

531
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,640
I’d like to know how far
you’ve gotten with your homework.

532
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,920
Honestly, it’s nothing too difficult.

533
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,840
That whole Greater plan,

534
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,600
it’s just a front they’ve put up.

535
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,800
I’ve got a few inside connections.

536
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,120
So I’ve learned the only thing
that really matters… is the number.

537
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,360
And if you can dig up Orienna’s number,

538
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,880
winning this bid will be easy.

539
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,000
But there are so many
companies in this bid.

540
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,800
Why focus only on Orienna?

541
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,920
Is there some secret deal

542
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,960
between Superior and Orienna?

543
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,360
This auction…

544
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,600
just got a lot more interesting.

545
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,360
Because Orienna is the company
that matters most to me.

546
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,600
I’ve gotten intel on the others.

547
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,680
Nothing too threatening there.

548
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,640
The only real player left… is Orienna.

549
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,600
So if you can uncover their number…

550
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,520
then we just put in
a number higher than theirs.

551
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,040
Winning this auction won’t be hard at all.

552
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,320
And do you actually have a way
to dig up Orienna’s figures?

553
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,120
No.

554
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,520
But I think you do.

555
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,560
Why would you think that?

556
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,280
Because you’re both women,

557
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,840
it should be easier
for you to get close.

558
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,840
And besides,

559
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,680
Aiwarin has a special interest in you.

560
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,000
Everyone can see it.

561
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,400
So let’s agree on this,

562
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,120
you handle digging up
Orienna’s numbers,

563
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,720
and I…

564
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,440
I’ll take care of the other companies.

565
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,680
Once we know Orienna’s figures,

566
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,440
we’ll adjust ours to top them.

567
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,880
And I’ll even step back for you,

568
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,960
so you can win the bid.

569
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,760
As for compensation,

570
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,640
I don’t want much.

571
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,400
Just bring me in to help manage
the parts you’re not good at.

572
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,480
That way, we’ll be partners.

573
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,680
And how can I be sure

574
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,800
you won’t stab me in the back later?

575
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,640
I don’t know.

576
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,200
But at the very least,

577
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,240
I’m honest enough

578
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,000
to tell you straight out what I want.

579
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
While some people

580
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,280
might come to you
with hidden motives,

581
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,160
acting far kinder to you
 than any rival should.

582
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,000
Father, did you come
to see me for something?

583
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,400
Last night,

584
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,400
I went to the hotel to see you.

585
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,360
I was about to go up to your room.

586
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,120
But do you know

587
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,960
why I didn’t?

588
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Because I happened to see…

589
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,480
that you had a very important guest.

590
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,320
What exactly is going on
between you and Superior’s heir?

591
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,720
I asked, what is going
on between you two?

592
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,600
Are you free the next couple
of days, Khun Mae?

593
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,640
What thrilling plan
are you dragging me into now?

594
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,560
(A secret deal between
two billion-dollar heiresses)

595
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:51,000
I think by entangling yourself
with that woman,

596
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,240
you’re taking on a risk that’s not worth it.

597
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,840
But I truly have feelings for her, Father.

598
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,880
Feelings? What feelings?

599
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,680
I’m assigning you to assist Aiwarin.

600
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,280
Dig out Superior’s bidding numbers.

601
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,480
But Mae would never hurt Ai, ever.

602
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,920
(That was close…)

603
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,520
- Cut!
- Cut.

604
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,040
Belle, you leaned in way too heavy.
(Don’t blame her!)

605
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,560
You really put your full weight into it.

606
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
I nearly toppled over.
(That’s called commitment!)

607
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,760
(A sudden flutter in the heart…)

608
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,600
Breaking into a sweat, hot and steamy.

609
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,720
And I already run hot.

610
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,520
So the sweat just poured out.
(Is your heart racing too?)

611
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,960
Felt like an onsen.
(This one’s hopeless…)

612
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,920
(Actually fell asleep!)

613
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,840
(Didn’t want to get up at all…)
