1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,240
You know that, right?

2
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,200
We may have just shaken hands
in front of the press,

3
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960
but we’re still business rivals.

4
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,480
Of course. I may be new in the game,

5
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
but I get how this works.

6
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Even if we’re rivals,

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,960
that doesn’t necessarily mean

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
we have to be enemies.

9
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,960
I’m not so sure about that.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,800
It kind of depends…

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,280
on what happens next, don’t you think?

12
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
(1 hour earlier)

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,960
(The Greater)

14
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello, everyone.

15
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Right now, we’re here at Greater Tower.

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
In just one hour,

17
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,200
a major national
project auction will take place.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,280
Hosted by The Greater Duty Free.

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,760
The energy inside is buzzing already.

20
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
Let’s take you inside for a closer look.

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,079
I just got here, Dad.

22
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,120
Alright. I’ll be there in about 20 minutes.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,360
Have you talked to any reporters yet?

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,240
Even after rehearsing a hundred interviews,

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,079
I’m still nervous.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Thinking of grabbing a drink…

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,320
might help me relax a bit.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,600
That’s a good idea, sweetie.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,760
Stress won’t help you one bit.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,720
This is your first real event…

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,960
your debut as Superior’s new leader.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
Iced matcha latte, no syrup, please.

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
One moment, please.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,600
It’s not just
the press you’ll be dealing with.

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,320
There are plenty of
Thai business rivals waiting for us.

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,640
When you face them,

37
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,600
stay calm. Stay sharp.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,400
Think carefully before every move.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,320
Otherwise, they’ll say…

40
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,560
that you were never cut out
for this from the start.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,160
Got it, Dad.

42
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
I won’t slip up.

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,240
I’ll prove myself to everyone.

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
That I’m not just some rookie

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
they can take down easily.

46
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,480
Especially not Orianna.

47
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,440
Orianna?

48
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,200
Why?

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,600
You’ve got plenty of rivals.

50
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
What’s so special about this one?

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,840
Well…

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,840
Because the face of Orianna

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,840
is also a woman like me.

54
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,040
Same age, too.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,880
And she’s just as good-looking.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,920
But she’s more experienced.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,360
She gets way more media coverage than I do.

58
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,000
She’s a public figure.

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
She probably thinks…

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,840
what she has gives her an edge over me.

61
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,160
But I’ll make her see…

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,760
the more we’re underestimated,

63
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,120
the more we burn to win.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I’ll probably arrive just before it starts.

65
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
We won’t have much prep time.

66
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,440
Just remember…

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,520
you are the face of Orianna.

68
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Where are you going, Aiwarin?

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
- Smoke break?
- Not a chance.

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,920
If anyone sees you, your image will tank.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
Please, Yam’s begging you. Please.

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,480
I get it. People warned me before you did.

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,640
Was it the Chairman?

74
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,400
Help me out here.

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,640
What can I do to kill this boredom?

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,680
Still almost an hour till showtime.

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,200
Walk. Just wander around the building.

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,720
It’ll kill time, burn calories,
and scope the place out.

79
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,080
Once this bidding war’s done,
we’ll be working here often anyway.

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,400
Good to get the lay of the land first.

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,720
Every war starts with studying the battlefield.

82
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Exactly. Let’s go.

83
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,120
Wait…

84
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,040
Let me grab a matcha real quick.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,640
Hello!

86
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,760
- One sweet iced matcha, please.
- Sure, just a moment.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
Here’s your matcha.

88
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,240
I’m so sorry…are you okay?

89
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
I’m fine.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Sorry again.

91
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,480
All set. Let’s head out.

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,800
Aiwarin…

93
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,440
Did you see that woman sitting over there?

94
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah.

95
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,600
Isn’t that Maevika, heir to Superior Group?

96
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
Mhm.

97
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,280
Knew it.

98
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,880
But I heard she just came back from abroad.

99
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,840
Why is she here at this event?

100
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,960
Could Superior be sending her
to represent them?

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,440
So what?

102
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,840
If that’s the case,

103
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,560
you should stay far away from her.

104
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,080
Don’t get close. Don’t get friendly.

105
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,960
Why? You think she’s
here to steal our secrets?

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,840
I’m not dumb enough to let that happen.

107
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,880
I know you're smart, Aiwarin.

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,760
I just want you to be careful.

109
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
Right now, whoever you talk to or hang out with…

110
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,040
you’ve got to be extra cautious.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,320
This competition’s brutal.

112
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,800
The stakes are massive.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,400
Everyone’s ready to fight to the death.

114
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,680
The old players aren’t much of a threat.

115
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,400
We’ve already got
the data on every one of them.

116
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,720
But…

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,760
a newcomer like Maevika?

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Once she hits the real game,
we don’t know her playbook.

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Better to treat her as a wildcard.

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,240
She doesn’t seem scary to me.

121
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,920
She’s kind of cute, actually.

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,960
Aiwarin, you can’t be serious.

123
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,400
It’s my great pleasure

124
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,160
to welcome you all
to the official press conference

125
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,280
for The Greater Duty Free bidding event.

126
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
We aim to develop
this into a brand new landmark

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
for duty-free shopping

128
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,440
that ranks among the biggest in the region.

129
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,560
The Greater isn’t just a retail complex.

130
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
It’s also a key move for driving
the national economy forward.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,360
And we firmly believe

132
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,360
this venue will attract tourists
from all over the world.

133
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,960
Boosting spending and
opening endless business opportunities…

134
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,000
for both public and private sectors.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,960
Today, we open the floor to investors

136
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,360
and capable business operators

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
to become part of our ambitious project.

138
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,920
Lastly, I’d like to thank
all members of the press

139
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,840
for your interest
and support for this project.

140
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Our bidding process involves multiple phases.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,960
I hope everything goes smoothly.

142
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,120
Let’s see who comes out on top.

143
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
Is there a particular reason, Mr. Attawit,

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,960
why you chose Aiwarin to lead this project?

145
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Because I trust her.

146
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,840
That’s all there is to it.

147
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,440
Aiwarin is the sole heir to Orianna.

148
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
So you must have
a lot of faith in her, Mr. Attawit?

149
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,800
I do.

150
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
She may be young,

151
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,040
but she thinks and makes
decisions like someone much older.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Not like most her age.

153
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
I think it’s clear to everyone…

154
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
many aspects of our hotel operations

155
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
are actually her work.

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,920
And all of it

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,960
has been very well received.

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
But Orianna has always been a hotel business.

159
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
Entering the duty-free concession space…

160
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,920
isn’t that unfamiliar territory?
Maybe a step behind others?

161
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,720
Like Superior, for example…they’re in retail.

162
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,640
What do you think gives you the edge to win?

163
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
Maybe ambition.

164
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,680
I once heard someone say…

165
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,280
the more we know we’re at a disadvantage,

166
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,720
the stronger our urge to win becomes.

167
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,280
Let’s move over to
Mr. Nuttakorn for a quick interview.

168
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,920
- Please go ahead.
- Hello, everyone.

169
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,040
We see you brought your daughter along today.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,520
Will your daughter be involved in the project?

171
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,880
Well, with that setup…

172
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,520
do I even need to answer?

173
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,760
Yes, she will.

174
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,160
Maevika is my only daughter.

175
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,200
She’ll be leading Superior
in this bidding round.

176
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
We heard that Maevika

177
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,960
just got her master’s abroad.

178
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
No work experience yet, right?

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,440
Aren’t you worried, putting her
in charge of something this big?

180
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,520
Exactly.

181
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,720
Well, I’d be lying if I said no.

182
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,960
But I trust my daughter.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,440
Just like any father would, I guess.

184
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,080
If there are more questions,

185
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,000
maybe ask her directly?

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,760
- Sounds good.
- Sure thing.

187
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
Hello, Mr. Nuttakorn.

188
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,520
Heard you let your daughter

189
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,120
take charge of this project too?

190
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,760
Interesting move.

191
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,080
But this is still a national-level project.

192
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,160
It’s not a training ground for fresh grads.

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,400
Honestly, Mr. Nuttakorn…

194
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,520
it’d be better if you were
front and center again.

195
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,120
Let her shadow you, learn the ropes.

196
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Then once she’s more seasoned,

197
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,440
she can take the reins.

198
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,120
Otherwise…

199
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,880
Superior…

200
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,920
might end up trailing
far behind the competition.

201
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,560
Thank you, Mr. Attawit, for your concern.

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
But I don’t see it that way.

203
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,160
Having experience…

204
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,680
doesn’t always mean you have the upper hand.

205
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,720
Even someone who’s never failed in their life

206
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,960
is still capable of falling flat.

207
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,000
If I may offer you some advice in return,

208
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,840
maybe start practicing
how to comfort your daughter

209
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,720
when the day comes that she falls short.

210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,920
From the look of it,

211
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,840
your daughter’s very self-assured.

212
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,040
So in case things don’t turn out as she hopes…

213
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,120
she’ll be prepared to handle disappointment.

214
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,200
Dad…

215
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,680
Hello.

216
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,120
Hi.

217
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,160
I’m Maevika.

218
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,920
It’s a pleasure to be here.

219
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,680
Now, we’d like to invite
both Maevika and Aiwarin…

220
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,120
for a photo together
as representatives of both companies.

221
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
Please step forward.

222
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
You two seem to be from the same generation.

223
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,560
Did you happen to know each other before?

224
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,600
Yes, we’ve met before.

225
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,040
For the charity event next month,

226
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,280
anyone with ideas, feel free to share them.

227
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
- Me, please.
- Go ahead.

228
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,040
I’m Maevika from St. Aldrich School.

229
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,840
I’d like to propose a gala dinner for the event.

230
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,040
Since this involves two prestigious schools,

231
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,000
we shouldn’t go small.

232
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
As for the venue,

233
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,760
I’ve talked to my dad, and we can use
the hall in his department store.

234
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
He’s fine with hosting it.

235
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,840
We also have an event organizer
ready to handle everything.

236
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,920
All we really need to do is

237
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,280
spread the word and get people to attend.

238
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,080
And help raise funds, of course.

239
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,920
If you still can’t picture it…

240
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,640
I’ve also prepared
a presentation to pitch my idea.

241
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,200
I disagree.

242
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
Go ahead.

243
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,680
A charity event is meant for giving back.

244
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Making it over-the-top and flashy…

245
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,200
feels more like showing off than giving.

246
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,960
I propose we keep it simple.

247
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,320
Use our school space
to set up a creative market.

248
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,840
Let students from both schools take part,

249
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,720
make DIY goods to sell,

250
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
and donate the proceeds.

251
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,640
We could also have busking,

252
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,040
performance art…

253
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,880
anything that highlights creativity

254
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,760
and hands-on contribution.

255
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,600
Not just relying
on one person’s family fortune.

256
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,440
Let’s not forget…

257
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,360
society already sees us

258
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,560
as rich kids from elite schools.

259
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,240
Privileged, well-connected.

260
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,720
Don’t we want to change that image?

261
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,920
Not just live off luxury and connections?

262
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
And show we can do basic,
functional things too?

263
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,200
You really think that’s gonna
change how people see us?

264
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,120
Bit too idealistic, isn’t it?

265
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,240
Maybe not right away.
But it has to start somewhere.

266
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,160
Anyone else want to pitch an idea?

267
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,400
If not…

268
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
we’ll proceed to vote.

269
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Starting with Maevika.

270
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,920
What’s your name again?

271
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,560
Aiwarin.

272
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,200
All in favor of Maevika’s idea,
raise your hand.

273
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,200
Now, those in favor of Aiwarin…hands up.

274
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,160
Alright, we’ll be going with Aiwarin’s idea.

275
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,280
Aiwarin…

276
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,640
well done.

277
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,440
In all my years of teaching,
I’ve never seen a student quite like yours.

278
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Thank you.

279
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,360
Let’s give her a round of applause.

280
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,520
Yes, we’ve met before.

281
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Hard to believe, right?

282
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,760
But we weren’t close or anything.

283
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,360
Just vaguely familiar.

284
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,280
Back in high school…

285
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,800
our schools once co-hosted
a charity event. That’s all.

286
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,280
Well then,

287
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,000
I guess it’s time…

288
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
to properly introduce myself, officially.

289
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,680
Nice to meet you.

290
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,120
Aiwarin.

291
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,680
Nice to meet you.

292
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
Maevika.

293
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,520
Find out everything you can about Maevika.

294
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,040
As much as possible.

295
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,880
And Aiwarin?

296
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,400
No need.

297
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,920
I already know her well enough.

298
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,320
You did well today, sweetie.

299
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,040
But you caught me off guard a little.

300
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,120
About what?

301
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,440
When you said you knew Aiwarin…

302
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,920
I thought you only knew her from the media.

303
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,960
Yeah… just like I said.

304
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
We only sort of knew each other.

305
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,720
That’s good.

306
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,920
She’s our rival.

307
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,480
If you want to learn more about her,

308
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,760
just don’t let her see it coming.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,920
You sure you don’t want
to grab dinner with me?

310
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,720
I’m sure. I’m not hungry yet.

311
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
I want to stay and survey the place a bit more.

312
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
Alright then.

313
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,440
See you at home, sweetheart.

314
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
Okay.

315
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,320
G, take care of her.

316
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
Dad…

317
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,840
Earlier…

318
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,040
what Mr. Attawit said about me…

319
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,120
It’s normal.

320
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
You may not have faced it before,

321
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
but now’s the time you should.

322
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,960
So you’ll understand
why losing is not an option for us.

323
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
About you and Maevika…

324
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,320
There’s nothing to worry about, Dad.

325
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
We only crossed paths briefly back in school.

326
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,200
In that case, stay here a while longer.

327
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,400
Survey the space.
Get a feel for how things run here.

328
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
Sure.

329
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,560
I’ve got high hopes for this project.

330
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
And when someone like me hopes for something…

331
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,720
I don’t leave room for failure.

332
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,240
Um, Aiwarin?

333
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,600
Why didn’t you tell your father just now

334
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,160
that we already walked every corner
of this place before the event?

335
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,480
- Every single part.
- Let it go.

336
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,120
Saying it wouldn’t change anything.

337
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,440
So we’re really going out for another round?

338
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,840
Nope. You go find a place to wait.

339
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,800
I’m gonna go unload real quick.

340
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,200
Been holding it in since the event started.

341
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Oh, Maevika.

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Seems like we’ve been running
into each other a lot today.

343
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,280
A lot? Really?

344
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,280
Well…here.

345
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,880
At the event.

346
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,640
And the coffee shop.

347
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,880
Sorry, what?

348
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Thanks for saying I’m good-looking, by the way.

349
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Likewise.

350
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
Then tell me…

351
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,680
why didn’t you say anything to the press

352
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,600
when I told them
we’ve known each other since school?

353
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,400
Did you really not recognize me?

354
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
You really don’t remember me?

355
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,080
Well...

356
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,840
weren’t you the one who said

357
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,320
we only knew each other vaguely?

358
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,600
So why expect me to…

359
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,480
Why would I need to remember you?

360
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Then that’s up to you.

361
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,440
Wait.

362
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,440
You do know, right?

363
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,600
That handshake we gave the media…

364
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,360
doesn’t change the fact
that we’re business rivals.

365
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,760
Of course.

366
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,280
I may be new to this world,

367
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,680
but I know how it works.

368
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,200
Even if we’re competitors,

369
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,320
that doesn’t necessarily mean

370
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,720
we have to be enemies.

371
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,640
I wouldn’t be too sure about that.

372
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,800
It depends…

373
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,120
on what happens

374
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,240
from here on out.

375
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,320
Your lipstick’s a bit much.

376
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,280
It doesn’t really suit you.

377
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,760
So I figured I’d share a bit of mine.

378
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,400
Maevika…

379
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,000
G, are you heading to the restroom?

380
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,600
No.

381
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,280
I just came in to check…saw she gone a while.
Thought something happened.

382
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,400
I’m fine.

383
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,720
Just got caught up reapplying lipstick. Took a bit longer.

384
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,760
Maevika…

385
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,760
You sure you’re really okay?

386
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
You think I’m lying?

387
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,960
Probably not.

388
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,840
But whatever technique you used on that lipstick…

389
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,800
it made quite the mess.

390
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
And now it’s even worse.

391
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Excuse me.

392
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,160
Not bad, assistant. Not bad at all.

393
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,800
Bag. Now.

394
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Something definitely happened.

395
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
Nothing did.

396
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,480
That pitch is too high. Spill it.

397
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,280
- Nope.
- Ugh, come on, what happened?

398
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
Why didn’t you say
anything to the press when

399
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,760
I told them we knew
each other from school?

400
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Why didn’t you say a word?

401
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
Did you really not recognize me?

402
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,680
- He came up with the whole idea himself.
- Yep, all by himself.

403
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,920
Thank you.

404
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,440
- That’s impressive.
- Totally.

405
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,840
Thanks so much.

406
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,680
You nailed it.

407
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,760
Just wait.

408
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,760
If I get the chance, I’ll make you pay.

409
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,800
Then hurry up and take your shot.

410
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
I’ll be waiting.

411
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,320
Good morning, G

412
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,400
- Morning.
- Waiting to head in with Maevika?

413
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
Come sit.

414
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,880
Want some tea or coffee?

415
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,520
No need, thank you.
I already had some at home.

416
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,560
So, what were you up to just now?

417
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,880
I was reviewing successful
duty-free cases overseas.

418
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,440
Maevika said before
the bid packet sale opens,

419
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,960
she wants to understand how
other countries approach their strategies.

420
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,320
In case she finds something useful.

421
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,800
Wow.

422
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,560
Your boss is seriously committed.

423
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,600
Do your best to support her, okay?

424
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
If anything comes up, just tell me.

425
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
I’ll find a subtle way to help out.

426
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,400
Without making her feel like I’m interfering.

427
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,880
Got it.

428
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,880
Dad…

429
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,400
I won’t be joining breakfast this morning.

430
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,200
G, go ahead to the office first.

431
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,560
I’ve got something to settle.
I’ll join you later.

432
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,880
What is it, sweetie?

433
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,760
It’s about a guy.

434
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,840
Gavin, right?

435
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,440
Yeah.

436
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,080
I’m heading out, Dad.

437
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,400
Alright.

438
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,160
- See you, Dad.
- Take care.

439
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,040
Who’s Gavin?

440
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,960
He’s the last guy May talked to.

441
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,280
Son of the Luxspeed Import owner.

442
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,400
Since when?

443
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,480
Since Mae studied in London.

444
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,880
They talked for a few months
before she pulled away.

445
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,440
But he kept chasing her.

446
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,760
Even followed her back to Thailand.

447
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,760
Why didn’t Mae take G with her?

448
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,680
Mae can handle it herself.

449
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,560
Gavin’s not the first guy she turned down.

450
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,440
She can handle it…

451
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,840
But how exactly?

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Mae, wait…

453
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,120
- What?
- I’m sorry.

454
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,760
- I really am.
- You’re annoying.

455
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,680
Please forgive me.

456
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Mae.

457
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,440
How many times I called you,
why you don't answer…

458
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,520
You ignored me. Who are you?

459
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,480
- Stop.
- Who are you?

460
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,960
- We don't need to talk
- I can have

461
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,720
so many girls like you

462
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,680
- Stop
- Hey, I'm talking to you

463
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,440
- Fxxk
- Fxxk you

464
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,960
Alright.

465
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,440
You don’t have to give me an answer now.

466
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,680
But you’re Mae’s assistant, G.

467
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,520
You need to keep an eye on her.

468
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,840
The way she handles problems…

469
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,600
is it gonna put her reputation at risk?

470
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,000
Don’t forget…

471
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,120
We just launched her
as Superior’s lead at the auction.

472
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,720
Every move she makes
will be under a microscope.

473
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
I hired you to assist Mae…

474
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,320
not just follow her orders blindly.

475
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,040
You have to assess the risks too.

476
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,960
If something she does is going to blow up…

477
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,120
…you step in and fix it.

478
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,240
Don’t just stand there and let it happen.

479
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,960
Otherwise, there’s no point
in you being here at all.

480
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,720
Am I wrong?

481
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,840
Yes sir.

482
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Thanks for closing the café like I asked.

483
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,440
I’ve got to be careful right now.

484
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,240
I don’t want any drama.

485
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Take a seat.

486
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,320
Whatever you want to say, just say it.

487
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,560
I don’t have much time.

488
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,880
I’ve got nothing to say.

489
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,480
You’re the one who called this…go on.

490
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,320
Did I really do something that bad?

491
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,639
Is that why you’re so set on ending it?

492
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,840
I already told you.

493
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,600
You didn’t do anything wrong.

494
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,679
You’re just… not it.

495
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,320
Not it?

496
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,320
What does that even mean?

497
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,880
Can we not do this?

498
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,199
The best thing for both of us
right now is to walk away, Gavin.

499
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,639
Forcing it won’t fix anything.

500
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,880
And most importantly…

501
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,400
Right now I’ve got bigger things
to deal with than romance.

502
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,800
I need to focus on my work.

503
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,600
And so do you.

504
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,080
You’ve got your own job to get back to.

505
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,760
So stop chasing after me.

506
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,440
Why do you get to be
the only one who chooses?

507
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,080
Do I get a say in anything at all?

508
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,320
We both have choices, Gavin.

509
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,400
But you need to respect mine too.

510
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,880
And have you respected mine?

511
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,320
All you ever say is you
want to end it, over and over.

512
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,080
- Just like that.
- Hey.

513
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,400
Are you serious right now?

514
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,360
You keep picking fights.
Can’t you just listen?

515
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
When will you finally get it, huh?

516
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,600
- Wait, Mae…
- Ow! Gavin, that hurts!

517
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,480
- Let’s just talk…
- I’m done talking. Let go!

518
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,840
- We need to clear this up, Mae…
- I said it hurts!

519
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,720
I don’t want to break up with you.
Please, just hear me out!

520
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,360
- That’s enough.
- Why, Mae?

521
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
Why do you even care?

522
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,120
Let go…ow, that hurts! Let go!

523
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Let go! I said let go, damn it!

524
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,200
If you don’t want to get hurt…

525
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,480
then stay away from Mae.

526
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,720
What the hell’s your problem?

527
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,560
- You’re just her lackey, mind your damn business.
- That’s enough!

528
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,840
Yeah, I’m just a lackey.

529
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,080
But I’ve got more worth
than you’ll ever have.

530
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,240
You were born with everything,
yet you waste it all.

531
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,360
Spending your days
begging some woman to stay.

532
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,960
Let me ask you something…

533
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,760
aren’t you even ashamed of yourself?

534
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,920
- Damn it!
- Go ahead.

535
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,800
If you wanna go, bring it on.

536
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,680
Let’s go.

537
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,480
Mae, are you alright?

538
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,280
I’m fine, thanks.

539
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,400
G, why did you come after me?

540
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,840
I wasn’t planning to follow you at first.

541
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,440
But I couldn’t help worrying.

542
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,320
You’re not just Superior’s heir anymore.

543
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,120
You’re the one leading our company now.

544
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,920
I’m sorry if I overstepped.

545
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
But honestly…

546
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,400
you should block
all ways for Gavin to reach you.

547
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
So this won’t happen again.

548
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,360
Actually...

549
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,800
I’ve been meaning to block him for a while.

550
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,080
But part of me still wanted to hold on.

551
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
It’s not just Gavin…

552
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,960
even I don’t understand why I keep hanging on.

553
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,080
I don’t even understand myself sometimes.

554
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,600
Thank you, P’Min.

555
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,040
It’s confirmed for tomorrow, yeah?

556
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,440
I’m excited!

557
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,920
It’s our class reunion, after all.

558
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,760
We’re gonna gossip ‘til sunrise!

559
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,400
For sure. See you all there!

560
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,840
The party’s at the Orianna Hotel?

561
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,280
Hello, Nutty.

562
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,800
Who picked the venue for the reunion?

563
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,320
We voted. Why?

564
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,080
Oh…turns out that place
is in your competitor’s hotel.

565
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,920
Oops. But it’s no big deal, right?

566
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,160
If you’re nervous,
you don’t have to come.

567
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,520
I’m sure everyone will understand.

568
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
It’s great seeing you all again.

569
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,880
But I think I should...

570
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,360
head out now.
– Bye!

571
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,240
Did he follow you?

572
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,560
Yeah.

573
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,880
Need help?

574
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,360
Tell the guy who followed her
what the rules are.

575
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,000
Yes, Khun Ai.

576
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,680
Mae…

577
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,240
Mae, Mae…

578
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,120
Ah, sorry, sir.

579
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,600
Men aren’t allowed in here.

580
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,440
Anthea Bar is for women only.

581
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,800
Mae. Mae…

582
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,960
Right this way.

583
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,680
Two glasses of wine, please.

584
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,960
Thanks for helping me just now.

585
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,640
Of course.

586
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,400
And I’m sorry…

587
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,280
for touching you without permission earlier.

588
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,320
No worries.

589
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,400
Last time you did way more.

590
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,280
And you didn’t even say sorry.

591
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,360
This time my intentions were good.

592
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,800
So last time your intentions weren’t?

593
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,680
Guess that’s fair.

594
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,840
You did take my lipstick.

595
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,000
Let me see…

596
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,080
did you go even bolder this time?

597
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,680
Stay here for now.

598
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,640
Just to make sure
the guy who followed you has left.

599
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,200
Then you can head out.

600
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,160
It’s okay.

601
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,160
I can find my way out.

602
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,640
There’s probably another exit somewhere.

603
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,680
How could you possibly know
this place better than me?

604
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,800
Just stay a little longer.

605
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,480
I’d like you to stay.

606
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,040
Drink with me.

607
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,680
I don’t drink.

608
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
Excuse me, I’ll be leaving.

609
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,080
Turning down someone who just helped you…

610
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,280
that’s kind of rude, isn’t it?

611
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,200
You don’t mind, do you?

612
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,400
If we share a glass.

613
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,680
Do whatever you want.

614
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,840
Not like I’ve got a choice.

615
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,960
So tell me…

616
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,320
what brings you here tonight?

617
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,160
I come here quite often actually.

618
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,760
Out of all the businesses under our company…

619
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,680
Anthea Bar is my personal favorite.

620
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
Why is that?

621
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,440
Because every time I come here…

622
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
I get to be myself.

623
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,640
No need to worry about
how people look at me or judge me.

624
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,080
Because everyone here…

625
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
they’re just like me.

626
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,280
We like the same things.

627
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,120
Like what exactly?

628
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,400
Like women?

629
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,320
And if I do…

630
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,120
what then?

631
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,800
I want you to know…

632
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,880
how things changed for me.

633
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,240
In case you

634
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,560
want to find some answers for yourself.

635
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,800
None of this was random.

636
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,920
Khun Ai set things up so you
and her would be alone.

637
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
And don’t you think maybe Mae agreed

638
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,840
because maybe Mae feels the same way she does.

639
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,840
People like me…

640
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,600
never play to lose.

641
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,120
If you're here to play games…

642
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,400
I'll play just as hard.

643
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,000
And if you keep going like this…

644
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,480
you’ll lose every single time.

645
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,280
(What's wrong?)

646
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,480
You moved closer out here

647
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,400
because it's cold?
(Is it really?)

648
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,640
(Bet you're not cold anymore.)

649
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,560
(Warm and cozy now.)

650
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,480
(That’s straight up fire.)

651
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,680
Mae…Khun Mae.

652
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,240
That light's intense.
(It’s blinding!)

653
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,720
My eyes can’t take brightness.

654
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,040
And they’re already small eyes.

655
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,440
Oops.

656
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
(Was that on purpose?)

657
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,040
Suddenly hitting people now, are we?
(Was that planned?)
