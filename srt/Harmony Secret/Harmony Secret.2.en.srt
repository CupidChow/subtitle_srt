1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,320
Just because we shook hands for the press

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,560
doesn't mean we're enemies now.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,560
You should stay away from Khun Ai.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,560
Don't get close or friendly.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,840
Who's Gavin?

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,520
Mae's most recent fling.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,800
- I'm done.
- Talk to me first.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
- Let go.
- I don't wanna break up.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,120
If you don't wanna get hurt,
stay away from Mae.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,520
- Did he follow you?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,160
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
Because everyone here likes the same thing.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,560
Girls?

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,880
If so, what’s the problem?

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Quiet.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,800
You don’t think I’m weird, do you?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,320
Not at all.

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,920
Liking the same gender is totally normal.

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm just surprised,

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,760
'cause I've never heard about it before.

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,080
The media keeps talking nonstop

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,200
about how you're
this hotshot young entrepreneur.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,000
But no outlet has ever
mentioned your preferences.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
I’ve never dated anyone seriously.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,240
And no one’s ever asked me.

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,360
So I don’t see the point of
announcing it to anyone.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Then why tell me?

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Aren’t you afraid I’ll discredit you?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,600
I don’t think

30
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
you’re the kind of person who plays dirty.

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,280
And if you were that shady,

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,600
you wouldn’t have shown up
at Orienna tonight.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,759
Honestly,

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,160
I didn’t even wanna come.

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,200
But my friends planned to meet here.

36
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
I couldn’t really say no.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
You? Seriously?

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,759
Can’t say no to your friends?

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,800
I think

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,480
there’s probably another reason.

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,639
Whatever the reason may be,

42
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm glad you're here.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,000
It’s nice seeing you again.

44
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,400
Khun Maple.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
How do you know my nickname?

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
You did your homework on me, didn’t you?

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,400
So why can’t I do mine on you?

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,600
Khun Maple…

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
It’s a really cute name.

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Thanks.

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,040
But we’re not close.

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
And we never will be.

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,040
So I think you’d better stick with Maeveeka.

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
Don’t say “never” just yet.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
Fate…

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
it always has its tricks.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,560
Trust me.

58
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,480
Excuse me, manager.

59
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,960
Is Khun Ai at Anthea?

60
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,200
Yam wants to talk to her about something.

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I tried calling, but she won’t pick up.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,920
She’s here, Khun Yam.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
She’s talking to...

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,520
Talking to who?

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
- Khun Maeveeka.
- What?

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,120
Okay then.

67
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,520
Keep an eye on them from a distance.

68
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
And save all the CCTV footage.

69
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,079
Every single camera.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,360
If anything leaks and becomes a problem,

71
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,480
we’ll have proof to deal with it.

72
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
Khun Ai, seriously...

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,640
I told you already, not this one.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Who is that guy?

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Why is he following you?

76
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,920
An ex-date.

77
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
We talked for a while.

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
And then...

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,520
When I realized he wasn’t it, I backed off.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,760
And...

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,160
Are you like this with everyone?

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,040
What do you mean?

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
I mean…

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
You talk to someone,
then realize they’re not it.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
Why do you wanna know?

86
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Just tell me.

87
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,520
It won’t affect our business anyway.

88
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,040
Well...

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
Everyone.

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
But this one’s the only one

91
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,320
who still won’t stop chasing me.

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,320
Guess he just couldn’t take it.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
People like that are so annoying.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,480
You talk like you've been through it.

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,600
I have.

96
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,160
With a girl?

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
With a guy.

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,160
Before we know what we really like,

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
we’ve got to make some mistakes first.

100
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
And...

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,440
When did you know?

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,760
I guess it was around the time

103
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,760
I first went abroad for school.

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,640
Back then, I thought I was fine with guys.

105
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,400
But when I gave girls a chance…

106
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,040
started talking to them more…

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
and eventually slept with one…

108
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,000
that’s when I knew for sure.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,800
This is what I like.

110
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,640
You didn’t have to be that detailed.

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,520
What do you mean?

112
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,480
That was just the intro.

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
I want you to know…

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
how that turning point felt for me.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,600
So maybe...

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,440
you might wanna find your own answers too.

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,280
I think...

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,480
I’d better head back.
Gavin’s probably gone.

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Khun Ai.

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,200
The lobby said
that guy came back to the bar.

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Want me to handle it?

122
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,480
No need. I’ll handle it myself.

123
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
Okay.

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,560
Looks like he’s still trying.

125
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,480
I’ll come with you then.

126
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Let’s go.

127
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
Don’t be nervous.

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,440
Just go with it if I do anything.

129
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,280
Where’s your car? I’ll drive you.

130
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,400
Come on, let’s go.

131
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Hurry, let’s go!

132
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
What now? We can’t shake him.

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,800
Just drive. I’ll find my way back.

134
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
Mae! Mae!

135
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
Mae!

136
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
Pull over here.

137
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
I’m heading off now.

138
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,000
Wait.

139
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,680
Just now…

140
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Thanks for helping me.

141
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,280
I don’t accept thanks.

142
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
I’ll take something else instead.

143
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,000
And...

144
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
What would that be?

145
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,640
I'll let you know later.

146
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
Bye.

147
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,640
Khun Ai, that guy came back to the bar again.

148
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,280
Want me to handle it?

149
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,480
No need. I’ll handle it myself.

150
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
I’ll go with you.

151
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,440
Looks like...

152
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,840
we’ll have to pretend to be a couple for now.

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,400
Sorry, what?

154
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,560
He already saw you

155
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,760
entering a bar full of women.

156
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,880
So make him believe it.

157
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,160
That you’re dating a woman.

158
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,720
Then maybe he’ll finally let go.

159
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
Come on.

160
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,160
Don’t be tense.
Just go with it if I do anything.

161
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,160
Stop it, Maple.

162
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,760
What’s wrong with you?

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,320
Why would she even do that?

164
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,720
Khun Yolada.

165
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,000
I told you to send the market analysis files

166
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
for all companies likely to bid, last night.

167
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,520
Why didn’t you send them?

168
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,440
You’re usually never late.

169
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,360
Is there a problem?

170
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
There is.

171
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
What is it?

172
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,440
Why didn’t you call?

173
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,280
I did. But you didn’t answer.

174
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,080
I heard you were busy
entertaining a VIP at Anthea Bar.

175
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,360
I warned you, didn’t I?

176
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,760
It’s not that I didn’t listen.

177
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,000
I was just minding my own business.

178
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,760
He’s the one who showed up.

179
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
And since I’m the host…

180
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
Of course I had to greet him.

181
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,400
What did you expect me to do,
kick him out?

182
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
Khun Ai,

183
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,240
you haven’t been
“just minding your business.”

184
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,720
Ever since you saw him
at the Greater Building,

185
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
you’ve been acting off.

186
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,480
Maeveeka’s a newcomer.

187
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,080
We don’t know what her angle is.

188
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,800
We should be cautious around her.

189
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,440
She’s not scary.

190
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,040
She’s adorable.

191
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,880
Yes, I want her.

192
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,640
There are tons of women out there.

193
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,600
But she’s different.
She’s more special than anyone.

194
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,920
And more dangerous than anyone, too.

195
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,480
She’s the competition.

196
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
Getting involved with the competition
is a disaster waiting to happen.

197
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,640
Maybe not.
Maybe it could turn out well.

198
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,000
I mean, if we’re on the same page,

199
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,760
maybe we can come to an agreement
on how to move forward.

200
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,840
So we both benefit from it.

201
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,160
- But that’s still…
- It’s fine.

202
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,680
You don’t have to worry about me.

203
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,400
No one’s gonna get hurt from this.

204
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,320
Khun Ai.

205
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,520
Khun Ai.

206
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,840
Greater just sent an email.

207
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,960
They invited the first batch of
companies buying bid packets

208
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,440
to attend an urgent meeting this Thursday.

209
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,840
About what?

210
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,200
They’re opening the bids next week.

211
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,560
The Business Promotion Research Institute

212
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,320
and the Small Traders Association

213
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
have submitted a joint complaint.

214
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,440
It’s about monopoly practices
from previous concession holders.

215
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,560
So they’re inviting our company,

216
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Orienna, and the others joining the bid

217
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,520
to a meeting before the official conference.

218
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,480
To discuss how we want
to respond to that claim.

219
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,359
Orienna too?

220
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,520
If you don’t want to go, Mae,
I can send someone else.

221
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,599
Hold on, P’G.

222
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,280
I’ll go.

223
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,640
You can add it to my schedule.

224
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,160
Got it.

225
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,520
Is this the full list of bidders, P’G?

226
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,920
You can keep it for now.

227
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
I also listed the complaints for you.

228
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,080
In case you wanna check during the meeting.

229
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,400
No need. I’ve memorized every word.

230
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Okay.

231
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,000
Khun Mae.

232
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
Khun Mae. Khun Mae.

233
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,640
Yes?

234
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,080
Let’s go. Orienna already went in.

235
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Okay.

236
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,240
Regarding the concession fee policy,

237
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,720
we propose raising the rate.

238
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,200
Higher than what’s charged to
duty-free shops at airports.

239
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,280
How much does Greater plan to charge?

240
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,000
We can’t disclose that yet.

241
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,520
All information will be in the TOR documents.

242
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,960
Everyone will receive them
on the day bids go on sale.

243
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,080
But that’s why we’re proposing you
change it now, before then.

244
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
We’ve already made our decision.

245
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,440
If there’s to be a change,
it should apply to the next round.

246
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,480
But the contract lasts over ten years.

247
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,880
Don’t you want to reconsider?

248
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,200
Do you really want that, Khun Maeveeka?

249
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,360
Yes. If it’s better in the long run,

250
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
I’m fine with it.

251
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,840
I can afford the higher fees

252
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,760
if I win the bid.

253
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
And paying higher fees

254
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
means more income for the country too.

255
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,040
But I think…

256
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,200
if everything’s already set in the TOR,

257
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,040
we shouldn’t change things mid-way.

258
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,120
It could affect the whole bidding process.

259
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,640
And since I’m one of
the candidates in this round…

260
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,800
I think we should respect the original terms.

261
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,680
Whoever wins the concession

262
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,040
should manage it well under those terms.

263
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,120
And in the future,
if anyone feels it’s unfair,

264
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,520
they can file a complaint

265
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,200
so changes can be considered next time.

266
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Thank you, Khun Aiwarin,

267
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,480
for opening that possibility.

268
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,120
From what Khun Aiwarin said,

269
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
I think we can all see that

270
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,520
a single-operator monopoly like before

271
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,080
might not be working anymore.

272
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,680
Because whoever wins the concession

273
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,720
will carry an enormous responsibility.

274
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,120
When in fact,
that risk could be distributed.

275
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,760
How so?

276
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Besides listening to complaints today,

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,080
I also have a proposal.

278
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,960
I’d like Greater Duty Free

279
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,120
to adopt a category-based bidding system.

280
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,760
This wouldn’t just reduce risk…

281
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,400
it would give us a more
complete duty-free model.

282
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
Especially if we bring in business groups

283
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,640
with experts in each category to manage them.

284
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,840
I know it won’t be easy.

285
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,840
News of this bid has
already spread everywhere.

286
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,400
Everyone knows Greater wants just one winner.

287
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,800
But for me,

288
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,400
this project is a chance to
create something new.

289
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Single-concession models are
outdated in many countries now.

290
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,600
That’s why I think we should try
a more flexible approach…

291
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,320
something that fits today’s world better.

292
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,280
I agree with that point.

293
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,000
We agree as well.

294
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,240
Alright then, let’s say…

295
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,680
we’ll take this proposal into consideration.

296
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
But as everyone knows,

297
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,920
the bidding period coincides
with the national election.

298
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,480
We’ll need to proceed in a neutral manner

299
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,040
and wait to see where
the new government stands.

300
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,360
I understand. Just the fact that Greater

301
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,760
is considering my proposal…

302
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,360
that already means a lot to me.

303
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,360
I agree with the proposal,

304
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
and your fresh perspective.

305
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you so much.

306
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,000
Honestly, I do believe this idea

307
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,880
could really help investors
like us manage risk better.

308
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
- I’ll take my leave now.
- Of course.

309
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,520
- Hope to see you again.
- Likewise.

310
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
How are you?

311
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,120
- How was it?
- Pretty good, P’G.

312
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
We’ve got another meeting this afternoon.

313
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
Coffee’s here.

314
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Come here.

315
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,680
Yes?

316
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,400
Do whatever it takes to get
Maeveeka’s assistant out.

317
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,400
- What?
- Now.

318
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,240
For how long?

319
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,640
As long as you possibly can.

320
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,040
Shall we head out then?

321
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
I’ll go get the car ready first.

322
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,200
Okay.

323
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,080
Call me, okay?

324
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh no!

325
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,280
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to, really.

326
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
I was too caught up talking
about work, I didn’t see.

327
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,520
So clumsy, aren’t you?

328
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,640
Yeah, look…what a mess.

329
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,240
I should go clean up first.

330
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,040
- Let me help…
- No need.

331
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,840
I can handle it myself.

332
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
Mae…

333
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
Go wait for me at the car.

334
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,640
I’ll be right there when I’m done.

335
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,240
Khun Mae, do you think
I should help P’G?

336
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,160
I should, right? Since it was my fault.

337
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,760
I should take responsibility.

338
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,520
I’ll excuse myself, then.

339
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
Why are you following me?

340
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,400
Who said I was following you?

341
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,560
I’m just heading to the parking lot too.

342
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
Then why not use a different elevator?

343
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,960
Or wait until I left?

344
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,040
Don’t you know
we shouldn’t act close in public?

345
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,320
Oh? I didn’t know we were close.

346
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,040
But good to know.

347
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,720
What is it?

348
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,440
Are you scared?

349
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,120
I’m not scared.

350
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,960
It’s just inappropriate.

351
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,200
We’re just in the same elevator.

352
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,560
Can’t we call it a coincidence?

353
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
Let go.

354
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,200
My boss needs to talk to your boss privately,

355
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,920
so I’ve been assigned
to look after you for now.

356
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,960
Look after me?

357
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
Oh no!

358
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,240
I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to!

359
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,160
You spilled coffee on me…

360
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,720
So this was your
and your boss’s plan, right?

361
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,360
Yes.

362
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,960
- Back off.
- No.

363
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,800
You… You…

364
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Stop.

365
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,600
You want me to leave nicely,

366
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,920
or do you want force?

367
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Go ahead.

368
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,440
I’ll scream the whole building down.

369
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,960
Let them think you’re trying to rape me.

370
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
Are you insane?

371
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,760
No. I’m serious.

372
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,440
And you’ll be in trouble.

373
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,000
You…and Maeveeka too.

374
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,520
Go ahead.

375
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,920
No one’s gonna believe

376
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,680
something that stupid.

377
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,520
Doesn’t matter.

378
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,920
Nowadays, once someone says it out loud…

379
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,360
and someone else repeats it…

380
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,560
that’s already enough to cause damage.

381
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,680
Don’t worry so much.

382
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,720
If your boss feels unsafe with mine,

383
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,360
she’ll call you herself.

384
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
And when that happens, I’ll let you go.

385
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
But for now…

386
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
just wait, okay?

387
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,360
Superstar assistant.

388
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,480
Mae.

389
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
Ugh, Gavin, what now?

390
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,880
I’m not here to bug you.

391
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
I just wanna clear something up.

392
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,160
When you said I’m not the one…

393
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,880
Was it 'cause I’m not a woman?

394
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,160
I saw you that day at Orienna Hotel.

395
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,400
And I know you saw me too.

396
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,080
You really like that kind of thing, huh?

397
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,160
But I think…

398
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,560
you’re just putting on a show to fool me.

399
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,080
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,200
Why would I do that?

401
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,360
Yeah, right. You don’t even like women.

402
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,240
You’re just doing this to spite me.

403
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Why?

404
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,840
If I want to be with someone,

405
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,000
does it have to be a man?

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,440
Exactly.

407
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,920
Why do you assume

408
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Maeveeka couldn’t be with a woman?

409
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
I told you to wait and walk in together.

410
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,320
Why’d you come ahead?

411
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,640
See? Just a moment apart,

412
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
and this happens.

413
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,960
Over something so ridiculous too.

414
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,640
You’re Gavin,

415
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,240
son of Lux Speed’s CEO,

416
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,960
a major car importer, right?

417
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,640
Educated overseas…

418
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,840
Who knew you’d have such a narrow mindset?

419
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,520
This is between me and Mae.

420
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,000
This isn’t your business.

421
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,960
Khun Aiwarin.

422
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,800
Narrow-minded and blind, huh?

423
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,960
What a combo.

424
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,400
Mae and I are this close,

425
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,560
and you still can’t tell?

426
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
You really don’t see

427
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,280
what we are to each other?

428
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,240
That woman who was
with Mae at Orienna that night…

429
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,760
that was me.

430
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,360
No way.

431
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,920
No chance.

432
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Believe what you want.

433
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,960
Let’s go, babe.

434
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,120
No point talking to someone
who denies reality.

435
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,560
It’s a waste of time.

436
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Like preaching to a wall.

437
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,720
If it’s true, why tell me?

438
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,760
Aren’t you afraid I’ll tell the press?

439
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,560
Go ahead. Try it.

440
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,080
I'm not so sure either.

441
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,440
Whether it's about me dating Mae

442
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,800
or you trying to harass her…

443
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,680
which headline would hit harder?

444
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,200
Your parents would be thrilled to see that.

445
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,200
I heard your dad’s pretty strict.

446
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,040
I didn’t harass her.

447
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,880
But what you did says otherwise.

448
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,120
And I’ve got proof.

449
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Security cams at Orienna

450
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,280
and here too.

451
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,280
Remember this…

452
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,320
someone like me

453
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,200
never backs down.

454
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,160
If you wanna play games,

455
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,000
I can hit just as hard…

456
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,920
or harder.

457
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,840
So go ahead, use that tiny brain of yours

458
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,320
and figure out between you and me,

459
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,200
who’s gonna win.

460
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,040
This is the third time now

461
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,880
that I’ve helped you

462
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,480
So tell me already

463
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,040
what you want in return

464
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,200
so we can settle this once and for all

465
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,800
You're in a rush, huh?

466
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,480
Not planning ahead for the future?

467
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,200
What if I need to help you again?

468
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
Khun Aiwarin

469
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,120
Can you walk me to the underground parking?

470
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,280
That’s where I parked my car

471
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,320
Oh, then…

472
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,080
Why are you following me?

473
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,960
I just wanted to walk you there

474
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,400
And talk to you about something

475
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,400
I really admire some of your ideas

476
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
that you brought up in the meeting

477
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,840
But I just wanted to remind you

478
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,520
that in business

479
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,360
you can’t always be that blunt

480
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,200
You need to learn some finesse.

481
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,920
And play the game a little.

482
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,720
Don’t let people see through you too easily.

483
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,440
Don’t let them read your mind.

484
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,720
Because you never know

485
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,120
who’s out to get you.

486
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,880
And if you keep being like this,

487
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,120
you’ll lose every single time.

488
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,520
Your car’s in the basement, right?

489
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,200
Whoa, where are you going?

490
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,920
I’m not waiting anymore.

491
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Hey.

492
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,120
Ouch.

493
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,040
That’s too much.

494
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,640
We’re here.

495
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,040
Now we’re even, aren’t we?

496
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,440
How can we be?

497
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,560
I’ve saved you three times.

498
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,880
You’ve only paid me back once.

499
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,320
So is there a way we could even it up?

500
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,480
I’ll make it up to you all at once.

501
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,360
You...

502
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,320
Just think about it.

503
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,719
Are you satisfied now?

504
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,199
I think...

505
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,320
That wasn’t you returning the favor.

506
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,239
It’s more like you feel something for me.

507
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,840
Normally...

508
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,719
people don’t just kiss like that.

509
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,679
Not if they feel nothing.

510
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,360
Don’t you think maybe
I just wanted to try it too?

511
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,360
Try what?

512
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,840
Find the answer you talked about.

513
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,840
Wanna try a little more?

514
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,040
I’ll be waiting.

515
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,680
Come see me at
the Antier Bar when you’re ready.

516
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,640
What did Khun Ai talk to you about?

517
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,120
Just random stuff.

518
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,400
But do you know...

519
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,840
none of what’s happened is a coincidence?

520
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,320
Khun Ai planned it
so you'd be alone with him.

521
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,280
If it ever happens again,

522
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,600
you must not give in.

523
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm sure his intentions aren't good.

524
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,400
He might be getting close to you

525
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,400
just to extract secrets for
his benefit in this auction.

526
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,880
But don’t you think, P’G,

527
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,320
that Mae might have agreed

528
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,160
because she feels the same way?

529
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,520
Don’t be silly.

530
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,320
- You can’t see through his tricks.
- P’G...

531
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,320
That’s kind of insulting to Mae, you know?

532
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,640
That’s not it.

533
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,240
I’m just worried about you.

534
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,200
You don’t have to worry about
every little thing.

535
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,120
Especially not work stuff.

536
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,920
Let me think,

537
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
and decide things on my own sometimes.

538
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,160
Whatever the outcome may be,

539
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,160
I’ll deal with it myself.

540
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
I understand.

541
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,360
I think I’ll head straight home, P’G.

542
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,640
Probably won’t stop by the office.

543
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,920
Alright.

544
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,120
We can part ways here then.

545
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,040
One pill and you’re out cold?

546
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Hey, go check the entrance.

547
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,320
- Damn it
- Damn it

548
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,160
What kind of guy are you?

549
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,680
How could you do that to a woman?

550
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,600
What the hell’s your problem?

551
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Come on, then.

552
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,360
Why’d you let him drug you like that?

553
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,800
Good thing I got there in time.

554
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,120
P’G is just my campus mentor,

555
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
but she really cares about me.

556
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,560
And...

557
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,520
she treats me like a real sister.

558
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,080
Thank you.

559
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
You don’t have to thank me.

560
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,880
I'm happy I got to take care of you, Mae.

561
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,120
I know you're looking for a job, G.

562
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,240
Once you graduate,

563
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,120
why don't you work at my dad’s company?

564
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,120
He’s looking for someone to take care of me.

565
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,120
So you can look after me forever.

566
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,160
I’m just worried.

567
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,360
You don’t have to worry about everything.

568
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,840
Especially work stuff.

569
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,240
Let me make some decisions for myself, okay?

570
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,280
Hey, assistant.

571
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,480
You look like someone with a broken heart.

572
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,440
I admire a lot of your ideas.

573
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,520
But I also want to warn you…
when it comes to business,

574
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,320
you can't be too straightforward.

575
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,040
You need to learn some finesse.

576
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,440
You never know
who might be out to get you.

577
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,040
And if you keep being like this,

578
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,000
you’ll lose every single time.

579
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,480
You'll see soon enough.

580
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,080
Turns out I’m way
more cunning than you thought.

581
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,240
People don’t usually kiss
that easily, you know?

582
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,960
Not unless they feel something.

583
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,360
You don’t think I just wanted to try it?

584
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,280
Wanna try more?

585
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Come find me at
the Anthea Bar when you’re ready.

586
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,320
I’m here, just like we said.

587
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,760
Does your dad know you're here?

588
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,240
That you're meeting me?

589
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,680
Does your dad know you like girls?

590
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,600
I’m not so sure myself.

591
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,560
But I don’t think he does.

592
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,120
Because if he did,

593
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,320
he wouldn’t just sit back like this.

594
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,640
My dad’s addicted to success.

595
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
He’d never let something like this

596
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,600
get in the way of his success.

597
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,720
So that means…

598
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,600
if you were to get serious with a girl,

599
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,360
you wouldn’t be able to be
with her, would you?

600
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,440
Maybe not.

601
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,200
If that day ever comes,

602
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,280
I’ll follow my heart.

603
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,280
No matter what it costs me.

604
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,120
Say it out loud.

605
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,600
I want to hear it.

606
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,440
This is my first time.

607
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,200
I wanted it to happen
somewhere a little nicer.

608
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,320
Like...

609
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,640
maybe your place?

610
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,760
Sure.

611
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,360
Let’s go then.

612
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,120
Wanna drink something?

613
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,480
Anything you think suits me.

614
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,240
Then you’ll have to wait a bit.

615
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,760
Because when I make a drink,

616
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,200
I give it special care.

617
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,200
Just like when I do anything else.

618
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Right...

619
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,560
Then while we wait,

620
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,240
I’m gonna look around your place a bit.

621
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,160
It’s a nice room.

622
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,560
I like it.

623
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,440
Make yourself at home.

624
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,040
What are you doing?

625
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,280
Who’d you bring here?

626
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,040
But this is Ai’s personal matter.

627
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,480
Don’t use that line on me.

628
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,840
It reminds me of your mother.

629
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,200
Rachen.

630
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,800
Hello, Khun Maevika.

631
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,040
If you plan to approach Maevika

632
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,160
the same way you did with me,

633
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
just forget it.

634
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,760
I don’t need your approval.

635
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,680
Meet me at the rooftop pool tonight.

636
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,200
Then we’ll talk about this.

637
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,200
This is a bug. It’s how we’re
going to get secrets from him.

638
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,680
Ready?

639
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,920
Teh Tarik.

640
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,880
(That was almost a splash.)

641
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,200
(Better stash it first.)

642
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,040
(Where’s Khun Mae?)

643
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,120
(Wait for Yam, too.)

644
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,120
I’m signing up for a marathon after this.

645
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,600
(New career: runner.)

646
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,000
- Let’s sign up.
- The two girls are heading home.

647
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
(Heading home~)

648
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,560
Why?

649
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,960
You scared?

650
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,320
I’m not scared.
(Someone like Mae never gets scared.)

651
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,800
It’s just inappropriate.

652
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,600
(Such a ship!)
