1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,200
From now on, we’ll have no other status
except being rivals.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,840
Hey.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,440
Everyone must have seen the rumors
about Khun Aiwarin of Orienna

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,080
and Khun Maevika of Superior.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,440
You can’t just accuse people
without evidence.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,160
But in some cases, even suspicion alone
can’t be ignored, right?

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,760
And if there’s clear evidence,
we definitely can’t.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
No filming, please.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
I won’t let you two off the hook.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,600
Cutting out another rival

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,320
means our chance
of winning the bid goes up, sir.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,840
- Perfect timing, I was just talking about,
- Everyone.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,120
Ai has something to announce.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,200
After the bidding ends,

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,200
I’ll be resigning from here.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,280
And moving to Boston.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,600
I’ll have our staff

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,240
who’ve been working
with Bradley return to Thailand.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,600
I’ll take over the project myself.

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
Everyone, please leave the room.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
I need to talk to my daughter.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,120
I won’t let you go anywhere.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
You must stay here

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,600
to run The Greater Duty Free.

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
Don’t be so sure, Dad.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,240
That Orienna would win the auction.

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,720
Even if our rivals are fewer.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,280
Or we think we’ve got the edge
over Superior.

29
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,440
It doesn’t mean we’ll always win.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,479
Don’t forget.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,680
In every competition.

32
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:53,400
There’s always a surprise waiting.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Ai thinks Dad should brace for it.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
I said no.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,280
No means no.

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,680
Even if Orienna doesn’t win the auction.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,080
I won’t allow you to go anywhere.

38
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,800
But Ai will go.

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,960
And if Dad won’t let me.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,079
Then just take my life instead.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
Because it’s the only thing
I have left.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,079
Other than that.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,200
I’ve got nothing left for you, Dad.

44
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
Hey you!

45
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,200
What kind of driving is that?
Were you even watching the road?

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,200
Sorry, Khun. I was picking things up,
I didn’t pay attention.

47
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,600
Does your car even have insurance?

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Hold on a sec.

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,000
- My insurance just expired.
- Huh?

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,640
Then I’ll just cover my car myself.

51
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,840
- And you handle your own car.
- How could you say that?

52
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
Give me your number first.

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,360
You.

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Here.

55
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
What’s this?

56
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Hey.

57
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

58
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

59
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,560
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

60
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
(Calling. What’s wrong?)

61
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,960
Nothing. I woke up,
you were gone, so I called.

62
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,800
But I get it, you probably
don’t want to talk.

63
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
(Nothing. I woke up, you were gone, so I called.
But I get it, you probably don’t want to talk.)

64
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,200
(Why would you think that?)

65
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Because we broke up.

66
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
(Because we broke up.)

67
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,840
(Do you want to meet tonight?
We could clear things up.)

68
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Where?

69
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,760
(Where?)

70
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Delete the chat.

71
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,320
Block the account.

72
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,840
So they can’t reach you.

73
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

74
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Here.

75
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,680
A new phone to replace the one you lost.

76
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,800
Thanks, P'G.

77
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,640
As for the data Khun Mae back up on cloud.

78
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,200
I already pulled it all back.

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Anything you didn’t back up.

80
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,440
It’s gone with the phone.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,280
Did something happen?

82
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Well

83
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,520
The chat with Aiwarin’s account is gone.

84
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
Mae, you’re sure you
didn’t delete it yourself?

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,480
I’m sure, P'G.

86
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
Even though Mae broke up with her.

87
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,000
It doesn’t mean
I’d cut her out of my life.

88
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,800
Or maybe that thief.

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
P'G.

90
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,200
Mae’s worried.

91
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,840
Something bad must’ve happened.

92
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Hello.

93
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,320
(Yam)
Hey, where’s Khun Aiwarin?

94
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,640
Why?

95
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,720
Just tell me first.

96
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
She should be on her way.

97
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,440
Heard she’s meeting
your boss to clear things up.

98
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,600
- Your boss asked to see Ai.
- No, P'G!

99
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,000
So they set it up for tonight.

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,680
At the seaside resort.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
Yam, can I have Khun Ai’s number?

102
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Sure.

103
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,080
But Khun Mae doesn’t have Khun Ai’s number?

104
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,280
Don’t ask more, just send it first.

105
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Alright.

106
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Got it.

107
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,320
Sorry.

108
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,520
- Sorry, the number you dialed cannot be
- Not connecting, P’G.

109
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,280
Maybe she’s on a plane.

110
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,640
Khun Mae, wait.

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
Mae has to rush to him, P’G.

112
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,480
Please handle the flight ticket for Mae.

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Rachen.

114
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,480
Where’s Maevika?

115
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
No need to waste time asking.

116
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,880
She’s not here.

117
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,120
The one you’ve been chatting with

118
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
it was me.

119
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
I still remember.

120
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,880
The day you told me
so confidently you were smart.

121
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,400
I’d say today you’re dead wrong.

122
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,320
Because standing here now

123
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,720
just proves you’re stupid.

124
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,920
And the fact you could expose me

125
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,640
both in Boston and The Greater

126
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
I just slipped, that’s all.

127
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,680
Today I’ll show you.

128
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,200
Someone like me won’t slip for someone like you again.

129
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,320
- Where are you going?
- Let go, let me go!

130
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,160
What are you gonna do?

131
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,440
I’ll make you live in nightmares forever.

132
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Pathetic.

133
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
That’s all you’ve got?

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,280
Why not just kill me then?

135
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,000
- Don’t you dare me.
- I’m not daring.

136
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,000
Because if I don’t die

137
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
I’ll come back for you again.

138
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,920
And then you’ll come back for me.

139
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Yeah, to you

140
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
I might look dumb.

141
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,520
But to me

142
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
you’re downright stupid.

143
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Open your mouth.

144
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
- I said open!
- No!

145
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,920
- Eat it, swallow it.
- No.

146
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Eat.

147
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,520
What did you put in the wine?

148
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,040
Something that’ll make you

149
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,360
submit to me.

150
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,560
A woman who loves women, like you

151
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,800
If a clip leaks of you with a guy

152
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,080
- Where you going?
- Let go.

153
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
- Where? Get back here.
- Let me go!

154
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,920
Think you’re so tough?

155
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Think you’re so tough?

156
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,560
Your life had to run into me.

157
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Khun Ai!

158
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,640
Rachen!

159
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
Let Aiwarin go right now!

160
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Hurry!

161
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,400
Or I’ll shoot you.

162
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
Khun Mae.

163
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Khun Ai.

164
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Don’t.

165
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Khun Mae.

166
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
Think you’re both so strong?

167
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,520
Then die together.

168
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,120
Stop! Drop your weapon.

169
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,320
I said drop it!

170
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Don’t!

171
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,200
Let’s go to the hospital.

172
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,800
- No.
- Please, go.

173
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
No.

174
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
You need to stay conscious.

175
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,800
But I can’t hold on.

176
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,600
You’re like this

177
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
because he drugged you.

178
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Khun Ai.

179
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,520
Stay with me.

180
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Khun Ai.

181
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,440
Khun Ai, focus.

182
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,079
Please help me.

183
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Khun Ai.

184
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
How are you feeling?

185
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,200
It’s okay now.

186
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Khun Mae is right here.

187
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,400
And you, Khun Mae?

188
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,600
Does it hurt?

189
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,280
Yeah, it hurts.

190
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,480
But not as bad as you, Khun Ai.

191
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,400
Rachen dared go this far?

192
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,600
Yes, Dad.

193
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
But

194
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,760
you don’t need to worry anymore.

195
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,000
Mae and Aiwarin are safe now.

196
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,680
Then hurry and come back.

197
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,440
I’ll send word to Khun Attawit.

198
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,120
I believe once he knows

199
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,320
he’ll worry about his daughter too.

200
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Yes, Dad.

201
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,880
I’m such a mess.

202
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,000
All this time I thought

203
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,080
I could handle someone like him.

204
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
But in the end

205
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,560
I almost fell for it.

206
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,480
Don’t beat yourself up.

207
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,920
The reason you slipped

208
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,320
was because you thought you’d see me.

209
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,360
Stop blaming yourself, okay?

210
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,240
Everything will pass soon.

211
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,120
Tomorrow morning we’ll head back to Bangkok.

212
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,280
I’ll take you home myself.

213
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,360
Why home?

214
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,960
You should have someone with you.

215
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,760
In case there are side effects from the drug.

216
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
Just drop me at Orienna.

217
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,920
I can take care of myself.

218
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,200
You don’t want to see anyone yet, do you?

219
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,920
Then stay with me for now.

220
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Once you feel better

221
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,720
we can go our own ways.

222
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,040
(How are you? I know everything now.)

223
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Get some rest.

224
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,200
Can we stay together a bit?

225
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,000
(I’ll go prep food. When you wake, wash up and change.)
(Mae)

226
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,200
Your skin is so beautiful.

227
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,320
Glowing, radiant, so fresh.

228
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,160
Yours is beautiful too.

229
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,280
Not just beautiful

230
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
it smells good too.

231
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,280
Khun Ai.

232
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,280
Eat plenty, okay?

233
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,960
Orange juice for a beauty like Khun Ai.

234
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
How are you, dear?

235
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,480
Must’ve been such a shock.

236
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
(Hello.)

237
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,280
No need to worry anymore.

238
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,680
I’ve already had it taken care of.

239
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,560
Thank you so much.

240
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Mae.

241
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,400
- Yes?
- Come here.

242
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,160
We haven’t settled this yet.

243
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,400
I’m sorry, Dad.

244
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,200
You know it’s just the two of us, right?

245
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
You know that?

246
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Yes, I know.

247
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,960
Ai went inside the house.

248
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
She said

249
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,200
you were at the company early this morning.

250
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,680
How are things?

251
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

252
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,720
Do you really care about me, Dad?

253
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,640
Or are you just acting?

254
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,640
What are you saying?

255
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,200
You’re my daughter.

256
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
I’m asking

257
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,200
because you’ve never done this before.

258
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,480
Ever since I was little,growing up

259
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,800
no matter what I went through

260
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,800
you always said

261
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I had to get back up on my own.

262
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,960
Not once

263
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
did you ever hug or comfort me.

264
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,600
I’m sorry.

265
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,920
Being a father

266
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
raising a daughter alone

267
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,120
it’s never been easy, Aiwarin.

268
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,200
Everything I did

269
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
it was because I believed

270
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,520
it was the best for you.

271
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,640
It may not have been the way you wanted.

272
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,880
But trust me

273
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,200
I never wished you harm.

274
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,600
I have something to ask you, Dad.

275
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,360
Where’s my mother?

276
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,680
Please tell me, Dad.

277
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,200
Maybe your answer

278
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,280
could unlock something for me.

279
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Your mother

280
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,280
she had someone else.

281
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
But in the end

282
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,960
she chose not to be with us.

283
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,480
It was her choice.

284
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,520
Not mine.

285
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
But all of that

286
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,840
it was my fault.

287
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,080
I gave too much of myself to work.

288
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,000
And forgot about the ones behind me.

289
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,920
Then why didn’t you tell me?

290
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,160
I didn’t want you to hate your mother.

291
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Like I said

292
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,400
it was my fault.

293
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
I drove her to that decision.

294
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,320
So you carried all this pain alone?

295
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
See?

296
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,400
I told you being me isn’t easy.

297
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
I’m sorry, Dad.

298
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,120
If I had known

299
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,600
I would’ve understood you more.

300
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,680
And I’m sorry to you too.

301
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,720
I may not have been a good father.

302
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
I kept thinking the only way

303
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,520
to keep you from hurting like I did

304
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
was for you to be strong.

305
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,800
Give me a chance.

306
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,880
I want to change.

307
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,160
It may not happen right away.

308
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,160
But I’ll try.

309
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
Dad

310
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,560
I have something important to tell you.

(Auction Result Announcement Day)

316
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,680
First, I’d like to thank everyone

317
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
for honoring us with your presence

318
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,960
as witnesses of

319
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,280
the auction result

320
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,600
for The Greater Duty Free today.

321
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,960
The committee has carefully reviewed

322
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,239
the operational plans,

323
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,000
project models, and final proposals

324
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,520
from all participants.

325
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,880
And the winner of The Greater Duty Free project

326
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920

Orienna Group Company Limited.

328
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,800
At the final meeting

329
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,920
I intended to leak our numbers

330
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,280
to Maevika.

331
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,600
On behalf of The Greater’s committee

332
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,480
may I ask one question?

333
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,760
Since I already placed ten percent

334
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,280
- what benefits will we receive?
- Excuse me a moment.

335
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,280
I understand.

336
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,920
You probably think

337
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,720
the number we’re submitting

338
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
is too high, right?

339
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,680
But this figure

340
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
isn’t just about beating Superior

341
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,320
or any other competitors.

342
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,120
It’s a declaration that

343
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,560
Orienna

344
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,280
is ready to run this concession.

345
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,840
Therefore

346
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,320
thirty billion

347
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,400
is the most suitable figure.

348
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,280
If they knew

349
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,760
they would’ve raised their number.

350
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Just like when we learned theirs.

351
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,200
Therefore

352
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,880
we probably wouldn’t have won anyway.

353
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
I’m sorry.

354
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,080
But I don’t want to win by dirty means.

355
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,880
I’ve made my decision, Dad.

356
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,000
I’ll stick with the original number.

357
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Khun Mae, may I have an interview?

358
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,480
No interviews. No.

359
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,480
- Khun Mae,
- Let me handle this.

360
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
That’s enough.

361
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,520
- Khun Ai,
- What made your company grow so big?

362
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,200
What’s going on?

363
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,320
Khun Mae!

364
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,120
Why didn’t you change the figure

365
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,200
so you could win?

366
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,960
I purposely

367
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,040
let you know Orienna’s number.

368
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
What?

369
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,200
You mean

370
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,040
the phone call that day

371
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,960
you did it on purpose?

372
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,400
What kind of person are you really?

373
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
Playing dirty with me

374
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,800
right up to the last second?

375
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,760
I never thought of it as playing dirty.

376
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,600
I did it because

377
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,360
I just felt guilty.

378
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,000
For stealing secrets from you.

379
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,200
I just wanted to make it right.

380
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,120
Wouldn’t it have been easier

381
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,720
if you never started it at all?

382
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,080
And know this

383
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Aiwarin.

384
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
I

385
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,000
never gained anything from that bug.

386
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,680
The only reason I kept it

387
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,560
was because I just wanted
to hear your voice.

388
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,640
To feel like

389
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
you were close to me all the time.

390
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,000
That’s all.

391
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,120
Khun Ai, any words to share

392
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,400
on Orienna winning this bid?

393
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,720
As the leader of Orienna

394
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,200
I don’t see this win

395
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,120
as just our company’s victory.

396
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,320
It’s also an opportunity

397
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
to create jobs.

398
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
To build collaborations.

399
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,480
To foster cooperation

400
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,080
among the new generation.

401
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,040
with vision,

402
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,760
and ideas different
from the older generation.

403
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,480
Who do you mean, Khun Ai?

404
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,080
Myself and Khun Maevika,

405
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,800
the leader of Superior.

406
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,760
I hereby declare

407
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,000
that as Orienna,

408
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,400
the winner of this auction,

409
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,600
we invite Superior

410
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,520
to be our strategic partner,
(A strategic partner is someone you team up)

411
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,400
developing this concession together.
(with to create shared benefits, instead of competing against each other.)

412
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,000
But Khun Ai and Khun Mae

413
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,960
there were rumors of a secret deal.

414
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
Won’t this raise questions
about your relationship again?

415
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,920
- That’s right.
- You’re not worried?

416
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,960
- Not afraid?
- No.

417
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Will this be okay, Khun Ai?

418
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,200
I’m not afraid.

419
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
Because no matter the questions

420
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,800
the answer remains the same.

421
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,280
It isn’t true.

422
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,600
What matters between Mae and me

423
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,040
comes from sincerity.

424
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,480
There are no hidden benefits.

425
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,280
(P’G)

426
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,080
Yes, P’G.

427
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Khun Mae.

428
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,800
It’s me, Yam.

429
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,720
The reason Khun Ai had to steal from you

430
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,720
was because her father ordered it.

431
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,720
Khun Ai never wanted to betray you.

432
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,200
She had to.

433
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,520
Out of necessity.

434
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,720
If she hadn’t

435
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,520
many others would’ve suffered.

436
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,640
Khun Ai had no choice
and it hurt her deeply.

437
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Because she knew

438
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,880
what she did

439
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,440
was hurting the one she loved.

440
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,880
If you love Khun Ai too

441
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,600
please talk to her with your heart.

442
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,800
Not with anger.

443
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,000
That way no one else will suffer from this.

444
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,800
I hope I’ve helped them a little.

445
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
I don’t know.

446
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Maybe this is all I can do.

447
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
The rest is up to them.

448
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,600
Why?

449
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,120
Why didn’t you ever tell me before

450
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,040
that you were forced
into so many things?

451
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,480
I didn’t see what good it would do.

452
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,680
Because whether I was forced

453
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,080
or I chose to

454
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,120
I still did it.

455
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
So

456
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,000
what’s past, let it be past.

457
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
Just let it go.

458
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,400
Back when we were kids

459
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,400
you might not even remember.

460
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,720
We once competed pitching ideas
for a school event.

461
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,760
And you beat me.

462
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I was

463
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,880
so bitter about it.

464
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,160
And ever since then

465
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,720
I kept thinking that if I saw you again

466
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,000
I’d get my payback.

467
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,800
And when I found out

468
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,840
I’d be competing against
you in the auction

469
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,280
I told myself right then,

470
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
this was it.

471
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,920
This was my chance

472
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,480
to finally get back at you.

473
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,680
I was going to beat you.

474
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,600
And I’d never lose to you again.

475
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,280
But you know what?

476
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,800
But when I finally met you

477
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,480
I lost to you from day one.

478
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,880
I love you, Aiwarin.

479
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,000
I fell in love

480
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,200
with the one I was supposed to fight.

481
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,200
Why wouldn’t I remember you?

482
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,200
I’ve been waiting for
the day to see you again too.

483
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,720
All in favor of Aiwarin’s idea,
raise your hand.

484
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,440
So, we’ll go with Aiwarin’s idea.

485
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,200
Watch me.

486
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,160
If I get the chance,
I’ll get back at you.

487
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,880
Hurry and do it.

488
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
I’ll be waiting.

489
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,120
To you

490
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,360
I may have been an enemy.

491
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,520
But to me

492
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,360
you’re the only one in my heart.

493
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,200
And maybe that’s why

494
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,200
I never dated anyone else.

495
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,800
If it wasn’t you.

496
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,120
From now on

497
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
we don’t have to compete anymore.

498
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,320
We’ll work together.

499
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,960
I already announced to everyone

500
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,000
that I’ll invite Superior.

501
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,120
to be our strategic partner.

502
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,920
Thank you.

503
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,120
But

504
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,080
I don’t want success

505
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,520
that comes under someone else’s shadow.

506
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,000
I’d rather achieve it on my own.

507
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,720
Don’t forget, though.

508
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,080
Even if this auction is over

509
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,600
Orienna and Superior

510
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,200
will still be rivals.

511
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,040
So sooner or later

512
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,600
we may face off like this again.

513
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:20,960
Hey, you.

514
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,440
Sounds like

515
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,040
you’re breaking up with me again.

516
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,560
I’m sorry.

517
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,000
It’s okay.

518
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,480
You can break up with me

519
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,840
but I can’t break up with you.

520
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
I’ll keep loving you the same.

521
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,360
And no matter what happens

522
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,960
I’ll keep waiting for you.

523
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,080
Waiting for you to come back.

524
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,680
Yes, Khun Ai.

525
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,880
You.

526
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,280
Don’t overthink it.

527
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,920
Their decision

528
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,920
it won’t affect us.

529
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,040
It does.

530
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
Even if Khun Ai says
she understands Mae

531
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,000
she must be hurting.

532
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,800
And Mae must be hurting even more.

533
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,960
If both of them are suffering

534
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,160
how can we allow ourselves happiness?

535
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,440
More importantly

536
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,440
from now on

537
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,000
they’ll each return to their duties.

538
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,000
No one knows

539
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,600
if they’ll face each other again.

540
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,800
What we must do

541
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
is support them fully.

542
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,160
Think of it as

543
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,840
the little time we have together.

544
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,640
Which honestly

545
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,000
isn’t much at all.

546
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,640
So little that sometimes I wonder

547
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,040
if we even know each other well enough.

548
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,400
So

549
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,320
don’t be sad.

550
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,160
You don’t need to tell me that.

551
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,200
how I should feel.

552
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,840
If you want to go

553
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,080
then go.

554
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,800
I’ll respect your decision.

555
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,880
(Months later)

556
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,920
Don’t stress.

557
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,600
Just one more step
and you’ll succeed, Khun Mae.

558
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,400
Keep that sweet smile on.

559
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,640
Khun Mae, you’ve got a package.

560
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,080
Today is your big day.

561
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,760
Use this pen.

562
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,720
I want you to know there’s still me

563
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,240
waiting to celebrate your success.

564
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,920
How did you get in?

565
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,000
Did you forget?

566
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,080
I’ve got a Rose Gold card.

567
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,200
Why are you here?

568
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,320
I don’t know.

569
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,600
When I saw this pen

570
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,920
my heart told me

571
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,560
I had to come see you.

572
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,240
I’m sorry.

573
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,920
For making you wait
all alone for so long.

574
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,120
Thank you.

575
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,600
For not letting it go on any longer.

576
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,000
Thinking of someone?

577
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,800
Sitting here waiting?

578
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
Yeah, I am.

579
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,800
But not you.

580
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,480
Then who?

581
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,000
Just someone

582
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,920
who said I don’t know them well enough.

583
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,600
Maybe they’re right.

584
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,720
Maybe I don’t know them well enough.

585
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,160
But I’ve seen sides
of them no one else has.

586
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,600
And those sides made me fall for them.

587
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,920
Is it this one?

588
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,000
Or this one?

589
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,280
Still not?

590
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,600
Then

591
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,400
it must be this one.

592
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,880
Everyone!

593
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,920
Come on, let’s have some fun!

594
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,560
Come dance, come dance!

595
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,000
Hurry up!

596
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,600
I’m embarrassed. Let’s go back.

597
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,280
Let’s get back together.

598
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,320
Our bosses got back together too.

599
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,400
I think this time they won’t part again.

600
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,400
You think doing this

601
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,120
You think I’ll give in that easily?

602
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,520
Still not giving in?

603
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,720
Then

604
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,600
That’s enough. Let’s go back.

605
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,200
You.

606
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,680
Will you come back nicely?

607
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,000
I will.

608
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,800
Back to the table.

609
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,640
No.

610
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,440
The first time we met

611
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,520
Khun Mae said

612
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,960
she’d get back at Khun Ai.

613
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,280
Who would’ve believed

614
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,880
the rivals from that day

615
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,040
would become lovers today?

616
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,080
But before we got here

617
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,000
we had to go through so much together.

618
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Or maybe

619
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,600
when Khun Ai once said

620
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,200
fate always plays tricks on us,

621
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,080
maybe it was true.

622
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,280
Fate’s part of it.

623
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,280
But what brought us here

624
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,080
isn’t just fate.

625
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,880
It’s the hearts of the two of us.

626
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,640
That

627
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,960
no matter how much time passes,

628
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,720
or what trials we face,

629
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,880
in the end

630
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,880
we’ll still choose to find our way back.

631
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,680
I love you.

632
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,520
I love you too.

633
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,560
(What happened to Khun Ai?)

634
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,840
Fight, girl! (Go girl!)

635
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,640
- She’s sweating.
- She didn’t take sugar, that’s why.

636
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,240
LookMhee doesn’t take sugar.

637
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,000
Get everyone hyped up.

638
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,760
(Mommy’s the dance queen)

639
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,720
- Cut!
- Cut!

640
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,880
(Knees gave out right there)

641
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,240
(Such sweet eyes, melting away)
Bear-eyes, more happiness.

642
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,280
Hug, good job.

643
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,720
(Super warm and cozy)
