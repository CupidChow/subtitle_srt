1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
This relationship is nothing but risk.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,360
And if anyone finds out,
it’s even more dangerous.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,680
Do you have anything
to tell me about your boss?

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,520
If we could just stop time here,
that’d be perfect.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
What happened between us

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,840
was just a fleeting moment.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,600
If you really want to forget,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,120
it’ll fade on its own.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,240
What’s going on between
you and Superior’s heir?

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,440
Dad, you can see it clearly yourself.

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,360
She’s your rival.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,240
Why would you get yourself
involved with her?

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Answer me properly,
or I’ll come down hard on you.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,080
But Dad, have you ever thought

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,880
that the reason Ai is with her

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
might be because Ai
is doing exactly what you want?

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,320
What do you mean?

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,440
Didn’t you say it yourself, Dad?

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,880
That you wanted to know
the competitor’s bidding numbers.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,879
Good.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,000
If that’s really the reason you’re with her,

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,920
then I hope your plan

23
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,400
will make Orienna win the bid.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,440
I’ll be watching.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Yes, Dad.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
But I have one condition, Dad.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,000
What condition?

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,600
If I can make Orienna win the bid,

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
whatever happens between me
and Maevika after that,

30
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
you must stay out of it.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,200
Fine.

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,800
But you have to win the bid. That’s all.

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,240
Because if you succeed,

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,400
whatever you choose
to do is your business.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
I won’t interfere.

36
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,800
I know, Yam.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,400
When it comes to
Khun Ai’s personal life, I can’t help.

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,600
But if there’s anything I can do,

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,440
please tell me, Khun Ai.

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,960
Mm.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,240
I’ll do anything for you, Khun Ai.

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,640
I know. No need to get all dramatic.

43
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,560
What are you looking at on your phone?

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,440
Just… houses and condos.

45
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,880
Why?

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
Looking for a new place?

47
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,159
Yes.

48
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,080
Why? Is the place you
live now not good enough?

49
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,840
Ever since you started working at Orienna…

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,560
Have you gone back to see your family yet?

51
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Not answering means you haven’t.

52
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,920
I’d say by now they must miss you a lot.

53
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
They probably wonder how you’re living,

54
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,440
how happy you really are.

55
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,960
Or should I send
them news about you myself?

56
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
Well… sure.

57
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,960
I’m just tired of the same old atmosphere.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,560
Khun Ai,

59
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,320
the owner of this house,

60
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,440
she has the same name as your mother.

61
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,960
(For inquiries, contact Arunwalai)

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,160
Mama.

63
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,800
But these days, a lot of
people share the same name.

64
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,040
This exact name, spelled this way,
(For inquiries, contact Arunwalai)

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
it’s definitely one of a kind.

66
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,920
Hello?

67
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,960
Hello?

68
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
So, um,

69
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,880
I saw your post about selling the house,

70
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,120
and I was interested, so I reached out.

71
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Uh, yes.

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
If I’d like to set
a date to view it in person,

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
would that be possible?

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,520
When will you be coming?

75
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
Hello, Khun Ai.

76
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,160
Are you and Mae free in the next two days?

77
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
Why?

78
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Planning to drag us
somewhere thrilling again?

79
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,560
If I tell you, it won’t be exciting.

80
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,720
Let’s go then.

81
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
Dad.

82
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,200
Didn’t the doctor tell you not to stress?

83
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,760
So why are you still working like this?

84
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,400
Mae.

85
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,560
I’m the owner of this company, my dear.

86
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,760
No matter how sick I am,

87
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
I can’t just sit still.

88
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,680
One day, when you step into my place,

89
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,560
you’ll have to do the same, my child.

90
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,600
So, what is it?

91
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,320
Why come see me now?

92
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
Um…

93
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,760
Well,

94
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
I wanted to ask you, Dad,

95
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,880
if I could take a short trip for two days.

96
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,400
Hm.

97
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,600
But don’t worry.

98
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,320
I’ve finished all my work already.

99
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,240
Everything’s ready.

100
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
These past weeks,

101
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,400
I’ve been so stressed about the bidding.

102
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,559
I just want a break.

103
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
But I’ll bring my tablet with me,

104
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,520
in case urgent work comes in,
I’ll handle it right away.

105
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
Alright, as you wish.

106
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,760
Actually…

107
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,880
there’s something else, Dad.

108
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,680
Go on, Mae.

109
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,640
Speak, my dear.

110
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,840
We don’t hide things from each other, do we?

111
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
What is it?

112
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,800
What would you think, Dad, if…

113
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
I was dating a woman?

114
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
Listen.

115
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,040
Even though I’m getting old,

116
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
I still understand love these days.

117
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,680
No matter what gender they are,

118
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,360
as long as they’re a good person,

119
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,040
don’t take advantage of you,

120
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,120
and don’t hurt you,

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,920
that’s all that matters to me.

122
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,240
Thank you, Dad.

123
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,120
I love you.

124
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
I love you too.

125
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
Khun Ai, what are you doing here?

126
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
I brought her to meet someone important.

127
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,040
And…

128
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,800
bringing Mae along,
aren’t you afraid she’ll find out about us?

129
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,040
That’s exactly why I brought her.

130
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
Because I want her to know.

131
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
I’m in front of the house now.

132
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,160
I’m sorry, truly.

133
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,000
I had to fly abroad urgently.

134
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,400
So I couldn’t meet you.

135
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,880
But you can get the key from the caretaker

136
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,240
and look around the house yourself.

137
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,600
Um, then…

138
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,280
when will you be back?

139
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,200
Well…

140
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
no date yet.

141
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,120
But don’t worry.

142
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,960
If you’re truly
interested in buying this house,

143
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,680
I’ll sign over power of attorney
to let someone handle it for me.

144
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,280
Mm. In that case…

145
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,400
uh…

146
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,760
Mama…

147
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
it’s me, Ai.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,400
Aiwarin, your daughter.

149
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,920
I’ve never had a child.

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,160
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

151
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,120
So let’s leave the house matter at that.

152
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,760
Let’s get some exercise.

153
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,160
Let’s see if Khun Ai can catch Khun Mae.

154
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
Come on.

155
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,760
Please?

156
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,320
Think of it as burning off what you ate,
so you won’t gain weight.

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Khun Mae, you have no idea

158
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,520
what Khun Ai has been through

159
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,480
and the problems she’s had to face.

160
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,240
But,

161
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,240
if those problems

162
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,800
can’t be solved right away,

163
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,840
we just have to let them go

164
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,040
and keep moving forward.

165
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,280
That house,

166
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,400
Khun Ai thought

167
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,400
it was her mother’s.

168
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,200
She saw it listed for sale online,

169
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,560
so she rushed over,

170
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,720
thinking she’d get to see her mom.

171
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
And the reason she brought Khun Mae

172
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,560
was because I wanted you to meet her too.

173
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
Khun Ai wanted,

174
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,440
the two people she loves most
in this world to meet each other.

175
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,839
That wasn’t her.

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
Just someone with the same name.

177
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,120
When Khun Ai once told Khun Mae

178
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,320
that she had no mother,

179
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,720
the truth was her mother is still alive.

180
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
But you haven’t been in contact?

181
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
No.

182
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,960
It’s been twenty years.

183
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,360
I don’t even know

184
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,080
why she left home back then.

185
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,760
What reason she had,

186
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,280
she just left all of a sudden.

187
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
Without saying a word.

188
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Not even…

189
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,440
a goodbye.

190
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
And…

191
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,640
what about your father?

192
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,360
He never told you anything?

193
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,800
No.

194
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,160
All he ever said

195
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,160
was to forget her.

196
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
After that,

197
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,840
I tried to do everything
my father told me to.

198
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
And I secretly hoped that,

199
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
since I had no mother,

200
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,760
I thought Dad would step up,

201
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
to make up for what I’d lost.

202
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,840
But no.

203
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,080
It only got more stressful.

204
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
And he pressured me to do everything

205
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
the way he wanted.

206
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,480
Because he thought

207
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
I was the only one left,

208
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,840
the only person in his life.

209
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,840
And so now,

210
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,320
I’ve become the person you see, Khun Mae.

211
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
Always trying to look strong.

212
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,920
Even when inside,

213
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
I’m painfully fragile.

214
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,760
But now you’re here with me, Khun Mae.

215
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,440
Thank you.

216
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,800
I just want to comfort you,
to ease your sadness.

217
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,760
Just stay still, Khun Ai.

218
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,240
I’ll be the one to make you happy.

219
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,600
Hello, Khun Adisorn.

220
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,080
Alright, when?

221
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay.

222
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,680
Was that urgent work?

223
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

224
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,760
(Unanimous resolution:
submit a bid of 26 billion baht)

225
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,080
(26 billion baht)

226
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,040
Beautiful, isn’t it?

227
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
It is.

228
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,200
But you’re more beautiful.

229
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,920
Such sweet talk,

230
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
does that mean you’re not sad anymore?

231
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
I feel so much better now.

232
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,040
Because of you, Khun Mae.

233
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,120
Khun Ai, have you ever thought

234
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,320
that if one day,

235
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,520
we weren’t rivals at all,

236
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,040
but just two ordinary women

237
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,640
who happened to meet,

238
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
like each other,

239
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
and start dating, what would that be like?

240
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,520
It would be wonderful.

241
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,600
If we didn’t have to
hide whenever we’re together.

242
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,120
And…

243
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,000
if we didn’t have to worry
that behind our backs

244
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,600
the other might be plotting something.

245
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,000
So you’ve been suspicious of me, Khun Mae?

246
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,960
A little, yes.

247
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,160
Because we are rivals, after all.

248
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
But…

249
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,800
after spending time with you, Khun Ai,

250
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,720
We’ve been through both hard times

251
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,560
and happiness together.

252
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
So I’m certain,

253
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,760
you’d never hurt me, Khun Ai.

254
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,320
And so,

255
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,520
no matter what happens from now on,

256
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,880
I’d never hurt you either.

257
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,440
Never, for sure.

258
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,760
(P’G)

259
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,600
- Yes?
- Khun Mae.

260
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
Something’s happened.

261
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,360
(Billionaire businesswomen
caught in a secret deal)

262
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,320
(Is it personal, or collusion in bidding?)

263
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
Contact the news page that posted it.

264
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,880
Do whatever it takes to delete it all.

265
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,600
Pay them whatever they ask.

266
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,640
And for those who shared it,

267
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,880
damaging Superior’s name,

268
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,760
send someone to threaten them.

269
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,880
If they don’t delete it,

270
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,720
we’ll sue them all.

271
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,440
(Billionaire businesswomen
caught in a secret deal)

272
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,200
Who do you think did this, Khun Ai?

273
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
I’m not sure either.

274
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,600
It could be anyone.

275
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,800
Someone who benefits from this.

276
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,040
Or else…

277
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,600
we must’ve gotten in their way.

278
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,400
But if I had to guess,

279
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,320
there’s only one reason.

280
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,040
The bidding.

281
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,720
Thank you

282
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,480
for preparing so thoroughly.

283
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,000
But I’m sorry,

284
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,120
I’d rather not join forces with you.

285
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,240
No matter how much I want to win this bid,

286
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,680
I never planned on using dirty tricks

287
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,520
or anything dishonest.

288
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,680
I’ll just work harder on my own

289
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,040
and win another way.

290
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,440
As you wish.

291
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,920
But let me warn you,

292
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,160
I’m not someone who wastes time on people

293
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
without getting something in return.

294
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,160
You’ll have to answer for

295
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,040
turning your back on me.

296
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
Let me tell you something.

297
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,800
If I were really afraid of your threats,

298
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,040
I wouldn’t have come here
in the first place.

299
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,840
Your refusal of me,

300
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,240
Because you’ve got
a secret deal with Orienna, right?

301
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,960
Do you really think Aiwarin
is sincere with you?

302
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,920
It’s obvious,

303
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,560
she’s just exploiting
your inexperience, that’s all.

304
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,520
Aiwarin would never back down.

305
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Worried Mae’s gone missing?

306
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,520
She just went to
get something from the car.

307
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,280
She’ll be right back.

308
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,200
Rachen?

309
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,719
- Hello.
- I’ve got a reservation.

310
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,840
- Under Rachen.
- This way, please.

311
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,040
Right this way, sir.

312
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,840
Bring the menu.

313
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,560
Mr. Direk’s guest has arrived.

314
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
Hello.

315
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,960
- Yes?
- Do you have a reservation?

316
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,400
My friend booked it already.

317
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,640
I’ll find the table myself, thank you.

318
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,800
Of course, ma’am.

319
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,680
Sorry for making you come out so far.

320
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,560
I thought meeting in Bangkok right now

321
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
might not be convenient.

322
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,760
Not far at all, it’s fine.

323
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,000
So, what is it you want to discuss with me?

324
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,520
I wanted to give you
an update on Superior’s deal.

325
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,000
Khun Ai.

326
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,720
What are you doing here, Khun Mae?

327
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,240
I saw you rushing out in your car,

328
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,880
so I followed.

329
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,800
What exactly are you planning to do?

330
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,440
The people in that room,

331
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,200
it’s Rachen and Khun Direk.

332
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,600
What?

333
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
I saw Rachen at the hotel,

334
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,760
so I drove after him.

335
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,920
I was sure something was up.

336
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,640
Turns out he was meeting with Khun Direk.

337
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,880
And they’re discussing the bidding.

338
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,720
What should we do?

339
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,560
How can we find out what they’re saying?

340
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,400
I know it’s risky,

341
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,880
but we really need to know, Khun Ai.

342
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Um, excuse me.

343
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,680
I need your help with something.

344
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,120
(Khun Maevika)

345
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,040
(Khun Aiwarin)

346
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,080
I’ll make sure you’re well compensated.

347
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,160
And if anything goes wrong,

348
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
I’ll take full responsibility.

349
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,080
I’ll even help you find a better job.

350
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,240
Please, help me.

351
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
I’ll be honest.

352
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,040
I don’t think this has
anything to do with Aiwarin.

353
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,680
The reason Maevika came to you

354
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,760
might be because she knew
you’d never keep your word.

355
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,120
In the end, once she gave you the numbers,

356
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,040
you’d just offer higher
to win the bid anyway.

357
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,560
You’d never step aside and let her win.

358
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Maevika isn’t that naïve.

359
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,200
But whatever.

360
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,560
I’ve already prepared my backup plan.

361
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,160
What plan?

362
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,200
I’ve got you to back me up.

363
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,280
Back you up how?

364
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,000
I’ve already mapped out
everything for you.

365
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,360
If I do more,
I’ll be risking too much myself.

366
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,160
Though I’ve already rewarded you generously.

367
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,920
Both what I’ve paid so far,

368
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,680
and what I’ll pay again
after the bidding’s over.

369
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
Don’t forget, Rachen,

370
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,920
even if I’m the chairman of this project,

371
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,680
it’s not that easy

372
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,400
for me to interfere
with everything as I please.

373
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,000
But there might still be a way.

374
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,800
What way?

375
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,240
Get out.

376
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,520
Out.

377
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,080
Yes.

378
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,920
So you went to meet Rachen,

379
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
even after I warned you.

380
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,600
I just wanted to know what his offer was.

381
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,800
Do you really want to win
that badly, Khun Mae?

382
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,200
So badly you’d risk dealing
with someone like him?

383
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,800
And if something happens,

384
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,000
how would you protect yourself?

385
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,720
Yes.

386
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,040
I want to win.

387
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,360
Because it’s the only way

388
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,760
to make everyone at Superior

389
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,640
finally accept me.

390
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,080
Do you know, Khun Ai,

391
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
even now,

392
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,160
there are still so many people

393
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,880
who don’t believe

394
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,120
that I could ever rise to lead Superior.

395
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,920
And even more so,

396
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,480
now that they know my father’s sick.

397
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,280
It makes me want to win even more.

398
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,360
Your father…

399
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,040
he’s sick?

400
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,400
Yes.

401
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,560
That’s why

402
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,280
this bidding isn’t just about me.

403
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,360
It’s about doing it for my father too.

404
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,240
I want you to know, Khun Ai,

405
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,640
that the two of us

406
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,560
are both carrying the weight

407
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,120
and pressure of everyone’s expectations.

408
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,360
Then tell me,

409
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,320
why didn’t you accept Rachen’s offer

410
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,280
and do what he asked?

411
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Because his offer

412
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,480
was to dig secrets out of you, Khun Ai.

413
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,760
Exactly.

414
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,480
If the stakes are that high for you,

415
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,920
you could’ve just accepted.

416
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,840
But the reason you didn’t,

417
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,640
is because you saw through Rachen,

418
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,520
just like Khun Direk said.

419
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,960
That’s not it.

420
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,680
The real reason I didn’t,

421
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,280
is because I didn’t want to.

422
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,240
I already told you before,

423
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,760
no matter what happens,

424
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,640
I’d never hurt you, Khun Ai.

425
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,960
I’m sorry, Khun Mae.

426
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,320
Sorry that…

427
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,400
I didn’t realize

428
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,720
everything you’ve had to face.

429
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,000
It’s nothing.

430
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,120
Just having you here,

431
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,760
by my side, listening, that’s enough.

432
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,680
So…

433
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,920
what should we do
with the recording we got?

434
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,880
Should we just release it?

435
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,720
Not yet.

436
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,680
If we’re up against people who play dirty,

437
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,360
that doesn’t mean

438
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,480
we have to become like them.

439
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,840
Let’s choose the transparent way instead.

440
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,720
Don’t worry.

441
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,400
Everything will work out just fine.

442
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,920
You know about Mae and Aiwarin, don’t you?

443
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,440
Then why didn’t you tell me?

444
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,440
Mae asked me to keep it secret, Dad.

445
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,160
Mae.

446
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,240
What were you thinking?

447
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,640
If you’re with a woman,

448
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,240
I don’t mind.

449
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,240
But she’s our rival, Mae.

450
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,640
I know, Dad.

451
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,960
At first,

452
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,880
I only approached her,

453
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,440
got close to her just to,

454
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,080
gain an advantage
in the bidding, that’s all.

455
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,120
But now…

456
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,200
I’ve come to truly feel
something for her, Dad.

457
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,000
Feel what?

458
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,440
I love her.

459
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,520
Mae.

460
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,720
In that case,

461
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,800
you’ll have to step down
from leading this bid.

462
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,240
Hand it over to me.

463
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,120
I’ll take care of it myself.

464
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,360
Don’t you see,
competing against the one you love,

465
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,960
whether you win or lose,

466
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,200
either way, it hurts.

467
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,800
I won’t back down.

468
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,400
No matter what, I won’t.

469
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,280
Aiwarin and I already agreed,

470
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,840
no matter how the bidding turns out,

471
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,680
we won’t let it decide our relationship.

472
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,400
Are you sure, Mae?

473
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,080
That you can do that?

474
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,960
I’m not sure, Dad.

475
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,480
Even if it hurts me,

476
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,480
at least now

477
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,120
I’ve already done it for you, Dad.

478
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,760
I promise you,

479
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,000
I’ll make you proud.

480
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,600
Give me this chance, Dad.

481
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,440
Let me see this through.

482
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,520
Yes, the original page deleted the post.

483
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,600
But I’m sure the board
will still be suspicious.

484
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
You should prepare an answer, Khun Ai.

485
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,680
Mm.

486
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,440
I really want to know
who leaked the story.

487
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,560
- I already know.
- Really?

488
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,880
So what will you do next?

489
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,120
Nothing much, just…

490
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,680
keep doing everything the right way.

491
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,520
Have you got the numbers yet?

492
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,520
(26 billion baht)

493
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,720
Not yet.

494
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,160
If it’s going to take this long,

495
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,360
I think you should change your plan.

496
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,000
Getting yourself entangled
with that woman,

497
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,240
it’s not worth the risk.

498
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,480
No. Just give me a little more time.

499
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,360
And when exactly is "a little more"?

500
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,000
The bidding deadline is almost here.

501
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,320
I’m trying, I really am.

502
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,640
Someone like you,

503
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,840
if you truly tried, you’d succeed.

504
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,000
Unless…

505
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,680
something’s holding you back.

506
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,240
What is it?

507
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,280
Your heart.

508
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,560
Getting close to Maevika,

509
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,080
it wasn’t just about business, was it?

510
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,400
It’s because you like her.

511
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,840
I’ll give you one more chance.

512
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,560
If you succeed,

513
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,160
I’ll grant you whatever you ask for.

514
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,640
But if you fail,

515
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,640
you’ll get nothing from me again.

516
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,240
(Tomorrow at the meeting,
I want you, Khun Mae,)

517
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,040
(to clarify the facts about
everything that’s happened.)

518
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,720
Yes, because many people have questions.

519
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,200
(Like whether you still have the full
qualifications to lead Superior Group.)

520
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,000
If you all remember,

521
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,440
at the press launch of The Greater,

522
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,280
I told the media

523
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,160
that Aiwarin and I knew
each other back in school.

524
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,520
So meeting again this time,

525
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,280
even as rivals,

526
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,440
doesn’t mean I have to see her as an enemy.

527
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,720
Because after this bidding ends,

528
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,400
Orienna and Superior

529
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,960
might still work together
on other projects in the future.

530
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,120
So maintaining relationships,

531
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,920
maintaining friendships,

532
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,640
isn’t such a bad thing.

533
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,840
But isn’t this the wrong timing?

534
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,760
Why not wait until this is over?

535
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,000
Do friendships really have to follow timing?

536
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,200
Don’t you think, Khun Mae,

537
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,040
that the press, or even The Greater,

538
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,360
might not understand your intentions?

539
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,120
They might assume

540
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,800
you and Aiwarin are colluding on the bid.

541
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,560
That accusation is a bit extreme, isn’t it?

542
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,440
If someone’s going to accuse us of collusion,

543
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,800
they’d better have solid evidence.

544
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,320
Not just a photo.

545
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,760
If a single picture

546
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,480
is enough to explain everything as fact,

547
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,720
then this world’s
become impossible to live in.

548
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,520
I think…

549
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,440
everyone shouldn’t
worry too much about this.

550
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,680
As long as there’s
no official statement from The Greater.

551
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,880
whether Orienna or Superior

552
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,080
will be disqualified from the competition,

553
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,120
that means we’re still in the clear.

554
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,440
And who knows,

555
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,560
maybe The Greater doesn’t
even care about this rumor.

556
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,160
They might see it

557
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,560
as just another tactic from other bidders

558
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,000
trying to discredit us.

559
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,480
Because tricks like this have always been

560
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,880
part of every bidding war.

561
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,120
And these "other bidders" you mentioned,

562
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,320
who do you think it is?

563
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,560
Could it be…

564
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,480
Superior themselves?

565
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,640
Why would they do that?

566
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,480
They’d be damaged too.

567
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,560
True,

568
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,520
but we’d take the bigger hit.

569
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,160
Since we’ve been in the industry longer,

570
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,920
they could spin it
as us tricking them into collusion.

571
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,960
No way.

572
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,200
Maevika’s not that kind of person.

573
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,560
Meeting adjourned.

574
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,200
Khun Ai…

575
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,480
is there something I should know?

576
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,200
Come in.

577
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,720
I’m starting to think your boss

578
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,600
won’t be able to pull it off,

579
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,840
like she promised me.

580
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,240
I can see how much you love her.

581
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,080
So maybe you can do it for her.

582
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,760
What do you mean, Sir?

583
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,520
I want you to help Aiwarin.

584
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,920
Get the bidding numbers from Superior.

585
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,320
Because you yourself,

586
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,360
you’re close

587
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,200
with Maevika’s assistant, aren’t you?

588
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,040
You knew about that?

589
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,960
Someone like me,

590
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,760
if I want to know something,

591
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,240
I’ll know.

592
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,440
And if…

593
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
I can’t do it?

594
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,960
You wouldn’t want me to do things

595
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,160
you’d rather I didn’t, right?

596
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,360
So in truth, you already know
Superior’s numbers,

597
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,080
but you told him you didn’t?

598
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,120
Mm.

599
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,520
I can’t do it.

600
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,520
I love her.

601
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,400
Hey…

602
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,240
Come on, stand up properly.

603
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,560
Hey…

604
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,080
Hey…

605
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,680
What the hell are you doing?

606
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,480
Easy…

607
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,800
It’s okay.

608
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,600
It’s okay.

609
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,120
I was forced to hurt Khun Ai…

610
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
and you too.

611
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,280
But I couldn’t do it.

612
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,840
I thought…

613
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,200
this was the best way out.

614
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,440
It’s okay. Calm down.

615
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,840
In a situation like this,

616
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,720
we should hold on to each other more.

617
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:49,920
Okay?

618
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,400
I don’t know what info you’ve
already got on Orienna.

619
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,080
But I’ve also secured
key intel from Superior.

620
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,560
So I’d say the time has come.

621
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,360
From now on, we’re nothing
but rivals.

622
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,400
What do you want?

623
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,480
Proof.

624
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,640
By now, everyone’s seen the rumors
about Aiwarin of Orienna

625
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,440
and Maevika of Superior.

626
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,760
If there’s any truth to it,

627
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:58,720
then both Orienna and Superior
should be disqualified from the bidding.

628
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,960
- How fast are you driving?
- Ten.

629
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,960
Ten kilometers per hour?
(Driving or pushing?)

630
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,080
(It’s called cruising.)

631
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,560
Three kilos, a hundred each!
(Now I’m a vendor.)

632
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,600
I’m just a burden to everyone.

633
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,480
(There, there, Khun Yam.)

634
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,640
(Still stuck in the mood.)

635
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,880
You okay?
(P’G, comfort her.)

636
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,040
(Give her some comfort.)

637
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,720
That’s better, feels warmer.

638
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,360
A moment ago it was too manly.

639
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,520
Right, sweetie? Just now.
