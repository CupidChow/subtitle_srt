1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,880
If one day the news breaks that
Orienna's heir is behaving badly,

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,280
I won’t keep you around.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,560
You haven’t forgotten, have you, Mae?

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,440
That there are people waiting to
kick us while we’re down if we lose.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,400
Just be careful of that man.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,200
Because we never know

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,840
what Rachen might do next.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,840
You’re the first person

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,760
who’s made me feel like
I want to get serious.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,560
Shall we give it a try together?

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,840
I’ll be with you.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,120
Hurry back, change clothes,
and shower at my place.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,720
It’s getting chilly.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,480
You might catch a cold.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,160
Let’s go.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,400
Aren’t you afraid your father will see?

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
I’m not.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
It’s true my father’s people

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,680
are everywhere.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,480
But here,

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I have more of my own.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,280
You like using force too, don’t you?

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Only sometimes.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
But...

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,240
Sometimes I like using a softer touch.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,759
And when I do use a softer touch,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
it’s so soft that...

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,600
you wouldn’t even imagine.

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,600
You know,

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
you always talk like this.

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
Let’s go.

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
Didn’t you say...

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,320
you brought me here just to change?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,200
You’re such

35
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,160
a kid sometimes.

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Wait.

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,000
But we’re a couple now.

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
That’s true.

39
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,280
But...

40
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,560
this is my first time.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,320
So what?

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,520
You’re not expecting me to wait
until our wedding day, are you?

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Not exactly.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,160
I just feel like

45
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,800
even though we’re together,

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,680
we don’t really know each other yet.

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,079
I think

48
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,080
we should get to know each other better.

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,840
Alright then.

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
If that’s what you want,

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,960
I’ll go along with it.

52
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,120
So...

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
what should we do?

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
Take a shower.

55
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,079
You invited me here to take a shower?

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
Come on, let’s go.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,040
Let’s go.

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
You go first.

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I’ll go after you’re done.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,760
Don’t give me that look.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
Because I know if we shower together,

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
it’s not gonna end quickly.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Why wouldn’t it end quickly?

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,720
You... when will you stop
talking like this?

65
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,440
I really wasn’t thinking anything.

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,320
Swear it.

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
What about you?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
What are you thinking?

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
Go take a shower already.

70
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
Go, go on.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
Go.

72
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Wait, Khun Mae.

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,080
This is a bug.

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
I gave it to you so you can
use it when it’s needed.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,040
It’s a way for us to dig up the secrets.

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
Khun Mae, think about where you can place it

77
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,159
so he won’t notice.

78
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
(Khun Maevika)

79
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,920
(Khun Maevika is calling)

80
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,520
Hey, girl.

81
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,080
Can I get a shot of vodka?

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Make it four.

83
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,600
Sure.

84
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Given the situation right now,

85
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,880
we each need two shots to handle it.

86
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,600
I know you don’t want to be near me,

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,960
but we’re not enemies.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
More importantly,

89
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,000
our boss isn’t even scared.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
So why should you be?

91
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,960
I’m not scared.

92
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,960
But either way, there’s no reason
for us to get close.

93
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,040
We don’t have to be close.

94
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,720
I just thought...

95
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,080
can’t we at least be new friends?

96
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
I’m not looking for friends.

97
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,720
Really?

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,160
What kind of person lives
without any friends?

99
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Alright then.

100
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
We don’t have to be friends.

101
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Just drink together.

102
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,600
It’s on me.

103
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,640
I think...

104
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,120
we can at least talk to each other.

105
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,320
Because we’ve got something in common.

106
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,720
What’s that?

107
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,520
Well...

108
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,640
we’re both loyal subordinates.

109
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,120
We do whatever the boss tells us.

110
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,960
Because our boss treats us well.

111
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
And we’ve already given them our trust.

112
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,680
Enjoy.

113
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,880
Cheers.

114
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,400
Come on, let’s dance.

115
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
I don’t dance.

116
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,080
Come on.

117
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
Let’s dance.

118
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
Come on.

119
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I said no.

120
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,960
Are you coming or not?

121
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,680
Huh?

122
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,400
Come on.

123
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,520
I’m not going.

124
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Enough, let’s head back to the table.

125
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,000
Come on.

126
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,880
I’m not going back.

127
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,480
You’re drunk. Let’s go back.

128
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,520
I’m not drunk.

129
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,280
I don’t believe you.

130
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,840
See?

131
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,280
You, you...

132
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,480
you.

133
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,920
Khun Mae.

134
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,040
Where are you right now?

135
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
Uh...

136
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,960
and...

137
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,240
where’s G?

138
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,440
I’m at the hotel bar.

139
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Are we heading back yet?

140
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,080
G, you go back first.

141
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,040
I’ll find my own way.

142
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,440
Khun Mae,

143
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,040
G, trust me.

144
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,800
I’m safe.

145
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,720
That’s all for now.

146
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,640
Hot chocolate.

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
It’ll warm you up.

148
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,640
Thanks.

149
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,400
You’re welcome.

150
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,240
I’ll clean it up.

151
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
Thank you.

152
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,200
No need to thank me.

153
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,680
Because I want to.

154
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,880
And it’s just a little thing

155
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,640
that couples

156
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,560
should do for each other.

157
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,040
Come here.

158
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,320
I think...

159
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,440
we should change how we call each other.

160
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,320
Saying “you” and “I” feels too distant.

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,320
Hmm, then...

162
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,840
how about

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,360
“baby” or “boo-boo”?

164
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,120
I’ve heard my friends call
their partners that.

165
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
It’s kind of funny.

166
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,480
No way.

167
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,280
I can’t imagine myself calling you that.

168
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,560
How about Khun Ai and Khun Mae?

169
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,120
That’s how we usually call each other.

170
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,560
I just want to make it sound sweeter.

171
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,120
Like how?

172
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
For example...

173
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,640
Khun Ai is happy

174
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
to be with Khun Mae.

175
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,640
Don’t be so happy just yet, Khun Ai.

176
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,880
Sometimes...

177
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Khun Mae might not be as good
as you think.

178
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,840
Khun Ai doesn’t like good people.

179
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,960
Khun Ai likes Khun Mae.

180
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,160
Only.

181
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,760
What’s so funny?

182
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Well...

183
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,560
I just didn’t expect

184
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,920
someone like Orienna’s heir

185
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,160
to say something so cheesy.

186
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,160
Are you bullying me?

187
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,480
Careful, it’ll spill.

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Hey, you,

189
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,200
get some tissues quick or it’ll stain.

190
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
It’s all over now.

191
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,280
- Hello?
- You left your keys at the bar.

192
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Where are you? I’ll bring them to you.

193
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,680
I’m already home.

194
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,000
Just give them back when we meet.
I’m not in a hurry.

195
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,040
But I want to return them now.

196
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
Send me your location.

197
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,880
It’s fine.

198
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Why did you leave early
without telling me?

199
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,080
Here.

200
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,440
Hey, hey.

201
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,080
You.

202
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,240
Are you okay?

203
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,840
You.

204
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
You.

205
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,240
You.

206
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
You’re heavy.

207
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,320
You.

208
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,480
You.

209
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,240
You.

210
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,640
You.

211
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,480
(Have to head to work now, bye.)

212
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
Turn your camera on.

213
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,000
What?

214
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,680
I’m ordering you to turn it on.

215
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
As your girlfriend.

216
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Uh… fine.

217
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,880
But we agreed, remember?

218
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Khun Mae has to speak nicely to Khun Ai.

219
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,160
Still not enough.

220
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,200
Or I’ll barge into your room right now.

221
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360
Alright, Khun Mae, you’re so fierce.

222
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,920
So...

223
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
what are you doing, Khun Ai?

224
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Why are you sweating so much?

225
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
And what do you think I’m doing?

226
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,280
I asked you, not for you to ask me back.

227
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,160
Are you working out?

228
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Of course I am.

229
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,040
What did you think Khun Ai was doing?

230
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,160
Uh...

231
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,040
Nothing.

232
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,480
In that case...

233
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,000
you can keep working out, Khun Ai.

234
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,760
I won’t bother you.

235
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,760
Hello, Khun Ai.

236
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,320
It must be something important
for you to call Anne directly.

237
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Don’t you think Ai might
just miss you sometimes?

238
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,680
Flirt like that and be careful,
Anne might play along.

239
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Then you’ll be in trouble.

240
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
How many girls do you have in stock?

241
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Anne will take care of them all.

242
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
Ai doesn’t have any girls in stock now.

243
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,880
Because...

244
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,240
I just got a girlfriend.

245
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,400
Hmm? Really?

246
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Congratulations.

247
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,760
Thanks.

248
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,960
Alright, let’s get to the point.

249
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
Ai knows you don’t have much time.

250
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,080
You probably already know, Anne.

251
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,400
That Orienna is joining the bidding
for The Greater Duty Free, right?

252
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,480
Well...

253
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,280
I’d like to invite you and Andromeda
to work with me.

254
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
But...

255
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,880
there are some details that I think

256
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
we should discuss in person.

257
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,400
Would you have time
to have a meal with me?

258
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,880
(So many mosquitoes.)

259
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,080
Put some ointment on. Why sit there
when you know there are mosquitoes?

260
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,720
Hello.

261
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,440
Honestly, I wanted to take you inside
to sleep.

262
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,120
But you’re too big.

263
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
I couldn’t lift you.

264
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,880
So you just sat there
letting the mosquitoes bite?

265
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Yeah.

266
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,040
But it’s fine. I’ll be fine soon.

267
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,160
What about you? Did you get bitten?

268
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
I tried to swat them away for you.

269
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,240
By the way, why didn’t you tell me

270
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,720
you took sleeping pills?

271
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,880
I wouldn’t have gone to see you.

272
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,080
How would I know

273
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,320
they’d kick in so quickly?

274
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,360
Here.

275
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,520
When you’ve been drinking alcohol,

276
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,400
you shouldn’t take sleeping pills.

277
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,960
It’s dangerous, you know.

278
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
You sure know a lot.

279
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,960
Of course.

280
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,560
Sometimes I take them when I’m stressed.

281
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,880
Seems like we’ve got
quite a few things in common.

282
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,280
We’ll talk later.

283
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,640
- Yes?
- G?

284
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,480
Come see me for a bit.

285
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,640
Okay.

286
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Morning, Khun Ai.

287
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
Who were you talking to?

288
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Your girlfriend?

289
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,600
What girlfriend?

290
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,040
I don’t have one.

291
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,360
You could, you know. I wouldn’t mind.

292
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
Because I know...

293
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,480
you’ve spent all your time helping me work

294
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,920
and never had a single boyfriend.

295
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,080
Wow.

296
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,920
Saying it like that,

297
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,240
you might as well kill me.

298
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,920
But...

299
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,000
with that kind of encouragement,

300
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,280
Because you’re caught up
in romance yourself, right?

301
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
Not at all.

302
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,680
I’m just...

303
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,920
a boss who really cares about her staff.

304
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,680
But if you’re going to have someone,
choose carefully.

305
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,800
If they’re not good,
or plan to take advantage,

306
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,960
don’t date them.

307
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
So you can spend all your time

308
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,600
helping Khun Ai with work again?

309
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,080
Exactly.

310
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,120
That’s all Mae heard them talk about.

311
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
So she’s not sure

312
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,240
how Andromeda is involved with Orienna
in this bidding.

313
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,360
Or if Khun Aiwarin plans to invite Andromeda

314
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,720
to open a flagship store in The Greater.

315
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,840
Because right now, Andromeda

316
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,440
is a high-end brand in Thailand

317
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,080
that foreign customers are most interested in.

318
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,240
And Aiwarin herself

319
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,160
is already their brand ambassador.

320
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
Plus, she seems close to the brand’s owner.

321
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,360
So she plans to use that connection
to her advantage, huh?

322
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
Of course.

323
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,840
And I think Khun Aiwarin

324
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,720
is also reaching out to many other big brands.

325
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,240
But for now, forget about the other brands.

326
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,600
If Khun Mae can pull Andromeda

327
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,280
into our project,

328
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,760
while Khun Ai is their brand ambassador,

329
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,440
it’ll be like Superior slapping Orienna
in the face.

330
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,480
And our credit with the board
will also go up.

331
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,360
In that case...

332
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,360
G, find me Anne’s contact number.

333
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,520
Alright.

334
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,640
Hello, Anne.

335
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,600
Hello.

336
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,840
Please, have a seat.

337
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,240
Thank you.

338
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
Thank you so much, Anne,

339
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,080
for giving me the honor today.

340
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,520
My pleasure.

341
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,360
I really admire your work, Anne.

342
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,800
I know.

343
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,960
Just looking at the outfit
you’re wearing today says enough.

344
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,760
But this outfit is from the brand’s
latest collection.

345
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,680
It only launched a few days ago.

346
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,640
Actually,

347
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,640
I don’t even know what you wanted
to talk about today.

348
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,400
But first, I want you

349
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,200
to meet a friend of mine.

350
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,200
Alright.

351
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
This is Khun Aiwarin.

352
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,400
I’m sure you already know her.

353
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,800
Khun Ai is our brand ambassador,

354
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,560
and also an important partner

355
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,120
who’s helped push our brand this far.

356
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,120
So I thought

357
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,800
if what you want to talk about
is business,

358
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,280
Khun Ai should be in the loop.

359
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,640
She might help me think it through
and make a decision.

360
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,640
Shall we start the discussion then?

361
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,520
It’s alright, Anne.

362
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,440
I’ll excuse myself.

363
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,840
Goodbye.

364
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,600
She came to ask for our cooperation

365
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,800
but couldn’t control her emotions.

366
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,960
Still so young.

367
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,120
Don’t judge her just yet.

368
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,920
Anyone in her situation

369
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
would be just as stressed.

370
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,320
I’ll be going now.

371
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,000
Khun Mae.

372
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,440
Anne knew, didn’t she?

373
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,160
What I was coming to talk about,

374
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,360
that’s why she invited you.

375
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,600
And you knew too, right,
what I was about to do?

376
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,200
That’s why you came.

377
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,640
Feels good, doesn’t it? Knowing you
hold the upper hand over me.

378
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,280
You’re being unreasonable.

379
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,880
I never thought of it that way.

380
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,560
Then why did you come?

381
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,520
If Anne invited you,
you could’ve just declined.

382
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
Or is it,

383
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,640
the reason you didn’t say no

384
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,640
is because you didn’t want
to upset her?

385
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,360
You must really like her, huh?

386
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,800
You’re getting carried away.

387
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,040
Whatever.

388
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,560
But one thing’s for sure,

389
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,520
I know what you want.

390
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
So I want to give you a chance.

391
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,640
And the reason I came here

392
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,800
is to hear your proposal.

393
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,080
If it’s good,

394
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,480
I might support you
in getting this deal.

395
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,880
I know that...

396
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,760
in the end, we’ll be competing.

397
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,240
But if there’s anything I can do
to help you,

398
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,040
I’d like to help.

399
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,160
Don’t.

400
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,800
Don’t treat me like some rookie
you have to hold up all the time.

401
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,280
I can stand on my own.

402
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
And I don’t need anyone’s help.

403
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,440
(Khun Ai)

404
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,000
Because you didn’t want to upset her.

405
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,560
You must really like her, huh?

406
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Don’t treat me like some rookie
you have to hold up all the time.

407
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,960
Yes.

408
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,840
I’m Rachen, Khun Mae.

409
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,280
How did you get my private number?

410
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,920
Nothing is too hard for someone like me.

411
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,440
So...

412
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,960
why are you calling me, Rachen?

413
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,440
I have something important
to discuss with you in private.

414
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,520
But we should set up a meeting.

415
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
It’s better to talk face-to-face.

416
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,520
I promise you, what we discuss

417
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,680
will benefit you

418
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,880
and the bidding, for sure.

419
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,000
Just be careful of that man.

420
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,960
Both as a rival

421
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,480
and as a man.

422
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,400
Because he’s not like any man
you’ve met before.

423
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Because we never know

424
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
what Rachen might do next.

425
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,520
Alright.

426
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,200
I’ll come meet you.

427
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,360
Welcome, Khun Maevika.

428
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,520
This is one of my family’s businesses.

429
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,920
Did you know, Khun Mae,

430
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,200
when I was young,

431
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,200
I was very weak physically.

432
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,720
So my parents built this sports arena

433
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,440
to force me to play sports every day.

434
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,680
At first, I didn’t like it,

435
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,280
especially sports where I had to compete
with others.

436
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,200
Because every time I competed,
I always lost.

437
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,480
But one day, when I finally won,

438
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
I became obsessed with it.

439
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,600
To the point where everyone said

440
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,080
I must be addicted to winning.

441
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
So you’re saying,

442
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,680
you’re addicted to winning

443
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,520
against me, your bidding rival?

444
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,120
Because I don’t see you as my rival.

445
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,800
I see us as partners instead.

446
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,680
Winning together sounds better.

447
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,760
So this is it,

448
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,080
the important matter you wanted
to discuss with me.

449
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,240
That we should win together.

450
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,160
And how exactly should we do that?

451
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,960
I’ll tell you later what I want you to do.

452
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,520
Right now,

453
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,840
I need some time to do my homework first.

454
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,320
The real reason I asked you here today

455
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,480
was so I could be sure

456
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,240
that you’d cooperate with me.

457
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,600
And now I’m sure.

458
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,960
Why are you so sure?

459
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,480
Otherwise...

460
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,000
you wouldn’t have come here today.

461
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,960
By deciding to come here,

462
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,600
you’ve already said yes halfway.

463
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,640
Am I right?

464
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,320
Someone once told me

465
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,640
that in business,

466
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,840
you have to learn to play angles.

467
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
And now, as a newbie,

468
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,680
I’m starting to learn

469
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,440
what I need to do.

470
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Once you’ve done your homework, Rachen,

471
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
get back in touch with me.

472
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,280
I see us as partners instead.

473
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,560
Winning together sounds better.

474
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,360
And how exactly should we do that?

475
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,120
I’ll tell you later

476
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,800
what I want you to do.

477
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,760
The real reason I asked you
here today was so I could be sure

478
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,880
that you’d cooperate with me.

479
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,080
(Khun Ai)

480
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,720
Anne already knew, didn’t she,

481
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,680
what I was going to talk to her about?

482
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,400
That’s why she invited you.

483
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,040
And you knew too, right,
what I was about to do?

484
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,480
Feels good, doesn’t it,

485
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,600
seeing yourself holding
the upper hand over me?

486
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,240
Delivery for you.

487
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,920
Who sent it, G?

488
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,840
Not sure.

489
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,480
(If you want to go do something fun together,)

490
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,640
(change your clothes and
wait in front of the house at 9 tonight.)

491
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,440
Whose car is that?

492
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,640
My assistant’s.

493
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,400
I bought it for her a long time ago,

494
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,760
but she hardly uses it, so I borrowed it.

495
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,920
Khun Mae, are you ready to go have fun with Khun Ai?

496
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,120
Not yet.

497
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,640
I just want to know where you’re taking me.

498
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Then hop in the car.

499
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,960
What is it?

500
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
I want to put it on you.

501
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Do we really have to
disguise ourselves this much?

502
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,480
Well, Khun Ai wants to take Khun Mae out

503
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,160
like other couples do.

504
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,440
But...

505
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,200
I don’t know if Khun Mae
has forgiven Khun Ai yet.

506
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,440
If not, that’s fine.

507
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,040
Just hold Khun Ai’s hand

508
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,960
and come along with me.

509
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,560
But Khun Ai has to promise Khun Mae first.

510
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,600
That Khun Ai won’t do that again.

511
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,880
Because it doesn’t make Khun Mae feel good.

512
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,520
It makes Khun Mae feel worthless,

513
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,000
like she’s incapable of doing things on her own.

514
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,600
And Khun Mae absolutely hates that feeling.

515
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,480
Okay.

516
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,000
Khun Ai promises.

517
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,560
I won’t do it again.

518
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,520
Ready to have fun with Khun Ai now?

519
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,880
Then shall we go?

520
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,640
Not yet, this too.

521
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,720
Khun Ai.

522
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,720
Khun Mae wants to eat here.

523
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,360
But you’ve already eaten a lot.

524
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,560
Aren’t you afraid of gaining weight?

525
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,320
Heh, no.

526
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,800
But if Khun Mae gets fat,
will Khun Ai break up with her?

527
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,960
No.

528
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,160
I’ll like you even more.

529
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
Soft, squishy, and cute.

530
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,480
Good, then...

531
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,880
let’s get fat together.

532
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,520
Come on.

533
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,200
Hello, oops.

534
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,360
(Can I have two pieces of this one?)

535
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,360
Aren’t you Thai?

536
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,000
You look familiar.

537
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,720
I thought you were a celebrity.

538
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,840
(It’s okay, I’ll pass.
Thank you very much.)

539
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,560
Khun Mae, you can speak Chinese too?

540
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,160
A little.

541
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,280
I’ve studied it since I was young.

542
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,360
Your father really had foresight.

543
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,520
He must have known you’d use it one day.

544
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,560
Actually, it wasn’t my father.

545
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,400
It was my mother.

546
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,040
Even though she’s not a businesswoman,

547
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,000
sometimes

548
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,640
my mother has better
foresight than my father.

549
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,160
Honestly, I’m not that good at it.

550
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,880
I can only remember some sentences.

551
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,880
I haven’t studied it since I was little.

552
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,400
Since my mother passed away.

553
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,240
Actually...

554
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,120
Khun Ai should probably
say something to comfort Khun Mae.

555
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
But...

556
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,200
it’s hard.

557
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,360
Khun Ai doesn’t have a mother either.

558
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Thank you so much, Khun Ai.

559
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,440
For taking Khun Mae out today.

560
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,280
It was really fun.

561
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,920
Khun Mae really likes
this kind of atmosphere.

562
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,840
Let’s come again another day.

563
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,960
Actually, Khun Ai knows
a place even better than this.

564
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,280
Do you want to go, Khun Mae?

565
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,480
Yes.

566
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,960
Khun Ai read reviews
from the hotel guests here.

567
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,200
They said

568
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,520
this is one of the most beautiful spots.

569
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,960
And we can see Bangkok

570
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,520
from a perspective
we may have never seen before.

571
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,480
Beautiful.

572
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,080
Because we’re not
just seeing the view, right?

573
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,560
We’re seeing real life as well.

574
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,880
Khun Mae understands things like this too?

575
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,440
I thought...

576
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,160
a rich girl like you, Khun Mae,

577
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,760
would never have seen
anything so down-to-earth.

578
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,560
Khun Mae’s life

579
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,000
isn’t always up in the clouds.

580
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,760
So you think I’m a rich girl?

581
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,480
What about you, Khun Ai?

582
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,000
It’s different for me.

583
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,640
Khun Ai likes excitement,

584
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,600
loves adventure,

585
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,400
and loves sneaking away

586
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,760
to find new and unusual things.

587
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,760
Today,

588
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,400
even street life

589
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,120
can bring happiness.

590
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,640
Khun Mae, have you noticed?

591
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
The street vendors,

592
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,480
who live grounded lives,
don’t live in the clouds like us,

593
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,080
yet they seem happier than we are.

594
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,920
That’s true.

595
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,840
And I don’t know why people envy our lives.

596
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
When in reality,

597
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,920
it’s their lives

598
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,160
that are far more enviable.

599
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,400
At lease,

600
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,480
They have the freedom

601
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
to do whatever they want,

602
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,760
without anyone forcing them

603
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,600
or drawing boundaries for them.

604
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,520
But what they don’t have is money.

605
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,640
We have to admit...

606
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,240
money is one of the most
important factors in life.

607
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
You might never have known...

608
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
the pain of...

609
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,120
seeing someone you love get sick,

610
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,800
and having no money to treat them,

611
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,360
or no money to buy food

612
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,920
to ease their hunger.

613
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,560
It’s incredibly cruel.

614
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,000
Next time,

615
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,320
take me here again, Khun Ai.

616
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,800
Doing something I’ve never done before

617
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,760
with someone,

618
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,760
it’s so much fun.

619
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,440
And...

620
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,240
it makes me feel so warm inside.

621
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,400
(Khun Maewika went to meet with Rachen.)

622
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,840
If we could just stop time here,

623
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,720
that would be nice.

624
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,000
Shall we make a pact?

625
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,240
No matter what happens after this,

626
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,440
we won’t let it affect
what we have between us.

627
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,880
The most important thing
is that number.

628
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,240
And if you can find out
Orianna’s figure,

629
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,720
winning that auction won’t be hard.

630
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,120
What’s going on between you
and Superior’s heir?

631
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,560
Today we’re shooting outdoors,
(shedding the high-society image)

632
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,680
in Yaowarat,
(ready now)

633
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,160
on a disguised date.
(I’m ready too)

634
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,600
Khun Maewika and Khun Aiwarin
disguise themselves as Sonya’s baby bears.

635
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,240
(What’s your hand doing? I saw that.)

636
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,840
(Cheek to cheek.)

637
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,520
Ouch.

638
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,440
Are you okay?

639
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,680
Oops.
(Belle, don’t mess with me.)

640
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,480
(That was a real bump. Really hurt.)

641
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,280
(Sorry.)

642
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,560
Yes, okay.

643
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,800
Your lashes are so pretty.

644
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,720
So full.
(Complimenting me to my face, I’m shy now.)
