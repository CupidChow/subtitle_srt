1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,050
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,490
I have acquired information
from the hospital as well.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,790
Is it confirmed?

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,700
I bribed a nurse who is
addicted to male host.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,800
Ijuin Sho was indeed, hospitalized

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,170
and his illness is true.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,410
That's enough dig.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,410
Now I can start destroying
Grand Cross gravely.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,110
Certainly.

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,650
Since I'm in a good mood,
let me punch you.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,660
My pleasure. With the usual rule.

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,840
Take these.

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,450
Is that why

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,460
you're trying to die?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,100
That's what "Death Day" here
means, right?

16
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,070
Yeah.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,670
Just... why?

18
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,310
Because my life is dull.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,950
I made that decision right
just before I met you.

20
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,490
I was a bullied kid
and a school dropout.

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,690
I was intimidated by
the gangsters every day.

22
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,790
Thinking that my life would
keep going like this

23
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,830
gave me unbearable anxiety.

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,200
That's why I agreed to
be your fill-in.

25
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm going to die anyway
so it doesn't really matter.

26
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,580
Is it still dull now?

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,710
What?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,390
Things happened since you
started taking my place.

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,860
You overcame problems
together with comrades.

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,090
Tatsuhito.

31
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,770
Does it still feel dull to you?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,640
It's because I was
pretending to be you.

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,910
I mean, that's unnecessarily
burdening my thoughts.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,610
With the fact that
I am a dull person.

35
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:58,260
You and I

36
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,060
are different.

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,300
I can't.

38
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,070
I can't do this anymore.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,670
Enough.

40
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,040
I couldn't care less
about everything.

41
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,280
I don't wanna leave house
until the day I die!

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,070
This is the first step
in destroying Grand Cross.

43
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,700
What kind of talk
did you have with them?

44
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,270
I won't tell you.

45
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,840
All the more if it's for crushing them.

46
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,180
I heard you were a lady gangster.

47
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,950
Is this the comradeship that
exists among gangsters?

48
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,790
Fine.

49
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,830
Your silence makes it
more interesting.

50
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,560
Hold on.

51
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,460
Why Grand Cross?

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,200
Nothing specific.

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,370
Just... because.

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,950
Morning! You're early!

55
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,520
You must be in high spirits.

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,290
Your birthday party is coming up!

57
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,360
The tickets are sold out so we
have to make it even more exciting!

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,590
Yeah...

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,690
Got a minute after the lesson?

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Tatsuhito!

61
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,780
Don't make people worry, dammit!

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,650
You didn't look well lately, rejected my calls,
and ignored me when I came to your house!

63
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,360
You still can't distinguish us.
After all this time.

64
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,330
Are you... Sho-san?!

65
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,500
Bingo.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,170
First time home since
I fell off my motorcycle.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,570
Is Tatsuhito okay?

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,450
Well... he said that he can't
do this anymore.

69
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,920
Can't force him any further.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,520
So that means...

71
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,250
You've fully recovered!

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,260
Hate to break it to you.

73
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,260
But I didn't.

74
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,060
I need to discuss something.

75
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,860
'Cause there's one thing
I've hidden from you as well.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,700
What is it?

77
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,300
It's about your illness,

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,100
isn't it?

79
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,990
Nice to meet you, Ijuin Sho-kun.

80
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,820
I'm Kiyoto.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
Kiyoto...

82
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,130
Who the hell are you?

83
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,370
Butting in to say he has an illness.
What the hell are you on to?

84
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,070
It means that I know Sho-kun
better than you do,

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,170
Daimon Densuke-kun.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,740
I know that the legendary leader of Grand Cross
was hospitalized until recently.

87
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,450
I also know that Yamada Tatsuhito-kun
was acting as his fill-in.

88
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,520
Including the fact that he suffers from
an illness that is fatal for a gangster.

89
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,340
Long time no see.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,070
Well, maybe it's my first time meeting you.

91
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,510
As Yamada Tatsuhito.

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,780
Excuse me!

93
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,950
Apologies for the sudden intrusion.

94
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,090
Shall we talk over tea?

95
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,160
At your grandma's cafe.

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,030
Wait.

97
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,300
What is it about?

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,700
A deal.

99
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,240
Whether Grand Cross
will bow to me or...

100
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,610
Be crushed by me.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,280
LEGENDARY LEADER SHO

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,050
Of course, since this is a deal,

103
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,690
I will pay you an appropriate
reward if you agree.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,690
You want to hire us for money?

105
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,530
Yes.

106
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,400
Many teams in Kitakanto district
have already agreed to this deal.

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,030
To name one...

108
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,040
Tojo Shin from Blood Mafia.

109
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,570
Stop making up bullshit.

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,740
He ain't a guy who will
wag his tail for money.

111
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,810
Well, can't say whether
he's wagging his tail for money

112
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,450
or he's just protecting his team.

113
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,990
Those who refused to comply with me
ended up quite tragic, just so you know.

114
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,600
Sasame Alliance...

115
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,600
White Dragon...

116
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,070
White Rose...

117
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,540
As you're aware, these are teams that have
been destroyed over the past two years.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It was you?

119
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,480
In this occasion...

120
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,480
If you turn down this deal,
as a starter,

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,260
I will spread Sho's secret
throughout Kitakanto.

122
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,590
Don't be so nervous.

123
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,470
I am here today because
I really want to talk to you,

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
a victim of Grand Cross and Ijuin Sho.

125
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,770
Victim, you say?

126
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,740
When he was hospitalized,

127
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,780
you were forced to disguise as him
because you two looked alike, right?

128
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Yamada Tatsuhito-san.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,590
Let's take this opportunity
to let it all out.

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,060
How despicable Ijuin Sho is

131
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,900
and how unworthy his title
of the legendary leader is.

132
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,700
Basically, he asked you to cooperate in
destroying Sho-chan and Grand Cross.

133
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,070
Tacchan.

134
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,210
They're willing to pay
so if you just agree,

135
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,710
you can make a decent
amount of pocket money.

136
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,010
What do you expect from me?

137
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,420
For your information.

138
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:12,420
My boss is also a sponsor of
the agency that Machisuke belongs to.

139
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,160
So at his discretion,

140
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,230
he can make your favorite member,
Fujitani Aya, leave the group

141
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,570
or even disband Machisuke altogether.

142
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,980
What's this illness you just said?

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,080
I'll let Sho-kun himself
say more on that.

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,120
Just so you know,
this deal is just on paper.

145
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm not planning on making money
by uniting the gangsters.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,290
When it comes to money, I have
way more than enough to spend.

147
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,830
What!! Then lend me 100 million yen!

148
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,370
Interest-free and unconditional!

149
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,600
No.

150
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
Stingy.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,470
Calm down, Kanako.

152
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,940
Are you dumb?

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,370
'Scuse me, Senpai.

154
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,140
I used to be a debt collector apprentice

155
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,000
so when it comes to money,
I can't help it.

156
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,950
Like I said, call me Mama, not Senpai.

157
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,950
Anyway, you shouldn't borrow
money from such a shady guy.

158
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,020
Shady? That's rude of you.

159
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,790
Oh, right, I heard your name
from Detective Mura.

160
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,500
Lately, there's been a lot of
unsettling hustle in this town.

161
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,640
The name Kiyoto pops up here and there
both in public and underground.

162
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,610
That obnoxious host guy
is one of your people too, right?

163
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,840
He's just a disposable piece.

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,640
I disposed of him a long time ago.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,650
I give funding to quasi-yakuza groups
and crime syndicates as well

166
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,150
so disposing garbage
is an easy work for me.

167
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,090
What the hell are you up to?

168
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,260
To make every gangster
in this town bow to me.

169
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,860
That's my only main agenda.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,540
By any means necessary.

171
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:12,610
Well, I don't think Grand Cross
can fulfill your wish.

172
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,490
Are you turning down this deal?

173
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,420
I ain't into bowing or bossing.

174
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,430
Ain't gonna wag my tail for money either.

175
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,400
Let's just finish this dude off here, Sho-san.

176
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,230
No need to give him a mercy.

177
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,270
Wow, you're so quick-tempered.

178
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,310
Laying a finger on me here

179
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,410
means the revenge won't be
just for Grand Cross itself.

180
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,780
Your families and...

181
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,150
Not to forget...

182
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,520
Yamada Tatsuhito as well.

183
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,060
You bastard...

184
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,590
Stop it, Daimon.

185
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,660
But, Sho-san...

186
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,160
Daimon-kun.

187
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,870
I don't think Sho-kun
has time for that.

188
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,140
Sho!

189
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,040
- Sho-san?
- Sho!

190
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,810
Did you get it now?

191
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,020
This is the current shape
of that legendary leader!

192
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,560
Well?

193
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,160
Do you think you can cooperate?

194
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,630
No.

195
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,570
I cannot.

196
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,900
Your decision can cause trouble
for many people, you know?

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,440
You might find yourself in
a dangerous situation as well.

198
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
I don't care about myself!

199
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:59,350
Just don't lay a hand on
Machisuke or Aya-nee!

200
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,190
I don't think you understand.

201
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,090
If you would just cooperate a little,

202
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,230
you wouldn't have to
go through all that trouble.

203
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,160
I don't want to hate myself even more.

204
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,640
I've always hated gangsters anyway.

205
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,640
I didn't disguise as Sho-san
because I wanted to either!

206
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,980
But...

207
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,110
Even so,

208
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:34,190
I was a part of Grand Cross
until recently.

209
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,260
I think they'll turn their back on you
if the secret is revealed.

210
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,500
Still, I don't want to betray them.

211
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,170
Is that so?

212
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,570
My business here is done then.

213
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,840
I'm sorry for suddenly showing up
and asking you for unreasonable help.

214
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,410
Excuse me now.

215
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,980
Wait.

216
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,750
His mission was just accomplished.

217
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,220
The whole talk earlier
was recorded on camera.

218
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,890
Recorded?!

219
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,730
No matter what your answer is,

220
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,530
they now have an evidence that Sho-chan was
filled in by a lookalike who is an idol nerd.

221
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,040
That's enough crack to
damage Grand Cross name.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,070
Didn't know you had some guts.

223
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,910
I thought you'd be freaked
out and just comply.

224
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,150
I applaud you for that.

225
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,520
I'll just give you a warning.

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,620
Stop disguising as Sho-chan

227
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,420
and don't get involved with
us gangsters ever again.

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,830
Kitakanto will get out of control
for the time being

229
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,300
and not even this house is safe,
you just saw that coming.

230
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,330
So...

231
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,210
If I ever see you hanging
around aimlessly,

232
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,810
I

233
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,180
will twist your jaw.

234
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,940
What are you doing, Nao?

235
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,510
Ow.

236
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,640
Wait! That's my question!

237
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,010
Beniko-san called and told me
that you wanna meet me

238
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,720
and when I got here, you're asleep.

239
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,150
It was grandma, huh?

240
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,420
Someone just got a seizure here.

241
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,490
Seizure?

242
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,560
What do you mean?

243
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,870
But wait, what happened
to your wound?

244
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,040
You got beaten up so badly
just recently.

245
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,470
How come?

246
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,240
No marks whatsoever at all.

247
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,680
Because...

248
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,380
It wasn't me.

249
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,340
What?

250
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:17,220
It was my lookalike
who disguised as me.

251
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,320
Are you still half asleep?

252
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,560
What kinda dream did you
have? That's so cute of you!

253
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
I got it. I got it.

254
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,930
I'm not half asleep.

255
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,830
I'm dead serious.

256
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,400
For the past few months,

257
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,340
I've had someone else replaced me.

258
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,010
The past few months...?

259
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,550
It was after I fell off my motorcycle
and got hospitalized.

260
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,220
At that time,

261
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,790
I met a guy named Tatsuhito
whose face looked exactly like mine.

262
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,490
No. No. Wait. Stop.

263
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,990
Tatsuhito? What?

264
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,000
Who's that? What's this about?

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,330
Who was defeated by
the gangster hunter?

266
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Tatsuhito.

267
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,100
Who was called by the detective
and went to the police station?

268
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,940
Tatsuhito.

269
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,570
Including when we went to the club

270
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,210
and listened to the scout about that
weird ass fighting tournament too?

271
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,650
Yeah, that was him.

272
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,050
That means... the guy I was
here with a few times was...

273
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,660
That must've been Tatsuhito

274
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,390
but I ain't heard
anything 'bout this.

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,390
Did you two kiss?

276
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,700
Heck nah!

277
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,800
Are you dumb?!

278
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,330
No way in the hell we did!

279
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,900
Forget 'bout that!

280
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,640
You gotta be kidding me!

281
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,340
What the hell was that about?

282
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,470
Why did you hide it from me?

283
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,380
I thought it's better known
to only a few people

284
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,380
and also because

285
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,150
I was diagnosed with an illness
after hospitalized.

286
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,420
Illness?

287
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
I have narcolepsy.

288
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,720
I would get seizure
and suddenly fall asleep.

289
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,890
It just happened earlier too,

290
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,700
I suddenly fell asleep when
I was talking to someone.

291
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,200
Stop. Quiet.

292
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,900
I can't process all of this at once.

293
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,910
That's why I can't continue
as who I have been.

294
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,950
Either as a gangster or
the leader of Grand Cross.

295
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,080
I said, quiet!

296
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,420
What in the actual hell!

297
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,000
Stop joking with me, I'm serious!

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,050
How can you bombard me
with all of these?!

299
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,130
I know. My bad.

300
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,460
But...

301
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,860
Shut up now!

302
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,800
How could you hide such
an important thing from me...

303
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,110
I'm so sorry, for not telling you.

304
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You're sickening, Sho.

305
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,760
My dumb grandson.

306
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,500
I don't remember raising a half-baked
guy who'd make a girl cry.

307
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,270
Grandma...

308
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,180
Her wake up surprise
freaked me out.

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,080
Though I knew you called her so
we could have a proper talk.

310
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,180
It's your fault for keeping it a secret.

311
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,920
I told Daimon about it

312
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,520
then he left while in shock.

313
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,460
Thinking what will
happen to Grand Cross.

314
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,190
I bet he did.

315
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,470
Even if I kept quiet, that Kiyoto guy
would reveal everything anyway.

316
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,940
Either way, make sure you
apologize to your comrades.

317
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,210
I'll apologize to Naoko
on your behalf.

318
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,020
- Thanks for today!
- Bye!

319
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,660
- So hungry!
- It's finally over!

320
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,930
Aya... listen.

321
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,460
Did you get in some shady affairs?

322
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,700
Like what?

323
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,870
Like being involved with Ijuin Sho
from Grand Cross, perhaps?

324
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,480
When you skipped lesson
and left the other day,

325
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,510
there was a man you walked by, remember?

326
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,410
Sorry.

327
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,750
He asked me about
some things that day.

328
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,450
Including your relationship
with Ijuin Sho.

329
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,690
He did?

330
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,730
I'm begging you.

331
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,360
Don't meddle in any more
of these shady affairs.

332
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,370
Who is that man, actually?

333
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,770
He's called Kiyoto-san.

334
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,570
A major sponsor of our agency.

335
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,140
I don't know much about him either

336
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,210
but he looks intimidating.

337
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,690
You were forced to disguise as him

338
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,990
because you're his lookalike, right?

339
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,860
He's an impostor!

340
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,690
I didn't disguise as Sho-san
because I wanted to either!

341
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,130
Crazy that an introverted idol nerd
was filling in for Ijuin Sho.

342
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,230
That ain't all.

343
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,300
Apparently Sho had been sick and
staying home all this while.

344
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,870
Bet this is the end of Grand Cross.

345
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,670
We need clear explanation, Sho-san.

346
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,510
Why did you hide it from us?

347
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,820
You're in the wrong too, Daimon.

348
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,690
Are you gonna say that
you couldn't trust any of us?

349
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,490
It was my wish to hide it.

350
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,320
I hid my illness from Daimon too.

351
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,230
So don't blame him for this.

352
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,730
But it was only him who knew
about the disguise, right?

353
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,500
Why were we left out?

354
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,440
I can't explain it well, but...

355
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,280
At the time, I met someone
who looked exactly like me

356
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,350
and thought that maybe
he could help cover me up.

357
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:33,290
So we were all idiots just for not
noticing that he's a lookalike?

358
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,830
No, that's not it!

359
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:42,230
Sho-san just didn't wanna
make you guys worry. That's all.

360
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,870
Cut the crap.

361
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,870
Then why did you keep
quiet about his illness? Huh?

362
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,880
You knew he could no longer
be a gangster.

363
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,810
You're protecting Grand Cross
for nothing, dude!

364
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,150
We've always been in this together.

365
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,420
But why didn't you
tell us much sooner?

366
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm sorry.

367
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,730
Marukawa!

368
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,400
Daimon!

369
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:16,970
Let him.

370
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,900
Sho-san...

371
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,110
You guys can punch me
as many times as you want.

372
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,780
I...

373
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,780
I thought Grand Cross
was where I belonged.

374
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:40,320
I'd even risk my life
for you and this team.

375
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,430
And yet, look what you've done.

376
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,000
What are we supposed to do now?

377
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,030
Guys! Come on!

378
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,010
Daimon, I'm sorry.

379
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,250
Everything is my fault.

380
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,890
I knew you're upset too
that I hid my illness from you.

381
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,960
How about you take over for me

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,700
and become the next leader?

383
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,470
I'm so upset, honestly!

384
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,210
I can understand if it's Beniko-san

385
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,650
but you chose to tell Tatsuhito
over any of us.

386
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,090
Still...

387
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,830
More than anything,

388
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,330
I cherish you and Grand Cross!

389
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,810
I am

390
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,580
the second man of Grand Cross,
a team that you lead!

391
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,920
Till the very end.

392
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,190
You think so?

393
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,230
Thanks a lot.

394
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,810
I'm sorry.

395
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,880
For suddenly contacting you
and showing up here.

396
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,510
When you contacted me
out of the blue

397
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,180
and said that the gangsters will
be attacked if I don't let you in,

398
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,880
do you think I have
any other choice?

399
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,380
Tojo-kun and my staff Chamon
recently came by, didn't they?

400
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,020
I was wondering if you're on the lookout
and pretended to be not home.

401
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,960
So... what do you want?

402
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,760
Didn't you already use me
to crush Grand Cross?

403
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:42,340
Why you refused
to help me crush them.

404
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,210
I wanted to ask you
directly about it.

405
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,880
Yamada Tatsuhito-kun.

406
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,850
I've already said why.

407
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,420
Because Grand Cross
are your friends... was it?

408
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:03,030
But they were upset when they
found out you've deceived them.

409
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,230
How selfish they are.

410
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,430
More after dragging you into this.

411
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,040
But what can you expect from them?

412
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,740
Gangsters are just a bunch
of trash, after all!

413
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:19,940
What...?

414
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,810
They're nothing but a trouble
to decent citizens.

415
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:27,550
This town is full of trash like them.

416
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:34,060
You've lived your whole life
thinking the same, right?

417
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,130
Sorry.

418
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,370
Anyway, we're on the same page
about hating the gangsters.

419
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,140
They always talk about
friendship and bonds,

420
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,250
but I'll prove them how
easily broken such a thing is.

421
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,050
Aren't you trying

422
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,590
to make the gangsters
under your control?

423
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,460
Well...

424
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,860
Maybe I can tell you about this.

425
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,730
That is just the apparent story.

426
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,530
Apparent?

427
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,570
Then... what's your aim?

428
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,140
My aim is not
to rule the gangster world.

429
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,480
But to make it collapse.

430
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,930
Got any business with me?

431
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,100
Here for bounty hunting.

432
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,940
What an enormous amount of money.

433
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,640
If you follow what we say
then no violence is needed here.

434
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,910
Easier for us.

435
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,010
The hell?

436
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:04,050
Kneel and vow right here!

437
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,950
Say that you'll be Kiyoto-san's dog!

438
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,050
Don't fucking mess with me!

439
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,860
Oh, look.

440
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,900
None of them is actually kneeling, after all.

441
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,300
They're not guys who would back down
when facing multiple opponents.

442
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,010
All of the executive members of
Grand Cross are fairly well-known for that.

443
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,180
In order to get the bounty,

444
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,640
they have to spread a video
of Grand Cross kneeling.

445
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,780
The attackers will likely
exert themselves as well.

446
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,690
Well, I'm also thinking about additional
rule to make this game more exciting.

447
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,220
Additional rule?

448
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,490
Yes.

449
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,530
If Grand Cross members switched sides

450
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,400
and hunted down other
members as a bounty head...

451
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,800
They get double the amount.

452
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,170
So to cause a falling out
among comrades?

453
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,710
Once this rule becomes widely known,

454
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,180
even the lower-ranking members
of the team will start to take action.

455
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,020
The guys who were friends until yesterday
are now fighting each other.

456
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Nothing could be more fun than this.

457
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,360
If I may...

458
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,730
I think there's a hole
or flaw in that rule.

459
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,570
As comrades, they can cheat as much as
they want in order to get the bounty.

460
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,650
Whether they're cheating or not,

461
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,290
I just want the video of them kneeling and
vowing their loyalty to me to go viral.

462
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,860
There is no hole or flaw.

463
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,830
Certainly. My apologies.

464
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,900
So... can I get the money
for getting punched earlier?

465
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,300
Tojo-kun, send this man to the hospital.

466
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,340
Huh?

467
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,370
What do you...

468
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,880
I'm sick of seeing that face of yours.

469
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,180
I'm done with you.

470
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,650
You can't just suddenly say that.

471
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,880
Chamon.

472
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,320
Go attack him.

473
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,660
Do that and I'll pay off all of your
debts, either you lose or win.

474
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,430
Will you really?

475
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,060
Of course.

476
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,900
So do it until you're on
the verge of death.

477
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,810
Hold on now. Kiyoto-san?

478
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,540
Feel free to kill him
half to death.

479
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,810
I picked him up when he was
drowning in debt and on the verge

480
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,810
of committing suicide with his family.

481
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,720
He became my dog
just ​​for money.

482
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,890
Come on.

483
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,490
If you beat Tojo-kun,

484
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,160
I'll add prize money
on top of your debt repayment.

485
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,560
If it's for my family...

486
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,600
Please let me!

487
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,820
Congrats on paying off the debt.

488
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,800
Hey.

489
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,670
That's all you gotta say?!

490
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,780
I'm hella upset.

491
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,910
So fucking upset

492
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,150
that I came here to settle things.

493
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,450
Naoko-san, listen...

494
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,220
We're both quite stressed right now
because of the team.

495
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,560
Shut up!

496
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,990
You stay out of this.

497
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,970
Sho, what are you to me?

498
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,500
Huh?

499
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,040
Boyfriend?

500
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,340
You bet?

501
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,980
Then as your girlfriend who was
hurtfully left out of your secret,

502
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,150
do you want me to forgive you

503
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,990
or do you want us to break up?

504
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,350
Say it out loud!

505
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,390
Obviously, I want you to forgive me!

506
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,730
Alright then.

507
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,770
I'll give you three headbutts
and we're even.

508
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,700
What?

509
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,480
It's off my chest.

510
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,890
I forgive you.

511
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,720
That made me happy.

512
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,590
But getting your headbutt after
a long while kinda freaked me out.

513
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,130
And I got three in a row.

514
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,100
Not for you to complain, idiot!

515
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,430
I know.

516
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,840
Then...

517
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:34,480
While you're here, can
you do me a favor?

518
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,410
What is it?

519
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,020
Naoko-san!

520
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,790
Before that, please give me
a headbutt as well!

521
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,490
I was just as guilty as him.

522
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,420
You've got some guts, huh?

523
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:54,400
Look, you said that you were an idol fan
just to cover that impostor idol nerd guy.

524
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,430
Don't give me such a fanciful lie, you idiot!

525
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,870
I'm serious about Kyoko-senpai!

526
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
That pissed me off even more.

527
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,440
So gotta give you four!

528
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,120
Well? What is it?

529
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,060
Damn hurt.

530
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,760
Anyway.

531
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,500
I see you're completely back
to your default style.

532
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,570
Yeah, you look better that way.

533
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,770
Sho-san has returned

534
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,610
so you don't need to
dress up as him anymore.

535
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Uh... I'm sorry.

536
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,920
They found out that
I was disguising as Sho-san.

537
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,020
I also heard that the team members
are hunted like a bounty head.

538
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,620
It ain't a thing you should
feel responsible for.

539
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,160
But... you got that wound.

540
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,270
Oh, this is just Naoko-san anger relief.

541
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,100
Well, this is how she made it even.

542
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,570
I was rather lucky.

543
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,740
What about the other guys?

544
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,280
Hmm... anyway.

545
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,950
Looking at it again,

546
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,050
this room's hella cool,
it's filled with Aya-nee.

547
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,460
When Sho-san first came up with
the idea of making you his fill-in,

548
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,060
I honestly thought that
he gotta stop joking.

549
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,070
Like ain't no way

550
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,600
such a wimpy-looking idol nerd
could ever be his fill-in.

551
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Sho-san asked me to support you

552
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,540
and troubles kept coming
for one reason or another.

553
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:48,810
Truly, it's like a miracle that
I wasn't exposed till recently.

554
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,320
It ain't a miracle.

555
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,650
Nor was the reason that Sho-san
told only you about his illness.

556
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,430
Hey.

557
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,730
Can I come hang out
again sometimes?

558
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,810
Well, I'm a gangster that you dislike
so only if it doesn't bother you.

559
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,580
Of course... feel free. I don't mind.

560
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,980
Alright, let's talk a lot
about Machisuke next time!

561
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,250
Tatsuhito, listen.

562
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,890
Yeah?

563
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,090
I know you were forced into this

564
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,600
but you stayed with me
to protect Grand Cross.

565
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,460
Thanks a lot for that.

566
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,650
It's finally my turn, huh?

567
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,630
Not to mention the boss of
Blood Mafia himself is here.

568
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,790
'Ssup.

569
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,860
As you see.

570
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,660
But rest assured.

571
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,830
I'm just escorting these boys.

572
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,870
I was asked to come along
as a guarantee.

573
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,910
Stop the nonsense and
come bring your shit on!

574
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:30,680
All of you imbeciles who wag your tail
at the money-grubbing prick.

575
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,120
I'll fight you all damn back!

576
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,820
Business sure is slow.

577
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,960
Should we close up
and go for a drink?

578
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:47,260
The whole town seems to be
gloomy these days, I don't like it.

579
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,370
The gangsters are very tense too.

580
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,270
Well, yeah.

581
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:54,600
But in our days back then,

582
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,710
there were times when the atmosphere
was bad 'cause of fights and crackdowns.

583
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,240
Kinda similar to that.

584
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,550
Mine wasn't as extreme 
as it was in your days, Mama.

585
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,980
Hey, you're out of tune,
call me Senpai.

586
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,680
- What? But you always...
- Like I said...

587
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,420
You must call me "Senpai" first
then I fix you to call me "Mama".

588
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,660
What I'm saying is,

589
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,100
you don't have to change either.

590
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,900
Even this town ain't gonna change easily.

591
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,400
We won't let it be.

592
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,510
I was supposed to go back
to my usual life.

593
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,350
But a lot of people came to my house,

594
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,090
and told me all sort of things,
now my head is spinning.

595
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,450
Don't get involved with
us gangsters ever again.

596
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,490
Gangsters are just a bunch of trash!

597
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:49,390
You stayed with me
to protect Grand Cross.

598
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,290
Thanks a lot for that.

599
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,060
Enough!

600
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,670
Gotta stop thinking about them!

601
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:59,700
None of them matters to me anymore.

602
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,880
Again?

603
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,890
Hello?

604
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,790
I'm at the front door
of your house now.

605
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,300
What? Why?

606
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,900
Is this also considered a draw?

607
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,010
What?

608
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:42,810
I thought Yamada Tatsuhito and
Ijuin Sho were the same person.

609
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,780
On the other hand, you didn't recognize me
and thought that I was someone else, right?

610
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,390
That Fujitani Aya from Machisuke

611
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:58,260
was the girl you saved from bullies
in elementary school.

612
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,930
Stop right there!

613
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,230
Give it back!

614
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,070
Give that back!

615
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,670
I can't blame you.

616
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,580
I was quite overweight
and wore glasses back then.

617
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:19,380
Honestly, I was surprised that you didn't
recognize me after meeting so many times.

618
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,590
I was happy to lose weight.

619
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,490
But I was sad that you didn't
recognize me at all.

620
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,590
Well... you were in idol outfit.

621
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,200
I was in casual outfit when we met
during your disguise, though?

622
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,170
But your last name was different.

623
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,340
Sorry.

624
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,940
No biggie.

625
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,080
You finally remembered me
on your own anyway.

626
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm sorry.

627
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,020
So...

628
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,120
My misunderstanding
and your unawareness

629
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,620
are a draw, right?

630
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,920
No, that's not it.

631
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,270
I'm sorry that I've become
a guy like this.

632
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,170
The reason why you thought
Sho and I were the same person

633
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,210
wasn't just because we looked alike,

634
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:28,790
but also because you remembered
me from the past, right?

635
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,250
Yeah.

636
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:38,160
Because you were a hero to me.

637
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,370
I was bullied in middle school

638
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,940
then I became a dropout.

639
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,250
I became afraid to go outside.

640
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,650
Even my parents abandoned me.

641
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,260
I found Machisuke and became a fan.

642
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,090
I started supporting you,

643
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,400
buying your goods
and going to the gigs.

644
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,040
Even so...

645
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,040
Every time I went outside,

646
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,370
I got mugged and intimidated
by the gangsters.

647
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,150
I know it myself.

648
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,980
That I was braver when
I was in elementary school.

649
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,860
I was able to face the unpleasant
and difficult things.

650
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,560
But why did I turn like this?

651
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,240
Turning weak and pathetic.

652
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,040
And becoming someone who
always thinks about running away.

653
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,950
Aya-chan?

654
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,710
Sho-san gave me a message
 he sent through Naoko.

655
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,140
That he wants me to save you.

656
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,080
That's why you're here?

657
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,350
No!

658
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,080
I came here to stop
your bullshit!

659
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,850
Because I'm pissed off!

660
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,390
I can't get it over with unless
I came here and tell you directly!

661
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:48,060
How you felt about life

662
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,930
or why you wanted to die
is none of my business.

663
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:56,670
But don't try and use my existence
as a push to kill yourself!

664
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,770
It doesn't matter whether you're
weaker than you were back then!

665
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,910
You are still you!

666
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,380
Only different thing is,
you hate yourself now.

667
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,450
Aya-chan...

668
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,350
What pisses me off is

669
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,190
that you're using it as an excuse

670
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,890
to run away from your life!

671
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,990
If you are my fan...

672
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,890
Get out of your pathetic life!

673
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,470
If I can't give my fans the courage to live

674
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:35,870
then my existence as an idol has no meaning.

675
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,140
Hello.

676
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,570
Tatsuhito.

677
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,580
Daimon was severely injured
and taken to the hospital.

678
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,420
Which hospital?!

679
00:47:29,730 --> 00:48:13,710
