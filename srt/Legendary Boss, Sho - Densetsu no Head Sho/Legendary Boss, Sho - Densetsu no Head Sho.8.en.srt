1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,590
In the bloody lair of gangsters in Kitakanto,

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,860
a ultimately different type
of enemy has appeared.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,460
I'm Kiyoto.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,430
Grand Cross shatters in mid-air
due to Kiyoto's schemes.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,260
Tatsuhito who's in the verge of closing
his heart again after the secret was revealed

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,170
was scolded by Aya.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,010
Get out of your pathetic life!

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,710
Shortly afterwards,

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,110
the vice leader of Grand Cross, Daimon
was attacked and severely injured.

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,680
Which hospital?!

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,810
The time for Kiyoto's ruthless
plan to crush Grand Cross,

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,880
in a final battle,

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,480
is fast approaching.

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,470
What's wrong? Is this an emergency?

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm calling the doctor now!

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
It's my...

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,770
What?

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,340
My acquaintance...

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,590
How is Daimon-san's condition?

20
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,790
Who the heck?

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,090
Wait. Look at his face.

22
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,890
You're the idol nerd
who replaced Sho.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,460
Got some nerve to come here
after fooling us, huh?

24
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,700
Well...

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,210
But now isn't the time for that...

26
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,410
I'm getting pissed off here.

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,040
You ain't our friend or anybody.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,380
Nobody but a shitty impostor!

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,850
Kuroda-kun.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,450
Stop it. I'll call Sho here.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,220
If you wanna lay a hand on him,

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,920
you gotta fight me and Sho first.

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,330
With that looks, I can tell
you're someone else.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,610
How is he?

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,680
He's not in critical condition.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,980
But with this injury, he probably
won't be able to get up for a while.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,220
Uh... where's Sho-san?

38
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,090
He went out to find the guys
who attacked Daimon.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
I tried to stop him but
he blew his top.

40
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,860
Hey, gotta ask you something.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,840
You're the Grand Cross guy...

42
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,270
Needa find someone.

43
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,470
I ain't got no time.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,050
Just answer my damn question.

45
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,350
He's bearing the responsibility.

46
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,120
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,520
Because I got involved,

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,060
I caused trouble for everyone.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,630
You only got dragged into this.

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,330
It's not about finding who to blame,

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,240
but a matter of pride.

52
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,530
After getting beaten
by multiple opponents,

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,640
Daimon refused to admit defeat.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,210
Even when they were attacked
and hunted like a bounty head,

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,410
none of them kneeled.

56
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,020
So no need to feel responsible.

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,620
That being said.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,660
I have something else
to settle with you here.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,370
When you disguised as Sho,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,630
there were a few times

61
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,200
when it was just the two of us, right?

62
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,210
What happened at that time...

63
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,280
I hope you never told anyone about it.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,120
No, I never did.

65
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,650
That you're an extremely spoony girl

66
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,520
and how you're smiling
when patted on the head

67
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
and when you tried to kiss me...

68
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,290
Don't say every single of it
out loud, dammit.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,130
That's something special
that I only show to Sho.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,370
Listen up.

71
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,710
You gotta keep quiet about it!

72
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,140
Even better, erase it from your memory.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,540
Otherwise...

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,150
I'll kill you.

75
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,550
Got it.

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,170
Finally you're awake, Sho-chan.

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,340
Don't just wander into
someone else's territory.

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,650
Haven't seen the real Sho-chan
in a long while.

79
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,550
And now we met again,

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,780
you've ironically become
a dogsbody of that prick.

81
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,630
Well, we're only business-like partners.

82
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,960
So you're here today for business too?

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,830
You bet.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,500
I heard you were looking
for me all night.

85
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,570
That's why I came here.

86
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,310
Then...

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,990
You should've done it
while I was sleeping.

88
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,490
You're no longer
Tojo that I knew.

89
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,670
I'm gonna crush you

90
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,300
right here and now.

91
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,670
Looks like I'm completely despised now.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,940
But no biggie.

93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,980
Let's do it until we die.

94
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,030
Found him! He's that impostor!

95
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,860
No offense, but

96
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,130
come disguise as Sho
from Grand Cross again.

97
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,670
Then if you kneel

98
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,570
and vow your loyalty to Kiyoto-san,

99
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,570
you can leave unharmed.

100
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,610
Why should I?

101
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,880
For the bounty, of course.

102
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,180
That jerk Kiyoto, he's imposing
such an ass rule.

103
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,750
To film and spread a video of the target
kneeling and vowing loyalty to me.

104
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,130
Did anyone say about
sending him to the hospital?

105
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,830
No matter how we beat
him up, he won't listen.

106
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,000
But you guys got beaten by Daimon-chin
from the start to the middle of the fight.

107
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,070
In the end, it was me
who cleaned the mess.

108
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,070
If you want to win the bounty,

109
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,710
you must meet the conditions I set.

110
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,110
Otherwise,

111
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,880
it wouldn't be called a game.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,050
What you just said.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
Was it you jerks
who attacked Daimon-san?

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,560
And what about it?

115
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,580
LEGENDARY LEADER SHO
final episode

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,270
Call over these guys
who attacked Daimon.

117
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,180
Don't forget Kiyoto.

118
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,450
If you can beat me, I'll
give you their contacts.

119
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
That won't happen.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,060
'Cuz I've already killed you by then.

121
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,100
Yeah, the real deal
is on another level.

122
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,500
Dudes.

123
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,270
Don't keep the party
to yourselves.

124
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,100
Let me in too.

125
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,380
Seyama.

126
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,350
Are you here for the bounty too?

127
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,680
Talk for your filthy self.

128
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,150
We ain't the same.

129
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,820
I'm so sick of you two.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,690
A pathetic loser who got ditched by his comrades
after he was exposed using a fill-in.

131
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,660
A scumbag who wags his tail
to a money-grubbing prick.

132
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,730
Your one-on-one fight
ain't stunning in the slightest.

133
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,730
So what?

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,640
Don't say you came to stop us.

135
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,070
I did, obviously.

136
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,280
I wanna take your breath away!

137
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,980
Sho.

138
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,990
I'm gonna crush you gracefully
before someone else does it.

139
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,960
Also, Tojo.

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,930
Your ugly ass gotta die!

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,360
Think you can make an ally
while dealing with me?

142
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,070
Nothing's changed in you,
creepy ass narcissist.

143
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,360
Perfect!

144
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,060
Don't intrude on me, dumbasses!

145
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,100
That's my damn part.

146
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,530
Dudes.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,670
If I fall asleep halfway through,

148
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,240
you'd better finish me off right there.

149
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,350
Getting a half-assed punch
will just make me sober again.

150
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,080
If that happens,

151
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,550
I'll put you to sleep instead.

152
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,730
Stop acting like a nerd
and show some guts!

153
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,070
Lemme check your goods!

154
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,170
Give it back!

155
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,070
You wish!

156
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,610
Stop!!

157
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,010
It's for Daimon-san...

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,250
He's a nerd too, huh?

159
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,450
Grand Cross deadass went downhill!

160
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,120
Not just the name,
they'll be over for real today.

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,930
I bet Tojo's already got his ass by now.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,500
You mean Sho-san?

163
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,170
Get off me!

164
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,100
Let go of me!!

165
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,370
Behave a little, you idiot!

166
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,280
It's hopeless.

167
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,510
Nothing's actually changed in me.

168
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,550
I'm still like when I was bullied
and intimidated by the gangsters.

169
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,090
My rage over Daimon-san's defeat
doesn't help.

170
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,090
Neither does the urge
to save Sho-san!

171
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,860
Here we go! Here we go!
Here we go!

172
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,540
Huh?

173
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,200
What's wrong?

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,550
You fucking dipshits!

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,680
Got some guts to act up
in Grand Cross territory, huh?!

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,460
Think you can get away after
laying hands on our friend?!

177
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,530
Come on. Let him go.

178
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,600
Your comrades ran scared.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,340
Dammit! Wait for me!

180
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,040
You fucking cowards!

181
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,510
Idiots!

182
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,810
Are you ok?

183
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,980
H-how come?

184
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,850
To be honest, we were so pissed

185
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,950
and never meant to forgive you.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,960
Not until someone sent this to us.

187
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,760
Nobody knows who took and sent it.

188
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,830
Daimon-san...

189
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,100
Why did you keep making him
disguise as Sho-chan?

190
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,540
Think it over.

191
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,210
A bullied and school-dropout idol nerd

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,520
taking the place of
the legendary leader.

193
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,390
He's risking it all to not get caught.

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,130
Desperately pulling the team together.

195
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,060
Even taking the brunt
whenever trouble happened.

196
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,700
Do you understand

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,970
how much grit he must take?

198
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,650
Still, he didn't run away.

199
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,450
He stayed to be Sho-san's fill-in.

200
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,830
That's why...

201
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,170
I'll never give mercy to anyone
who pokes fun at Tatsuhito.

202
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,810
He is

203
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,910
my precious friend!

204
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,990
Daimon-san...

205
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,320
Seeing this, we realized something.

206
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,830
That you've saved all of us.

207
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,330
When we had dispute
with Hokuso Gurentai.

208
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,870
Now come clear! Did you do it cause you
wanted to, or was it the opposite?

209
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,700
When I had conflict
with an old friend.

210
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,740
You're a scum worse than a gangster!

211
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,370
Even when I got kidnapped by some pricks
'cause of my love life.

212
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,280
Get a fucking grip on their suffering!

213
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,380
Also when I was mistaken
for a group of fraudsters

214
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,580
and got arrested.

215
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,350
You're so wrong for this.

216
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,120
The reason we didn't realize it

217
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,460
isn't just because of
your identical face.

218
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,760
When we were in trouble,

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,730
what we thought to ourselves that
this is what Sho-san would do,

220
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,900
you did it for us.

221
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,970
Tatsuhito.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,070
No... I didn't do anything...

223
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Honestly, I think you're quick-witted
more than Sho-san.

224
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,810
The real Sho-san would just use
his fists and get it over with!

225
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,980
You're badmouthing him too much!

226
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,810
Hahahaha!

227
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,950
Don't laugh, idiot!

228
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,850
Wait.

229
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,390
Sho-san is in danger!

230
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,850
In danger?

231
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,890
Tojo of Blood Mafia
went to beat him.

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,260
Those guys just said that.

233
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,830
We gotta go!

234
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,960
Should've said that sooner!

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,030
Wait for me!

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,560
Ugh! Just leave these out!

237
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,950
Take this.

238
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,380
This battle royal is so hectic.

239
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,650
Hey, Seyama.

240
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,920
Don't pull for Sho-chan.

241
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,250
Wait until I twist his jaw.

242
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,860
Who fucking cares about your crisis!

243
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,190
Quiet!

244
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,940
Why the hell are you here, Asakawa?

245
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,140
I don't remember calling you all!

246
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,510
That Kiyoto guy asked us to
and paid us a handsome amount.

247
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,410
He told us to crush the three of you.

248
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,120
That dude has no sense of judgment.

249
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,660
Well, already saw that coming.

250
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,990
Rubbish.

251
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,930
None of you all is fucking beautiful!

252
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,800
Nothing in Kitakanto right now is beautiful!

253
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,280
Sho-san!

254
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,880
You dipshits!

255
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,610
Bringing your wimpy asses
to attack one person?!

256
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,080
Hold it mate, you got it wrong.

257
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,790
It's only the three of us
who are having a fight.

258
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,320
These idiots just arrived here.

259
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,020
Saying they'll crush the three of us.

260
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,590
Did you guys betray your own team?

261
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:25,730
Come again?

262
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,460
Talk for yourselves.

263
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,870
But we ain't coming at Sho-san!

264
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,140
Yeah! We just came to help him!

265
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,940
Then we gotta crush them altogether.

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,510
Cool. Bring it.

267
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,010
I'll be your guest.

268
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,510
Hold freaking up!

269
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,590
Sho-san, can you put an end
to this situation?

270
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,490
Huh? What do you mean?

271
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,060
I think this is probably
what Kiyoto is aiming for.

272
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,870
That is to make us betray our leader

273
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,470
and pit the three big teams
against each other,

274
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,570
weakening our fighting power.

275
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,040
He's right!

276
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,380
He told me himself.

277
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,010
They always talk about
friendship and bonds,

278
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,680
but I'll prove them how
easily broken such a thing is.

279
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,190
That is exactly his aim.

280
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,000
Fighting here means
you fall into his trap!

281
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,230
And if you do fall into his trap,

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,600
no more team or comrades for you.

283
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,770
Nobody else to hang out with either.

284
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,970
That means...

285
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,110
You're no longer a gangster!

286
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Was a fun fight,

287
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,650
but calling it quits.

288
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,960
We're leaving, Asakawa.

289
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,500
Will you forgive me, leader?

290
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,440
I actually wanted to slap you gracefully.

291
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,500
But there's someone
irked me more than you

292
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,170
so I'll let you off this time.

293
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,410
Let's go.

294
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,620
You still gonna follow Kiyoto?

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,420
Ain't no way.

296
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,390
Even I was targeted.

297
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,200
At this rate, we can't stay
as business partners.

298
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I think this failure will make
his attack even more ruthless.

299
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,840
And Grand Cross will be
his first target.

300
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,980
In fact, with money and intimidation, he can
make gangsters all over Kitakanto bow to him.

301
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,180
Ain't that looking bad?

302
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,720
Aight, I'm done here.

303
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,260
Let's go, Nishijin.

304
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,540
You guys...

305
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,980
Thanks for coming back.

306
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,850
You too, Tatsuhito.

307
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,720
Well, when I was on my way
to visit Daimon-san,

308
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,990
these guys ended up
helping me instead.

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,570
Naoko?

310
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,710
Yeah, what's up?

311
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,380
What?

312
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,580
Daimon's in danger?

313
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,320
What do you mean?

314
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,630
What a meanie.

315
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,290
I worked so hard to build
a good relationship,

316
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,130
and now you're trying
to destroy me altogether.

317
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,470
Also I didn't hear that you're connected to
the low-ranking members of Hokuso Gurentai.

318
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,440
Don't get me wrong.

319
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,380
I only brought them because
they're part of the three big teams,

320
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,080
but they turned out to be useless.

321
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,950
Hey dude.

322
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,560
Be honest, aren't you panicking?

323
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,690
Things didn't go as you planned.

324
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,420
Even after you destroyed Grand Cross
and targeting them as a bounty,

325
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,870
nobody kneeled and
vowed loyalty to you.

326
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,200
The gangsters in this town aren't
as corrupt as you think.

327
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,970
But you didn't want to admit it...

328
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,280
Fuck it! Fuck! Fuck you all!

329
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,280
Getting so cocky 
for just being a gangster.

330
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,560
Stop laying down.

331
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,290
Get up quick!

332
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Go kneel.

333
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,660
And make a vow.

334
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,370
Say that you'll be our dog
your whole life.

335
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,810
Shut the fuck up!!

336
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,910
You lowly gangsters are lesser than me!

337
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,310
Don't get so cocky!

338
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,420
Daimon.

339
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,490
Get well soon, dammit!

340
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,590
Kyoko-senpai...

341
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,660
If you're my fan, you gotta
attend our gigs!

342
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,030
Get in the handshake
and photo sessions

343
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,270
and make sure to buy
my goods, you idiot!

344
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,340
I-I-I will!

345
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Once I recovered, in a flash!

346
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:48,880
I'll buy one for collection, for display,
for traveling, and for the gigs!

347
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,750
Also, one for emergency!

348
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,280
I'll hit part-time jobs!

349
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
Good.

350
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,320
Then come hug me right here!

351
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,420
What?

352
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,830
Are you serious? Like for real?!

353
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,630
Stop complaining!

354
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,830
Come hug me till
I get tired of you!

355
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,530
Excuse me!

356
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,210
For the last...

357
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,140
Attack me with all your heart.

358
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,220
Attack you... with all my heart?

359
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,490
That's obvious.

360
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,560
Steal my lips with a kiss.

361
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,730
Kyoko-senpai!!!

362
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,580
Ah, he woke up.

363
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,650
Kyoko-senpai...

364
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:04,220
Daimon, you're awake.

365
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,720
You had no idea, dude!

366
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,560
The moment she held your hand,
you actually woke up!

367
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,660
- Oww, that hurts!
- My bad.

368
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,940
Sho-san, what is going on here?

369
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,980
Seems like things got
a bit complicated.

370
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,050
When I came to check on you...

371
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,020
A-are you his friend?!

372
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,690
This is bad! Daimon-san's pulse has stopped!

373
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,950
What?!

374
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,930
Doctor! Doctor!

375
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,700
So I called Sho right away.

376
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,300
Daimon's in danger?

377
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,730
It was completely my mistake.

378
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,570
She's a newbie so can't
check the pulse well just yet.

379
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,570
In her haste, she didn't check
the monitor or his condition.

380
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,710
So she mistakenly thought he had died.

381
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,440
Come on, doc!

382
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,280
You can be clumsy too.

383
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,980
When Naoko-san called, we
were together with Tatsuhito.

384
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,350
After hearing the news,
he suddenly started running.

385
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,890
He came to our agency.

386
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,930
Tacchan!? What's wrong?

387
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm begging you!

388
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,800
Please come with me
to the hospital now!

389
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,000
Hospital?

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,300
The life of my friend, who is a big fan
of Kyoko-senpai, is in danger!

391
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,210
Only Kyoko-senpai can help him!

392
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,780
So they went all the way
to show up in costume.

393
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,510
You're kidding me.

394
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,570
Kyoko-san was so fired up

395
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,980
so we came dressed up too joining her.

396
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,380
Really sorry for causing you
so much trouble.

397
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,320
I sometimes stream your videos!

398
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:46,760
Then come our gigs!

399
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,620
That'd be my pleasure!

400
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,460
Yeah!

401
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,160
With all of Grand Cross members!

402
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,430
Kyoko-senpai, thank you for
doing all of this for me.

403
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,170
I can't ignore the fans
who are facing setbacks.

404
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,740
To give energy to our fans.

405
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,480
That's the kind of idol
I want to be.

406
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,850
Wait, where's Tatsuhito?

407
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,390
He's sleeping in another room.

408
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,120
He was running so much that
he got heat stroke and collapsed.

409
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,630
Yes.

410
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,000
Begin the all-out attack
on Grand Cross tomorrow.

411
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,270
I no longer need videos
of them kneeling.

412
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,900
Just crush them all at once.

413
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,510
Even better, kill them to death.

414
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,280
Yeah. No problem.

415
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,310
If they're arrested, they'll be
provided with a lawyer

416
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,850
and everything will be
handled afterwards.

417
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,490
Whatever happens,
I'll solve it with money.

418
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,890
Yeah.

419
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,960
Gather at the usual place at 5 pm.

420
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,610
I'll crush them all.

421
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,170
Hi, Tacchan.

422
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,500
Have a seat.

423
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,000
Are you okay now?

424
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,510
Why are you here?

425
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,680
I was called here by Sho-san.

426
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,350
I know.

427
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,110
I came to discuss
about Kiyoto with him.

428
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,180
Then he called you over.

429
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,150
After that, he fell asleep
'cause of that illness.

430
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,920
Discuss?

431
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,690
After you just had a fight today?

432
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,530
That's what fight among gangsters is like.

433
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,230
I've also apologized properly
to Daimon-chin.

434
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,900
The bigger question is
why he called you.

435
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,670
That stupid grandson of mine

436
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,800
might start babbling on crazy plans again

437
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,210
so if you don't want to,
you should tell him clearly.

438
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,110
Listen, I had no idea that
you're someone else

439
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,920
but you look just
exactly like Sho-chan.

440
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,050
I'm sorry for hiding it all this while.

441
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,520
That's no biggie.

442
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,790
In fact, this girl had it too in the past.

443
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,420
She was a bullied idol nerd
in her teenager days,

444
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,290
but she hid it and joined a ladies team.

445
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,390
Come on!

446
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,360
Don't expose me like that, Senpai!

447
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,200
Call me Mama, not Senpai.

448
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,200
Another surprising past.

449
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,800
Well, many things sure happen

450
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,410
but that's what makes life fun
in its own way.

451
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,180
The important thing is, Tatsuhito.

452
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,280
For your own sake,

453
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:04,390
don't ever run away
when you shouldn't.

454
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,060
I'll remember that.

455
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,030
Oh naw, this started to
sound like a lecture!

456
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,770
'Cause you were my grandson for a while.

457
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,740
Ah... right.

458
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,810
You just got up, huh?

459
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,880
Tatsuhito, let's take a walk outside.

460
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,120
Sure thing.

461
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,190
Have you heard from Tojo?

462
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,560
Kiyoto is preparing for an all-out attack.

463
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,500
No...

464
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,470
Seems like he completely despises
the gangsters in this town.

465
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,880
Be honest.

466
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,310
What do you think?

467
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,920
Do you still hate gangsters?

468
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,220
I did.

469
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,660
All this while.

470
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,400
But now...

471
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,300
Because I've met you, Daimon-san

472
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,140
and everyone in Grand Cross...

473
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,210
I don't anymore...

474
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,780
You think so?

475
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,910
Then...

476
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,150
Maybe I should leave everything to you.

477
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,020
Leave what?

478
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,730
The fate of Kitakanto.

479
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,870
Aya-chan.

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,440
Can we meet right now?

481
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,510
Hey!

482
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,450
Don't make me trespass on
the school grounds at night.

483
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I'm no longer a gangster,
I'm an idol now.

484
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,960
Sorry.

485
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,090
For calling you this late.

486
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,160
Brings back memories.

487
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,840
Our classroom was at the far end
of the second floor.

488
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:15,210
After you saved me from the bullies,

489
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,010
I would often look at you

490
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:24,220
playing in the schoolyard, while I was
reading a book in the classroom.

491
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:31,960
You were so lively and surrounded
by friends, it's so dazzling to me.

492
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,930
That's why I came here.

493
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,070
I want to remember who I was
before I turned weak.

494
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,680
Because I'm having a fight tomorrow.

495
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,430
If this happened yesterday
or days before,

496
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,930
I would've been freaked out,

497
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,360
avoided conflicts like that,

498
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,340
and said that I can't do it
then I'd run away.

499
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,340
But...

500
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,210
I don't wanna run away anymore.

501
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,450
Because I wanna get it together.

502
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:33,590
Though I know it's scary.

503
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,930
I want to hear you say it.

504
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,900
The words that ignite my willpower

505
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,540
and give me courage.

506
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,850
In this place.

507
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,920
Get out of your pathetic life!

508
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,380
Hold up.

509
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,390
What is going on?

510
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,100
The number you have dialed
is out of reach...

511
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,070
The number you have dialed...

512
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,470
Shit!!

513
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,940
What are they trying to do?

514
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,890
Everyone has come to their senses.

515
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,990
Yamada Tatsuhito?

516
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,370
You can no longer make

517
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:30,240
gangsters in Kitakanto bow to you.

518
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,480
What do you mean?

519
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,750
Did you... just do something?

520
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,920
I've told everyone in Grand Cross,
Blood Mafia, and Hokuso Gurentai.

521
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,060
That even if you buy them
with money or intimidation,

522
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,990
they'll never know when you'll betray them.

523
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,100
You actually targeted
Tojo-san too, didn't you?

524
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,310
That's why they said NO
to your way of doing things.

525
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,950
I see now.

526
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,720
But I don't understand.

527
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,950
Then why did you come here alone?

528
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:23,430
It'd be a different story if Ijuin Sho
brought along Grand Cross members.

529
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:30,130
Because Sho-san and
the Grand Cross guys

530
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,130
believed in me.

531
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,270
That I'm going to defeat you.

532
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,240
That it has to be me!

533
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,950
You're just like who I had been.

534
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,190
You hated gangsters

535
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,930
and wanted to destroy
their friendship and bonds.

536
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:07,040
You tried to change this town
with the power of money.

537
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,310
Maybe... it's because

538
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,440
you've always been alone like me.

539
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,820
Yeah.

540
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,230
This is my revenge.

541
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,630
I've gone through unpleasant
memories with gangsters.

542
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,040
Even thought about committing
suicide many times.

543
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,270
After my parents abandoned me

544
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,640
and kicked me out of the house,

545
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,950
I bought some virtual currency with my
own money and happened to hit the jackpot.

546
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,350
That's when I made a decision.

547
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,450
That I'll use this money

548
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,690
to make those gangsters realize
how worthless they are.

549
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,300
Not every gangster is like that!

550
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,610
Cut the crap!

551
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,640
You just happened to get comrades

552
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,910
for disguising as a gangster
whose face is identical to yours.

553
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,880
Otherwise,

554
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,950
nobody would ever pay
attention to someone like you!

555
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,220
You're just a bullied idol nerd!

556
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,860
We've gone through the same pain!

557
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,660
You piece of shit!!

558
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,160
Yeah.

559
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,800
But I had an encounter.

560
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,440
And I got to know
from that encounter!

561
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:28,180
That not all gangsters are bad people!

562
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:35,550
Besides, it wasn't gangsters
that I actually hated!

563
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,320
Shut your mouth!

564
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,160
A gangster who intimidated me once said.

565
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,870
There are only two types
of men in this world!

566
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,010
A man standing above others

567
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,780
and a man trampled under others.

568
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,880
Quiet!

569
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,890
When I was groveling
and being intimidated

570
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,090
I couldn't do anything
for myself.

571
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,530
That's what I hated
the most about myself!

572
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,740
Aren't we just the same?

573
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,110
That's why I...

574
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,800
How could you end up being
one who intimidates others!!

575
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,770
You're a moron!

576
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,410
A freaking moron!

577
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,940
Using money to take revenge against
all the unpleasant things done to you.

578
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,080
Does that mean anything?

579
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,050
Doing all of that by yourself

580
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,320
will only give you loneliness.

581
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,950
What are you doing that for?

582
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,630
If we're the same then
you could've changed too!

583
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,190
But you didn't try to.

584
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:28,360
You just had to try!!

585
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,900
Be fucking for real!

586
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,000
You're already rich, don't freaking
waste your time and money!

587
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,640
Why spending it for petty things when you
could use it to get your shit together!

588
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,510
You're a big ass moron!

589
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,480
Kiyoto!!

590
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,460
GET OUT OF YOUR PATHETIC LIFE!

591
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,670
Then...

592
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,100
What should I do?

593
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,050
For now.

594
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,650
Why don't you find
an idol you can support?

595
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,180
Listen, guys!

596
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,780
Today is my birthday!

597
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,850
Keep your spirits up till the end!

598
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,710
Soon afterwards, Kiyoto
was arrested by the police.

599
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,180
Assault, bodily harm, soliciting to murder,

600
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,520
illegal drug trafficking
and fraud among others.

601
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,160
He's charged with a ton of crimes.

602
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,360
Apparently Tojo-san and Blood Mafia

603
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,260
bowed to him in order
to get the evidences.

604
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
I can't accept this.

605
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:52,140
The prick who messed with this town
ended up being arrested by the police.

606
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,840
Tacchan did a great job to
beat him in one-on-one fight.

607
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,780
Fighting with fellow gangsters
is more exciting anyway.

608
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,990
So beautiful! Ain't it?

609
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,490
Yikes!

610
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,360
Don't say it out of your filthy mouth!

611
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,630
Save your complaints
and let's get into it.

612
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,200
Honestly,

613
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,600
I don't think the one-on-one fight
was actually needed.

614
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,940
But apparently that's what
saved Grand Cross name.

615
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,950
So you're not retiring yet.

616
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,780
Don't worry.

617
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,510
I won't ride motorcycle anymore.

618
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:39,750
Well, I refrained from going 'cause
I don't wanna fall asleep midway.

619
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,190
But you should've attended the gig!

620
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,060
Hell nah.

621
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,660
I don't need to celebrate the birthday
of someone who quit my team.

622
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,660
Besides...

623
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,070
Nobody hinders us today.

624
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,910
Sho!

625
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,590
Watch out.

626
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,160
That's foul!

627
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,700
Are you pretending to fall asleep?

628
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,700
Don't kiss me when I'm asleep!

629
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,070
Why not?

630
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,270
Come here.

631
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,410
Hey guys, up for some karaoke battle?

632
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,710
They seem to be having
a blast over at the gig.

633
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,310
We're on standby.

634
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,700
But anyway...

635
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,440
I'm having a blast so much
that nothing else matters anymore!

636
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,280
Aya-nee from Machisuke
is the best idol that ever exists.

637
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,980
And so is

638
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,460
my current life where I can
have fun with everyone!

639
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:29,800
THE BEGINNING OF A NEW LIFE
YOUR WAY OF LIFE IS NOT PATHETIC!!

640
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:58,820
