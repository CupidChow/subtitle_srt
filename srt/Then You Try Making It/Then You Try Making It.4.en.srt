1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,910
Hey, was that Ayumelo's...

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,990
Yes. He delivers alcohol here.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,300
Oh, I had no idea.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,270
You know our regulars Sumi-chan
and Sekita-san? He's also their ex.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,410
He's exes with two people here?

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,430
He isn't anyone suspicious, right?

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,690
Two ex-girlfriends from the same bar
sounds suspicious to me.

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,710
I guess. It might just be a coincidence, though.

9
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,940
"A coincidence"? I hope so...

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,850
This is so strong.

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,580
Excuse me.

12
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,730
Could I hear more about that, in detail?

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,670
Is it true that Ayumi is dating a womanizer?

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,540
- What?
- And you are?

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,140
Are you okay, Katsuo?

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,000
"Katsuo"? Oh!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,950
- Are you Ayumelo's...
- Yes.

18
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,870
So please, tell me more about this womanizer.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,460
He's not exactly a womanizer,
but a few of his exes are regulars here.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,210
Several exes?

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,810
No, just a few.

22
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,550
Unbelievable... Several?

23
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,450
Just a few, Sir.

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,150
Sekita-san, Sumi-chan,
could you come here for a second?

25
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,280
What's up?

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,830
This man wants to know more about Minato-kun.

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,680
What? "About Minato"?

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,550
These girls are both Minato-kun's exes.

29
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,830
Really?

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,480
So what sort of guy is Minato-kun?

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,350
How should I describe him...

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,100
He's kind and a good guy, but...

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,360
- "But"? But what?
- What can I say?

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,210
He's quick to start dating
and quick to break up, too.

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,190
What?

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,970
Look. That girl is another of his exes.

37
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,930
That girl is, too.
They didn't even last a month, did they?

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,620
No, she said they lasted a week.

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,070
What?

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,190
In other words, he's...

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,720
Let me guess... a mass consumption lover boy?

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,110
- Exactly!
- Is he really like that?

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,370
"Mass..."

44
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,260
"consumption..."

45
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,910
"lover boy"?

46
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,040
Seriously?

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,880
Right, trash day.

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,760
[Proper ways to dispose of trash]

49
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,860
"Mass consumption"...
[Mass consumption destroys our future!]

50
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,600
I have a boyfriend now.

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,180
And I really, truly love him.

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,970
This is quite risky, Ayumi.

53
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,340
- I'm heading out now.
- Sure.

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,570
Sorry to make you stay over
when you have an early day today.

55
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,190
It's fine.

56
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,640
I wanted to stay with you.

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,050
I'm happy to hear that.

58
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,450
I wish we could spend more time together.

59
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,880
Don't you wish we could spend more time together?

60
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:01,050
You have early shifts, while I work late,
so we hardly get to see each other.

61
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,320
I was just thinking the same thing.

62
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,400
Say, Ayu-chan.

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
So long as you don't mind...

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,060
Is he going to suggest living together?

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,320
You can visit whenever, okay?

66
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,200
Okay.

67
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,030
Eureka! I just had a great idea.

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,010
What?

69
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,980
It'll increase the amount of time
we can spend together.

70
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,030
Let me hear it.

71
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,910
It must be hard to visit here all the time, right?

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,040
- Yes.
- So we should...

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,560
- Move in together?
- play this app together!

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,920
See? We can poke our pet seals even when apart.
[Squishy-Seal Sim]

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,130
Sounds fun.

76
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,980
Regarding the ongoing next-generation
toilet development project,

77
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,870
we got 98% user satisfaction in user testing.

78
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,460
It also received high praise at the exhibition,

79
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,880
and many corporations
have already reached out to us.

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,290
I'd say our prototype is about perfect.

81
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,350
Wow, great!

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,080
- Ebihara-kun.
- Yes, Sir?

83
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,610
What are your thoughts on sustainability?

84
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,750
From now on, we must take into account
the issue of mass production.

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,150
"Mass production."

86
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,700
I have a boyfriend now.

87
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:24,730
A key issue is how to
reduce mass consumption of water.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,590
"Mass consumption"...

89
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,300
Quick to start dating and quick to break up, too.

90
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,370
Ayumi is being duped. I know it.

91
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,180
She would never fall for such a player.

92
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,610
Ayumi doesn't deserve to be "consumed"

93
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,010
by men who indulge in such flings!

94
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,390
- Ebihara-kun?
- Absolutely not!

95
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,820
I am against mass consumption
with every fiber of my being.

96
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,480
Right, I agree wholeheartedly.

97
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,210
[Could we talk?]

98
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,740
Katsuo-san, you wouldn't understand.

99
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,010
Nor will I hope you'll attempt to.

100
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,200
Mass production, mass consumption...

101
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,990
He's agonizing over her.

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,550
He sure is.

103
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,740
What can I do?

104
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,310
Ebihara's a role model.

105
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,440
- Oh?
- What?

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,020
Who knew he was so passionate
about sustainability.

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,530
- Well...
- Darn it!

108
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,480
I won't let you tackle this issue alone.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,990
Let's fight for what's right together!

110
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,660
We got this!

111
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,680
Ebihara-san, are you all right?

112
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,770
You certainly look troubled.

113
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,930
Listen.

114
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,070
Ayumi... may be in danger.

115
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,210
What?

116
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,250
I see your point. Having several exes at one bar

117
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,520
- does seem a bit suspicious.
- Right?

118
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,740
Maybe he's just a nice guy who gets women,

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,830
unlike you, Senpai.

120
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,830
I understand why you'd worry, though.

121
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:45,560
Listen, the Ayumi I know
would never fall for a guy like that.

122
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,260
She's a kind, sweet girl.

123
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,260
She's bright, cute, and has standards.

124
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,420
- She has a cute smile, a cute demeanor, and—
- Okay, got it—

125
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,770
And she's adorable with her fair skin.

126
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,200
However, Ebihara-san, maybe she wasn't her true self

127
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,050
when she was in a relationship with you.

128
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,820
When I was in a relationship with you,

129
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,880
I turned a blind eye to my own feelings.

130
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,160
That's impossible, probably.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,690
Like I said, it's best to date casually
without the pressure of commitment.

132
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,960
That way, you won't fixate
on emotions or obsessions.

133
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,710
Hey, listen.

134
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,520
Doesn't that become lonely?

135
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,610
Pardon?

136
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,500
I said, "Doesn't that make you lonely?"

137
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,070
- Not at all.
- Really now.

138
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,120
But dealing with his ex-girlfriend

139
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,090
can be complicated, right?

140
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,610
Did you call her my ex?

141
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,090
Oh, come on, at least accept that as a fact.

142
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,300
In any case, there's nothing you can do.
You're a stranger to her now.

143
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,100
She is your ex, anyway.

144
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,300
- Then if you'll excuse me.
- What?

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,210
Am I really only a stranger now?

146
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,630
You seem to be in a good mood, Yamagishi-san.
[Keep things organized]

147
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,160
Oh, well...

148
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Maybe I am.

149
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,330
Things must be going well
with that high-spec boyfriend of yours.

150
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,800
Oh, him? We broke up.

151
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,360
- What?
- It was recent, though.

152
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,620
- You two broke up?
- Yes.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,250
- What an absolute waste!
- Sorry?

154
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,230
I mean, you two dated since college, right?

155
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,610
Not to mention he was loyal,
handsome, had a great-paying job,

156
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,920
was set for success,
the third son from a good family.

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,740
Did I tell you that much?

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,540
Half of that is my guess.

159
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,610
But you broke up with a man of his caliber?

160
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,200
I certainly wouldn't be humming a jaunty tune.

161
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I wouldn't even be breathing through my nose.

162
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,930
I found something I wanted to prioritize
over mere "conditions."

163
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,730
So that's the kind of person
you are, Yamagishi-san.

164
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,460
What do you mean by "that kind of person"?

165
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,540
The type who dares to go down dangerous paths.

166
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,630
[Danger ahead!]

167
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,020
Mari, follow me.

168
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,930
This way.

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,280
A cliff...

170
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,210
I guess it's a dead end.

171
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,790
Mari! That man is no good for you.

172
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,800
He's dangerous. Come back this way!

173
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,370
Don't come any closer!

174
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,480
You're a stranger to me now!

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,070
Why?

176
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,380
Mari, I... I always...

177
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,700
Teruo, please give up on her!

178
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,010

Want to dance a bit more, Ayu-chan?

356
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,040
How about we eat dinner together at home?

357
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,530
Hey, it's Minato.

358
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,760
- Minato!
- Sumi-chan! Ko-chan!

359
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,130
- Long time no see.
- Hey there.

360
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,230
You know, just the other day
we were talking about you.

361
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,470
Yes, a person practically
interrogated us about you.

362
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,560
- What?
- Yes, they were super interested in you.

363
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,630
- Say, why don't you join us for a drink?
- Sounds good.

364
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,610
Oh, right. Want to join us, Ayu-chan?

365
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,470
Yes, drink with us!

366
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,150
- I'll tell you all about Minato's past.
- Girl, stop that!

367
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,720
Don't say silly things.

368
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,400
Actually, I think I'll head home.

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,390
- Already?
- Yes.

370
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,200
- Okay. Take care on your way back then.
- Sure.

371
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,360
Minato-san.

372
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,700
Yes?

373
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll wait for you back at home, okay?

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Okay.

375
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,970
Could I get a check, please?

376
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,710
- It's fine, drinks are on me tonight.
- You sure?

377
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,330
Of course.

378
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,170
They're living together.

379
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,120
They're already living together.

380
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,680
I've never seen Ayumi
enjoy herself like that before.

381
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,310

Oh, I messed up. This is bad. I overslept.

384
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,310
I won't make it to first period.

385
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,780
Hey.

386
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,690
You start class at second period, right?

387
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,630
How about we skip class today?

388
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,040
I suppose we have enough credits to make do.

389
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,630
That smells great.

390
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,060
It's almost done.

391
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,800
What're you cooking?

392
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,240
It's a surprise.

393
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,550
- Ta-da.
- I feel like I'm eating at a restaurant.

394
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,100
- Wow!
- Is it that impressive?

395
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,930
Absolutely. This looks amazing.

396
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,070

- Wait a second.

Hold on.

401
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,720
I have to take a picture.

402
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,740
This isn't anything photo-worthy.

403
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,390
Of course it is. It's your cooking.

404
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,920
You're overreacting.

405
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,520
You have many more
homemade meals to come, you know?

406
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,450
There.

407
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,840
- Thanks for the meal.
- Of course.

408
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,240
Wow, that's delicious!

409
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,440
This is fantastic.

410
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,940

411
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,530
Should we get drinking?

412

- Drink up!
- Let's drink this place dry!

I'm down!

414
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,630
No. It doesn't bother me at all.

Hey, Minamikawa.

00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,970
And I thought I'd be alone.

459
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,400
So did I.

460
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,630
Why did you come today?

461
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,580
The chief told me to review our plans
for sustainability.

462
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,850
I must rewrite everything from the ground up.

463
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,070
Sounds like tough work.

464
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,340
This is all your fault, Ebihara-san!

465
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,390
Mine?

466
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,800
Yes, you sparked the chief's motivation.

467
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,350
- I did?
- Yes.

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,540
It's easier to concentrate
in the office, isn't it?

469
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,360
Yes.

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,880

471
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,670
Being here keeps my mind off unnecessary things.

472
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,510
Do you end up thinking about Ayumi-san
when you're at home?

473
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,780
Something like that.

474
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,020
Ebihara-san, if you were duct tape,
you'd be the really sticky type,

475
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,720
like the kind you can't ever remove.

476
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,650
And would you be the removable, reusable kind?

477
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,990
That's right. I could be reused
as many times as needed.

478
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,560
To be fair, strong tape is useful.

479
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:18,520
Sir, do you recall asking me
if I'd feel lonely without fixations?

480
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,280
Did I say that?

481
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,840
You did.

482
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,950
Did I?

483
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,230
You did, and it irritated me.

484
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,550
What?

485
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:33,840

What?

489
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,340
So we can't meet anymore.

490
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,890
I thought pragmatic relationships
were the way to go.

491
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:03,540
But I'm not sure if the way I'm doing things
is truly making me happy.

492
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,560
I also made shallow assumptions.

493
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,500
Dating many people doesn't mean

494
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,210
someone is making light of a relationship, right?

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,650
What about you, Ebihara-san? Almost done?

498
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,600
Yes, just about.

499
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,010
Then shall we grab a drink together?

500
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,220
You're inviting me out to grab a drink.

501
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,100
What's so wrong about that?

502
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,940
Nothing. I'm just happy.

503
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,580
It's nice to be invited out by a junior.

504
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,830
Maybe you've become a senpai worth inviting out.

505
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,640
You think so?

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,420

00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,540
Oh, all right.

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,900
Oh, actually, I have a place I want to go,
if you'll join me.

509
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,310
Why are we going to get some tequila?

510
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,740
Ayumi was drinking it.

511
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,910
- Still hung up on her?
- No, I'm trying to move on.

512
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:30,740
But she really enjoyed herself while drinking the stuff.

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,820
"Ayu-chan"?

532
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,040
Oh, well, he's not exactly a friend, rather...

533
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,060
Could you be her ex?

534
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,900
- Yes, I'm her ex.
- Now, now...

535
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,080
It's nice to meet you. My name is Minato.

536
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm Katsuo.

537
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,140
Here, my treat.
[Tequila]

538
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,170
- What, really?
- No, I'll pay.

539
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,760
- Sir, why?
- I insist.

540
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,500
Let's just accept his offer, Senpai.

541
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,730
This one is quite strong,
so don't overexert yourselves.

542
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,120
Only sip it if you feel able to.

543
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,570
If I feel "able to"?

544
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,400
This guy's testing me.

545
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,300
Don't force yourself to down the shot;
I have weaker tequila's as well.

546
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,260
- I can down this shot, easily.
- Okay.

547
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,880
Here you go.

548
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,670
- Thank you.
- Thanks, and cheers!

549
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,630
- That's good!
- Right?

550
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,740
It's rich. And what a complex scent.

551
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,420
I always assumed
tequila was just a "frivolous drink,"

552
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,300
but it's more than that.

553
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,770
Now, where have I heard that before?

554
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,900
Here we go!

555
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,240
So...

556
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,920
Minato-kun.

557
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,000
You and Ayumi are...

558
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,220
No, this is nothing for me to ask.

559
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,260
We're dating each other.

560
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,020
She recently moved into my place too.

561
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,910
I love Ayu-chan a lot.

562
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,590
- You hit where it hurts.
- What?

563
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,230
But I spoke only the truth.

564
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,610
- Sorry.
- That's no better.

565
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,800
- Really?
- No, I'm fine.

566
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,010
It's the truth, after all.

567
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

568
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,480
- This is good.
- It really is.

569
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,700
Don't drink too much, Sir.

570
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,380
Me? I'm totally fine.

571
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,850
You should join us, Minato-san.

572
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,580
Sorry, I still have deliveries to make later.

573
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,160
- I see.
- Here you go.

574
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,280
I know this is easy to drink,
but it is quite strong. Don't overdo it.

575
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,730
This much is nothing.

576
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,600
Alcohol content isn't anything I worry about.

577
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,510
- Thank you, come again!
- It's really good.

578
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,920
- This tequila is seriously good.
- Please, enjoy yourselves.

579
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,210
Thank you.

580
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,800
If I'm being honest,
I'm not really a fan of this stuff.

581
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,730
But you're practically downing the bottle.

582
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,840
Would you like to share a snack?

583
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,160
It's poor weather for grabbing food, so...

584
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,830
- That looks delicious!
- It's a tortilla.

585
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,840
- "A tortilla"?
- Wow...

586
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,780
- Let me try a bite.
- Go ahead.

587
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,410
- And for you.
- Thank you.

588
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,700
That's delicious.

589
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,770
I didn't realize you could cook, Minato-san.

590
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,140
I can only whip up simple dishes.

591
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,780
Ayu-chan taught me this one.

592
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,710
Must you keep hitting him where it hurts?

593
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,550
That too?

594
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,530
Sorry.

595
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,190
I'm fine. You're speaking only the truth.

596
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,740
This tortilla tastes better with company though,

597
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,420
so I'm glad to have you both around.

598
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,340
It really is delicious.

599
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,960
All right!

600
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,200
Sir, aren't you drinking a bit too much?

601
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,690
I'm just getting started!

602
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,100
- Ready?
- Oh, that's good!

603
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,560
I wonder if Ayumi always preferred
guys like him instead.

604
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,760
A cute guy,

605
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,030
the exact opposite of myself.

606
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,220
You're cute, Katsuo-san.

607
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,580
- What? How?
- Oh?

608
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,400
It's cute how you're doing your best
to drink this tequila.

609
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,130
You've stabbed so deep,
you may have pierced him completely.

610
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,920
No, I didn't stab him.

611
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,470
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

612
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,450
We're looking for a wine to give as a gift.

613
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,760
- Wine, is it?
- Yes.

614
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,170
- We keep our wine over here.
- Okay.

615
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,350
- Sorry, may I pass behind you?
- Sure.

616
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,490
- Right this way.
- Sure.

617
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,040
How about a bottle like this?

618
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,530
- I like the label. It's cute.
- Right?

619
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,770
- Isn't it?
- Yes, it's cute!

620
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:45,960
That's what makes this bottle a great gift.

621
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,320
Maybe, right now...

622
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:57,920
Ayumi... is at her happiest.

623
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,270
I have another suggestion right over here.

624
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,350
Are you holding up, Sir?

625
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,330
All your selections were wonderful.

626
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,800
- We'll come get them all in the future.
- No problem.

627
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,370
Senpai? Are you crying?

628
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,980
- No.
- Are you all right?

629
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,130
See? You stabbed right through him.

630
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,950
- I really didn't mean to.
- No, I am not crying.

631
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,730
- Minato-kun.
- Yes.

632
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,170
Minato-kun.

633
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,730
Yes.

634
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,500
I leave Ayumi...

635
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,950
in your caring hands.

636
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,870
And I want you to really savor Ayumi's cooking.

637
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,470
Her cooking is delicious,
so I want you to savor it well.

638
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,670
- I will.
- And get plant-based dish soap, all right?

639
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,650
She says the cheap stuff works,
but it makes her hands dry.

640
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,720
And always buy two-ply toilet paper.

641
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,530
Ayumi will say one-ply is fine,
but she prefers two-ply.

642
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,880
- Noted.
- And get her good ice cream from time to time,

643
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,940
not the lactose-free ice cream
or ice milk. Ice "cream."

644
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,280
Okay.

645
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,280
And one last thing.

646
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,260
I want you to do what I couldn't for Ayumi.

647
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,210
What I never did for her.

648
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,100
What I never thought to do for her.

649
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,460
Please do many of those things for her.

650
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,710
I leave Ayumi to you.

651
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,220
Katsuo-san.

652
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,010
She'll be fine.

653
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,350
Ayu-chan doesn't need to be left
in someone else's hands.

654
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,650
She's a strong individual...

655
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,570
stronger than either of us.

656
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,400
You're absolutely right.

657
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,530
Senpai.

658
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,000
- Cheers.
- Hey.

659
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,580
You're not trying to console me, are you?

660
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,120
We're just exchanging glasses, that's all.

661
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,990
I don't think so, but if you insist.

662
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:04,310

About Ayumi-san, I mean.

680
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,810
I thought being obsessed
with someone was lame, but...

681
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,930
I think it just proves
how serious you were about them.

682
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,980

685
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,750
You're so stupidly devoted
to someone. It's admirable.

Hey, don't call me stupid.

00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:36,670
I just happened... to meet Minato-kun,

706
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,650
and we were drinking together.

707
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,250
Sorry, that's overstepping, right?

708
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,730
But I promise it really was a coincidence.

709
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,630
Where is Minato-san now?

710
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,140
Now? He left earlier to make some deliveries.

711
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,110
"Deliveries"?

712
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,750
I see.

713
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,150
So that really was Minato-san.

714
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,650
I thought I was mistaken.

715
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,080
Ayumi?

716
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,990
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.

717
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,790
What should I do? Maybe I should wait here?

718
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,650
Do you have the keys?

719
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,900
- Yes.
- Actually, never mind.

720
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,880
He'd be weirded out to see me waiting here, right?

721
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,500
- I'm leaving.
- Ayumi.

722
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,140
I'll wait for him at home.

723
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,890
This doesn't bother me.

724
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,080
It doesn't bother me at all.

725
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,040
Gosh.

726
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,100
Ayumi?

727
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,340
Ayumi.

728
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,640
What?

729
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,230
Are you okay?

730
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,690
Yes, I'm fine.

731
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:10,660
Even though I wouldn't know when to return to,

732
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,780
I'd still go back in time.

733
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,790
I'd go to see Ayumi all over again.

734
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:19,280
[Preview]

735
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,590
Not enough color.
[Katsuo's older brother makes an appearance?]

736
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:21,580
This is my older brother.
[Katsuo's older brother makes an appearance?]

737
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,930
That's hot!

738
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,340
Katsuo-san cried his eyes out?

739
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,020
Oh, Katsuo-san!
[The fossil man is faced with a crisis!]

740
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,240
What a coincidence.
[The fossil man is faced with a crisis!]

741
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,340
Minato-san, I don't want you to go.
