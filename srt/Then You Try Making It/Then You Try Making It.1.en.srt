Good man. Of course, you should do so.

180
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,530
"Responsibility"? How old-school.

181
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,290
Isn't that normally how it goes?

182
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,940
Being responsible is the norm for Ebihara-kun.
A good man indeed.

183
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,960
But marriage?

184
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,190
You love the chikuzenni
your girlfriend makes, don't you?

185
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,630
It's seriously the best.

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,650
I do the cooking at home.

187
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,930
But it's such a hassle
that I've never made it.

188
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,860
What, doesn't your girlfriend cook for you?

189
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,140
- I just enjoy cooking for us.
- Sure.

190
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,410
I feel Ebihara-san would propose
at a restaurant with a nice night view.

191
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,310
That's the plan,

192
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,610
but I it's hard to get a reservation.
I'll give her a ring on our anniversary, though.

193
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,550
I feel you can propose wherever
as long as your heart's in it.

194
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,270
That won't do. Ebihara-kun and his girlfriend

195
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,950
were named the perfect couple of their university.

196
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,890
A proposal under the kotatsu* at home is lame.
(*Heated table)

197
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,120
Exactly. A kotatsu
wouldn't match our home's interior.

198
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,850
Well said, Mr. Perfect Couple!

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,360
- I'm home.
- Welcome home.

200
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,640
That's right. We must be perfect.

- You never know.
- No, I do.

234
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,450
I know you won't understand.

235
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,040
Right, I don't understand.

236
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,400
- Exactly.
- No, I mean—

237
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,280
Katsuo-san, you wouldn't understand.

238
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,820
Nor will I hope you'll attempt to.

239

Not anymore.

240
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,650
I've been thinking about this recently, and...

241
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,240
I want to break up.

244
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,410
I thought my life was perfect,

245
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,440
until everything suddenly came crashing down.

249
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,030

252
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,470
I'm fine, perfectly fine.

253
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,950
Is it just me, or do you look slim?

254
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,010
I'm shaping up for my suit.
You know, for the wedding.

255
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,680
Eatery foods are flavored too strongly.

256
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,040
But convenience store meals get boring quickly.

257
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,350
Ayumi's cooking was always perfect.

258
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,300
This is delicious.

259
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,530
However, what became evident
through our interview was

260
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,190
male loneliness in the unmarried man.

261
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,870
According to my survey, 60% of unmarried men

262
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,450
do not have a friend they can confide in.

263
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,520
Some have even considered freezing their sperm

264
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,130
out of fear for their future.
[Sperm freezing]

265
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,920
Other worries that plague these men

266
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,810
include caring for their parents,
relying on takeout,

267
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,650
leaving behind offspring,
and preparing their own funeral.

268
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,700
All are indeed difficult issues.

269
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,660
Are you free tonight?

270
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,290
Why ask?

271
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,110
We're down a dude for our mixer.

272
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,320
You wouldn't be available to join, right?

273

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,800
You look like you'd be popular, Katsuo-san.

277
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,590
No, not at all.

278
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,270
Actually, I was too popular for my own good.

279
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,900
You're lying.

280
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,380
So what's your ideal type?

281
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,170
I like a girl who can make a great chikuzenni.

282
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,720
- "Chikuzenni"...
- Yes.

283
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,900
Do you have a dish
you're particularly good at making?

284
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,600
Me? Curry, I guess.

285
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,140
- You mix spices?
- I use store-bought roux.

286
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,240
Then you're just chopping vegetables.

287
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,160
No one calls that cooking.

288
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,360
You scared me for a second there.

289
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,140
Excuse me, here is your Caesar salad.

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,370

- Yes, thank you.

- "Tomorrow"?
- Tomorrow...

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,340
I am.

296
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,850
- Me, too!
- Oh...

297
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,820
- Then could I get your messenger ID?
- Sure.

298
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,300
- Awesome.
- Okay, okay.

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,790
- Got it.
- Could I get yours, too?

301
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,340
There, perfect.

302
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,960
- What?
- Anyone want round two of drinks?

- Sure.
- Yes, sounds great.

There's a karaoke place nearby.

- Yes.

- We both love to sing.
- Awesome!

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,990
- Why?
- Let's go to an "all you can drink."

- Sounds good.
- I can still drink the night away.

00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,440
- So can I.
- Great.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,940
- You in?
- Yes, sounds exciting!

312
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,260
Then I'll book a room for us.

313
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,720
- Let's do that.
- I'm having so much fun today!

314
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,140
- How about bowling?
- Sounds good.

315
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,210
- See you all!
- Have fun!

316
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,810
- See you.
- Take care!

317
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,440
- Later, Katsuo-chan.
- Yes, have fun.

318
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,630
All right.

319
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,950
Weren't those two hitting it off?

320
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,400
- Yes.
- I thought so, too.

321
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,470
Are you alone, Onii-san (young man)?
How about drinking with us?

322
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,480
- Let's go!
- Me?

323
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,780
Come on!

324
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,440
- Then you like to cook?
- Yes, mostly ethnic foods though.

325
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,890
But the standard of home-cooking is Japanese food.

326
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,500
You really should learn how to make
chikuzenni, I'm telling you!

327
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,580
"Chikuzenni"? Gosh, he's so funny.

328
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,530
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

329
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,330
Dead serious.

330
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,770
- Yikes, a big red flag.
- Let's leave.

331
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,850
See you, Onii-san.

332
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,820
Chikuzenni? Is he for real?

333
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,580
Why?

334
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,380
Is Chikuzenni a euphemism for something bad?

335
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,590
Your favorite food is chikuzenni?

336
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,990
It makes you sound mature and cool.

337
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,110
You're so cool. I like you.

338
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,810
Katsuo-kun, you're so manly.

339
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,480
I think you'll take the lead
in this relationship.

340
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,580
Growing up, I'd always been popular with women.

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,650
Did something in the world change
while I was in a relationship with Ayumi?

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,670
- Thanks.
- Have fun.

Hey, Ayumelo (Ayumi's nickname).

344
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,030
Ayumelo.

345
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,270
This is the best after all!

346
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,520
Why is it like this?

347
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,320
- So this individual was dumped—
- No.

348
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,130
I mean, he used to be popular, but now he's not.

349
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,440
This is about a friend?
[Ebihara Katsuo]

350
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,190
Yes, but he wasn't dumped, okay? Now listen.

351
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,690
They both agreed to part,
and the man is not entirely "unpopular."

352
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,650

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,070
I'll try it anyway.

534
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,850
- This is delicious.
- Thank goodness!

535
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,340
- It's good?
- Yes!

536
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,960
Great.

537
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,390
- Good.
- Here, try a bite of my cooking as well.

538
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:57,180
These fried shrimp turned out especially crispy.

539
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,710
Trading bites between guys
is a bit weird though, right?

540
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,680
I'd say we're already fairly odd
for eating somen outdoors.

541
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,660
That is crispy!

542
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,600
You took a bite from me after all.

543
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,800

Yes?

546
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,370
Never mind. It's nothing.

547
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:57,110
Ebihara-san, I apologize for yesterday.

548
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,690
- I had a bit of an attitude, and—
- Wait.

549
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,160
Wait.

550
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,050
I...

551
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,240
I said... you were cutting corners using mentsuyu.

552
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,050
Due to my prejudice,
I judged your girlfriend for not cooking.

553
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,180
But ultimately,

554
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:40,830
eating somen outdoors
with just us guys isn't so bad after all.

555
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,250
- Right?
- Yes. This is good.

556
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,720
It's really nice.

557
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,930
- Let's eat up now.
- Right.

558
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,530

560
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,590
I saw you eating outside with Ebikatsu* today.
(*Ebihara's nickname)

561
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,040
- Did that go okay?
- Yes.

562
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,780
I assumed Ebihara-san would never change,

563
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,400
no matter what you told him.

564
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,320
But I suppose that was my own prejudice.

565
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,850
Well, I don't know what happened,

566
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,150
but I still can't stand that Ebikatsu.

567
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,770
Did I keep you waiting?

568
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,160
Not at all.

569
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,800
- Want to hop on?
- Riding together on a bike for one?

570
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,320
- Why not?
- I'll pass.

571
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,890
A sound choice.

572
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,310
No, wrong person.

00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,020
Tomorrow morning, I think.

574
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,680
- Can I grab a bite, too?
- Sure.
