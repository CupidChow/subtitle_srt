179
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,730
Who out there is judging our worth to each other?

180
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:28,350
I don't want some stranger to make that decision for us.

181
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,320
If you no longer love me, then there's nothing more I can do.

182
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,110
But if that's not the case,

183
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,550
then I want us to stay together, Ryo.

184
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,150
I want to strive to stay together with you.

185
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,100
Sorry, I'm keeping the guys waiting.

[Koenji Junjo Shopping Street]

187
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,230
- More interviews today, Ayumi?
- Yup.

188
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,380
I also wish you the best at the office today.

189
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,750
Thanks.

190
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,590
- Then I'm headed this way.
- Take care.

191
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,520
- Good luck with your interviews.
- Thanks.

192
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,620
Remember, Ayumi. If you're in a bind, tell me.

193
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,040
Thanks, I'm doing just fine. See you later.

194
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,670
Morning.

195
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,770
Good morning.

196
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,990
- Good morning.
- Morning.

197
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,240
Morning, Chief.

198
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,580
I bet vacation bored you out of your mind.

199
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,520
How did you spend your time, sir?

200
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,580
I was real busy.

201
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,940
There was so much to do around the house.

202
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,270
Every day was jam-packed with activities.

203
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,220
I was busy as can be.

204
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,500
Ebihara, could you summarize our progress thus far?

205
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,830
Of course.

206
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:12,110
Actually, I was handling most of the work,
so I will give a summary.

207
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,490
Don't worry, I was given the brief. I've got this.

208
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,260
- Thank you, sir. But worry not,
- Allow me to...

209
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,900
I will handle this.

210
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,030
Now then, allow me to summarize.

211
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,380
I'm sorry that got a bit lengthy.

212
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,070
No worries at all.

213
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,640
Yanagisawa, could I have a minute?

214
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,430
If it's urgent, please just send me an email.

215
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,780
My throat is sore from all that talking.

216
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,400
I really think clientele feedback could bolster our proposal.

217
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,490
So if we could focus on these surveys...

218
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,050
Ebihara.

219
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,860
- Could I speak my mind?
- Sure.

220
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,990
Our priority now is selling our bigwigs on this product,
not our clients.

221
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,880
So first, we have to get our proposal through, alright?

222
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,680
Experience cooking professionally?

223
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,280
No, our place requires no such thing.

224
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,640
- Really?
- Of course.

225
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,730
You would start by working as one of our waitresses.

226
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,010
I think our attire will suit you perfectly.

227
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,900
When can I schedule your first shift?

228
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,690
How was your first day back at the office?

229
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,050
It was great.

230
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,920
We had a meeting for the project I'm working on.

231
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,590
My throat's a bit sore from all the talking.

232
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,920
- I see.
- Yeah.

233
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,690
How were your interviews?

234
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,230
I haven't heard back from any place yet,

235
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,250
but I think they'll all turn me down.

236
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,080
I see. There's always a next time.

237
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,260
- That's too bad though.
- Yeah.

238
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,460
- Katsuo.
- What's up?

239
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,150
I think I'll open my own restaurant.

240
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,640
- Your own restaurant?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,650
I was thinking about asking Taihei if I could rent his bar space.

242
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,560
His place only opens in the evening,
[ONBORO]

243
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,370
so I thought maybe I could use the space during the day.

244
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,720
That's a great idea.

245
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,270
I haven't consulted with Taihei about it yet though.

246
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,510
I'm looking forward to it.

I'll do what I can for you, too.

- Yeah.

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,780

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,850

Okay, here I go. Taihei.

Please let me rent your bar space in the afternoons.

260
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
- Huh?
- Rent this space?

261
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,950
Yeah. I want to use this space
to run a Mexican restaurant in the afternoons.

262
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:05,230
Not immediately, though.
Only after I've saved up enough money.

263
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,060
Of course, I'll make sure to keep the space clean for you.

264
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,630
I want us to discuss a rental fee
that works for the both of us, too.

265
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,810
So please, help me make this a reality.

266
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,970
Sounds fine by me. What do you think?

267
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,970
Yeah, I don't mind.
I'm not using this space for anything else in the afternoons.

268
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,230
- You mean it?
- Of course.

269
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,520
Thank you so much.

270
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,960
I'll call our landlord about it, too.

She did?

Yeah. I've never seen her act so sincere.

That's Katsuo for you.

327
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,880
I seriously could not believe him.

328
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,750
On that note, thank you for helping with those surveys.

329
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,460
I didn't do much. I just passed them out to my customers.

330
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,650
That's more than enough.

And you're fine with this outcome, Amina?

333
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,390
- Huh?
- You like Katsuo, don't you?

334
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,730
Of course not. That dense, blockhead is not my type at all.

335
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,010
How scathing.

336
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,760
I envy him, that's all.

337
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,220
See, I broke up with my previous ex over something stupid.

338
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
"Stupid"?

339
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,970
Smoking's a no-go for me in a relationship,

340
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,450
because my father passed away from lung cancer.

341
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,690
My boyfriend at the time said he'd quit for me,

342
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,900
but he was actually smoking behind my back.

343
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,270
When I realized he would never change himself for me,
I lost heart.

344
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Ever since then, I thought change was impossible for people.

345
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:50,120
But watching Mr. Ebihara makes me want to believe again.

346
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:56,040
Maybe change is possible, albeit with time and patience.

347
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,550
Sorry, didn't mean to talk about something so stupid.

348
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,060
It's not stupid.

349
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,260
- Huh?
- This is clearly an important topic for you.

350
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,670
It's not stupid at all.

351
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,800
Besides, I also feel the same way when I watch Ayu.

352
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,830
She makes me believe change is possible for people.

353
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,760
- That's good.
- Right?

354
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,210
Vegetables and dough...

355
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,600
With the sauce, that's 250 yen per dish.

356
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
[How much will one customer buy?]

357
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,410
Which means I should sell for...

358
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,380
[Make sure to treasure your regulars and repeat customers!]

359
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,890
500 Yen.

360
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,150
"I am quite interested".

361
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,680
"It would help if I could see the remaining quantities".

362
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,650
How many hours do I need to work?

363
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,060
I still won't have anywhere near enough money.

364
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,960
"It depends on"...

365
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,200
I'll help.

366
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,900
Thanks.

367
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,190
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

368
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,970
Phew, I'm beat.

369
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,370
Do you want to eat dinner now?

370
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,660
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

371
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,160
What's all this?

372
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,390
I was running calculations for initial costs and other expenses.

373
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,340
I see.

374
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,740
Makes sense.

375
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,980
Looks correct.

376
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,730
Ayumi, shall I run these calculations for you?

377
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,560
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

378
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,410
But this is totally my area of expertise.

379
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,920
First, let's talk break-even point and cost rates.

380
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,470
Your cost rates shouldn't go over 30%.

381
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,930
- But for your needs and purposes -
- It's fine.

382
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,440
Katsuo. I want to do this myself.

383
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,870
Sorry.

384
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,860
- I thought you were having trouble.
- I'm not.

385
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,930
I see.

386
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,090
I'm sure this spread is distracting you.

387
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,930
Sorry, I'll run my calculations at home.

388
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,560
You know that guy won't be coming, right?

389
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,280
I know.

390
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,150
Then why wait for him?

391
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,330
You know he won't be here tonight!

392
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,530
I'll always wait for Junpy to come home.

393
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,570
I've already made my choice.

394
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,680
But there's no point.

395
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,890
Why Junpei?

396
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,310
Mari!

397
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,020
Junpy...

398
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,550
I won't be leaving for the Netherlands.

399
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,210
I won't ever leave your side, Mari.

400
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,760
I was so lonely, Junpy.

401
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,170
So, so lonely!

402
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,680
Mari, I'm home!

403
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,090
Junpy, welcome home!

404
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,530
Congratulations, you two!

405
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,320
That's good.

406
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,210
I have a real passion for cooking.
[Handmade Rice Balls]

407
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,740
However, I have no experience cooking professionally.

408
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,410
We don't allow painted nails or piercings in the kitchen.
Is that fine by you?

409
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,300
Yes, of course.

410
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,010
Congrats on the job, Ayumelo. Cheers!

411
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,400
It's only a part-time gig though.

412
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,390
So? That's better than nothing.

413
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,970
You're inching closer to your dream.

414
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,120
Yeah. I'm still far from my goal, but I'll do my best to save up.

415
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,620
Guess that means I can charge high for rent.

416
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,140
Taihei, don't bully her.

417
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,070
Sorry, sorry.

418
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,980
How did Katsuo react? I bet he was over the moon.

419
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,090
Yeah, he was.

420
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,070
I feel like he'd literally jump for joy.

421
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,290
- Or he'd break out into dance.
- I can see that.

422
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,350
Right?

423
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,110
I remember he danced with his hips.

424
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,290
- Like this, I think?
- Yeah, something like that.

425
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,720
I know it's been difficult, but great work so far, Katsuo.

426
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,030
Tonight's my treat, alright?

427
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,870
Thanks, Chief.

428
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,650
So this is Minamikawa's go-to spot?

429
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,290
No, it's a go-to spot of mine.

430
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,950
Is that so?

431
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,630
- Your pork jowl.
- Thanks a million.

432
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,560
- What?
- Jowl tastes better straight.

433
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,480
Let people eat however they want.

434
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,590
I find it easier, and tastier to eat it this way.

435
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,980
You've changed, Ebihara.

436
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,250
- You think so?
- Yeah.

437
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,800
You've become more sure of yourself.

438
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
And to that, I say bravo!

439
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,290
- Did you want anything to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

440
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,630
Actually...

441
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,160
Could I have a beer?

442
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,190
A beer? Sure thing.

443
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,620
And the hairdresser who worked on me instead, was Nagisa.

444
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,230
So that's how you two met.

445
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,330
I remember being surprised by how blunt she was!

446
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,820
Her alien-colored hair shocked me, too.

447
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,500
I don't blame you there.

448
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,380
I never thought I'd use a dating app myself.

449
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,640
- And that's how you met Tsubaki?
- Exactly.

450
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:10,820
So much happened ever since we broke up, huh?

451
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,010
Yeah, to the both of us.

452
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:23,040
Having things the other party doesn't know... isn't so bad, is it?

453
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,300
None of this would have happened
if we stayed together, that's for sure.

454
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,510
Yeah.

455
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,280
Thanks.

456
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,220
Listen.

457
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,140
The other day, I had assumed on my own that you needed help.

458
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,380
I overstepped my boundaries without waiting for your answer.

459
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm really sorry I encroached on you like that.

460
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:23,810
When you turned down my proposal, I got to thinking.

461
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,600
And at first, I couldn't figure out where I went wrong.

462
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,540
That's why I decided to make chikuzenni.

463
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,950
Is that why you asked for my recipe?

464
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,020
Yeah, that's exactly it.

465
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,070
As you can probably guess, my first try was a disaster.

466
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,580
By the time I realized I was missing the stock,
it was already midnight.

467
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,300
I also cut my finger carving the carrots into flowers.

468
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,290
What? You tried that on your first pass? You didn't need to.

469
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,520
No, but I did.

470
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,840
Because it made me realize how amazing you are.

471
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,190
And yet.

472
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,130
I used to just...

473
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,710
nit-pick about your cooking.

474
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,750
Thinking back now, I'm so embarrassed of my old self.

475
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,150
You should be.

476
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,820
You used to call my spread "too brown".

477
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,430
And you'd point out
how I used the same ingredient in two dishes.

478
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,170
Coming up with nutritious meals that never felt repetitive

479
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,650
was a real ordeal, you know?

480
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,250
I'm so sorry.

481
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:43,090
But I wasn't able to speak up back then either.

482
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:50,260
I had assumed you'd dislike a girlfriend who got mad at you.

483
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:53,760
What? No, of course I wouldn't hate that.

484
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,070
Katsuo.

485
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,950
My whole life, I worked hard to be chosen by someone.

486
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,220
I strove to be chosen.

487
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,800
And eventually, I was.

488
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,710
Except, then I gave up communicating with my partner.

489
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:34,300
I never even gave conversation a chance.

490
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,720
So the reason why our relationship was built on self-restraint...

491
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,780
was most certainly my fault.

492
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:57,120
To be honest, I feel sick with worry.

493
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:06,150
I'm once again reminded of how terrifying it is
to stand on my own.

494
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,510
Relying on another without much thought

495
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,440
is definitely the easier option.

496
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:26,350
But I don't want to learn to stand behind others.

497
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,710
I want to stand next to those individuals, as equals.

498
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,150
So right now...

499
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,080
I want to be honest with myself.

500
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,060
I want to be able to stand on my own two feet, alone.

501
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,340
And I want to open that store with my own two hands.

502
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,620
I want to do what I can, as the person I am now.

503
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,470
Ayumi...

504
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:21,150
You've helped me time and time again throughout the years.

505
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:32,840
I think that's why I felt so inclined to help you this time.

506
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,630
But to say I want to support you

507
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:47,580
when you're trying so hard on your own,
was insensitive, wasn't it?

508
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,600
My selfish words and thoughtless actions were putting a lid

509
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,310
on the things you wanted to do, the things you wanted to say.

510
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,680
The Katsuo of the past...

511
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,110
would have definitely preferred the Ayumi with black hair.

512
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,340
But now I prefer the Ayumi I see in front of me.

513
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,560
This Ayumi is the best.

514
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,230
You're the most beautiful you've ever been.

515
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:32,440
I mean it.

516
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,560
Truly, from the bottom of my heart, I do.

517
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,420
But the sole reason I can say this...

518
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,490
without an ounce of doubt...

519
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:57,410
is because I'm no longer your significant other.

520
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:07,470
If you didn't reject me,
I would have never cultivated an appreciation for cooking.

521
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,260
Let alone eat offals, or try a cola highball.

522
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,530
I was able to experience new things.

523
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:31,030
Things I would have never encountered,
if we had stayed together.

524
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,030
Yeah.

525
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,020
Okay.

526
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,040

Your potential is limitless, Ayumi.

You'll do great.

533

You'll be just fine.

Yeah, I'd peek in on your watch sessions.

What we prioritized most
upon conceptualizing this Eco-Cycle Toilet,

556
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,470
was the user experience.
