00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,930
Are you heading out?

177
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,220
Yes, just shopping for a bit.

178
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,150
By the way, you got a package.
[Wearne]

179
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,620
Okay, thanks.

180
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,560
- Sayori's home?
- She is. She just got back.

181
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,280
- She said she was visiting Brazil.
- "Brazil"?

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,690
I told her a woman shouldn't travel alone,
but she just won't listen.

183
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,420
You assume it's a dangerous place
without even visiting.

184
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,670
Just don't cause us trouble, you hear?

185
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,760
And, Ayumi, we need to talk later.

186
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,800
- "Talk"?
- See you in a bit!

187
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,610
Hey, what's all this about?

188
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,880
Oh, you watched? Entertaining, right?
[Marriage Survival]

189
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,200
No. You made a spectacle
of our family's struggles.

190
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,120
And what's wrong with that?
Anything to win the competition.

191
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,080
Well, stop it; you're embarrassing us.

192
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,090
- That's none of your business.
- It is.

193
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,720
- Why is that?
- Because I'm your family.

194
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,850
I don't want to be ridiculed.

195
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,850
There's no point in living
by gauging other people's reactions.

196
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,990
I see you never change, Ayumi.

197
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,840
What? Go sit over there; you're distracting me.

198
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,990
I was just curious to see how you make your dashi.

199
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,440
Why is that?

200
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,350
To tell you the truth, I've begun cooking.

201
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,480
- You? "Cooking"?
- Yes.

202
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,370
Don't tell me you got into
an argument with Ayumi-chan.

203
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,900
No.

204
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,940
Actually...

205
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,040
- We've—
- Well, I figured.

206
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,780
You've been together for a while now.

207
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,460
- Discord happens once in a while.
- Right.

208
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,510
I can't wait to teach her how to make
our miso soup with dried sardine.

209
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,450
It's one of your favorites, right?

210
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,820
Takahiro's wife, Yurika-chan,
isn't much of a cook,

211
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,920
and Tora's wife, Megu-chan, never visits,
so I'm excited to teach her.

212
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,980
Torayoshi Nii-san doesn't visit often?

213
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,430
No. I wish he could at least
let us see our granddaughter.

214
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,980
- Yes.
- We even have a gift ready to please her.

215
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,730
What did you get her?

216
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,830
See? Red, for a girl!

217
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,200
- Is she already an elementary schooler?
- That's right.

218
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,990
But they never come to visit.

219
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,140
When did you last see them?

220
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,130
Not since we took this picture.
It's been over a year now.

221
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,130
They live close, right? They should visit.

222
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,020
That's what I want to tell him.

223
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,390
But I keep it in. I don't want him
thinking I'm annoying and all.

224
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,470
I do miss them.

225

What was your mother like?
[Forever Love in Tokyo]

226
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,700
She was the sort of person
who'd water three-leaf clovers.

227
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,260
She sounds lovely.

228
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,660
Even now, I think she's
watching over us from up in Heaven.

229
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,510
That's why I'll go see him.
I'll go see your father.

230
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,760
No, you can't!

231
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,850
Who knows what he'd do to you!

232
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,670
I'll be okay, Mari. I will overcome your father.

233
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,230
- Shunpy, you're asking the impossible!
- I don't care.

234
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,940
Mom, please! This is an important scene!

235
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,310
- Oh, jeez!
- This drama again? You've watched it a thousand times.

236
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,810
There's something different
about watching it at home.

237
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,690
- No, there isn't.
- Yes, there is. I can get really into the emotions.

238
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,510
- Move.
- Mom, please!

239
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,520
- Please!
- Please!

240
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,460
And I'm no longer invested.

241
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
- Unbelievable.
- Please!

242
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Darn it!

Here, I thought you'd like this one.

245
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,550
Thanks!

246
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,920
Books might seem to always be written
about undeniable truths,

247
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,850
but you're always allowed to doubt
and think for yourself, okay?

248
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,240
Torayoshi Nii-san doesn't visit often?

249
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,150
Not since we took this picture.

Do you want to meet?]

Why are you leaving me on "read"?

253
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,140
I told him to come home early today.

254
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,910
It's fine. Let him be.

255
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,310
So what did you need to tell me?

256
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,770
Oh, right. We're meeting his family
the day after your friend's wedding.

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,120
What?

258
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,020
The meeting between the two families.

Wait, between who?

260
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, don't act so surprised!
Between our family and Katsuo-san's, of course.

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,140
Sorry, I'm not following.

262
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,240
Both families have already discussed it.

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,070
We figured now was the perfect time!

264
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:26,420
- Mom, Katsuo-san and I—
- I'd be so relieved if you married into that family.

265
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,080
I mean, they're the Ebihara Construction Company.
You'd be set for life!

266
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,690
Mom, to tell you the truth, we...

267
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,350
I'll attend this "meeting of the families," too.

268
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,240
Why? You don't need to attend.

269

No, I'm going.

- What if you absolutely ruin it for her?

272
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,760
If my presence is enough to ruin it,
then their bond was nothing special.

273
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,780
What did you say? Come back here, Sayori!

274
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,080
Unbelievable.

- What?
- We will meet her family.

276
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,250
Hold on. This is the first I'm hearing of this.

277
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,890
Oh, it won't be anything too formal or stuffy.

278
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,730
- This is bad.
- We're only exchanging greetings.

279
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,210
- We're just eating together.
- Why did you schedule that without asking us?

280
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,350
We have every right to make that decision.

281
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,280
Marriage isn't just about tying you two together.

282
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,390
- It's an ordeal involving both families.
- Right.

283
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,050
- Mom—
- That's right, the son of the Ebihara Construction Company.

284
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,650
Yes, and we're finally meeting his family!

285
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,140
I even bought a new dress
to celebrate the occasion!

286
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,840
Yes, from that one store.

287
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,980
Oh, you remembered?

288
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,700
Yes, I'm so excited.

289
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,460
What do I do now?

290
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,360
- This is bad.
- Better?

291
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,320
- I think this one's better on you.
- Red seems a bit flashy, don't you think?

292
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,000
It's better to make an impression.

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,110
- You look good.
- Oh, no.

294
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,590
How am I supposed to tell them?

00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,720
Can we talk tomorrow?

Okay, say cheese!

298
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,760
- Wow!
- Could you take another photo?

299
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,800
- Her hair changed again.
- I'm happy for them, really.

300
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,020
I thought our Kacchan* would be next, though.
(*Katsuo's nickname)

301
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,310
- What?
- What're you talking about, Kijima?

302
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,580
- Our Kacchan's got pride, but he's easily hurt.
- Hey, shut up!

303
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,730
You'd better not say that.

304
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,960
Ayumi-chan sure has changed, hasn't she?

305
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,660
She seemed much more feminine back then.

306
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,390
- I guess Tokyo changes people.
- That's what they all say.

307
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,540
I agree.

308
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,120
What, really?

309
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,100
My child's friends have started
attending cram school already.

310
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,020
They do say the earlier the better.

311
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,200
My child is about to be a first grader.

312
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,290
Should I start thinking about cram school, too?

313
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,850
Maybe.

314
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,500
Say, Yamagishi-san,

315
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,380
you dated Ebihara-kun at one point, right?

316
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,250
Wow, what a throwback!

317
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,040
I remember that they were appointed
best couple back in college.

318
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,100
- That's right!
- The perfect couple.

319
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,390
- That's it!
- You two were a perfect match.

320
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,950
So are you two still together?

321
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,470
No, we broke up.

322
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,300
I thought so. College sweethearts
are unrealistic anyway.

323
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,670
By the way, take a look at this.

324
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,010
Ayumi.

325
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,380
You dyed your hair again?

326
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,840
Oh yes, I did.

327
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,210
- It's a nice color. It suits you.
- Thanks.

328
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,950
- So.
- Right.

329
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,360
About the meeting our parents are excited about...

330
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,610
Who knew they'd make plans behind our backs?

331
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,120
Right.

332
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,450
Marriage talk makes them
suddenly team up, you know?

333
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,630
And now, we're the ones put in a tough spot.

334
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,350
I know.

335
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,390
So what should we do about this meeting?

336
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,620
How about we tell them
we broke up at the meeting?

337
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,030
- What?
- Instead of hearing from me,

338
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,160
I think my parents will be
more convinced hearing it from you.

339
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,030
I suppose hearing it from both of us
would sound more convincing.

340
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,030
Right?

341
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,750
If anything, they gave us an opportunity.

342
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,730
- "An opportunity"?
- Yes.

343
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,530
We can each tell our
respective families, together.

344
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,740
You make a fair point. It's the perfect timing.

345
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,680
- Right.
- Ironically.

346
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,320
- Ironically.
- Ironically.

347
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,890
Ironically.

348
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,370
[Reserved: The Ebihara Family, The Yamagishi Family]

349
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,560
Ayumi-chan!

350
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,180
It's nice to see you!

351
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,280
It's wonderful to see you too, Dear.

352
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,990
My husband is looking forward
to seeing you as well.

353
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,510
I'm terribly sorry I couldn't visit sooner.

354
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,420
It's all right. Tokyo is quite far, after all.

355
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,760
Still, I was quite surprised
to hear Katsuo had taken up cooking.

356
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,000
Right? I was also surprised to hear the news.

357
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,660
What? Aren't you both living together?

358
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,420
We are.

359
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,880
Not now, not now.

360
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,580
- What was that?
- Well...

361
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,130
It happened while I was staying
at a friend's place.

362
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,010
- Yes, exactly.
- Right, I stayed over.

363
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,830
Not a day apart, and you're
already missing each other?

364
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,710
- Oh, you absolute lovebirds!
- Right, right.

365
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,930
- I must say, your father is quite late.
- True.

366
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,970
- I think I'll go check up on him.
- All right, go.

367
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,800
- All right, go ahead.
- I'm going, I'm going!

368
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,140
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

369
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,560
It's fine. Let's wait until everyone has gathered.

370
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,740
- I'll make the announcement first.
- Okay.

371
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,790
But what should I say?

372
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,060
- Should we practice?
- Please.

373
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,160
- First, imagine everyone's here.
- They're here.

374
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,080
- The whole family has gathered. Ready?
- Okay.

375
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,740
Though the two of us pursued
an earnest relationship with each other,

376
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,840
we have decided to part ways.

377
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,070
I will cherish the bonds we've built

378
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,150
and hope to remain in
your good graces in the times to come.

379
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,780
- All in one breath?
- They'll butt in if you pause.

380
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,230
- Fair enough.
- Okay.

381
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,350
Now let's assume this is the real thing.

382
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,370
- Assume.
- First, take a deep, deep breath.

383
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,290
Keep breathing. Keep going.

384
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,790
- Now the whole family is—
- Sorry.

385
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,210
- Breathe.
- I've got it.

386
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,620
Though the two of us pursued
an earnest relationship with each other,

387
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,770
we have decided to part ways.

388
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,950
I will... I'm getting choked up.

389
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,390
Deep breath, deep breath.

390
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,060
- "I will..."
- Don't rush me. I'll breathe.

391
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,670
- Breathe. "I will cherish the bonds"
- I will cherish the bonds...

392
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,100
- "and hope to"...
- What are you two doing?

393
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,990
- Wow, Ayumi has learned to flirt in public.
- I'm not flirting. Why are you here?

394
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,600
She insisted on joining us.

395
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Ayumi's older sister.

396
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,450
Onee-san, sorry, but we were not flirting—

397
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,390
- Don't deny it!
- No need to be shy.

398
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,320
It's been a while, Katsuo-kun.

399
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,020
I'm glad to see you again.

400
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,340
- Where's Dad?
- Your father? He'll be here any minute now.

401
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,740
- They've already arrived, Dear.
- Right.

402
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,160
My mother and father.

403
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,690
We're terribly sorry to have kept you waiting.

404
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,090
No, we just arrived too.

405
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,450
This is just a little something
for your family to share.

406
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,700
Baumkuchen symbolizes
many years of happiness to come.

407
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,620
My, what a wonderful sentiment!

408
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,630
I also have a little something
from one of my husband's clients.

409
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,980
- Please enjoy some dried squid.
- "Dried squid"!

410
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,460
You know how folks chew
to savor the flavor of dried squid?

411
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,250
It symbolizes a relationship
that will hopefully deepen with time.

412
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,110
My! That's quite—

413
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:21,420
Katsuo-san and I actually went out
for lunch once. Right?

414
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,340
I knew from then on Ayumi should never let him go.

415
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,280
My, you flatter him.

416
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,750
So what is in your future?

417
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,800
Will you take over the family business?

418
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,240
- Actually, that is—
- Mom, not now.

419
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,760
Why not? This is important.

420
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,520
- You see—
- Ayumi, it's okay.

421
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,080
- I'll break the news.
- What is it?

422
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:55,560
Ma'am, there is a truth I must make clear.

423
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,000
- Ayumi and I—
- Katsuo is only the third son.

424
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,920
Oh, come on!

425
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,690
He won't handle the business.

426
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,950
My eldest will take my place starting next year.

427
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,580
I see.

428
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,790
- But I hope the brothers can all run the company one day.
- (So sorry...)

429
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,460
Is that so? That sounds reassuring.

430
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,130
A family business is a solid foundation.

431
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,510
Then I suppose it's time to start
discussing the ceremony?

432
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,170
- No, Mom—
- I agree. We must send out invitations next year.

433
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:43,080
- When do you think the wedding should be?
- W-Wait just a second.

434
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,630
There's something we must tell you first.

435
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,420
What is it?

436
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,300
To tell you all the truth, Ayumi and I have–

437
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,340
- There you are!
- Dad...

438
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,570
- Terribly sorry I'm late.
- Dad, your seat's over here.

439
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,170
- This way?
- You're way too late.

440
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,840
This is my father.

441
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,820
Nice to meet you. I am Katsuo's father.

442
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,450
The pleasure's mine. I'm Sayori's father.

443
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,730
This is for Ayumi!

444
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,830
R-Right, my mistake.

445
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,980
- Dad, do you want a beer?
- Yes, thanks.

446
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,280
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

447
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,520
Working on a Sunday must be quite difficult, no?

448
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,150
- Well, yes.
- Oh, he wasn't working. He was fishing.

449
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,660
He's all about fishing, mahjong...
all that sort of stuff.

450
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,330
- He couldn't care less about his family.
- W-Wait.

451
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,070
- Onee-chan, please stop it.
- Sayori.

452
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:45,250
I bet you forgot all about
this meeting, didn't you?

453
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,600
I didn't forget; I just got the time wrong.

454
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,140
- So sorry about him.
- (It's okay.)

455
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,050
Ayumi told him the right time. The fault is his.

456
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,540
The fault is always mine in this household.

457
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,460
Choose your wife carefully, Boy.

458
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,540
Hush!

459
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,560
- So sorry! He's not usually like this.
- That's not true.

460
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,640
He's always like this.

461
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,060
Sayori, what is with you?

462
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,660
If Ayumi's marriage with Katsuo-kun
falls through because of you...

463
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,590
Ayumi is a hopeless girl on her own.

464
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,150
She's really helpless. Isn't that right, Dear?

465
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,320
She is not hopeless, Ma'am.

466
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,330
Ayumi-san will do just fine
even if she doesn't marry me.

467
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,420
She doesn't need to be "chosen" by anyone.
She can choose for herself.

468
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,400
She can juggle cooking, cleaning,
and a job all on her own,

469
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,710
not to mention her admirable strength.

470
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,280
- "Her strength"?
- Yes.

471
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,640
She can squeeze a grapefruit
for juice with just one hand.

472
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,750
I fell in love with Ayumi-san

473
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,830
because she strives to resolve issues on her own.

474
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,410
Is that so?

475
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,510
It seems you found yourself
a wonderful man, Ayumi!

476
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,230
- Are you sure?
- Of course, of course!

477
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,030
That was quite the proposal, Dear!

478
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,810
And in front of her parents, no less.

479
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,820
What do you mean by "proposal"?

480
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,380
You've become a bold man, Katsuo.

481
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,930
Leave the ceremony planning to us mothers.

482
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,500
- Mom, hold on.
- Oh, I can't wait!

483
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,680
Are you free today?
[Torayoshi]

484
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,010
We couldn't tell them.

485
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,170
We sure couldn't.

486
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,620
You know what?

487
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,520
I remember why I was so hung up on marriage now.

488
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,890
Won't your father just die already?

489
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,100
Then we'd at least get the insurance money.

490
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:50,210
I swore I wouldn't become like my parents.

491
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,420
I'd build a happy family for myself.

492
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,660
Jeez, I really don't want to go home.

493
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,820
- In that case...
- Yes?

494
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,730
Want to join me?

495
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,040
What?

496
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,540
Here we go!

497
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,020
Yes!

498
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,130
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

499
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,250
You're sweating like crazy.

500
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,020
Really?

501
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,670
Yes, I knew it.

502
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,210
This is bad.

503
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,380
Hold this, Matori.

504
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,880
You and your onii-san look nothing alike.

505
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,370
Right? Honestly, I'm more surprised than you are.

506
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,480
- Katsuo!
- Hey there, Kiddo.

507
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,580
- Your drinks.
- Thank you.

508
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,450
Say, you two certainly look... different.

509
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,610
Don't we?

510
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,740
Matori wanted to cut her hair short,
so I decided we could match.

511
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,730
Were you scared?

512
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,280
Katsuo has never been good with thrill rides.

513
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,840
Scaredy cat. Aren't you a man?

514
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,340
Matori, no saying, "because he's a man."

515
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,710
Why not?

516
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,840
Whether you're a man or a woman,
scary things are scary.

517
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,640
Wouldn't you hate for people
to assume things about you, too?

518
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,540
I would.

519
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,440
Sorry, Katsuo.

520
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,800
I'm proud of you.

521
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,270
You said "sorry" so quickly.

522
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,100
I am an elementary schooler already!

523
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,840
You've grown up.

524
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,080
Although it's a bit late,
how about we break for lunch?

525
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,060
- Great idea.
- All right, let's go!

526
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,930
- Looks good.
- Here.

527
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,080
- Thanks for lunch.
- Thank you.

528
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,600
- That's good.
- I get it now.

529
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
- This is delicious.
- I'm glad to hear it.

530
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,260
The sweet and sour taste of pickles
mellows the distinctive flavor of liver.

531
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,640
Just eat up! No need for the food report.

532
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,800
I just thought an honest review
shows my appreciation for the food.

533
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,580
I certainly enjoy hearing your thoughts.

534
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,430
- Wait, you do?
- Yes, of course.

535
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,120
You remember how Pops used to nitpick
Mom's cooking, right?

536
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,180
I always hated that.

537
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:26,330
The whole spread looks a bit brown.

538
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,710
You need to add more color.

539
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,360
- I'll be sure to do so next time.
- Good.

540
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,290
- I guess I reflected a bit too much on his bad example.
- Oh, no.

541
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,930
Now that you mention it,

542
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,000
I think I unconsciously copied Father.

543
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,020
Why do you need to copy Grandpa?

544
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,030
I wonder why.

545
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,660
Because that's the sort of household
I was raised in, I guess?

546
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,780
But you're you, Katsuo.

547
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,000
So I bet you'll be okay.

548
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,400
Let's play catch over there.

549
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,130
Come on, Ayumi-chan.

550
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,550
What? You want to play with me?

551
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,690
- Yes!
- Why?

552
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,670
Ayumi has great throwing form, I tell you!

553
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,730
- Katsuo-san, you're overselling it.
- What, really?

554
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,650
No, he's exaggerating. Really.

555
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,610
Katsuo, you must love Ayumi, don't you?

556
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,010
- Come on, let's go!
- Okay, sure.

557
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,800
- Don't cause her too much trouble.
- I won't!

558
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,900
- Have fun.
- Wait!

559
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,360
- I'm going to join them.
- Sure thing.

560
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,230
Wait for me!

561
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:52,300
Matori's sort of a tomboy, isn't she?

562
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:02,870
Matori likes playing catch
more than playing with dolls.

563
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:06,030
She prefers pants over skirts,

564
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,290
and her favorite colors are
black and blue, not red and pink.

565
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:16,010
She's not picking things because
they're "girly" or "for boys."

566
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,380
She just picks the things she likes.

567
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:29,040
But Mom and Pops are quick to say
"but you're a girl" to her.

568
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,080
And it was tough to watch her
deal with all that, you know?

569
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,040
See? Red, for a girl!

570
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:47,640
I want Matori to grow up
choosing whatever she wants.

571
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,340
- I see.
- Ready?

572
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,980
Catch!

573
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,200
- You got it!
- She got it!

574
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,560
Nice catch!

575
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,220
See you around. And thanks
for joining us today, Ayumi-chan.

576
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,540
Of course. I had fun today.

577
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,520
When things settle down,
shall we all take another family picture?

578
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,110
- Sounds good.
- I'll keep in touch.

579
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,950
Yes. See you two.

580
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,900
Well...

581
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,830
I'm glad I got to meet your folks today.

582
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,110
Why?

583
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,110
Even though we had been together for a long time,

584
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,520
I knew nothing about your family.

585
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,530
Oh, right.

586
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,400
- If I'm being entirely honest...
- Yes?

587
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,980
I just assumed you grew up
in a harmonious household.

588
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:05,830
That's because I kept my family situation secret.

589
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:12,820
Men prefer marrying women from a happy family.

590
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,900
- Is that how that works?
- It is.

591
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,810
I see.

592
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,380
- You know.
- Yes?

593
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,460
Matori-chan made that remark
about "you being you," right?

594
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,520
She sure did.

595
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,720
I was startled to hear that.

596
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:45,500
She reminded me that I must live by my own values.

597
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,660
This is not about copying my parents
or rebelling against them.

598
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,170
She showed me the importance
of living by my own values,

599
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,440
not by my parents' standards.

600
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,920
So I'll tell my parents
about our situation myself.

601
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,900
Thanks for inviting me out today.

602
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,880
I had fun.

603
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,690
Same here.

604
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,340
I also had fun.

605
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,400
Thank you.

606
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:42,430
I'm excited to gain another daughter-in-law.

607
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,600
Dear, you're being hasty!

608
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,210
Mom, Father.

609
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,030
Yes?

610
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,390
What's with the grave face?

611
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,740
I won't marry Ayumi.

612
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,040
What?

613
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,340
I broke up with Ayumi.

614
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,530
Katsuo? What are you talking about?

615
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,190
We actually broke up quite a while ago.

616
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,410
We don't live together anymore.

617
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:16,630
Oh? Is this true?

618
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,890
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry.

619
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,750
Sorry for the delay in telling you.

620
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,860
You...

621
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,430
You're a man and set your heart on her!

622
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,160
How dare you act unconcerned

623
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,890
after taking back a commitment like that?

624
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,150
But I am not unconcerned.

625
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,870
Enough.

626
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,360
I expect nothing more from you.

627
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,070
I've had enough.

628
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,030
Tell me you're joking.

629
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,840
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

630
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,900
Really?

631
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,870
I'm sorry.

632
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,150
Unbelievable.

633
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,790
Let her do what she wants.

634
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:31,300
Ayumi chose this for herself.

635
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,620
You only say that because
you're not thinking of what's best for Ayumi!

636
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,560
If you actually cared, you wouldn't
be so composed about this!

637
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,900
You always think you're
the only one who actually cares.

638
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,870
Don't marry a man like this, Ayumi.

639
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:56,910
Rethink this. You won't find
a better man than him!

640
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,750
You say that because of his family, right?

641
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:10,540
I want... to choose my own life.

642
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:15,490
That may not make me your "ideal daughter,"

643
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:20,550
but I still want my choices to be wholly my own.

644
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,380
I've never heard you speak
your mind like that before.

645
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:59,130
I'll go watch "Marriage Survival."

646
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,410
Then don't forget to give me a "like."

647
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,280
- What's that?
- The show has a ranking system.

648
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,620
The more "likes" I have,
the more screen time I get.

649
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,290
- No, thanks.
- Why?

650
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,300
- I don't want to.
- Oh, come on.

651
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,200
- Aren't we family?
- I'm not giving you a "like."

652
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,820
- See? Pick Yamagishi Sayori. It's that easy!
- No, thanks.

653
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,990
- Why not?
- Just, no.

654
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,640
Good morning.

655
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,730
I'm heading back today.

656
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,650
It's really too bad about you and Ayumi-chan.

657
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,430
You know, your father was looking forward
to the wedding.

658
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:15,310
He even practiced greeting her parents
and all the formalities.

659
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,190
Try to understand where
he's coming from, all right?

660
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,080
[Instant Miso Soup]

661
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,510
What?

662
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,540
Didn't Dad always say
using instant was a shortcut?

663
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,790
Has he become more tolerant of such things?

664
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,600
Keep that a secret between us, all right?

665
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,010
All's well that ends well, I suppose?

666
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,110
I guess.

667
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,130
You were able to tell your folks
you two broke up, right?

668
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,410
Yes.
♫ I was fed up ♫

669
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,360
♫ I was fed up ♫

670
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,560
♫ Where did we go wrong? ♫

671
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,590
Was this ultimately a good end result for you

672
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,400
or not?

673
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,690
- What do you mean?
- Because now you've really broken up with Ayumi-san.

674
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,500
Thanks for inviting me out today.

675
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,320
I had fun.

676
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,860
Let me guess.

677
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,610
Maybe they rekindled their flame
after seeing each other back home.

678
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,530
- No, we did not!
- I knew it!

679
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,500
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

680
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,970
- It's written all over your face.
- No!

681
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,450
You're wrong!

682
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,530
You are wrong.

683
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:58,090
♫ Notice the warm honesty ♫

684
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,830
