Ayumi, are these cups okay?

- Oh, thanks.
- There's no more, so I'll go buy some.

- Are you surprised?
- Yes, very.

31
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,880
- He looks so out of place.
- Do you think so?

32

I'm glad to hear it.

Ayumi, you're amazing.

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,380
You cultivated such a
welcoming atmosphere in there.

53
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,650
To be honest,

54
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,980
I had no idea you had that in you.

55
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,480
I'd say that was mostly Taihei-kun's doing.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,020
No, you definitely played a part.

57
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,480
Not really.

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,180
I realize something now.

60
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,510
when we were together, I restrained you.

I'm sorry, I never noticed.

No, me, too.

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,090

molding myself to you as well.

Let me guess.

74
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,270
Did Katsuo ask to do things over with you?

79
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,560
It honestly felt so weird.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,730
Katsuo-san was never one to admit he was wrong.

81
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,380
Maybe he reflected after being dumped.

82
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,230
I wonder.

83
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:36,950
But when he's so sincere,
I don't exactly know how to respond.

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,080
- Ayumelo.
- Yes?

85

86
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,950
I brought sweet treats.

87

- Ta-da!
- Oh, Ice-cream!

88
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,390
- Thanks.
- Nothing like eating ice-cream in the winter, right?

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,550
- Agreed.
- I wasn't sure what to get because Ayu-chan doesn't like sweets,

90
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,670
but then I remembered her love of ice-cream.

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,950
You didn't, Katsuo-san told me.

93
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:14,270
He insisted I get you ice "cream,"
not the lactose-free stuff, or ice milk.

94
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,200
- What is the difference?
- I don't know.

- Now, now.

176
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,710
Well, you two get along, okay?

177
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,510
- So are you joining us or not?
- Well...

178
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,220
- Cheers. Welcome!
- Cheers!

179
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too!

180
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,190
All right, let's eat.

181
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,680
I'll explain how this works.

182
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,670
For hand-wrapped sushi,
first you hold the seaweed like—

183
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,970
- I've got this.
- You do?

184
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,470
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

185
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,970
So once you have the seaweed,

186
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,860
- you place the rice—
- Thanks, but I'll manage.

187
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,020
- You'll manage? You sure?
- Yes.

188
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,140
- What should I put in mine?
- I'm a fan of shrimp.

189
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,860
Still, I never thought Katsuo
would have such an adorable junior.

190
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,960
- Not really, right?
- Shut it, Sir.

191
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,150
So harsh.

192
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,180
I'm also fresh from suffering a broken heart,

193
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,400
so let's all wallow in our misery together.

194
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,700
- Excellent idea.
- Exactly!

195
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,510
- Could I get the soy sauce?
- Here.

196
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,450
Thank you.

197
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,870
- Your wrap looks messy.
- I want to stuff my sushi full!

198
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,420
Your heart, not your head,
knows what you really want to do.

199
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Why were you rejected, Minamikawa-chan?

200
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,630
So this guy I met on a dating app

201
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,570
asked me a question about work over dinner.

202
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,990
But when I gave him my thoughts,

203
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,890
he said he wasn't looking for that kind of advice.

204
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,020
Then he complained about how,

205
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,830
"Women never understand
how stressful work is for men."

206
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,350
He blocked me the moment we broke up.

207
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,300
There it is! Some men
can't talk about things like that, right?

208
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,930
Right!

209
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:52,480
I haven't matched with any good guys recently.

210
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,340
What's with that expression?

211
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,260
Sorry, it just felt like you two
were complaining about me.

212
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,130
What? No.

213
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,380
It's not like you represent all men on Earth.

214
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,070
I know that.

215
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,570
Okay, I've had it.
You've been wrapping your sushi wrong.

216
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,520
There is no "wrong way" of wrapping sushi.

217
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,060
- Yes, there is. It's better to put it—
- Fine, I get it.

218
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,010
Jeez, that's no way to treat someone
who pretended to be your girlfriend for you.

219
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,430
I appreciate you for that.
But that's one thing, this is another.

220
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:33,390
- It'll taste better if you fold it properly.
- Simmer down, let me eat how I want.

221
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,700
I decided to quit my job.

222
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,970
What?

223
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,470
That lady from the other day invited me
to open my own restaurant.

224
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,990
A restaurant?

225
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,760
Am I dreaming too big?
Maybe I'm getting full of myself.

226
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,480
No, I'm just happy for you.

227
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,710
So I'd get to eat your cooking
whenever I want? Awesome.

228
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,340
- Do you mean it?
- Wow.

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,470
I feel like I'm getting further away
from a stable life though.

230
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,930
Clinging to stability will only chain you down.

231
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,200
Here's a tequila to celebrate the occasion.

232
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,290
- Thank you!
- Congrats.

233
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,960
Thank you both so much.

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,160

- Yes.

238
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,400
I want to open a Mexican place
that serves tequila.

239
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,670
But the cuisine won't be exclusively Mexican.

240
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,890
I want to serve anything that pairs with tequila.

241
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,960
That sounds like a great idea.

242
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,310
Oden will definitely be on the menu.

243
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,530
- "Oden"?
- Yes.

244
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,510
- Oden pairs with tequila?
- It does!

245
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,870

- Right.

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,410
What do you mean?

257
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,910
You two seem good for each other.

Stop it! I'm not interested in him at all.

00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,300
Oh, is that so?

260
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,270
When I broke up with my ex,
I just couldn't seem to move on from him.

261
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,660
So when I see Katsuo
so earnestly devoted to his ex-girlfriend,

262
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,370
all I feel is sympathy for his experience.

263
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,090
What about you, Minamikawa-chan?

264
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,350
What?

265
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,620
You said you haven't
matched with any good guys recently.

266
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,790
Maybe that's because you already
have a good guy on your mind?

- I want to confirm something with you.
- Sure.

I saw the surveys you submitted from each store,

269
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,670
and you had only jotted down the numbers.

- Yes. Then we'll get our answer.

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,840
I have.

344
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
- And that's why I want to aim even higher—
- But that's the problem.

345
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,250
You want to aim higher, but never stop to think
about how that affects others.

346
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,350
All right fine. I get it.

347
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,020
Talk to me about how you feel then.

348
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,290
What's the point?

349
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,380
You wouldn't understand.
I don't expect you to try and understand, either.

350
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,920
Of course I don't understand,
you're not telling me anything!

351
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,310
It's time for me to clock out.

352
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,340
Have a good night, everyone.

353
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,400
See you all tomorrow.

354
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,780
Ebihara-kun, there's a trick
to that vending machine.

355
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,720
Here.

356
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,050
That's a lack of communication.

357
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,910
- Chief...
- You can't put yourself in everyone's shoes,

358
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,960
even if you want to understand
other's perspectives.

359
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,220
That's what makes communication so important.

360
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,670
Why not start by inviting him out
for a round of drinks?

361
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,390
Yanagisawa-kun, do you have a minute?

362
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:21,460
- If this is about those documents...
- No, I want to ask you something.

363
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,410
The thing is...

364
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,490
I realize we haven't really spoken much.

365
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,920
So how about we grab a drink together?

366
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,100
I know a great place for grilled giblets.

367
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,780
Of course, we don't have to get grilled giblets
if that's not your thing.

368
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,430
- Are you forcing me to go?
- No.

369
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,150
I just thought it'd be nice
to get to know each other.

370
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,640
Is this another job you're assigning me?

371
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,310
No, far from it.

372
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,990
Then my answer is "No, thank you."

373
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,250
I see.

374
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,560
What to do...

375
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,170
Finally.

Wait, where's the chili oil?

379
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,870

- One moment, Sir.
- Why...

Ayumi.

388
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,590
Is everything okay?

389
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,140
Yes, the register just froze up on me.

390
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,220
I see.

All right.

392
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,410
That's a lot of groceries.

393
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,910
Yes, I'm testing a bunch of recipes right now.

394

- Testing recipes?
- That's right.

Here, I'll hold a bag for you.

- No, it's fine.
- Come on, I'll hold it for you.

- Let me help.
- It's okay, I got this.

402
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,940
- Thanks for helping me carry these.
- Of course.

403
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,860
Well, here's my place.

404
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,480
- Here?
- Yes.

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,230
Oh...

Thanks.

- Sorry, that must've been heavy.
- It's fine.

- Will you start cooking now?
- Yes.

00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,020
I see.

Want to stop in and try some? It'll be quick.

411
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,720
You helped carry the ingredients anyway.

412
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,150
- You wouldn't mind?
- Not at all.

413
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,240
It's my lucky day.

414
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,040
Okay.

415
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,110
- Thanks for having me.
- Sure. Sorry, it's a bit messy inside.

416
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,690
I can't believe you are opening a restaurant.

417
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,120
I know, right? I even quit my job for this.

418
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,580
I never realized you were one
to take action like this.

419
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,870
Although, I guess that's more the image
I had of you in my mind.

420
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,320
No, I never used to think
I could do something like this either.

421
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,020
In fact, back then,
I don't think I would have even tried,

422
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,790
let alone think I had it in me to do so.

423
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,260
Here.

424
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,430
Give these a taste,

425
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,020
and tell me your honest thoughts on them.

426
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,170
Does this make me your very first customer?

427
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:23,560
No. I had Nagisa and Taihei try all this already.

428
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,660
Oh, I see.

429
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,270
That makes sense.

430
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,730
Of course.

431
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,400
- Thanks for the food.
- Enjoy.

432

First...

433
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,280
I've been pretty swamped with work right now.

434
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:05,500
So it's been a while since I've enjoyed
a warm, home-cooked meal.

435
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,540
This is delicious.

436
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,810
Unbelievably delicious.

437
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,820
If all you say is "It's delicious," it won't be helpful.

438
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,750
But it is delicious.

439
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,990
Sorry, I can't give a more lengthy review.

440
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,750

Is everything okay?

444
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,630
I'm at a bit of a loss right now.

445
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,740
I'm currently acting as the leader of a project,

446
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,590
and frankly, it hasn't been going well.

447
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:10,790
I'm trying to understand one of my team members,
but I keep messing up.

448
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,870
People have always adjusted to me,

449
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,400
and I took that kindness for granted.

450
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,690
So I finally understand.

451
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,760
I get how difficult it is
to be the one doing the adjusting.

452
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,800
I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown.

453
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,150
Oh, I hate this.

454
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,860
I'm just making you listen to my whining.

455
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,680
- I'm so lame.
- You're not lame.

456
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,060

and I think that's quite admirable.

Oh, no!

460
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,900
Sweetie, you peed on the floor!

461
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,150
- What was that?
- The neighbor's cats.

462
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,050
I see.

463
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,230
Yes, it does sound like that.

464
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,100
- You know what?
- Yes?

465
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,510
This is seriously delicious.

466
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,150
- It's a Mexican rice ball.
- I see.

467
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,800
Homemade rice balls
are hard to get as an adult, right?

468
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,700
Yes, I associate them with
lunches packed for field trips.

469
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,770
- Why are those so good?
- I know, right?

470
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,880
I don't know, but eating something homemade
with a crowd is energizing in a way.

471
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,240
I get that entirely.

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,710
Please let me see Shunpei-san,
even if only for a moment.

473

- How many times must I tell you no?

475
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,340
I left you with my rice balls.

476
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,310
Did you make sure to hand them to Shunpei-san?

477
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,610
Of course not. My son
is in no condition to eat rice balls.

478

Now leave us at once!

No, impossible.

I ate the rice balls Mari left me.

484
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,420
To think her rice balls
had such healing properties...

485
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,320

Good choice! Two pork cheeks, coming right up.

695
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,490
All right.

696
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,560
That's impressive.

697
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,980
- That's good.
- You reminded me.

698
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,080
What's up?

699
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,920
Do you remember those giblets
we got in college? The ones at the stall.

700
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,730
I remember! The insanely tough ones?

701
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,930
Yes, that's when I swore off giblets altogether.

702
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:12,420
But now that I've found
a nice place like this, I feel happy.

703
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,270
I like this place as well.

704
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,300
- You know...
- Yes?

705
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,250
Eating delicious food doesn't necessarily
make the bad things go away.

706
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,940
But as long as I can enjoy it,
I feel like I'm still all right.

707
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,680
Yes, I think so, too.

708
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,320
Your two pork cheeks.

709
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,010
- Time to taste it.
- Yes.

710
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,560
Okay.

711
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,900
- Hey, wait a second.
- What?

712
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,290
Cheeks taste better straight.

713
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,780
- No...
- That's why they're served without sauce.

714
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,550
Let people eat however they want.

715
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:55,080
Trust me, I'm a regular here.

716
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,150
So am I.

717
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,620
- Are you now?
- I am.

718
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,870
- Here, I have proof.
- Really?

719
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,540
♫ Even if we worry ourselves sick ♫

720
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,190
- See, my point card.
- No way.

721
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,180
Look at this.

722
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,110
- You have one, too!
- See?

723
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,550
Wow, you really are a regular here.

724
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,540
Wait a second.

725
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,820
- We just missed each other.
- You're right.

726
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,920
- I was there the day before.
- Really?

727
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:24,970
♫ What we lacked ♫

728
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,470
- We sure drunk our fill tonight.
- We sure did.

729
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:38,310
♫ That changes through our clumsy love ♫

730
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,970
This feels a bit odd.

731
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,200
What?

732
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,520
Oh, nothing.

733
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,280
Ayumi, let's give it another go.

734
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,430
I mean, give us another go.

735
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,330
I think as we are now, we can make it work.

736
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:42,040
Both you and I have changed.

737
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,400
We won't repeat the same mistakes.

738
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,370
[Finale]
[This drama is fiction.]

739
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:11,430
♫ I was fed up ♫

740
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,430
♫ Where did we... ♫
