Sasaki-san?

361
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,340
Thanks for waiting.

362
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,380
Oh, Yamagishi-san? What happened to your hair?

363
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,010
I wear a wig at work.

364
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,930
Really? I had no idea.

365
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,650
You'd be much more popular with black hair.

366
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,080
This color is fine by me.

367
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,670
- You're as strong-willed as ever.
- Not really.

368
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,170
This is a posh party.

369
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:04,270
Only those with an annual salary
over ¥9 million are invited.

370
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,850
Let's give it our all, okay?

371
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,470
Come on.

372
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,990
- Perfect.
- That looks delicious!

373
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,140
- You made us shumai (steamed dumplings)?
- No, these are xiao long bao (soup dumplings).

374
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,660
- "Xiao long bao."
- Yes.

375
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,940
- I see. Smells good.
- All right!

376
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,740
- Could I ask you to carry all these condiments?
- Sure.

377
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,070
Thanks.

378
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,360
- Listen, everyone. Katsuo made us shumai!
- Xiao long bao!

379
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,790
- That's amazing!
- They're xiao long bao.

380
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,050
- Looks good.
- Time to dig in!

381
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,980
Before you do, I want you to try
them with just salt first.

382
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,880
What? But I prefer soy sauce.

383
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,530
No, salt brings out the flavor of the dashi.

384
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,520
Then go for just vinegar.

385
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,340
But really, you can use any condiment you wish.

386
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,740
Okay, let's all dig in while they're hot!

387
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,400
- Thanks again.
- But I really recommend you start with salt.

388
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,840
- I'll dig in!
- Thank you.

389
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,280

Good luck. Be assertive, okay?

393

See you later!

394
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,420
That's a flashy head of hair you've got.

395
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,140
Oh, yes.

396
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,330
Thank you.

397
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,040
Why did you choose that color?

398
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,980
My friend recommended it.

399
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,440
I see. So it was just a friend's influence.

400
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,650
Yes.

Really? You'd make a great wife!

404
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,910
Would you hope to continue
your current job after marriage?

405
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,810
I'm not quite sure.

406
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:26,280
- Here comes the special champagne!
- Hooray!

407

Katsuo, are you okay?

414
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,640
Yes. I'm fine.

415
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,140
I think I'll head out.

416
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,990
- Already?
- Yes. I have some work to catch up on.

417
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,090
- I see.
- Yes.

418
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,930
I'll pack up now.

419
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,000

- All right then.

- If I married this individual...

440
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,890
So I think living overseas is likely for me.

441
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,970

- So...
- Yes?

503
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,630
First, you should try one with just salt.

504
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,710
- "Just salt"?
- You can appreciate the dashi flavor.

505
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,610
- For your second, go for vinegar.
- Okay.

- I'm getting nit-picky again.

510
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,550
try it with soy sauce and vinegar,
but no karashi yet.

511
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,100
For your fourth, you can go for karashi,

512
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,780
but I'd recommend you try it
with sesame oil first.

513

- No, nothing.

and they don't live together anymore.

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,420
Then where is Ayumelo living now?

- Of course.

I didn't realize how happy that'd make me.

536
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,950
I began cooking only because
I wanted you to taste my food.

537
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,700
Maybe I'll try some, too.

538
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:05,670
All right.

539
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,250
- First, salt.
- Right.

540
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,380
That's seriously good.

541
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,050
They taste great even when cool.

542
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,630
I'll take this scrap.

543
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,440
- You know...
- Yes?

544
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,070
I never realized you had such an appetite.

545
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,590
Of course, I have an appetite.

546
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,300
I only pretended to eat light around you.

547
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,720
Was I unconsciously making you
hold back on your meals too?

548
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,530
No, you weren't.

549
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,060
It wasn't your fault, Katsuo-san.

550
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,290
I wasn't able to change,
even after we parted ways.

551
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,140
I kept relying on others

552
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,950
without ever knowing what I wanted for myself.

553
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,140
I thought dyeing my hair
would be a catalyst for change.

554
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,800
I must look like a pitiful idiot.

555
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,440
You're neither pitiful nor an idiot, Ayumi.

556
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
You never were, even when we were together.

557
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,670
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.

558
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,290
I'm glad you helped me eat them.

559
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,290
I wouldn't have managed alone.

560
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,520
It was absolutely delicious.

561
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,890
Eating good food makes me want to try harder.

562
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,920
Is that so? I'm glad.

563
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,640
Thank you.

564
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,040
Sure.

565
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,170
I think I'll get going now.

566
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,260
- Are you leaving already?
- Yes?

567
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,590
- Ayumi.
- Yes?

568
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,830
Give Minato-kun my regards.

569
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,520
Minato-san and I... broke up.

570
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,040
Sorry, a friend's calling. See you.

571
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,100
Hello?

572
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,840
Ayumelo!

573
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,630
Nagisa.

574
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,090
I just heard you two broke up.

575
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,730
Are you okay? What happened?

576
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,110
- Where are you even living right now?
- Wait, too many questions.

577
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,380
Why didn't you tell me?

578
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,370
Sorry.

579
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,630
I couldn't bring myself to reach out.

580
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,390
- Ayumelo...
- Sorry.

581
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,860
You broke up with someone you love.

582
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,440
Feeling down in the dumps is a given, okay?

583
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,580
Some even cling to those people
after they break up.

584
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,460
You're upstanding for
trying to brave this out on your own.

585
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,950
At times like this,
you must scream your heart out.

586
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,630
What?

587
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,890
- Minato, you moron!
- W-Wait! You're embarrassing us!

588
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,330
You must let it all out, toss away that shame!

589
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,200
Minato, you moron!

590
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,940
Give it a try.

591
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,900
You moron!

592
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,240
Come on.

593
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,280
♫ You do as you please ♫

594
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,840
- You moron.
- Louder. I know you have it in you.

595
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,180
- You moron!
- Good, keep going.

596
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,760
- You moron!
- Keep it up.

597
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,080
- You moron!
- Minato, you moron!

598
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,470
You moron!

599
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,130
Minato, you moron!

600
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,000
- Your room is way too messy!
- Right. What else?

601
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,720
You play too many games!

602
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,050
Lay off the gaming!

603
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,430
You take baths way too late!

604
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,600
Take them earlier!

605
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:52,950
Your hair dryer's wire is all tangled!

606
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,570
That was a good one.

607
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,940
♫ Like you say, I've never known love ♫

608
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,030
Thank you, come again.

609
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,610
♫ "What-ifs" don't come true that easily ♫

610
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,810
♫ I regret it ♫

611
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,020
Evening.

612
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,010
Welcome.

613
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,600
Would you like to try some of this?

614
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,790
You wouldn't mind?

615
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,970
I opened it for tasting.

616
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,710
I wouldn't want to waste it.

617
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,030
Thank you for offering.

618
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,880
I'm sorry about what I said the other day.

619
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,290
What?

620
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,870
I thought you were only in
a casual relationship with Ayumi-san.

621
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,640
But you were right to break up
if you weren't serious about her.

622
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,540
I was serious about her.

623
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,730
I made a thoughtless remark about you two.

624
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,290
It's fine.

625
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,440
But I can't blame you for saying that to me.

626
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,490
I ended up messing with her
due to my own circumstances.

627
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,890
See, I have no desire to get married.

628
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,580
You don't?

629
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,100
Not at all. To me, marriage
is like the life of an anglerfish.

630
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,180
"An anglerfish"?

631
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,930
A male anglerfish latches onto a female

632
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:24,360
and becomes a part of the female's body.

633
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,750
They become one entity,
and the male loses his sense of self.

634
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:31,800
So... like a parasite?

635
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,000
Exactly. And that concept scares me.

636
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,250
You have to change last names,
adjust to another's lifestyle,

637
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,660
and push yourself to socialize with the relatives.

638
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,070
By that point, it feels like
you no longer exist as an individual.

639
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,080
Personally, I sort of
look up to the female anglerfish.

640
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,040
What?

641
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,890
They take in the male anglerfish as nutrition.

642
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,790
If anything, they are strong and independent.

643
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,160
I suppose that's another way of looking at it.

644
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,260
You could also say

645
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,350
becoming one entity means
you no longer have to tough it out on your own.

646
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,770
Either way, they ultimately get caught
and gobbled up by us humans.

647
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,100
Wow, scary.

648
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:23,390
- Anglerfish are delicious. Trust me.
- That's really not my point here.

649
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,540
Welcome.

650
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,300
What style are we thinking today?

651
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,590
Here you go.

652
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
Thanks.

653
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:31,350
Say, Minato-san.

654
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,370
Yes?

655
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,730
Thank you for everything.

656
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,330
I enjoyed being with you.

657
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,650
Likewise.

658
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,770
I enjoyed our time together, too.

659
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,160
Goodbye.

660
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,250
Hey, Ayu-chan!

661
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,720
Yes?

662
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,260
Your hair looks great.

663
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,050
Thanks.

664
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,460
I chose this color myself.

665
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,390
What? Ayumi-san and Minato-san broke up?

666
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,570
That's what I heard.

667
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,840
And why aren't you more surprised?

668
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,180
Are you not shocked to hear the news?

669
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,900
- No, I totally am.
- Right.

670
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,500
Hey, you can't add the stock before making a well!

671
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,950
- Oh.
- Here, give me that. I'll do it.

672
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,840
What the heck are you doing?

673
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,890
Look at what you've done.

674
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,620
First, you create a well.

675
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,620
Hasn't he gotten more annoying
now that he can cook?

676
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:58,070
- I can't wholly deny that.
- What? The well is important.

677
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:01,140
Jeez, you made the batter watery.

678
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,120
If Ayumi-san isn't dating anyone now,
isn't this your chance, Sir?

679
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,140
You want to reconcile with her, don't you?

680
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,090
Don't suggest something so ridiculous.

681
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,690
I wouldn't take advantage
of someone getting over a breakup.

682
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,770
Absolutely not.

683
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,120
I've already moved on.

684
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,350
That's good to hear, Sir.

685
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:33,270
I wouldn't want to see you
dragging this out any longer.

686
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,460
You're mixing it all anyway!

687
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,860
Hey, you distracted me!
[Home]

688
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,390
My son's not answering.

689
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:50,950
That's fine. He must be busy.

690
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,980
So? How is it with Katsuo-kun?

691
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,490
Can we expect good news soon?

692
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,210
Apparently, there's a girl
he's thinking of marrying soon.

693
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,270
Really? What's his girlfriend like?

694
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,240
- Any photo of her?
- No, but we'll take it next time she comes.

695
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,080
Are they coming to visit together?

696
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,350
- Then it's practically confirmed!
- Oh, I wonder.

697
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:11,370
- Hey.
- Yes, Dear?

698
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,640
Is this all you made?

699
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,470
What about the fish we got from the neighbors?

700
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,230
Right. I'll prepare that right away.

701
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:22,950
Hurry it up. The table's practically empty!

702
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,080
We will arrive at Oita Central Airport soon.

703
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,340
Please fasten your seatbelts and remain seated.

- What?
- The meeting between the two families.

706

Between who?
[Both families go off the rails!]

707
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,640
Seriously? What now...
[A forbidden family introduction]

708
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,600
Maybe they'll rekindle their flame
after seeing each other back home.

709
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,650
I fell in love with Ayumi-san

710
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,970
because she strived to resolve issues on her own.
[This drama is fiction.]
