What? Oh, yes. She's busy cooking.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,420
It's so reassuring to know

- You haven't?
- No.

101
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,120
It was certainly a popular term a short while ago,

102
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,580
alongside the "herbivorous man."

103
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,400
Categorizing something because it's a rarity
sort of irks me though.

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,900
Agreed. I also felt off when she
called me a "man-who-cooks."

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,890
You know,

106
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,650
I've been categorizing others all this time,

107
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,710
even though I dislike being categorized myself.

108
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,030
It's a countermeasure you take
because you don't know the other person well.

109
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,120
Fair point.

110
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,010
I wonder if those "categories"
will fade away naturally

111
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,510
if both come to understand the other.

112
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,650

They're right. This is my chance to move on.

Of course I haven't! Isn't that obvious?

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,050
Normally, I'd wear a dress like this.

135
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,860
And I wouldn't wear too many accessories.

136
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,310
I'd put on something dangly,
to really shake a man's heart.

- Hey, Ayumelo.
- Yes?

138
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,550
When you talk about how to get men,

139
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,630
why do you always emphasize
"swaying hair" or "dangling accessories"?

140
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,590
When men see something dangling,

141
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,250
their hunting instincts are awakened.
They can't help but take an interest.

142
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,940
- Is that true?
- No, I'm not that foolish.

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,880
So he says. But Taihei-kun prefers swaying breasts.

144
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,070
I never said that.

145
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,330
Hey, which dress do you think is better?

146
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,720
I think you look great as is right now.

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,330
- In these sweats?
- Yes.

148
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,430
They're not exactly date clothes, though.

149
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,450
They violate every principle I know
about capturing a man's heart.

150
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,530
You say that, but you're wearing my clothes now.

151
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,490
And I love your clothes.

152
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,350
But they're not for a date.

just as you're dressed now?

154
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,950
Well...

155
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,250
Yes?

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,760
He never said he liked me.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,230
What?

158
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,950
But... he did hug me.

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,090
- Oh.
- Even though you two aren't dating?

00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,290
What's up with that?

161
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,430
I know, right?

162
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,750
I must get him to clear things up.

163
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,750
I'll make him confess on our next date.

I sort of want to hear his ramblings as well.

353
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,030
Right?

354
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,100
Wasabi octopus is a food I dislike,

355
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,670
but you and Taihei-kun both love it.

356
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,960
Even though we feel differently about it,

357
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,950
coming to understand our differences
by opening up is quite fun.

358
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,570
Opening up is the first step
to understanding one another.

359
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,760
So there's no need to endure.

360
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,200
I don't need to endure.

361
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,710
That's right.

362
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,420
Does that include mont blanc?

363
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,790
What?

364
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,470
I have to go!

365
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,390
"Mont blanc"? Can't you save it for tomorrow?

366
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,360
Hello?

367
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,420
I'm sorry I ran out on you earlier.

368
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,910
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

369
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,480
Yes...

370
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,750
Listen.

371
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,070
Yes?

372
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,020
I...

373
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,270
couldn't tell you how I really felt all day today.

374
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,610
You see...

375
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,710
The truth is, I don't really like sweet things.

376
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,060
What?

377
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,680
I can eat pudding and things like jelly,
but not much else.

378
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,620
I enjoyed our time eating around though.

379
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,750
You should have said something.

380
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,190
And to be honest,

381
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,520
I don't exactly see why
"Squishy-Seal" is cute, either.

382
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,910
At least, not yet.

383
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,930
Hey, that's no big deal.

384
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,910
One more thing.

385
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,380
I like you, Minato-san.

386
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,480
To tell you the truth,

387
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,700
I've always hoped the man would confess.

388
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,120
I was thinking that all day today too.

389
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,910
But I realized something.

390
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,960
It doesn't matter who does the confessing.

391
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,470
I just wanted you to know what was on my mind.

392
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,550
That's why, well...

393
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,900
I wanted to tell you.

394
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I wanted to communicate exactly how I feel.

395
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,750
Minato-san.

396
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,160
Would you please...

397
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
Go out with me?

398
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,850
And if possible,

399
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,500
I'd want you to tell me everything you like

400
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,730
and dislike as well.

401
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,120
Maybe he's the one.

402
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,700
Of course!

403
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,110
I feel the same way.

404
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,370
I want to know everything about you, too.

405
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,030
Really?

406
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,640
How joyous would it feel?

407
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes!

408
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,270
Not to be a "good girlfriend" or "good wife,"

409
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,470
- but to be with someone who understands who I truly am?
- I'm so happy.

410
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,650
There we go.

411
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,650
Chikuzenni and oden.

412
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,300
- Yes.
- I see.

413
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,430
- Beer is fine with you, right?
- I'd prefer wine.

414
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,040
I have no wine.

415
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,820
- "No wine"?
- Right.

416
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,290
- You have no wine?
- But I do have Japanese sake.

417
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:06,280
Home drinking with no wine
is like the Ueno Zoo with no pandas.

418
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,340
- This woman is...
- Too bad.

419
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,830
- Here, sake.
- It's fine. Beer will do.

420
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,020
Then shall we?

421
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,860
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

422
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,910
All right.

423
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:25,310
First, let's start you with daikon and a sausage.

424
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,900
I promise it's good.

425
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,430
No kuruma-bu*? A shame.
(*Ring-shaped baked wheat gluten)

426
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,200
This woman...

427
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,580
- I'll taste it.
- Go ahead.

428
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,370
- It's really good. The daikon is especially flavorful.
- Right?

429
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,700
Of course it is. I spent an entire night
carefully prepping this—

430
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
It's as good as convenience store oden.

431
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,530
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

432
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,810
Of course, it's high praise.

433
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:03,300
It's not better than
a high-end restaurant's oden, though.

434
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,410
Oh, is that so?

435
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:09,470
The crab oden I had in Kanazawa was great,

436
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,670
especially with sake.

437
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,100
But I worked so hard.

438
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,860
Aoyama's oden was delicious, too.

439
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,330
They serve oden with caviar! Isn't that amazing?

440
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,790
She keeps comparing our odens.

441
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:25,330
Tsubaki-chan, do you usually cook?

442
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,520
I do. I toast bread for breakfast every day.

443
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,580
I often make pasta using a sauce
from a favorite restaurant of mine as well.

444
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,090
Can you really call that "cooking"?

445
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:54,460
Are you the type who thinks
women should diligently cook?

446
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,470
- No, no.
- Then let me say my piece, too.

447
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,830
Oden is just cutting and boiling ingredients, no?

448
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
Hold on a second.

449
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,990
Just listen, all right?

450
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,580
This oden...

451
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,440
is my heart and soul.

452
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,300
- Sorry?
- It's cold out, so I wanted to cook you something warm.

453
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,130
I bought a variety of ingredients,
hoping one would be your favorite.

454
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,010
I thought you'd appreciate the flavorful daikon
if I carefully prepped it.

455
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:36,160
I spent all of yesterday prepping this,
hoping you would find it delicious.

456
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,470
Well, I appreciate the effort.

457
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:46,780
Besides, it's not like you're any better
at cooking than I am, right?

458
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,270
I knew it! You're just like
the rest of them, Katsuo!

459
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,500
- Dropping formalities, I see.
- What? "Women do the cooking"?

460
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,800
- What era are we living in?
- That's not what I mean.

461
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,470
- That's not what I'm saying.
- I'm busy as is.

462
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,100
Aren't I amazing for cooking at all?

463
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,900
- Yes, and I could say the same about myself.
- Wow, you're like all the other men

464
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,180
I've met.

465
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,440
They all start by saying,
"You're fine just as you are,"

466
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:15,090
but they all ultimately hope I'll do the chores.

467
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,990
They act all benevolent,
but they're just envious of capable, working women.

468
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,390
I got it! I got it now.

469
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,080
I'm disappointed in
how thoughtless you are, Tsubaki!

470
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,300
- Dropping formalities?
- Simply put, you have an awful personality!

471
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,510
What did you just say?

472
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,020
- Whatever, I'm leaving.
- And your actions!

473
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,410
Your actions...

474
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,990
Wait.

475
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,310
Your actions remind me of myself.

476
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,500
Oh, man...

477
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,860
I never thought about the person making the food.

478
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,750
I would just... To Ayumi, I...

479
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,590
But if I had to say,

480
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,050
I think the side dishes look mostly too brown.

481
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,590
I prefer dinner made fresh.

482
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,820
Microwaving it ruins the taste.

483
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,840
The side dishes and miso soup
use the same ingredients.

484
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,620
Thanks for dinner.

485
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,850
Tsubaki,

486
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,940
you are me.

487
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,920
You're the version of me that Ayumi saw.

488
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,410
Every single day,

489
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,780
I trampled all over Ayumi's feelings.

490
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,390
I...

491
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:41,460
Is this "Ayumi" your ex-girlfriend?

492
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,930
Yes.

493
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,430
Katsuo.

494
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,560
Let's drink.

495
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,950
Sure.

496
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,010
- I signed up for this dating app to forget my ex.
- Yes.

497
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,690
Yes!

498
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,650
But I end up comparing every guy to him.

499
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,310
- Exactly. You get it!
- Ouch!

500
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,760
I signed up for the exact same reason.

501
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,410
The two of us have broken up, and yet...

502
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,500
I still love her.

503
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,180
You think that's bad?
I've been hung up for two years now.

504
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,320
- "Two years"?
- Two!

505
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,470
- No way! Seriously?
- Crazy, right?

506
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,560
They say women move on quickly,
but that's not true.

507
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,640
Yes? Well, I'm a man,

508
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,810
yet I cry into my pillow every night.

509
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,580
- Damn it!
- Oh...

510
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,000
Oh!

511
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,930
Say...

512
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:54,600
Is this... a budding friendship?

513
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,790
- "A budding friendship"?
- Right.

514
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,480
What? Have you never made a friend before?

515
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,720
Of course I have! I'll throttle you.

516
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,210
Then have you ever befriended a woman?

517
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,340
- "Befriended a woman."
- Yes.

518
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,010
Now that's a first.

519
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,910
I see.

520
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,080
Here's to our friendship, my fellow in heartbreak.

521
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,590
"Fellow in heartbreak..."

522
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,890
- Cheers!
- You spilled your drink on me!

523
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,950
Jeez, I've done it. I've really done it now.

524
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,280
Morning.

525
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,990
I've really done it...

526
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,220
Wait.

527
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,300
- Did we do it?
- Of course not.

528
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,960
Now sleep, sleep.

529
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,080
Friend or not, we definitely can't
sleep in the same room!

530
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,430
That was what you said
before immediately passing out.

531
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,620
Thank god! That was a close one.

532
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,490
I'll make us breakfast, to thank you for the oden.

533
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,930
Done!

534
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,780
- Ready for breakfast?
- Thanks.

535
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,880
Voilà! My specialty, natto* toast.
(*Fermented Soybeans)

536
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,910
- So this is natto toast?
- Yes.

537
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,430
First time having it?

538
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:29,870
I knew of its existence,
but yes, it's the first time.

539
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,810
Score! Another first taken from Katsuo.

540
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,820
Don't make it sound like an innuendo.

541
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,290
- Shall we dig in?
- Sure.

542
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,450
That's good.

543
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,520
What in the world?

544
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,360
Eating something smelly together

545
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,210
makes me feel we're really friends now.

546
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:12,920
I wonder why I feel so happy
to have a female friend?

547
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:21,630
Maybe because you realize you can
become friends with the other 50% of humanity?

548
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,120
It's not about whether someone's a man or woman.

549
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,440
It's about understanding one another, as people.

550
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,490
- Breakfast is almost ready.
- Thanks.

551
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,110
If I had seen Ayumi not as my girlfriend

552
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,400
but simply as another person...

553
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,220
Chicken was the right call.

554
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,140
I'll give it a try, too.

555
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,880
How should we spend our next day off?
[Minato-san]

556
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,090
What?

557
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,760
Are things going well?

558
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,180
I'm happy for you.

559
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:17,770
"I want to drink... tequila... together."

560
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,070
And, "send." I really sent it.

561
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,350
Well...

562
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,330
- Having tacos for breakfast is a true luxury.
- What?

563
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,050
I'm really glad you're around, Ayumelo.

564
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,830
And I'm happy to be here.

565
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,030
I've only ever had Japanese for breakfast.

566
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,490
- Chicken's good.
- Really?

567
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,700
- Yes.
- Good.

568
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,100
[Can't wait!]

569
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:47,770
I wonder... If I had communicated
like this with Katsuo-san,

570
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,570
would things have been different?

571
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,200
That was delicious. Thanks for breakfast.

572
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,640
- Good, right?
- Yes.

573
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,010
I wish Ayumi could try some.

574
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,570
I know how you feel.

575
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:11,300
Eating something delicious reminds me of the person I love.

576
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,410
One day, I want to cook all of Ayumi's favorites

577
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,770
and have her taste them.

578
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,800
- What?
- Ayumi's favorite foods.

579
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,370
I just realized I never asked;
I never even thought to.

580
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,860
Wow, that's just bad.

581
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,800
It's a bit too late to have that epiphany, right?

582
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,000
Right.

583
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,990
The other day, I saw Ayumi with a guy, and...

584
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,630
No. Nope.

585
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,020
No, it couldn't be. Ayumi would never.

586
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,090
She'd never hug someone in public.
It's too scandalous.

587
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,860
What's so scandalous about a single woman
hugging someone she likes?

588
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,520
Though, I guess she might not be single anymore.

589
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,190
Now, now...

590
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:21,040
Still, I think you might want to convey
that regret to her, at least once.

591
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,480
Yes.

592
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,390
I'm sure

593
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:29,050
she still misunderstands
the granulated dashi thing as well.

594
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:34,870
You should talk to her once more
and tell her how you feel.

595
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,860
[There's something I want to discuss.
Could we briefly meet up?]

596
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,990
Ayumi?

597
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,440
Jeez! What are you doing, Katsuo?

598
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,890
Wow, I didn't expect that!

599
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,530
- Ayumi.
- Katsuo-san.

600
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,300
- What brings you here?
- What?

601
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,340
It's the closest grocery store to where I live.
Of course, I'd drop by.

602
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,510
Oh, I see. That makes sense.

603
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,960
Well then...

604
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,260
Could we talk?

605
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,210
Sure.

606
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,760
- Do you have time now?
- I do.

607
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm sorry.

608
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,640
What?

609
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,870
The other day, I ran out on you all

610
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,560
even though you offered me a meal.

611
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,400
No, it's fine. Don't let that bother you.

612
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,610
That was because I...

613
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,850
Well...

614
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:07,860
I want to properly convey to you
how I feel, Katsuo-san.

615
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,590
I was able to change, thanks to you.

616
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,950
I left you without
actually speaking my mind, didn't I?

617
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,130
Well, I've thought about many things after I left.

618
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:38,300
And I realized things might have been different
if I'd actually expressed how I felt.

619
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,950
Since we've parted ways,

620
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:49,040
I've realized what it means to truly love.

621
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,240
Katsuo-san...

622
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,520
I...

623
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,650
Ayumi, I also—

624
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,840
I have a boyfriend now.

625
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,940
And I really, truly love him.

626
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:18,460
When I was in a relationship with you,

627
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,150
I turned a blind eye to my own feelings.

628
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,030
I didn't even know what I liked.

629
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,580
I thought only about qualifications

630
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,240
and how convenient life would be with me.

631
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,700
I made every decision rationally.

632
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,560
That's why...

633
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,600
I think that's why it hurt to stay with you.

634
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,570
But now, I've changed.

635
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,310
And I owe my change to you, Katsuo-san.

636
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,700
Since we parted so abruptly...

637
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:10,100
I wanted a chance to convey my gratitude to you.

638
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,140
Katsuo-san,

639
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,520
thank you for everything.

640
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,160
Likewise.

641
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,280
Thank you.

642
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,510
Then I'm going now.

643
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:06,350
[Onboro]

644
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,390
Katsuo, over here.

645
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,010
Jeez, what happened? Here.

646
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,510
Why did you suddenly invite me out?

647
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,070
Because you were bawling over the phone.

648
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,760
I was not "bawling."

649
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,870
- Evening.
- I can't leave someone crying alone, can I?

650
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:32,090
Come on, let's get you a drink, okay?

651
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,660
Taihei-kun, this man
needs something "deadly strong."

652
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,250
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

653
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,340
- Could I get your signature?
- Sure.

654
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,880
- You are bawling.
- Am not!

655
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,720
Fine, fine.

656
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,320
What?

657
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,190
- Thanks for your continuous patronage.
- Sure thing.

658
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,340
Hey, what gives?

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,620

Hey, was that Ayumelo's...

667
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,450
- Cheers.
- Yes, he delivers alcohol here.

668
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,580
Oh, I had no idea.

669
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:40,720
Yes, you know our regulars,
Sumi-chan and Sekita-san? He's also their ex.

670
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,550
- What? He's exes with two people here?
- Yes.

671
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,170
He isn't anyone suspicious, right?

672
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:48,330
I'm back.

673
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,640
- Smells great.
- Welcome home, Minato-san.

674
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,260
- Wow, this looks great!
- It's napolitan (pasta dish).

675
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,300
Two ex-girlfriends from the same bar
sounds suspicious to me.

676
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,120
I guess. It might just be a coincidence, though.

677
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,400
"A coincidence"? I hope so.

678
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,090
This is so strong.

679
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,240
Excuse me.

680
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,160
Could I hear more about that, in detail?

- Absolutely not!
- He's practicing mass consumption...
