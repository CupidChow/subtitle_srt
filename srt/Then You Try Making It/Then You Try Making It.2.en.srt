- You look cute when enjoying tequila.

524
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,810
What?

525
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,380
See? You're even a bit red.

526
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,700
Oh, gosh, you're right.

527
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,220
Let's take a picture.

528
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,640
It turned out great.

529
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,960
You're right.

530
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,780
I remember now.

531
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,320
Excuse me.

532
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,630
Are you a leftie?

533
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,670
Yes.

534
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,890
Me, too.

535
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,650
I see.

536
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,880
- And you hold utensils with...
- My left hand.

537
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,850
Same here.

538
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,580
Which hand do you throw with?

539
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,820
I throw with my right.

540
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,360
- Same here.
- Really?

541
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,450
The first time I spoke to Katsuo-san,

542
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,830
I didn't care about "conditions" at all,

543
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,900
and I felt something welling up
naturally from my heart.

544
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,880
Here.

545
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:40,110
I noticed something about
Ebikatsu's recent bentos.

546
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,870
He brings chikuzenni for lunch every single day.

547
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,200
"Every single day"?

548
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,300
Yes. And he looks constipated about it too.

549
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,620
Why?

550
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,450
Who knows? I hope he's all right, though.

551
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,610
I thought you couldn't stand Ebihara-san.

552
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,710
Well, sure.

553
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,400
But I now see where you were coming from.

554
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,280
- I see.
- Hey.

555
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,250
I need advice from you guys.

556
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,750
- Welcome.
- Thanks for having us.

557
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,250
Place your stuff here.
Shirosaki, the kitchen's all yours.

558
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,960
- I'll put my stuff here.
- Then I'll use the kitchen.

559
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,750
Go ahead.

560
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,340
Hey, you're drinking already?

561
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,500
And I didn't even invite you over.

562
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,280
Now, now, don't sweat the details.

563
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,900
- So, Shirosaki.
- Yes, Sir?

564
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,340
You'll teach me how to make chikuzenni, right?

565
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,580
I don't know the hidden trick
to Ayumi-san's chikuzenni.

566
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,840
But I can put a delicious twist
on the chikuzenni you have now.

567
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,730
- Canned tomatoes?
- Yes.

568
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,660
Impossible.

569
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,300
- And curry roux?
- Yes.

570
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,190
Seriously?

571
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,810
- Unbelievable...
- I got thirsty, okay?

572
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,330
But already?

573
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,590
Delicious.

574
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,300
Yes?

575
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,510
I came to return my key.

576
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,890
Ayumi?

577
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,890
Here. I still had mine.

578
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,650
Farewell.

579
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,450
- Ayumi—
- Would you like to join us for curry?

580
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,040
- What?
- The rice is just about cooked too.

581
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,880
Besides, curry tastes better when eaten together.

582
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,640
Ayumi, would you like to join us?

583
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,710
Minamikawa, toss out your empty cans.

584
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,390
Yes, Sir.

585
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,850
Well...

586
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,670
Ayumi, have a seat.

587
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,390
Here, sit.

588
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,190
Shirosaki, I'll handle the rest.

589
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,890
Then if you'd please.

590
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,080
Ebihara-san cooks now.

591
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,340
What?

592
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:08,450
He makes chikuzenni every day
in a quest to mimic your flavor.

593
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,240
Katsuo-san cooks?

594
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,760
Sounds unbelievable, no?

595
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,040
Yes, he's trying to change.

596
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,720
What?

597
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,320
Hey now, what's up with that?

598
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,930
Looking good, Sir.

599
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,200
I don't mind taste-testing for you.

600
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,700
Don't act so pompous; you didn't even help.

601
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,050
- Here, have a taste.
- Will do.

602
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,950
That's rather good for your cooking, Ebihara-san.

603
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,380
- Wow!
- Wait a second.

604
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,020
But I think it needs a bit more punch.

605
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,460
- What shall we do then?
- Are there any spices we can use?

606
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,250
Maybe around here?

607
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,470
How about this one?

608
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,470
- I don't know about that.
- I'll look over here.

609
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,030
- Let's see...
- Oh!

610
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,310
Right, since you're here, Ayumi.

611
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Could you teach me your chikuzenni recipe?

612
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,390
- What?
- I can't replicate your flavor, no matter what.

613
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,910
If you could just tell me your recipe,
I'd appreciate it.

614
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,420
"Just tell you my recipe..."

615
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,920
You finally got to ask her.

616
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,480
- Finally, you'll be freed from your daily chikuzenni.
- Exactly.

617
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,040
Say, could this possibly be
the flavor you're missing?

618
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,020
Ayumi-san, did you use this for your base?
[Granulated Dashi]

619
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:40,520
- Granulated dashi?
- Yes.

620
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,020
No, that can't be...

621
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,250
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

622
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,020
- What? Wait!
- Ayumi-san?

623
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,020
[Granulated Dashi]

624
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,810
Do you feel betrayed?

625
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,190
No, it's not like that.

626
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,820
But when we first moved in together,

627
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,940
I watched Ayumi make a dashi stock from scratch.

628
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,970
My family used sardines,
but because you're "Katsuo-san,"

629
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,610
I tried using dried bonito (katsuo).

630
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,610
Sounds wonderful.

631
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,810
Wonderful indeed.

632
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,300
Here you go.

633
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,210
- This is delicious.
- Is it?

634
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,550
- Yes.
- I'm glad.

635
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,040
Wow, this is good.

636
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,420
From now on, this will be our household's flavor.

637
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,690
But I was wrong.

638
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,360
I thought I knew it all.

639
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,820
I never noticed...
I was pushing her to her limits.

640
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,480
I'm disappointed in myself.

641
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,900
Ebihara-san, you have to tell her that.

642
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,790
Ayumi-san!

643
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,400
Minato-san.

644
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,950
- Sorry I called for you without prior notice.
- It's fine.

645
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,040
I was already out and about.

646
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,960
I just suddenly wanted to see you.

647
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,890
Oh, my gosh.

648
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,730
I'm so sorry. What's wrong with me?

649
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,610
It's not that I want to cry, I just...

650
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,300
I'm sorry. Using granulated dashi
was such a given to me.

651
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,660
I didn't realize it was
such a point of contention.

652
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,810
It's not your fault, Shirosaki.

Sorry you have to see me like this.

656
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,920
- Let it out.
- I'm not crying.

657
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,720
- Men are allowed to cry.
- I'm not crying!

658
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,360
- I won't cry.
- Right. Let's eat this curry!

659
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,300
Great idea.

660
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,640

You're so adorable!

than in your photo.

Well, I wouldn't say that.
