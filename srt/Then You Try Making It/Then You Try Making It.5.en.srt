- Welcome home.

- It's a bit...
- Tough.

No, it's still delicious though.

45

No worries at all.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,840
My umbrella was stolen at the convenience store,

50
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,730
so I stopped by Minato's shop
because it was close by.

51
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,940
Yes, and I first took her to the station,

52
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,020
but the trains weren't running either.

53
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,990
That's when Minato kindly said
I should come to his place.

You two are...

We used to date, just for a bit though.

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,680
- You're his ex?
- I promise there's nothing between us now.

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,550
Honestly, it feels funny when you call me his ex.

63
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,150
I think, "Am I really?"

64
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,110
I get that. It's like when
I became an eighth grader,

65
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,030
- and the juniors suddenly started calling me "senpai."
- Totally!

66
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,630
- I feel nostalgic!
- Yes, so weird.

67
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,290
- Right?
- I feel anxious.

68
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,660

69

Yes, Sir.

75
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,660
Man, when I first heard Ebihara-kun
broke up with his girlfriend,

76
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,260
I was worried.

77
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,780
But he's really perked up lately, hasn't he?

78
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,360
He sure has.

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,180
I only hope he's not pushing himself.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,310
What? Do you think he might be?

81
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,970
Well, he was depressed until just recently.

82
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,830
I see. He really doesn't show it though.

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,740
What an admirable guy.

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,440
Hey, Minamikawa.

85
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,160
- What?
- Your nails have gotten too long.

86
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,180
You knew you were handling the remote today.

87
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,780
What if you scratch it?

88
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm pressing the buttons
with my finger, not my nails.

89
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,370
But what if your nail grazes it?

90
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,430
It won't. You're nitpicking.

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,040
They're too long.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,670
I guess the word "admirable" doesn't suit him.

93
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,430
Why not? Just look at how
Minamikawa-san has warmed up to him.

94
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,270

- Oh, sorry.
- Wait a second.

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,550
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries, just raise the lid.

98
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,610
- Sir, just stay still.
- Press the button and open the lid with the remote.

99
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,840
- Oh, no.
- Come on. Raise it up.

100

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,040

- It's fine, just calm down.

- I can hear it going up and down.

104
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,480
- How about turning it off for now?
- One moment.

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,960
Just restart the remote and give it another go.

106
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,320
- Almost got it.
- This is starting to hurt.

than defrosting your freezer?

- With pleasure.
- Hey now...

139
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,340
My baby brother grew up absolutely coddled.

140
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,040
He was even a crybaby. Some man, right?

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,700
- No...
- He is sweeter than the soy sauce from Kyushu.

- They have plans tonight.

145
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,460
But, man, Tokyo is full of chain stores,

146

so it tastes the same everywhere.

- Let's go somewhere proper tonight, all right?
- Sure.

148
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,420
- Here, I found a good place close by.
- Great.

You can say that again.

153
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,180
I guess that earlier call was from his onii-san.

154
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,020
- What?
- Ebihara-san didn't take it.

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,920
Does he dislike his brother?

156
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,700

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,000
You're getting older.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,180
You must give Mom and Pops reassurance.

179
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,990
Your mackerel with sesame. Enjoy.

180
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,720
- What about you, Nii-san?
- What?

181
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,370
What brings you to Tokyo?

182
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,590
Maybe you've heard.
I'm taking over Pops' company next year.

183
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,770
So I needed to meet some folks about that.

184
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,080
The whole ordeal's been a huge hassle, you know?

185
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,150
Especially since all the employees hate Pops
for one reason or another.

186
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,920
- They do?
- Yes.

187
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,710
I thought they all respected him.

188
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,810
Oh, gosh. When did they ever?

189
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,440
They've only ever complained about his nitpicking.

190
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,180
- Don't hunch over your keyboard; you'll make mistakes.
- Sorry, Sir.

191
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,780
You'll get your desk dirty.

192
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,920
Drinking coffee again?

193
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,960
And three cans of the stuff?

194
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,400
Do you realize how difficult it is
to patch up the office after he visits?

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,530
I had no idea.

196
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,400
A bit salty for my taste.

197
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,140
I heard you're coming back
to visit us in Oita next month.

198
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,270
What?

199
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,760
You're attending a friend's wedding
with Ayumi-chan, right?

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,220
Oh, that's right.

201
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,230
It'd be great if the whole family
could gather when you two visit.

202
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,410
See, we haven't taken a picture since this one.

203
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,770
- That's a nostalgic shot.
- Right?

204
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,520
How about Torayoshi Nii-san?

205
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,160
- Does he visit home often?
- No.

206
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
Only once in a while.

207
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,730
He has a child, so he should visit more often.

208
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:33,370
Speaking of children, will you have any
for Mom and Pops to meet soon?

209
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,620
Yes, eventually.

210
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,360
I remember you wanted
enough children to fill a baseball team.

211
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,470
How is Yurika-san? Is she doing well?

212
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,130
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

213
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,490
Could we get chicken tempura?

214
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,610
Sorry, Sir, we don't serve chicken tempura here.

215
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,040
What?

216
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,900
- Sorry, Sir.
- That's all right. Thank you.

217
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,640
Unbelievable. They don't have
chicken tempura here!

218
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,470
For a Kyushu Izakaya, it's surprising.

219
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,650
There are places that carry it.

220
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,400
Really, now.

221
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,140
There's nothing like chicken tempura
with Kyushu yuzu chili paste though.

222
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,360
"Chicken tempura..."

223
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,300
I haven't had it in a while.

224
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,100
Have Ayumi-chan make it for you.

225
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,600
She makes delicious chicken tempura.

226
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,270
Remember when I stayed
at your place that one time?

227
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,730
Man, I still crave that meal.

228
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,660
Maybe I'll try making it myself some time.

229
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,050
What?

230
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,670
I've started learning how to cook.

Welcome back. You're early today.

240
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Yes, I dashed back home
because I missed you, Ayu-chan.

241
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,020
Sorry for suddenly inviting
Ko-chan over last night.

242
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,000
It's fine. I didn't mind.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,580
- Here.
- Oh?

244
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,120
I found some stuff I thought you'd like.

248
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,450
- Thanks.
- Sure.

249
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,230
- May I take a bath first?
- Go ahead.

250
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,070
- I sweat a lot today.
- Really?

251
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,440
Yes. I'll be out in a second.

252
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,160
Take your time.

Let's meet up again some time!
[Ko-chan]

254
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,900
I know I shouldn't let it bother me.

255
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,620
- But it does, right?
- Yes.

256
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,170
Can't you express
your displeasure to him about it?

257
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,580
Just say you don't want him meeting his ex.

258
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't think Minato-san could
ignore a person in need, because he is kind.

259
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,320
Also, he has many friends,

260
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,810
so I bet he can't say no to them,
and there's probably nothing between them.

261
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,920
You don't sound certain at all.

262
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,830
And you won't know unless you ask him.

263
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,520
I know that.

264
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,720
By the way, I actually met your ex the other day.

265
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,860
- What was his name...
- Katsuo-san?

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,770
- Right.
- What?

267
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,870
He was at Taihei-kun's bar the other night.

268
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,500
Why?

269
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,080
Beats me.

270
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,450
He seemed worried about you, though.

271
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,110
He was drinking while crying his eyes out.

272
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,740
- He cried his eyes out?
- Yes.

273
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,420
- Katsuo-san did?
- Yes.

274
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,440
What? No, that's impossible.

275
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,180
Katsuo-san keeps his tears
and weaknesses within him.

276
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,080
He keeps them locked in a safe

277
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,510
found only at the bottom of an ocean.

278
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,340
It sounds like you're describing
something dangerous.

279
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,360
But it's true. That's how he is.

280
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,120
Maybe there's a side to him you don't know.

281
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,730
You never know everything about a person,
no matter how long you've dated.

00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,930
They are. My nii-san just gave me too many.

354
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,650
Well, thanks for sharing.

- Yes.

He can do anything.

- Yes.

451

Yes.

452
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,210
The tempura you made for me
was delicious, Ayu-chan.

453
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:34,800
I will assist him, but chicken tempura
is a first for me as well.

- What?
- I want to try this "chicken tempura," too.

- This place is huge.

461
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,510
Right.

462
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,610
- First, Katsuo-san, can you cut the chicken breast into cubes?
- Yes.

463
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,740
- Sure.
- Shirosaki-san, can you grate the garlic and ginger?

464
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,120
Will do.

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,860
- Will you give up? Yes!
- Seriously?

466
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,500
You're quite good at this.

467
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,450
That's because I practiced several times.

468
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,150
But this is where I started having issues.

469
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,490
I can't get the batter right.

470
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:43,430
You must never make the batter sticky.

471
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,750
- "Never"?
- Right.

472
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,710
A good tempura must be crisp.

473
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:54,360
If it's sticky, the tempura sinks into the oil,
since it gets heavy.

474
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,020
That's it.

475
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,310
So you want your batter to be smooth,
not thick and sticky.

476
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,570
- Yes.
- Good.

477
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,760
That makes so much sense.

478
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,500
Here, mix this.

479
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,870
Right. Sorry, Shirosaki.

480
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,110
- Hold on.
- Wh-What?

481
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,350
Don't over mix, or you'll activate the gluten.

482
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,170
"Gluten"?

483
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,490
The stuff in bread?

484
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,800
Exactly. And tempura needs no gluten.

485
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,340
Lumps are okay, so mix by cutting into the batter.

486
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,870
- "Cutting."
- Yes.

487
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,270
- Okay.
- Can you do that?

488
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,520
- I can.
- Okay, good.

489
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,190
Cutting...

490
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,030
- Am I doing this right?
- You are.

491
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,990
- Great. Cut into the batter...
- That's right.

492
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,060
- Exactly like that.
- Cutting in...

493
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,840
Mix by cutting.

494
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,930
This already looks so different from mine.

495
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,630

Wait, make sure you wipe your hands,

499
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,320
or you'll make the oil splatter.

500
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,040
- That's why the oil was getting everywhere?
- Yes.

501

Wow, you're amazing.

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:11,340

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,950
Are you good on time?

529
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:42,140
- Oh!
- We'll drive you to the airport.

530
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,050
I parked my car downstairs. Feel free to get in.

531
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,460
This is my girlfriend, Aoko-chan.
Earlier, I called her to come over.

532
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,400
Thank you.

533
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,100
Great! That's a big help!

534
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,190
- It looks delicious.
- Good.

535
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,850
It looks so good!

536
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,860
Oh?

537
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,990
What is it?

538
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,920
Something's missing.

539
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,270
The yuzu chili paste.

540
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,810
"Yuzu chili paste"?

541
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,810
No, wait a minute.

542
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,620
I don't have any.

543
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,980
Oh, no...

544
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,250
Nii-san always has to have
yuzu chili paste from Kyushu with chicken tempura.

545
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,450
We might have some at our place.

546
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,120
- Really?
- I'll go get it.

547
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,480
- You will?
- We'll follow on my bike once we grab it.

548
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,130
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

549
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,110
If I may ask, what is
weighing on your onii-san's mind?

550
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,610
I have no idea.

551
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:51,420
He has a wonderful wife and a successful career.

552
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,880
His life's been going great.

553
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,230
Our father often says having children
is all that remains, but...

554
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:08,350
Speaking of children, will you have any
for Mom and Pops to meet soon?

555
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,610
Did I say something uncalled for again?

556
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,590
I've made a similar mistake, too.

557
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,890
You, too, Aoko-chan?

558
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:24,290
When I was a child, I once asked my frail aunt
why she didn't have any children.

559
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,160
My mother scolded me like crazy afterwards.

560
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,160
You were only a child. You didn't know any better.

561
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,030
Maybe.

562
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:38,520
But when I think back
to how my aunt must have felt,

563
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:42,690
it makes me never want to forgive
myself from back then.

564
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,940
So to avoid repeating such mistakes,

565
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,940
I want to try to understand and imagine
other people's perspectives.

566
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,210
Found it.

00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,340
Thanks!

569
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,810
- Thank you, really!
- Go, Sir!

570
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,490
I will.

571
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,350
- Maybe this way?
- Katsuo-san!

572
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,600
Katsuo-san, here.

573
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,020
The chili paste.

574
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,070
Thank you.

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,110
Nii-san.

Hey! What's up?

578
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,830
Here. Eat that.

579
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,480
What's this?

580
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,180
Chicken tempura.

581
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,900
"Chicken tempura"?

582
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:54,390
I made it myself.

583
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,800
You cooked this? I'm scared to eat it.

584
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,250
I promise it's crispy.

585
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,980
So you say.

586
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,870
But you know what?

587
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,530
I couldn't manage to make that on my own.

588
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,230
All my attempts ended up burnt and half raw.

589
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,090
And soggy too.

590
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,990
In other words...

591
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,550
I couldn't do it on my own!

592
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,380
- Katsuo, calm down.
- So don't carry the burden by yourself!

593
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,500
What?

594
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,820
If something's bothering you,
talk to someone about it!

595
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,280
It doesn't have to be me.

596
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,820
You can talk to a friend, anybody.

597
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,650
But I want you to rely on someone.

598
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,070
What's all this? You're overreacting.

599
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,590
What are you so worried about?

600
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,650
I'm fine.

601
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm well equipped to handle my problems on my own.

602
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,400
Deal with it, Katsuo!

603
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,810
Someone who leads his family
can't show anyone his weaknesses!

604
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,140
You're a man, are you not?

605
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,430
Come on.

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,690
- Don't cry!
- No, I will cry! I will!

607
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,040
I'll cry because I'm worried about you.

608
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,350
It hurts to see you worry about something alone.

609
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,700
It hurts to see you struggling.

610
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:05,190
Don't lock your feelings away.

611
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,880
Don't keep them to yourself.

Please.

My chicken tempura has taken flight.

615
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,200
Your tempura has what now?

616
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,360
All children must leave the nest eventually, Sir.

617
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,910
They do.

618
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,450
What are you two talking about?

619
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,470

00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,800
Sure. What's up?

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,180
- Thank you.
- What?

625
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,940
My husband and I haven't been
on speaking terms for a while.

626
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,360
But when Taka-kun returned home from Tokyo,

627
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,600
he suddenly said he wanted to talk.
[Infertility Treatment]

628
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,580
I'm sorry I kept avoiding this.

629
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,550
I worried the issue might be with me.

630
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,850
I was scared.

631
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,430
I felt ashamed.

632
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,760
Still...

633
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,240
I want us to try.

We can try, but it might not work out, you know?

Even if it doesn't,

636
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,950
will you stay by my side?

637
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,070
I won't get into the specifics of it.

638
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,760
It was unusual for my prideful Taka-kun
to show his weakness.

639
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,940
So I asked him what happened.

640
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,600
He then started talking about
the chicken tempura you made.

641
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,410

Say, Ayu-chan.

707
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,740
There's something we need to discuss.

708
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,390
What is it?

709
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,300
I think...

710
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,560
we should break up.

711
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,900
[Preview]

712
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,560
- Why?
- I heard she left his place.

713
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,980
Then where is Ayumelo living now?
[A chance for the living fossil!]

714
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,200
It's your chance, Sir.
[A chance for the living fossil!]

715
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,210
You want to reconcile with her, right?
[A chance for the living fossil!]

716
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,530
Ayumi, I began cooking because I wanted you to taste my food.
