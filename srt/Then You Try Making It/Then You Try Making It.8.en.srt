Today's the day.

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,460
Today's the day I tell her.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,670
- I'm home.
- Welcome back!

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,080
Mom, we need to talk.

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,400
Look, I made you chikuzenni!

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,530
- It looks delicious.
- I know it's one of your favorites, Dear.

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,990
- Mom.
- Now sit, sit.

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,290
I'm just about to fry up some spring rolls.

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,970
I can't do it.

10
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,570
Making spring rolls is tedious, isn't it?

11
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,360
No, not really.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,290
But I feel so bad to have you
cook for me every night.

13
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,300
So you'd better...

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,850
Oh, come on! This is nothing.

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,510
Just take it easy and rest now.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,660
I can't ask her to leave.

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,130
Right.

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,580
Evening! Your delivery is here.

19
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,900
Sorry for the wait.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,910
- Thanks for being a loyal customer.
- Yes.

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,470

Mom, thank you for cooking all this. Really.

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,950
Gosh!

29
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,410
Your father just eats and doesn't even thank me.

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,620
These noodles are hard.

31
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,280
Well...

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,620
I knew it. You've reminded me of something.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,110
What's that?

34
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,250
This is the joy of cooking for another.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,340
You're holding a Mexican festival here?
[Fiesta Mexicana]

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,560
It sounds exciting.

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,680
On that note, Ayumelo,
I'd like to ask you a favor.

38
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,880
What is it?

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,860
Could you make Mexican food for the festival?

40
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,330
What? Me?

41
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,840
I want to eat your tacos again, Ayumelo.

42
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,340
No way! I'm fine with making foods for my friends.

43
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,620
But my food is nothing worth paying for.

44
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,930
- That's not true, right?
- Yes.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,700
I made those tacos for you two
using store-bought shells.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,460
You should hire a real expert.

47
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,870
"A real expert"?

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,470
- A real expert of the cuisine.
- Like?

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,390
Someone with one of those wide hats?

50
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,510
- I'll at least buy you a hat.
- You know that's not what I mean.

51
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,750
Sorry, sorry.

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,700
But putting aside whether you can,

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,160
do you want to do this or not?

54
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,950
You do, don't you?

55
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,260
- I do.
- Then it's settled.

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,560
- Thanks a million.
- Thanks.

57

- I wonder if I can handle this.
- Evening.

- Any time.
- All right.

60
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,860
I guess I'll need to order more tequila
for the festival, too.

61
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,640
- "Festival"?
- Yes.

62

64

Oh, right...

66
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,550
- Thanks again.
- Sure thing.

67
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,650
- I'll be back with your next shipment.
- Sure.

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,840
Why don't you come, Minato-san?

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,260
What? You wouldn't mind?

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,840
No, come. I'll be making tacos.

You won't have another opportunity
to try Ayumelo's tacos.

73
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,430
Okay, count me in!

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,640
I'll definitely be there.

Mom is with Pops every waking hour.
She must've been stressed.

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,860
I'm sure she just needs time away.

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,980
I understand that,
but she's already been here a whole week!

79

Let her have this, okay? Just deal with it.

80
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,550
- Katsuo, I'm coming in.
- Mom's here. I'll call again.

I sent your wrinkled suit from the closet
to the dry cleaner's as well.

Hang on. You looked in my closet?

86
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,570
Suits must be dry cleaned every season, Dear.

87
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,880
I suppose you need a woman around
to notice these things.

88

I just don't know if I can
efficiently make one tortilla at a time.

127

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,590
Are you heading out already?

178
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,170
Yes, I was planning on it.

179
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,880
Is that so?

180
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,890
See you around.

181
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,630
Yes, see you.

182
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,520
[Then You Try Making It!]

183
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,240
That's good.
[Episode 8: My ancient mom is visiting!]

184
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,360
[Episode 8: My ancient mom is visiting!]

185
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,100
The dashi is just amazing!

186
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,230
I see you're still a hearty eater.

187
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,710
That's only because your cooking is so delicious.

188
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,110
I'm serious.

189
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:50,530
Say, Mom, don't you need to head back soon?

190
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,560
Back to where?

191
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,170
Well, you know...

192
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,210
to Oita.

193
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,010
Dad must be worried sick about you.

194
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,000
That man thinks only of himself.

195
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,900
How about this? I'll leave once
you get yourself a girlfriend.

196
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,720
Just joking!

197
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,420
- I'll get us some tea.
- Thanks.

198
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,380
I can't tell her to leave,
even if I am tortured to speak.

199
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,050
- Do you understand?
- Want me to test your theory?

200
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,880
- Please.
- I was joking.

201
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,400
I do agree it's tough to have
a parent around all the time.

202
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,480
You understand me.

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,910
Why are you crying, Sir?

204
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,090
I was just thinking about Mom.

205
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,610
You're lucky to be able to enjoy
your mother's cooking.

206
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,510
I haven't been able to for some time now.

207
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,490
I'm so sorry.

208
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,310
Chief, didn't you recently
go on a vacation with your mother?

209
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,700
Yes, I did.

210
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,250
Oh, she's not dead.

211
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,450
My wife hates visiting home.

212
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,290
That's why I haven't had
my mother's cooking in a while.

213
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,900
You're such a mama's boy!

214
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
- What? Me? I'm not, right?
- You're not.

215
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,250
I have a good idea.

216
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,760
Have Minamikawa pretend to be your girlfriend.

217
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,980
- Why me?
- Your mother will leave if you have a girlfriend, right?

218
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,070
- That's a great idea!
- I like that.

219
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,590
- What? No way!
- Seriously.

220
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,630
That's a very good idea.

221
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,160
Wait, won't a girl like Minamikawa-san
only make her worry more?

222
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,990
- What do you mean by that, Chief?
- Minamikawa.

223
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,450
Please.

224
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,170
I'm begging you.

225
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,090
- Absolutely not!
- Why?

226
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,600
Then what do I do?

227
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Figure that out yourself.

228
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,830
But I'm at a loss!

229
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,820
- Why not? Do him a favor.
- No way!

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,010
I don't know anyone else who'd act the part!

231
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,980
That's right.

232
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,040
- Come on, take one for the team.
- Why?

233
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,610
- He'll treat you afterward.
- I take that back.

234
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,280
Coming.

235
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,120
My girlfriend.

236
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,960
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kashikura Tsubaki.

237
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,270
Goodness, she's so tall and pretty!

238
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,840
Mrs. Ebihara, do you like cookies?

239
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,360
I brought you an exclusive Tokyo treat.

240
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,600
Please enjoy.

241
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,070
My, these look like jewels.

242
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,730
Thank you, Dear!

243
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,450
Please, come on in.

244
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,520
Look at this.

245
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,310
My ex.

246
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,050
You went to your ex-boyfriend's wedding?

247
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,370
No.

248
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,300
I looked up my ex on social media on a whim.

249
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,890
That's when I saw this picture.

250
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,090
So he got married...

251
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,730
That's right. And only half a year
after he broke up with me.

252
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,870
For a moment I thought,
"Maybe he still has lingering regrets,"

253
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,040
but I was quickly disillusioned.

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,910
Katsuo's devotion to you hasn't wavered since.

255
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,950
It's not that I wanted
to reconcile with him, though.

256
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,010
So your ex-boyfriend wants
to get back together with you.

257
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,670
Ayumi-san, do you think
your feelings may rekindle?

258
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,900
Yamagishi-san?

259
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,720
Sorry. Yes, I understand.

260
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,640
You weren't listening, were you?

261
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,770
I had no idea Katsuo
had such a wonderful girlfriend.

262
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,640
"Wonderful"? No, Katsuo-san is a waste
on someone like me.

263
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,810
You should have told me earlier.

264
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,890
Why didn't you?

265
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,540
I just... couldn't find the right time.

266
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,530
Jeez, Katsuo-san, you shy boy!

267
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,360
So where did you two meet?

268
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,970
- We met using a dating—
- My senpai at work introduced me to her.

269
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,130
- That's right.
- Yes.

270
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,230
His senpai at work paired us together.

271
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,410
Is that so? How wonderful.

272
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,020
This boy was trying to do chores
all on his own, you know.

273
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,420
Tsubaki-chan, make sure
to be there for him, all right?

274
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,180
Of course.

275
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,380
The rice is ready!

276
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,020
- Hey.
- Yes?

277
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,460
- Don't go too far off script.
- I know.

278
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,400
What if you say something strange and she notices?

279
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,480
What, don't you want to put her at ease?

280
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,260
- Yes, so don't mention the dating app.
- Sorry.

281
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,950
- It would only deter her.
- Don't worry! I got this.

282
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,440
Tsubaki-chan, could you come help me out?

283
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,330
Oh, of course.

284
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,980
Don't blow it.

285
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,420
We women have a better
touch for these sorts of things.

286
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,380
There we go.

287
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,130
Be sure to include the stems, Dear.
We can't waste our vegetables.

288
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,440
I didn't realize you could eat that part.

289
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,780
Tsubaki-chan, do you not cook often?

290
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,730
No! I cook quite often, actually.

291
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,930
Is that so?

292
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,430
(Good luck.)

293
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,900
I usually cook Italian.
Japanese cooking isn't my specialty.

294
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,870
I see.

295
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,690
But remember, Japanese is healthy for you.

296
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,030
If you two marry, you'll have to learn.

297
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,030
Stewing vegetables and meats
is a great starting point.

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,420
Working leads you to eat out often, does it not?

299
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,780
But Japanese cuisine is easy
and includes plenty of vegetables.

300
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,690
Don't worry. I'll teach you all my recipes.

301
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,930
Thank you.

302
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,640
So when will you two marry?

303
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,300
Sorry?

304
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,460
I mean, we just began dating recently, Ma'am.

305
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,760
Sorry, Dear. I'm a country bumpkin.

306
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,910
- I worry for my poor son out here in the city alone.
- I see.

307
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,680
You really should marry soon though.

308
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,700
Having children becomes
more difficult as you grow older.

309
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,980
"Ch-Children"?

310
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,550
Neither of you is getting any younger, certainly.

311
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,480
If you wait any longer...

312
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,970
Mom.

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,840
What is it?

314
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,830
Let's drink some tea.

315
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,640
Delivery.

316
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,570
Coming.

317
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,760
Oh, you're here for the neighbor.

318
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,640
- Sorry, I believe that's mine.
- Oh, hello there.

319
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,560
Mom, I got your vegetables.
Thanks for sending them over.

320
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,430
I'm glad to hear they arrived safely.

321
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm sure you can't eat them all,
so give some to Katsuo-kun.

322
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,090
Oh? Why?

323
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,840
I feel bad for putting him
in an awkward spot the other day.

324
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,740
Give him my regards, all right?

325
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,160
What?

326
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,060
Ayumi, I began cooking only because
I wanted you to taste my food.

327
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,440
This is delicious.

328
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,810
Really? I'm glad you think so.

329
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:55,020
I might actually have to ask you
to teach me your recipes.

330
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,620
I'm terribly sorry, Dear.
I overstepped my boundaries earlier, didn't I?

331
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,510
No need to apologize, Ma'am.

332
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,610
But that thing about childbirth
and our age was a bit...

333
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:20,120
It was... a bit much.

334
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,690
To think I'd do the very same
to my son's girlfriend.

335
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,310
My mother-in-law used to pester me
about grandchildren all the time.

336
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,120
She'd ask for one girl and two boys.
I truly couldn't stand it.

337
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,600
"One girl and two boys"?
She was asking the impossible!

338
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,970
You'd have to perform gene manipulation!

339
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,970
Exactly.

340
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,420
She'd request these impossible tasks
of me all the time.

341
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,550
Winter or not, wash the rice with cold water.

342
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,060
Yes, Mother.

343
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,620
She would nitpick about
how to wash the rice and set the table.

344
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,480
And when my husband
wouldn't come home for dinner...

345
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,810
He stays out because your cooking is bad.

346
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,390
I told myself I wouldn't
become like that, and yet...

347
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,390
Thank you for having me.

348
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,130
It was a pleasure meeting you today.

349
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,870
Here, I made some rice balls
with the leftovers, if you'd like.

350
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,440
Really? For me?

351
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,600
I'll put them in the freezer
and really savor them.

352
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,220
- I'll see her out.
- Sure.

353
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,140
Good night, Ma'am.

354
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,890
Get home safely, Dear.

355
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,230
Unbelievable.

356
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,490
He didn't mention that it
doesn't include miso soup.

357
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,410
Water will do.

358
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,760
Okay.

359
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,220
Where are the chili peppers?

360
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,760
In here?

361
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,030
"Instant Miso Soup"?

362
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,210
Thank you for tolerating her today.

363
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,810
It must be tough being so loved.

364
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,930
No, well...

365
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,940
By the way, I met Ayumi-san
at Taihei-kun's bar the other day.

366
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,700
Is that so?

367
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:45,300
And look, here's your chance
to eat her cooking again.

368
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,090
Do you need to call a taxi?

369
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,660
No, I'm going out for drinks.

370
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,600
I see.

371
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,800
- Thanks again for today.
- Of course. I enjoyed the dinner.

372
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,660
- See you again.
- See you.

373
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,110
- Katsuo-san!
- What?

374
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,590
A-Ayumi? What's up?

375
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,550
I came to deliver this.

376
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,040
My mom sent me some extra vegetables.

377
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,490
She said she wanted
to apologize for the other day.

378
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,700
- So here's your share.
- Really? Thank you.

379
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,160
Sure. See you.

380
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,230
See you.

381
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,550
Tsubaki-chan isn't really your girlfriend, is she?

382
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,140
You could tell?

383
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,300
It was quite obvious.

384
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,470
Which means I must be a nuisance here.

385
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,750
No, that's not it.

386
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,290
I appreciate that you do the chores; I really do.

387
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,380
But I want to do that stuff on my own now.

388
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,360
You may be more at ease
knowing there's a woman in my life.

389
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,360
But I want to be okay on my own.

390
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,790
That's how I feel now.

391
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,660
I'm sorry, Dear.

392
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,850
Mom, no.

393
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,840
It's not that I want you to apologize.

394
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,960
Well, about Ayumi-chan or Tsubaki-chan,

395
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,310
you couldn't tell us the truth, right?

396
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,610
We were putting pressure on you
without even knowing it.

397
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,920
- Thanks again for today.
- Of course. I enjoyed the dinner.

398
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,150
See you again.

399
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,340
I burned it.

400
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,580
Oh...

401
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,340
Mom?

402
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,710
Mom?

403
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,200
[Thank you for having me. From Mom]

404
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,590
[Koenji Junjo Shopping Street]

405
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,140
Come on!

406
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,800
Chinese is 45...

407
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,960
"Recharge"?

408
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,120
What does that mean?

409
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,910
Mrs. Ebihara?

410
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,030
Oh, Ayumi-chan!
[Neyo]

411
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,890
What are you doing here?

412
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,280
I've always wanted to come
to a nice café like this.

413
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,350
But I didn't have courage to go in alone,
so I was wondering what to do.

414
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,920
- Thank you for joining me, Dear.
- Of course.

415
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,830
Now what should I get?

416
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,090
Well, where is Katsuo-san?

417
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,510
- I left.
- Pardon?

418
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,890
I left my home in Oita and Katsuo's place as well.

419
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,450
Katsuo wanted me to leave so badly

420
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,730
that he had a friend pretend to be his girlfriend!

421
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,820
"Pretend"?

422
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,040
Her name was Tsubaki-chan.

423
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,070
I see.

424
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,280
He said he wants to be okay on his own now.

425
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:20,310
- Excuse me.
- Yes, Ma'am?

426
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,060
Your flan. Enjoy.

427
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,720
This is what I wanted to try!

428
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,050
- This is delicious, isn't it?
- Indeed.

429
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,360
I thought about eating out
by myself this afternoon,

430
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,880
but I couldn't even enter an eatery on my own.

431
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,600
The things I haven't done all this time
aren't simply because I didn't do them.

432
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,070
It's because I came to believe
I couldn't, unknowingly.

433
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,910
Father?

434
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,840
Why?

435
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,940
Hey. I'm coming in.

436
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,180
It's freezing out there.

437
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,980
But why?

438
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,250
Thanks.

439
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,400
This tea is not hot enough.

440
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,630
Isn't this a proper teapot?

441
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,790
Did you come knowing that Mom was here?

442
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,350
What's that?

443
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,280
Right. Takahiro told me.

444
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,460
I see.

445
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,570
Then have you come to get her?

446
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,900
Of course not.

447
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,930
Then why are you here?

448
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,770
Here, look at this.

449
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,410
- What?
- Here.

450
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,300
Your mother has always done that.
[Recharge]

451
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,050
I don't know how to make that work.

452
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,590
You came all the way just for this?

453
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,210
Yes.

454
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,470
Hello, Ayumi?

455
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,580
Hi, Katsuo-san.

456
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,080
I'm currently out with your mother now.

457
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,240
You're with my mom? Wh-Where is she?

458
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,510
We're still in the neighborhood.

459
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,900
I just thought I'd call,
in case you were worried about her.

460
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,790
Thank goodness!

461
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,630
Thank you.

462
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,820
Does she seem... down in any way?

463
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,200
Far from it.
She's enjoying herself to the fullest.

464
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,980
I thought this was a hair salon,
but it's a trinket store.

465
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,660
Tokyo is amazing.

466
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,390
Everything is so fashionable!

467
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,200
Ayumi-chan, let's go inside this store too.
[Malto]

468
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,630
Of course. I'll call you again.

469
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,020
Right.

470
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,990
Give me a break.

471
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,720
I bought so much.

472
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,330
You really seemed to enjoy choosing.

473
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,390
Yes. I love little trinkets and knickknacks.

474
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,410
My husband says they clash with our decor,

475
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,180
so I usually hold back on buying them.

476
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,550
- Ayumi-chan.
- Yes?

477
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,380
Do you still have some time?

478
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,230
Sure.

479
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,570
I packed these leftovers,

480
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,740
in case I needed them.

481
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,870
Thank you.

482
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,450
They're delicious!

483
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,500
I'm glad to hear it.

484
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,170
My husband was a prince, you know.

485
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,870
What?

486
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,550
Back when we first got married,

487
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,090
he was set to take over his grandfather's company.

488
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,910
He even wrote me letters
early in our relationship.

489
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:59,630
That all sounds wonderful.

490
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,880
I was so excited to become his princess.

491
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,870
That's why I trained hard to be
the perfect partner to a prince.

492
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,160
But raising children was far more grueling
than I could ever imagine.

493
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,750
And then I had to care for my mother-in-law.

494
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,900
I was often hurt by my husband's
thoughtless remarks, as well.

495
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,990
I had to ask whether I was
truly okay with this life.

496
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,140
I was happy once upon a time, but what about now?

497
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,060
At times, I feel helpless.

498
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,460
Have you ever considered getting a divorce?

499
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,750
Of course, I have.

500
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,870
But changing my way of life
at this age is difficult.

501
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,130
That's true.

502
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,460
Although, I suppose the same
applies to people of any age.

503
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,770
It must have required courage
to break up with Katsuo, did it not?

504
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,590
It certainly did, yes.

505
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:11,140
I gave up from the beginning, thinking that
my feelings wouldn't be understood.

506
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,950
But thinking back now, if we had talked properly,

507
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:19,920
maybe we could have made
different choices along the way.

508
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,020
Regardless, your lives together are your choice.

509
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,960
It's nothing we parents,
nor the public, ought to dictate.

510
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,070
The same goes for cooking.

511
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,610
One person's method isn't the golden standard.

512
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,260
You're right.

513
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,650
I'm back.

514
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,910
I'm sorry I worried you.

515
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,970
Hey, Katsuo.

516
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,550
I'll take a bath.

517
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,820
Why is he here?

518
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,770
Unbelievable!

519
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,680
He came because he didn't know
how to recharge our phone?

520
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,970
That just means Father relies on you.

521
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,070
Well, I won't cook or clean for him anymore.

522
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,970
I'll make what I want to eat!

523
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,110
Now, now...

524
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,490
Father wants you to come home.

525
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,040
He just can't be honest with himself.

526
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,450
He even asked Takahiro Nii-san where you went.

527
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,250
Katsuo.

528
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:55,530
Tsubaki-san is single, isn't she?

529
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't force it to happen, Mom.

530
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,060
No, I won't.

531
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,190
In my generation, they called
single women "unhappy,"

532
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,360
and boys became men
only when they found a wife.

533
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,280
But Tsubaki-san said she would
freeze and savor my rice

534
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,910
without an ounce of sadness on her face.

535
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,290
Ayumi-chan also seemed more composed
than when she was with you.

536
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,820
I can now see you're trying
to grow up in your own way as well.

537
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,880
Not going to sleep?

538
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,950
I will eventually.

539
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,120
Then tuck yourself in. You'll catch a cold.

540
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,620
It's been a while since
we slept together like this.

541
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,820
This is a first for both of us.

542
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,620
No, it isn't.

543
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,420
When you were just a baby,

544
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:31,020
I used to put you to sleep every night.

545
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,950
I never knew.

546
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,650
I did so till you were two.

547
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,540
That's practically no time at all.

548
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,790
Back then, Grandpa finally collapsed,

549
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,740
and I had to take over the company.

550
00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:00,000
I slaved away at that office from dawn to dusk.

551
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,710
By the time I got back,
the whole house was fast asleep.

552
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,920
It must have been tough.

553
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,000
Tough or not, it was something I had to do.

554
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:24,090
It's our responsibility as men

555
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,450
to ensure our families get by without worry.

556
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,740
Now sleep.

557
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,880
Am I doing this right?

558
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,900
This is tough work.

559
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,890
You're up bright and early.

560
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,810
- You're shaving bonito flakes to make dashi?
- Yes.

561
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,730
Here, let me see that.

562
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,910
I insist.

563
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,630
Wow, amazing!

564
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,810
Your grandmother made sure
I knew the proper technique.

565
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,050
- Here, I'll handle this.
- No.

566
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,000
Let me.

567
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,420
I'll do it.

568
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:04,320
- That's delicious.
- Yes!

569
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,900
I can't remember the last time I had
miso soup made with fresh bonito.

570
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,680
So the miso soup I had
back at home the other day...

571
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,640
- Was that the instant stuff?
- No, I made that from the dashi.

572
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,860
Right, I thought so.

573
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,230
But instant is what I
normally serve your father now.

574
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:31,810
Making fun of him for not noticing
despite his complaining is my form of revenge.

575
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,100
You know what?

576
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,460
Maybe I am a mama's boy.

577
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,790
The other day, I watched you
put Tsubaki in an awkward position.

578
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,380
But I couldn't say a thing.

579
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:03,420
You must have made
plenty of sacrifices to raise us all.

580
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,720
And when I think about that...

581
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,380
I just couldn't say anything.

582
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,900
You don't need to worry about that, Dear.

583
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,440
- I raised you all because I wanted to.
- I know that.

584
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,480
But it's just...

585
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,040
Yes, I understand.

586
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,420
We are parent and child,
but we're also both adults now.

587
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,940
I won't pester you too much anymore, Katsuo.

588
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,750
And if I ever bother you, you tell me, okay?

589
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,000
Okay.

590
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,430
Should I talk to him for you?

591
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,720
About what?

592
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,480
About... maybe treating you a bit better?

593
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,450
Don't bother. Your father won't change.

594
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,660
But, you know.

595
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,010
I'll tell you a little secret.

596
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,080
I actually rented out a place for myself.

597
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,680
What? Where?

598
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,290

Oh. You scared me.

Though it may not be spacious,
it has an ocean view.

This place for myself
is the reason I can endure anything.

- Time to eat.
- Bon appétit.
