What's this?

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It's a school.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm sure it's a name.

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400

I like electric trains.

131
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,400
This is a drum track.

132
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,400
This train is designed to be more heated than our driver.

133
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,400
This train is designed to be more heated than our driver.

134
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Mr. Inouka, this is my job.

135
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,400

136
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,400

137
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400

It's okay.

143
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,400
I don't want to be scolded or insulted by anyone.

144
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I don't listen to anyone.

145
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm a senior in a family.

146
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Listen to the sound.

147
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,400
We have a safe product that we sold.

148
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,400
We were forced to sell it until it was sold out.

149
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400
We sold out the ride.

150
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
But customers gave us a Karaage.

151
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Karaage is a great product.

152
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,400
We sold out the Momo.

153
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,400
We sold out the Momo.

154
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
But the Hintaro arrived.

155
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
What's wrong with them?

156
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
They're all lying.

157
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
They're all lying.

158
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,400
They're all cyber terrorists.

159
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
What if they're limited to Japan?

160
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
What do you think?

161
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
It's the longest train.

162
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
It's been two years.

163
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I've written a report on the station.

164
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
But there's no news from the station.

165
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
What's the plan?

166
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
There's a contract for a contract, but no review.

167
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
You don't have any opinions?

168
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
I'm just giving my opinion.

169
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,400
I'll take it if I want to make a comeback.

170
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
What's the deal?

171
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
It's a customer-centric product.

172
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
A customer-centric product?

173
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
I don't like it.

174
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Where is it?

175
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
Over there.

176
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,400
The most important thing in the 12th policy of Deliphas is customer-centric.

177
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,400
All of them are for the customer.

178
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Thank you.

179
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
It's a mistake.

180
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I'm sorry.

181
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,400
It's hard to bring a bomb to the center.

182
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Did you get a bomb in the next quarter?

183
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,400
There's no crime here.

184
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
It's not a crime.

185
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
It's a murder.

186
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I'm not sure if it's a crime or a crime.

187
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
But...

188
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,400
How much is it?

189
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
How much is it?

190
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
It's half a million yen.

191
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
It's the same amount as the amount of money.

192
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Thank you for your hard work.

193
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm hungry.

194
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
What's the name of this place?

195
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Dokuniya.

196
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm not interested in anything.

197
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
What's the person interested in this morning?

198
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
What do you want for my product?

199
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Dokuniya.

200
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
No way.

201
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,400
I don't have a special vision for my life.

202
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
You're young, but you're good at it.

203
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
What do you want for the president?

204
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Everything.

205
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
This is my scene.

206
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm sure it's the only one this year.

207
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Here.

208
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
There's a U-Wall.

209
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Daily fast?

210
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Hashtag.

211
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
The person you want is...

212
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
What?

213
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
What do you want?

214
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Why?

215
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
I alright?

216
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I got eliminated this!

217
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,620
It's possible but one more time each...

218
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,940
it's from it.

219
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,120
Son!

220
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,320
It's actually a

221
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,940
year.

222
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,420
The first really remember look the

223
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:20,460
20 team

224
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,460
The police are still downstairs. I'll call them.

225
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,460
Wait, wait.

226
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,460
It's this late. The police have to go home and rest.

227
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,460
They're all working too hard, so it's going to be weird.

228
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460
I'll go to the cancelling and drink some medicine and go to the end of the day.

229
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
It's a crime to go to the crime scene.

230
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Where are you going? Who are you going to?

231
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,460
What did you do to me?

232
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460
What are you looking at?

233
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,460
What are you looking at?

234
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,460
I'm going to the crime scene.

235
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460
What are you looking at?

236
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,460
What are you looking at?

237
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,460
What are you looking at?

238
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,460
The first explosion of this kind of perfectly perfect scene is just before the explosion.

239
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,460
What the hell is this?

240
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,460
It's a pretext.

241
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
There are some strange things.

242
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,460
Are you serious?

243
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
If this is true, the bomb in Ichidas...

244
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,460
The bomb is in Ichidas, and it's our target.

245
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,460
What if it's true?

246
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
It's too early now.

247
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,460
The information is going to be over the sea.

248
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
The information is going to be over the sea.

249
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460
From now on, it's Friday.

250
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,460
After three hours, the bell will ring in New York.

251
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,460
I got it.

252
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,460
I'm checking the room.

253
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
I'm checking the room.

254
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
I'm checking the room.

255
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm checking the room.

256
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
I forgot how to call the police.

257
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I forgot the number.

258
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
I forgot the number.

259
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,460
The bomb is in Ichidas, and it's close to the explosion.

260
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,460
It's all the same stuff.

261
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,460
It's all the same stuff.

262
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,460
I'm looking for a place to live.

263
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,460
I got it.

264
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,460
It's not my own place.

265
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,460
I'll be back.

266
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
I'll be back.

267
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,460
I got it.

268
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,460
The news of the Asian telephone is coming out on the news.

269
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,460
The next morning, at 6 a.m.

270
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,460
If bad news doesn't come out,

271
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,460
the other side will be in a hurry.

272
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,460
So, I'll have time to pay.

273
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
I'll see you tomorrow.

274
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Excuse me.

275
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Thank you.

276
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
I'll be back.

277
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,460
I'll be back.

278
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
I'll be back.

279
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
I'll be back.

280
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
Is there a car?

281
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
No, there isn't.

282
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
It was almost zero.

283
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,460
There's no car.

284
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,460
You can take it from a woman.

285
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,460
I don't want to take it from a woman.

286
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Nononon,

287
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
eat your food.

288
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Yes.

289
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
Grandma?

290
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Yes.

291
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Come here.

292
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
I don't want to take it.

293
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
I know.

294
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,460
I'll eat it.

295
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:34,460
I'm not going to let you see me anymore.

296
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
I'll be back.

297
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
I'll be back.

298
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
What's the news about the bar?

299
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,460
It's about the car that we're going to deliver.

300
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
What's that?

301
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,460
It's a two-story building.

302
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Is it a dead one?

303
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
No, it's only a small one.

304
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
The access is exploding.

305
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,460
The source is the fake news.

306
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,460
It's a rumor that it's a pre-existing or a warning on social media.

307
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
It's a fact that it's a one-story building.

308
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,460
Isn't it scary to explode?

309
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,460
I believe that everyone is not only attacking themselves,

310
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,460
but also the normal and the subordinate.

311
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Hey, let's roll the dice.

312
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Who's starting a limited time offer while we're getting those hits?

313
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
See what happens.

314
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
I'll go beg for your home.

315
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
What do you want?

316
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
What?

317
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
What do you want?

318
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Good morning.

319
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
It's a product.

320
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
I bought it.

321
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
I got it before the packing.

322
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
I got it on the data.

323
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
How is it?

324
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
The fashion category is weak.

325
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,460
The police are investigating the crime and crime.

326
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
I got a call from a police officer.

327
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Are you awake?

328
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
When did you get the call?

329
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
The phone number.

330
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Of course, it's 6 a.m.

331
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
You came here two years ago?

332
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,460
This is Japan, but you should go to the American company.

333
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Go there and laugh.

334
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,460
You laugh?

335
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
I'm confident and I'm confident.

336
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,460
I'm positive.

337
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,460
If you don't come, I won't be released.

338
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
You don't have to.

339
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Before you come here,

340
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,460
I worked at a company that looked like a bad place in Japan.

341
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
It's heaven here.

342
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,460
I'm told it's a boring face,

343
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,460
but I'm having fun working here.

344
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,460
If I can maintain my current life, that's enough.

345
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
You can say that.

346
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
What about the report?

347
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,460
The news that the victim of the crime is in the local community.

348
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,460
The company is not available.

349
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,460
Okay, okay.

350
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Now, what about the bad victim?

351
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Okay.

352
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,460
If you killed the client,

353
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,460
I would have died if I had released 100 copies.

354
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,460
The report is used every day,

355
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,460
but it's a bomb.

356
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,460
Nishimu Sashimi, 511.

357
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Nishimu Sashimi.

358
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Excuse me.

359
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,460
This is my commercial.

360
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
It's my commercial.

361
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
What about this?

362
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,460
My company is selling it remotely.

363
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,460
I was angry that the title was too big.

364
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
Well, it's your company.

365
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,460
There are people like that.

366
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
Is this the daily fast?

367
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,460
I don't want to be small like you.

368
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
I thought it was strange.

369
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Can you tell me about the victim?

370
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,460
I don't like the phone on my phone.

371
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,460
This is it.

372
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,460
Daily fast.

373
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Wow, that's true.

374
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
It's not fast.

375
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,460
960,000.

376
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,460
It's cheap, isn't it?

377
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
The website is only in the Kanto area.

378
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,460
There is only one extension.

379
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,460
It's only 15 seconds.

380
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,460
Nishimu Sashimi's target.

381
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
Where is this EC?

382
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
EC Kessai.

383
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
Credit card valid.

384
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
I don't know.

385
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
I'll look it up.

386
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
I'll go to the address.

387
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Go.

388
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
949, from Nikizo Hongbu.

389
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Setagaya PSKanai.

390
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
The bomb is in the box.

391
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Maruki is found.

392
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,460
The address is Setagaya 6.

393
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
No. 142.

394
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
It's hot.

395
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Maruki is 36 years old.

396
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
He is in the bomb.

397
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
He is in the bomb.

398
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
The target is at the site.

399
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Nikizo Hongbu, from Nikizo Hongbu.

400
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
Setagaya is in the bomb.

401
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
Hey, Nuri.

402
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
It's a long way.

403
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
He is going to bomb.

404
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
We are in the bomb.

405
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
Why?

406
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
We can't leave him.

407
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
He is in the bomb.

408
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
He is in the bomb.

409
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Nikizo Hongbu, from Nikizo Hongbu.

410
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
Setagaya is in the bomb.

411
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
Maruki is in the bomb.

412
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
Nuri, from Nikizo Hongbu.

413
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
Setagaya is in the bomb.

414
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
He is in the bomb.

415
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
He is in the bomb.

416
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
He is in the bomb.

417
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
He is in the bomb.

418
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
It's a bomb.

419
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,460
Hey, Nikizo Hongbu.

420
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,460
You are so pretentious.

421
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Did you bring it back?

422
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,140
than if you were damaged and weird.

423
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,160
You'd be, hold on.

424
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,880
Hm...

425
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,280
bears good clothes.

426
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,660
It's not my carry contract but...

427
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,180
I can't fit in the Kot crush's room.

428
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,200
Hey.

429
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,100
Have you seen her?

430
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,900
No!

431
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,620
Ah, what kind of a little group are you talking about?

432
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,660
Do you not want to hurt anyone?

433
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,320
So what?

434
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,880
That's why...

435
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,400
You want to be happy.

436
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,640
Thanks to Deliferce?

437
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,140
Huh?

438
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Yamazaki...

439
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,000
Task...

440
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,380
wait no...

441
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Namasaki.

442
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,160
I've appointed this person as the third person.

443
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Do you know him?

444
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
No.

445
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
You're the same as Mr. Naishimatsu.

446
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Are you a former employee?

447
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
No.

448
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,160
Before that?

449
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,660
Search for the human data base and search it.

450
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Yes.

451
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,560
Namasaki.

452
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,260
Namasaki.

453
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Namasaki.

454
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
I don't have a name.

455
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
I mean, you don't have one.

456
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
You can't hide it.

457
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
If you look at the record of the insurance company, you'll know it in one go.

458
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
Then, please look it up.

459
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,360
If the company's agent is sorry,

460
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,060
he can delete the information.

461
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,560
The agent is hoping for a delete.

462
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,760
The insurance company's agent who was arrested in the olden days.

463
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,960
That's too much.

464
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Is that enough?

465
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Can you help me with one more thing?

466
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
Of course.

467
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,760
If the former employee is a criminal,

468
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
he can think of a way to break the company's business.

469
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Therefore, I want you to stop all the products.

470
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
I was told by the police.

471
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,560
I want you to stop the delivery man's news.

472
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Mr. Hitsugi.

473
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
It's Yagi.

474
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Yagi? Yagi?

475
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
Yagi?

476
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Yagi.

477
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Yagi.

478
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,960
We don't have the right to stop the police.

479
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
If you stop the delivery man's news,

480
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,360
we'll make a contract with the company and send him to the emergency room.

481
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
What?

482
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,760
What should we do?

483
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,360
I've checked it, but I can't apply for the emergency room.

484
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,560
The price is only 10% lower than the original price.

485
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
It's about 1 billion yen.

486
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I can't stop all of it.

487
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Please pull it.

488
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Please take it.

489
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Yes.

490
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Get out.

491
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Get out!

492
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Daily Fast Japan.

493
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Daily Fast Japan.

494
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
The company's business is...

495
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Logistic.

496
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Logistic.

497
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,760
We'll make all the products in the center.

498
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
We'll make them as a product.

499
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
It's true.

500
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
Don't tell anyone. Stop it.

501
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
It's the police.

502
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Let everyone get to the office and take the copy of the newspaper.

503
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
What are you talking about?

504
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Hurry up and get the time.

505
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
Hurry up.

506
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,360
There's no bomb in the warehouse.

507
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,560
The company is against the criminal.

508
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Do you think the criminal is the one who came to the police station?

509
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I'll investigate it.

510
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,160
If you're going to interfere, I'll arrest you in the police station.

511
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,360
I've learned that the police is a big crime.

512
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
You're so stupid.

513
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
You were so careless.

514
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,960
What?

515
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Yamazaki and Yamazaki.

516
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,960
The criminal is also against the police station.

517
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
The criminal is against the criminal.

518
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,360
We can't arrest him.

519
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,560
You're so stupid.

520
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,560
Why are you doing this?

521
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,760
There's no problem.

522
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
We're the ones who are responsible for the initiative.

523
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Because we don't have a place to store all the products in our warehouse.

524
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
We can search anywhere in Japan.

525
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,360
If we do, we'll be able to find out the truth.

526
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,360
If we do, we'll be able to work safely.

527
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,560
This is the last checkpoint.

528
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,760
We'll be able to find out all the products here.

529
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
We'll be able to search here.

530
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
If the police doesn't want to bomb, we'll have to leave the place.

531
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,960
The police will cover the safe zone and the human rights.

532
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,160
Isn't that a great story?

533
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
The Japanese police are the best.

534
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,560
They're being arrested at the emergency.

535
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Yagi will check the safety zone at the X-ray inspection.

536
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,760
I heard that the security zone is only in the Kasumiya area.

537
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
The limit is the limit.

538
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,160
You decide the limit.

539
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,160
The inspection will arrive soon.

540
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,360
What? The inspection will arrive soon?

541
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Not only the warehouse, but also the inspection.

542
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,760
The bomb was found on the way to the hotel.

543
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I don't understand.

544
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Yagi will check the location of the bomb.

545
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
The entire area is in the X-ray.

546
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,360
Stop!

547
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Stop!

548
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
It's all over the place.

549
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
I'll read it.

550
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
The security zone is in the Kana area.

551
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,360
The authorities have found three or four places.

552
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560
They'll be able to find the safe zone.

553
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,760
They'll check all the items and send them to the customer.

554
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
The police will understand.

555
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,960
Wait a minute.

556
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I'll wait three minutes.

557
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
I'll be back.

558
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,560
The police are not in the security zone.

559
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
The police are in the center.

560
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,960
The police found the bomb yesterday.

561
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,960
The police found the bomb at the center.

562
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,160
There are no other sites.

563
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
I won't stop.

564
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
What are you talking about?

565
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
You're so fast.

566
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
You're so fast.

567
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,760
The security camera is in the lobby.

568
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,960
The police are not in the room.

569
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
What happened?

570
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
It's been a week since we last saw the police.

571
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
Good job.

572
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,760
Good job.

573
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,760
Excuse me.

574
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
Is Ibuki in the wild again?

575
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,160
The room in the mountain was so clean.

576
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
Clean?

577
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,560
Yes.

578
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
What's the smell?

579
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,960
What kind of smell?

580
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Clean?

581
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
Clean.

582
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,560
It must be the woman's smell.

583
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
That's it!

584
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,960
Sorry for the mistake.

585
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
There's no use in reporting.

586
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
The latest information?

587
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Is this the woman's smell?

588
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,560
This is the person who is not a resident.

589
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Not a resident?

590
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Yes.

591
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
What about the PC in the mountain?

592
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,160
I wonder if it'll take until morning.

593
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Excuse me.

594
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,360
What's the matter?

595
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
The police said you can use the food.

596
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,360
I'll give you the food card.

597
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,560
It's a double-edged sword, so you can't take it.

598
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
You failed the next week.

599
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,960
What did you see?

600
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
How do you think you put on a bomb?

601
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,360
What?

602
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,560
How do you think people outside put on a bomb in the warehouse?

603
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,560
Do you think people outside put on a bomb in the warehouse?

604
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,760
It's a very small point.

605
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,960
It's just a possibility.

606
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,960
How is the return system?

607
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,160
When I returned, I returned the product with a bomb.

608
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,360
The return product was confirmed by the staff.

609
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,560
The staff is going to blow it up.

610
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,560
What about the service of the goods?

611
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,760
The sales of the deli-fast is 3% of the goods.

612
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,960
We are not checking the contents of each product.

613
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,160
The goods are mixed with the actual goods and the goods.

614
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,360
But all the goods that exploded are not goods from the goods.

615
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,560
It's a product of the goods that I bought and sold.

616
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,760
I see.

617
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,960
There are seven of them left.

618
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,960
I can't believe that there are 12 of them.

619
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,960
I think there are 12 of them.

620
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,160
Do you think it's true?

621
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Is it more than 20?

622
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,360
No, it's not.

623
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,560
If there were 20, it would be more than 20.

624
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,560
It's normal.

625
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,760
But if there were fewer,

626
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,960
the bomb would be 11 of them and 12 of them would be a warning.

627
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
What would happen?

628
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,360
No matter how hard we search, we can't find the last one.

629
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,560
Because we don't have one.

630
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,560
We have to find the bomb that doesn't exist.

631
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,760
Forever.

632
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,960
If I'm the culprit, I'm sure I'll do that.

633
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,560
I'm home.

634
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,760
I'm home.

635
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Nanami?

636
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
Nanami.

637
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,960
Nanami.

638
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
Nanami.

639
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,360
You're not falling, are you?

640
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,560
Stop it.

641
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Nanami.

642
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,560
What are you doing?

643
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,760
I'm waiting.

644
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,960
People who are waiting won't come in time.

645
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Who?

646
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,360
It has nothing to do with mom.

647
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,360
You can't come in time.

648
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
I told you it's dangerous.

649
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,760
Even if I tell you,

650
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,960
the girls are happy to have a father and a son.

651
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Well,

652
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
even if you're a woman, don't do it.

653
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,160
Even if you're a mother, don't do it.

654
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
It's not like that.

655
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Are you okay?

656
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,360
I'm fine.

657
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,360
I've found the culprit.

658
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
No.

659
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,560
I'm not sure.

660
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,360
It's been 5 years.

661
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,360
I'm sorry.

662
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,560
It's been 5 years.

663
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,760
Nanami.

664
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
The boss is fine.

665
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
He's fine.

666
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,160
He's completely fine.

667
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,160
I'm worried.

668
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,360
I'm fine.

669
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,160
It's sad that he's dead,

670
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
but he's a person I don't know.

671
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,160
He's always dead in the world,

672
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,360
but he suddenly got up and left.

673
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,360
He suddenly got up and left.

674
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,560
He can smile.

675
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,560
I can do it.

676
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,760
I can do it.

677
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,760
Hey.

678
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,760
I don't know who I am.

679
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
I'm sorry.

680
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Hey, stop it.

681
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
I'm sorry.

682
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,160
I'm sorry.

683
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,360
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360
I'm sorry.

685
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,360
I'm sorry.

686
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,360
The police have everything?

687
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,360
If you have any excuses, now's the time.

688
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,360
Details matter.

689
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,360
I'm just trying to get the facts straight.

690
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,360
As general manager of Asia, that is my responsibility.

691
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Well, here's what happened.

692
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,360
Elena, Fernando, was on duty when the seizure went down,

693
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,560
and she just assumed her duties.

694
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,560
She hasn't got the hang of it yet.

695
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
I'm going to meet a better story than that.

696
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,960
I think we have it under control.

697
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,160
When we found out what was going on,

698
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,360
I made a decision to partner with the police,

699
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,560
and they agreed to help in shipping at no additional cost.

700
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Excuse me!

701
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
Hello!

702
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,960
I'd like to ask you to give me a little more time.

703
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Hello, Fernando.

704
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,760
I can't reach you.

705
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Yes, you're right.

706
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,160
Business been more late.

707
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
Medical bin?

708
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Sorry, I'm sorry.

709
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
It's a devil!

710
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,960
A devil!

711
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
I'm dying!

712
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,360
They're confused.

713
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,560
The customer of the hotel is not connected,

714
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
and the claim is coming from here.

715
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Medical bin is the most important thing.

716
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
You can't say it, but think it over.

717
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,360
Why are you turning the machine?

718
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,560
They're confused.

719
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,560
Where is the medical bin?

720
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
Please check it on the data.

721
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,960
Right now.

722
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
I can tell by the bar code,

723
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,560
but I moved the bin to the center

724
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
to check the X-ray.

725
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,960
The tip is...

726
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
The tip?

727
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,360
There are many staff members in the center.

728
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,560
The way they do things is the most important.

729
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,760
What are you talking about?

730
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Hmm...

731
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,960
The information on the patient's condition is...

732
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,160
Please go to the conclusion.

733
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,360
Where is the medical bin?

734
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,560
Where is the data?

735
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
What are you talking about?

736
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
No, I'm not.

737
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
I'm just trying to find the truth.

738
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,360
What?

739
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,560
The X-ray is on?

740
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,560
Yamada-san.

741
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,760
I called you a while ago,

742
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,760
but I'm not sure what's going on.

743
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Please try to find the medical bin nearby.

744
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
I'm sorry. It's a common medicine.

745
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,360
I'm sorry.

746
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,560
What's wrong?

747
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,760
I'm sorry.

748
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
The medicine is gone.

749
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
I understand.

750
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,360
I'm going to go.

751
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,560
What's going on?

752
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,760
The X-ray is on, but the data is not yet confirmed.

753
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm sorry.

754
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,160
I can't find the bin.

755
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,360
I'm sorry.

756
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,560
It's only one hour.

757
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,560
If you can't find it, the patient will die.

758
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,560
Let's go.

759
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,760
Let's go.

760
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
Let's go.

761
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,160
Let's go.

762
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,360
The medical bin has 45 medical bins.

763
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
The business bin is over 200.

764
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,760
If we add up the number of yesterdays and todays,

765
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,960
we'll get over 400.

766
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Let's stop the medical bin.

767
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,360
How much is the 12 million?

768
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,560
It's not enough to get more orders.

769
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
We can't stop the sales.

770
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
What about the customer centric?

771
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,960
I believed you.

772
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,160
What?

773
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:22,360
For example, what's the reason for the company to reduce the delivery rate?

774
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,360
To increase the company's sales.

775
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,560
The answer is that if we reduce the delivery rate,

776
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,760
we can reduce the product and become a customer.

777
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
Customer centric.

778
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:42,360
For example, what's the reason for not stopping the medical bin?

779
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,960
To maintain the company's business.

780
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
That's not right.

781
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,960
If we don't buy it, we'll have to re-examine the customer.

782
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
That's the problem.

783
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,360
It's troublesome.

784
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,560
We don't want to do it.

785
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,760
We want to keep using cheap and fast delifaces.

786
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,960
We'll keep selling for the customer's desire.

787
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
Look.

788
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,160
Customer centric.

789
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,160
I'm so happy.

790
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,360
I haven't noticed the magic word in two years.

791
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,360
Here's the dint.

792
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Yes.

793
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,560
What's this?

794
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,160
It's a back bin.

795
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,360
It's at least 30.

796
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,560
We have to deliver the medical bin.

797
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,760
If the customer dies and the customer is left in the store,

798
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
we can take the responsibility.

799
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Here you go.

800
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
Thank you.

801
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,360
We have to attach the back bin to the counter.

802
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,560
We can't do that.

803
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,760
Turn it around.

804
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Yes, sir.

805
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:06,960
Good job.

806
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
We have to attach the back bin to the counter.

807
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,160
Yes, sir.

808
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,160
It's a fast delivery.

809
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,960
The fast delivery.

810
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Yes, sir.

811
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,360
This is far.

812
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
Yes, sir.

813
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
Hello?

814
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,760
It's Eri.

815
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,960
Please release the press release.

816
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,160
Right now.

817
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:34,360
Can you explain the conclusion a little more?

818
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Last chance. Open.

819
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,960
No.

820
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,960
No.

821
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,160
No.

822
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,560
There's no paper.

824
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,760
I'm really asking you.

825
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,960
I'm asking you.

826
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,160
I'm not coming.

827
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Excuse me.

828
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,160
We don't have a balloon camping set.

829
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
Balloon?

830
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:56,560
Kube-kun is not here.

831
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
He's in the hospital.

832
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,960
We're not in the hospital.

833
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,160
He's not here.

834
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,360
It seems like the delivery is coming.

835
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:04,560
Here.

836
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:05,760
I'm sorry.

837
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,760
I'm sorry.

838
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,960
The delivery is coming.

839
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,160
I'll be back in the morning.

840
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,360
The delivery is coming.

841
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,560
What?

842
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:12,760
What?

843
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,760
I didn't think you'd come.

844
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,760
The bomb is coming.

845
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,760
It's coming.

846
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,960
Why did you come at this hour?

847
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,960
I was investigating the bomb's detonation and the bomb's detonation.

848
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
What?

849
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,760
You're going to be in a big trouble.

850
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,960
It's a big trouble.

851
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,160
Then you should get out of the house.

852
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,360
I can't hear you.

853
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
The delivery is coming.

854
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,760
Please turn the volume up.

855
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,960
I'm sorry.

856
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
Why are you here?

857
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
I'm sorry.

858
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,560
Turn the volume up.

859
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:05,760
There is a pink tone on red and green.

860
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,760
So who is it?

861
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,160
Who are you?

862
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,360
The delivery is coming.

863
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,560
We can't see you.

864
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,160
The destroyer.

865
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:33,240
We'll speak to Matslike DIR for the terminal stretch.

866
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:37,580
I've met with BUD from the customer in Two Final 있어요 sessions.

867
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,660
The message is coming out, right?

868
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,780
Go on AlphaBunch, we'll meet at its' finale tomorrow.

869
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:55,700
GET

870
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,900
They'll shoot if we lie!!

871
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:06,400
I repeat, that you tav technologies hang no more!

872
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,440
Damn it!

873
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:14,400
Please get ready, please Will return soon!

874
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,260
.........

875
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,900
Granny A?

876
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,680
I'm finally home.

877
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,340
I'm sorry I'm late.

878
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:30,040
Get home safely, granny.

879
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,120
What's up?

880
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,720
Sorry for calling you late.

881
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,300
I'm really sorry but it's a big, scary and I feelAJ

882
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,360
I couldn't let-

883
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
It's late. It's the emergency room.

884
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Look.

885
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
The hotel is closed for one hour.

886
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,400
It's not like we're going to get a new one.

887
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
We're not going to get a new one.

888
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,400
I know.

889
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,400
We're not going to get a new one.

890
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,400
We're going to get a new one.

891
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,400
I know.

892
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,400
I'm going to work and get my soul back.

893
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Everyone's waiting for us.

894
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
They're happy for us.

895
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Think about the past.

896
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,400
It's a miracle that we can deliver our goods to each other's homes.

897
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,400
We're making a miracle.

898
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Yaccha is the one who did it.

899
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,400
He's the first store of Japanese goods.

900
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,400
He's the one who's making the world around here.

901
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,400
We're going to lose our goods and talk about the country.

902
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,400
It's better to have a shopper like this.

903
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,400
Yaccha, eat. It's 30 minutes.

904
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Yaccha is...

905
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Yaccha is a bad guy, right?

906
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,400
He ate 10 minutes at the event and slept in the car.

907
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,400
He got 100 or 200 tickets a day and died.

908
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,400
Maybe he got 500,000 yen a month.

909
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,400
It's half of the amount.

910
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,400
He died after breaking his body at the event.

911
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,400
Nobody cares about us.

912
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,400
We don't care about anyone.

913
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,400
We're going to lose our goods.

914
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
Run.

915
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
I can't run.

916
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,400
Run.

917
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
I'm sorry.

918
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
I lost my job three times.

919
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,400
I'm in a labor camp with a labor camp and a labor camp.

920
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,400
I lost my job because of this.

921
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,400
When I was brought in by Mr. Yamasaki,

922
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,400
I was still a student and I was working as a night shift worker.

923
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:33,400
I was a little bit lazy, but I still had a sense of humor.

924
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
I'm sorry.

925
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,400
You're the one who wrote this.

926
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,400
Of course.

927
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,400
I heard you were conscious of the first day of the year.

928
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,400
Why did you write this?

929
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,400
I was in labor camp, so I was in labor camp.

930
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,400
But it was hard to get a job.

931
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,400
I was paid a lot of money and a lot of money.

932
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,400
I was made at that time.

933
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,400
I was made in an American style so I wouldn't get a job later.

934
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,400
American style.

935
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,400
I was told that I was a labor camp and I was in labor camp.

936
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,400
Was it a place where you were in labor camp?

937
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,400
Maybe someone was trying to get me.

938
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,400
I don't think it was a labor camp.

939
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,400
I was told that I was a labor camp.

940
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,400
You're a fool.

941
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:52,400
You're a fool.

942
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,400
I'm sorry.

943
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,400
Did you get rid of the YAMASAKI task from here?

944
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,400
I think so.

945
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,400
Is that so?

946
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,400
What do you think?

947
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,400
An accident or suicide?

948
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,400
Whatever.

949
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,400
Because there's no connection to the bomb incident.

950
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,400
If you're not conscious of the first day of the year,

951
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,400
you're not a criminal.

952
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,400
I showed you the video of the YAMASAKI task.

953
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,400
Who are you?

954
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Don't you have a heart?

955
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,400
I don't know.

956
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
Why are you looking at me?

957
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,400
Everyone is looking at me.

958
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:13,400
I don't remember.

959
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,400
Can you find the criminal quickly?

960
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
I found him.

961
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,400
One of us.

962
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,400
I found the D.M.Yari story,

963
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,400
the account of Happy Friday

964
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,400
in the laptop of the YAMASAKI task.

965
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,400
The KAS is the real cause of this account.

966
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,400
The person who sold the bomb

967
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,400
has been arrested and found the criminal.

968
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,400
The person who sold the bomb has been arrested and found the criminal.

969
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,400
The investigation was held in Nitorabeta.

970
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,400
The investigation was held in Nitorabeta.

971
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,400
The bomb used in the 95's Ocora Homa City bomb attack

972
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
was the same as the original.

973
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,400
I spent 2.4 million yen on 12 bombs.

974
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,400
I used up all of them.

975
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,400
The money I spent on the bomb was the money I spent on the bomb.

976
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,400
Happy,

977
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,400
you were a good boy.

978
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,400
I want you to be a good boy.

979
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,400
Stop it.

980
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,400
I'm sorry.

981
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
I'm dead.

982
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,400
I'm in a lot of cases.

983
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,400
I'm in a lot of cases.

984
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,400
There are 12 bombs.

985
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
I'm sure this woman is right.

986
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,400
I don't know her face.

987
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,400
There was a bomb that the motor was in a bad condition.

988
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,400
I wrote that I'm sorry if I didn't move.

989
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,400
What's wrong?

990
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:03,400
The police told me to send a notice to the L.C. of Nishimusashi.

991
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,400
I can't help it.

992
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,400
Send it.

993
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,400
There was no record of Funato Elena.

994
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,400
He wasn't in Fukuoka?

995
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:19,400
The man who came from Fukuoka was Kimura from 47,000.

996
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,400
He was the man who was the target.

997
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,400
He stood in front of the center of the building and appeared as Funato Elena.

998
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Please let him in.

999
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,400
Maybe he is related to Yamasaki.

1000
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,400
I heard that he met his lover in Yamasaki.

1001
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,400
Thank you.

1002
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
I'm sorry.

1003
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,400
I'm sorry.

1004
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
I'm sorry.

1005
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,400
I'm sorry.

1006
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:02,400
You were in the conversation with Yamasaki and his father.

1007
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
Yes.

1008
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,400
I want to pursue the responsibility of Delifas.

1009
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,400
But I have to withdraw immediately.

1010
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,400
Your son was in charge of the memorial.

1011
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Yes.

1012
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:21,400
Maybe he was trying to commit suicide.

1013
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
Why?

1014
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,400
He was worried about marriage.

1015
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Marriage?

1016
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,400
I'm surprised.

1017
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,400
Why would he do that?

1018
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
There are people like that.

1019
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,400
He was in a state of physical condition without saying anything.

1020
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,400
He looked like a bad girl.

1021
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,400
What's his name?

1022
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:48,400
I think he was in the same state as his father.

1023
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,400
He had a marriage proposal.

1024
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,400
I understand if you ask him.

1025
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
He is sick.

1026
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,400
Oh, my.

1027
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,400
He is a distant relative of Yamasaki's relative.

1028
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,400
He doesn't know the situation.

1029
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,400
I wonder if he remembers his name.

1030
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:16,400
He just saw me at the hospital.

1031
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:24,400
She was trying to get rid of Delifas's responsibility with SNS.

1032
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,400
But if he does that,

1033
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,400
he will have to pay a huge amount of money to get rid of her.

1034
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,400
He was angry with his father.

1035
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,400
I was worried about your son.

1036
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,400
But he never hurt my son.

1037
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,400
He is very smart.

1038
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,400
Good job.

1039
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,400
Good.

1040
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,400
Good job.

1041
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
I'm going to the bar.

1042
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,400
Why?

1043
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
I'm going to the bar too.

1044
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
I'll do this.

1045
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,400
A secret crush that you can't sleep at night.

1046
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,400
I wanted it.

1047
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
I want you to buy it.

1048
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,400
I want a better one.

1049
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,400
I want to find a way to put a bomb on the product inside the warehouse.

1050
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400
What do you think you can do?

1051
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
I've already checked it.

1052
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,400
I couldn't do it.

1053
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,400
It's not about the person outside.

1054
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,400
What if it's the person inside?

1055
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,400
If the white pass is the culprit.

1056
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,400
I can't do it.

1057
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,400
It's a barrier-sweep point.

1058
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,400
What if I checked it?

1059
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,400
If you use the warehouse,

1060
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,400
you might get a bomb from the warehouse.

1061
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,400
If you use the key of the center,

1062
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,400
you might be able to do it.

1063
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,400
Maybe.

1064
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,400
You have to follow it.

1065
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,400
You don't want to be the center.

1066
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,400
What?

1067
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,400
You're lying.

1068
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,400
Where did you come from?

1069
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,400
How did you get in?

1070
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,400
Who are you?

1071
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,400
I'm in front of the elevator.

1072
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,400
You're Yamasaki's girlfriend.

1073
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
It's not me.

1074
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:50,400
Then why did you erase Yamasaki's data from the Jinji database?

1075
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,400
That's not true.

1076
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,400
You'll know if you see the system log.

1077
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,400
I don't know.

1078
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,400
The company that was working in the past

1079
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,400
was making security software,

1080
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,400
and my job was a white hacker.

1081
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,400
I didn't write any police records,

1082
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,400
and nobody told me.

1083
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:16,400
I was left behind because I was fired from the office.

1084
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,400
The truth of the incident is 13 minutes.

1085
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,400
Yamasaki's data was deleted from the Jinji database.

1086
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,400
You're the one who deleted the data.

1087
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,400
I don't know why Yamasaki's data fell from here.

1088
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:34,400
It's fine.

1089
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,400
The revenge is a success.

1090
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,400
The operation continues to go down,

1091
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,400
and Kamukawa's blood is falling to the ground.

1092
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,400
If it falls, it's a problem.

1093
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,400
It's fine to protect the Elifas.

1094
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,400
How can I remember this?

1095
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,400
It's not a game that's behind the panic.

1096
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,400
Okay, let's go this way.

1097
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,400
The Japanese people are...

1098
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:06,400
They're not bad at teaching while eating.

1099
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,400
Please take it.

1100
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,400
If you don't, I'll call the police.

1101
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,400
And?

1102
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,400
The bag.

1103
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,400
Inside.

1104
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,400
Hurry, hurry.

1105
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,400
The ID is open.

1106
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,400
I came from America.

1107
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,400
From the Elifas's main car.

1108
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,400
Calm down.

1109
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,400
Listen to me.

1110
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,400
This is probably...

1111
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,400
I mean, it's definitely a bomb.

1112
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,400
Hurry, the police is coming.

1113
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,400
Hurry.

1114
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,400
Why did you buy that?

1115
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,400
You don't need it.

1116
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,400
I was so excited at night.

1117
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Sit down.

1118
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,400
I'm glad you're sitting.

1119
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,400
I'll hit you on the leg.

1120
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,400
This is...

1121
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,400
It exploded.

1122
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,400
I...

1123
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,400
I was so worried that I died.

1124
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,400
I'm so sad that I'm running away.

1125
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,400
The woman in the video.

1126
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,400
I met that person.

1127
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,400
Just once.

1128
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,400
I don't remember her name.

1129
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,400
She was in Washington four years ago.

1130
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,400
She said she was on a trip.

1131
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,400
But I really want to hear about it.

1132
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:22,400
In America, there is a lot of compliance than Japan.

1133
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,400
That's why I came all the way here.

1134
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,400
The Japanese Elifas was my fault for taking him down.

1135
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:32,400
It's not that I'm hiding something bad.

1136
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,400
I want to know the truth.

1137
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,400
I want you to help me.

1138
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,400
She gave me the intelligence I had.

1139
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,400
But I have nothing to do with it.

1140
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,400
What happened next?

1141
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,400
The bomb exploded.

1142
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,400
The story of the woman is over.

1143
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,400
My story.

1144
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,400
I was a prisoner in the warehouse for a while.

1145
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,400
I got a job as a responsible person.

1146
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,400
I was happy.

1147
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,400
The first year.

1148
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,400
I felt good.

1149
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,400
The second year was fine.

1150
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,400
The third year.

1151
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,400
I couldn't sleep.

1152
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,400
I remembered her words.

1153
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,400
She always said,

1154
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,400
details matter.

1155
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,400
Responsibility.

1156
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,400
No limit.

1157
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:05,400
I have to do my best to do what I can.

1158
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,400
But I said it at the end.

1159
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Black Friday is scary.

1160
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,400
The day I jumped off the task was

1161
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,400
the day before Black Friday.

1162
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,400
Why did I jump off?

1163
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,400
I have more answers.

1164
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,400
I don't want to leave you.

1165
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,400
I don't want to die with a man I don't like.

1166
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,400
I don't want to die with a woman.

1167
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,400
I don't want to die.

1168
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,400
I don't want to die.

1169
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,400
I don't want to die with a man I don't like.

1170
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,400
The bomb exploded in the water.

1171
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:10,400
It took a little longer until the investigation was over.

1172
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,400
I will try my best.

1173
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,400
Are you okay?

1174
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
Please be careful.

1175
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,400
Are you okay?

1176
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,400
Are you okay?

1177
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,400
Please be careful.

1178
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,400
When is the opening?

1179
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,400
Tomorrow at noon.

1180
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,400
The five families are being separated.

1181
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
It looks like a smokeless fire.

1182
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,400
It was a place to be grilled chicken.

1183
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,400
I can't laugh.

1184
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:17,400
I was jealous of my childhood.

1185
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,400
I want you to buy me a toy.

1186
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I want something luxurious.

1187
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:35,400
The first gift is a white iron that I bought myself.

1188
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,400
I'm so happy.

1189
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,400
It's delicious.

1190
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,400
The high school club.

1191
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
It was a computer club.

1192
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,400
I played soccer when I was a student.

1193
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,400
I see.

1194
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,400
That was my fault.

1195
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,400
I worked too hard and I was too tired to work.

1196
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,400
I was too tired to work and I was too tired to work.

1197
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,400
I was too tired to work and I was too tired to work.

1198
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,400
I hate being a Japanese.

1199
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,400
I hate being a Japanese.

1200
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,400
I hate being serious and I hate being a Japanese.

1201
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,400
It's a good thing.

1202
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,400
It's a bad thing.

1203
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,400
I was the center president.

1204
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:42,400
I have been in this situation for three months now.

1205
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,400
I'm so happy to work.

1206
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,400
I can't fail you.

1207
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,400
I knew it.

1208
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:03,400
It was a little bit of a shame that Elena was working like a bulldozer.

1209
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,400
I wanted that vitality.

1210
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:19,400
I can beat that woman, but I'm using it for something else.

1211
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,400
I thought it was important.

1212
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,400
You wanted proof that you were a company employee, right?

1213
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,400
Yes.

1214
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,400
I think I have proof.

1215
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,400
What?

1216
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,400
I was told by the whole company.

1217
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,400
I heard it from the person in front of me.

1218
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,400
What?

1219
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,400
That...

1220
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,400
That's where I am.

1221
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,400
What does a company employee know?

1222
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,400
I don't know what it means.

1223
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,400
I don't know who wrote it.

1224
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,400
But I can't erase it.

1225
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
I can't erase it.

1226
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,400
Because it's proof?

1227
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,400
If this is the lock of Yamasaki,

1228
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,400
then that's what it means.

1229
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,400
MS?

1230
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,400
MS.

1231
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,400
Meter per second.

1232
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,400
2.7 meters in speed.

1233
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,400
It's about a fast walk.

1234
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,400
The speed of the belt conveyor?

1235
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,400
2.7 meters in speed.

1236
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,400
70 km in weight limit.

1237
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,400
Yamasaki doesn't just want to fly.

1238
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,400
What's the matter?

1239
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,400
I don't know.

1240
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,400
What are you doing?

1241
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,400
I can't stop.

1242
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,400
What do you do?

1243
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,400
I'll tell Yamasaki not to stop even if he dies.

1244
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,400
0.

1245
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,400
What?

1246
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,400
What?

1247
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,400
What?

1248
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,400
What?

1249
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,400
What?

1250
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,400
What?

1251
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,400
If he died because of me,

1252
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,400
I'll be punished.

1253
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,400
How can you be punished?

1254
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
You can't do that.

1255
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:52,400
If it wasn't for me,

1256
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:59,400
will the world be punished?

1257
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,400
I'm sorry.

1258
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,400
I'm sorry.

1259
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
I'm sorry.

1260
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,400
I'm sorry.

1261
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,400
I'm sorry.

1262
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,400
I'm sorry.

1263
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,400
I'm sorry.

1264
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,400
I'm sorry.

1265
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:35,400
I'm sorry.

1266
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,400
I'm sorry.

1267
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,400
I'm sorry.

1268
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,400
I'm sorry.

1269
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,400
I'm sorry.

1270
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,400
I'm sorry.

1271
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,400
I have to find her.

1272
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,400
How?

1273
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,400
It was a sale product to make the grilled chicken.

1274
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,400
Even if I put a bomb on it,

1275
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,400
I can't afford to buy a product.

1276
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,400
But if it was a sale product, I can definitely sell it.

1277
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,400
I chose the product from the local website.

1278
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,400
And I bought it.

1279
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,400
You bought it?

1280
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,400
Before the Black Friday event,

1281
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,400
I open the website.

1282
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,400
I introduce the products that will be sold.

1283
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,400
The culprit bought the product before the sale.

1284
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,400
12 points or more.

1285
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,400
I choose the product that can make a bomb

1286
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,400
because of the size and weight of the box.

1287
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,400
I put a bomb inside.

1288
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,400
I put it in the physical education service.

1289
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
If you use the physical education service,

1290
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,400
you can become a product.

1291
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,400
Wait a minute.

1292
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,400
The bomb is not a physical education.

1293
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:57,400
It's a product that Delphas has sealed.

1294
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:01,400
The culprit made Momotaro into a Kintaro.

1295
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,400
Inside the warehouse.

1296
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,400
Our warehouse has a free location.

1297
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,400
There are ordinary products and physical education products.

1298
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:13,400
But there are special barcode stickers on the physical education products.

1299
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,400
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

1300
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,400
The picking is based on the number of the items and the number of the items.

1301
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,400
But if you remove the sticker, the story is different.

1302
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
The original is the same product.

1303
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,400
If you remove the sticker and turn it over,

1304
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,400
no one will notice.

1305
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,400
If you look at the PC of the product management,

1306
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,400
you can see the products that are fast to be sold.

1307
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,400
Send it to the shelf.

1308
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,400
And you don't have to do anything else.

1309
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,400
If you order it,

1310
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,400
the Kintaro will be released and if you open it,

1311
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
it will be sold.

1312
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,400
And the culprit is...

1313
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,400
the two-week logistics center.

1314
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,400
He is in the Blue Pass.

1315
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
The data of the discovery company is only one month,

1316
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,400
but it's over 2,000.

1317
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,400
If you go around the picking,

1318
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,400
there are many people with a point minus.

1319
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,400
Isn't that the opposite?

1320
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,400
The culprit knows about this warehouse,

1321
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,400
and the routine of the Black Friday sale.

1322
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,400
If you have any questions, please leave a comment.

1323
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
The person who has been working for over two years

1324
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,400
is the one who is working for over two years.

1325
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,400
The person who has a job in the Chokin-Toukai.

1326
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,400
November 16th,

1327
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,400
2nd, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd.

1328
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,400
Can't you put these people together with the Butsuridai Co-Account?

1329
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,400
Name,

1330
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,400
address,

1331
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,400
phone number,

1332
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,400
search for it somewhere.

1333
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,400
The person who has a Butsuridai Co. account inside the store.

1334
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,400
Is the woman's name Kakei Marika?

1335
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:53,400
The account of the shopping bag is on the line.

1336
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,400
The person who has a Butsuridai Co. account inside the store.

1337
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,400
I found it.

1338
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,400
Police!

1339
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,400
Police, please come!

1340
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,400
I will contact the police.

1341
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,400
I will read out the information of the items

1342
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,400
that the person who has a Butsuridai Co. account

1343
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,400
has bought.

1344
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,400
All of them are fake.

1345
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,400
The person who has a Butsuridai Co. account inside the store.

1346
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,400
Please inform the police inside the store.

1347
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:31,400
The first is the number of the person who has a Minisaramic Heater.

1348
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,400
This is the Funado in the city center of Nishimusashi, Delfast.

1349
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,400
I just sent an email.

1350
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:56,400
Search for the most important item in the store.

1351
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,400
You search for it.

1352
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,400
Yes.

1353
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,400
It's your item.

1354
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,400
The important thing now is to check the items that explode.

1355
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,400
The item that exploded.

1356
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,400
The information of the shop is on the line.

1357
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,400
The suspect is broken.

1358
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,400
The suspect is 34 years old.

1359
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,400
He has been in the logistics center of Nishimusashi

1360
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,400
for 4 years.

1361
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,400
He is a high-ranking agent.

1362
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,400
Did you find the fake ID?

1363
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,400
Yes.

1364
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,400
The suspect who couldn't get the contact is the suspect.

1365
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,400
I found the fake ID.

1366
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,400
What about now?

1367
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,400
Is he in Delfast?

1368
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,400
He seems to be not in the store today.

1369
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,400
The suspect is not in the store.

1370
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,400
Yes.

1371
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,400
Hey, hey, hey.

1372
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,400
He is in the store.

1373
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,400
Yes.

1374
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,400
This bomb.

1375
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,400
If you press the switch, the two tormed bullets from the Shrinji will enter the store.

1376
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
The two tormed bullets will be combined with the Shoran Ammonium.

1377
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:09,400
By releasing the switch, the pressure will explode.

1378
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,400
This is the second step.

1379
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,400
The problem is this.

1380
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,400
This is a plastic.

1381
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,400
It's a 2-troll bullet.

1382
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,400
It's a V-O-V-O.

1383
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,400
V-O-V-O.

1384
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,400
Just a little shock.

1385
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,400
The danger of mixing with the Shoran Ammonium.

1386
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:32,400
In other words, the shock will be switched even without a box.

1387
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,400
Wait a minute.

1388
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,400
Stop it.

1389
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,400
Stop it.

1390
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,400
It's dangerous.

1391
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,400
What happened?

1392
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,400
What happened?

1393
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,400
I got hit.

1394
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,400
I got hit.

1395
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,400
Are you hurt?

1396
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,400
You!

1397
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
You are safe!

1398
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,400
I thought you were driving.

1399
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,400
I'm sorry.

1400
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,400
Dad.

1401
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,400
Thank you for your help.

1402
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,400
I'm glad you're safe.

1403
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,400
I'm glad you're safe.

1404
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,400
What happened?

1405
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,400
Are you hurt?

1406
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,400
I'm fine.

1407
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
What's the police?

1408
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,400
I'll talk to you later.

1409
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,400
Yagi!

1410
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,400
Wait a minute.

1411
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,400
I'm here.

1412
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,400
What is it?

1413
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,400
I'll call you later.

1414
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,400
I'll call you later.

1415
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,400
You're younger than I thought.

1416
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:24,400
I'm sure I can work better than I thought.

1417
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,400
I'm not asking you.

1418
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,400
Stop it.

1419
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,400
I'm sorry.

1420
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,400
I was about to explode at the center.

1421
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,400
You're going to make me fall?

1422
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,400
You're always like that.

1423
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,400
I thought you were moving.

1424
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,400
I think it's better to hang out with the president.

1425
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,400
And then...

1426
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,400
I'm done with the school.

1427
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,400
I'm sorry.

1428
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,400
The central department center is full of people.

1429
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,400
The tires of the cargo are on the ceiling.

1430
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,400
The cream from the trailer.

1431
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,400
Thanks to the delivery fast,

1432
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,400
I can't get rid of the condition of the delivery fast.

1433
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,400
The driver is a bit less than the cargo.

1434
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,400
Is it worse because of the accident?

1435
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,400
I was surprised.

1436
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:23,400
I asked him to turn the wheel.

1437
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,400
I wanted to turn it.

1438
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,400
Who is this tank?

1439
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,400
The last cargo to deliver the cargo.

1440
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
Last mile.

1441
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,400
I was like that too.

1442
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,400
That was a heart attack.

1443
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,400
I'm so far away.

1444
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,400
If you're crying,

1445
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,400
why don't you stop crying?

1446
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,400
I'm sorry.

1447
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,400
I'm sorry.

1448
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
I should stop.

1449
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,400
You're so stubborn.

1450
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,400
Yagi-san!

1451
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:27,400
I'm going to stop!

1452
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
I'm going to the airport!

1453
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:34,400
I'm sorry.

1454
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,400
It's cold.

1455
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
The total number is 2485.

1456
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,400
That's a total of 35.

1457
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,400
The body was found at the station of Tatsunaka-gou.

1458
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,400
The number of the body was found at the station.

1459
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,400
The body was found at the station of Tatsunaka-gou.

1460
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,400
The body was found at the station of Tatsunaka-gou.

1461
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,400
Let's start.

1462
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:37,380
You are me

1463
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,380
Good Morning

1464
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:52,140
So we gonna get out of here color

1465
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,840
Divine tunnel exploding

1466
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,580
The commander is getting on my nerves

1467
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:02,580
We won't let you get away with anything!

1468
01:43:02,580 --> 01:43:04,580
We won't!

1469
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:06,580
We won't let you get away with anything!

1470
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,580
We won't!

1471
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,580
Are you okay?

1472
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:18,580
But we really want to get away with things quickly.

1473
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:20,580
We have to do something.

1474
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:23,580
The strike at the central center is breaking into the front of the canteen.

1475
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,580
The warehouse is closed.

1476
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:27,580
We can't leave.

1477
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,580
The security guards are resting in the ring.

1478
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,580
This is the canceling.

1479
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:35,580
There's a emergency.

1480
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,580
Isn't it a big disaster?

1481
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:39,580
Yes.

1482
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,580
So you're saying it's a good thing?

1483
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:46,580
It's my fault.

1484
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:48,580
It's my responsibility.

1485
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:53,580
The problem is the superior of the emergency ward.

1486
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:54,580
What's going on?

1487
01:43:54,580 --> 01:43:56,580
It seems to be a big problem.

1488
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,580
What's the big deal?

1489
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:00,580
Hurry up and get back to work.

1490
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,580
The factory is Deliphaz, Japan.

1491
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:05,580
The head of the QB of the emergency ward has come to the rescue.

1492
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,580
The emergency ward is also in danger.

1493
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:12,580
The emergency ward is under the pre-trial and emergency care.

1494
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,580
The emergency ward is under the pre-trial and emergency care.

1495
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:17,580
One more thing.

1496
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:20,580
The superior of the emergency ward is going to be the head of the emergency ward.

1497
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:23,580
The emergency ward has been under the control for three years.

1498
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,580
We have to do nothing.

1499
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:28,580
If we don't do anything, we won't be able to deliver

1500
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:31,580
a hundred thousand items that are hidden in the foot.

1501
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,580
Then we'll just sign the contract.

1502
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,580
Yes, I'm using this too.

1503
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:39,580
Flamingo Bin, Salto Bin Un Yu Speed 2.

1504
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:42,580
This is the request letter from the representative of the three major companies.

1505
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:48,580
The delivery of the delivery is to be taken into account by the physical condition of the patient.

1506
01:44:48,580 --> 01:44:54,580
The QB of the emergency ward is to be taken into account by the Deliphaz, Japan.

1507
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,580
That's the kind of person.

1508
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:58,580
Who would do this?

1509
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,580
There was a great person.

1510
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,580
I was surprised.

1511
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,580
Deliphaz, you're going to deliver it.

1512
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:14,580
Delivering is to deliver something that has a strong power.

1513
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:16,580
This is a sign of an emergency.

1514
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:20,580
Now, what should we do?

1515
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:24,580
After 15 hours, the New York market opens.

1516
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:28,580
If we don't collect the entire stock and re-sale it,

1517
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:32,580
Mr. Igarashi, I'll take the job.

1518
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:36,580
You came from America to crush me?

1519
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:40,580
The plate that I sent to Japan is the plate of the author.

1520
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:43,580
It looks like that.

1521
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:46,580
I...

1522
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:53,580
I wanted to be the author from 5 years ago.

1523
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:55,580
I didn't want to be.

1524
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:11,580
Hey, people fly in front of you.

1525
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,580
You're worried about yourself.

1526
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,580
What about you?

1527
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:22,580
I wanted to ask you.

1528
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,580
You were there 5 years ago.

1529
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,580
You're the only one left.

1530
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:44,580
I just wanted to be a police officer.

1531
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:46,580
I just wanted to work as a lawyer.

1532
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:49,580
He was a weak man.

1533
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:52,580
I was so lucky to have such a good fortune.

1534
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:54,580
That's all I said.

1535
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:55,580
You're kidding.

1536
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:58,580
If you're caught by a police officer, you can say that.

1537
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:01,580
I don't know if you'll agree.

1538
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:09,580
I have done something.

1539
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:15,580
No one did anything.

1540
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:19,580
That's why I'm here now.

1541
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:27,580
We're on the same rail.

1542
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:36,580
You and I are not alone.

1543
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:44,580
We're on the same rail.

1544
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:47,580
You're the one who's running.

1545
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:50,580
You're the one who's running.

1546
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:52,580
The last one.

1547
01:47:54,580 --> 01:47:55,580
There he is.

1548
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:57,580
Don't let him run.

1549
01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:00,580
The last one.

1550
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:08,580
What's this?

1551
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:10,580
It's not a bomb.

1552
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,580
I know.

1553
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:13,580
It's a hole.

1554
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:16,580
I've searched all the items you bought.

1555
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:17,580
This is the last one.

1556
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,580
You're not the last one.

1557
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,580
Don't tell me.

1558
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,580
You're the last one.

1559
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,580
You're the one who's running.

1560
01:48:24,580 --> 01:48:26,580
You're the one who's running.

1561
01:48:26,580 --> 01:48:29,580
There's one bomb.

1562
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:34,580
Kasuga, the one who made the bomb.

1563
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:36,580
Yes, one of the 12 bombs.

1564
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:38,580
There's a bomb in the motor.

1565
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:40,580
The switch doesn't work.

1566
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,580
11 bombs?

1567
01:48:42,580 --> 01:48:44,580
That means you're the last one.

1568
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,580
Is the investigation over?

1569
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:48,580
Is it over?

1570
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:52,580
Thank you, Kasuga.

1571
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:55,580
The investigation is over.

1572
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:58,580
Excuse me.

1573
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:02,580
The list is on the table.

1574
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,580
One more.

1575
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,580
The number of people who are on the table is

1576
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:10,580
the driver.

1577
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,580
The president.

1578
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,580
The investigation team is calling.

1579
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:24,580
Wait.

1580
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:27,580
I'm sorry.

1581
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:29,580
The phone and the girl are calling.

1582
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,580
Sorry.

1583
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:34,580
Is the old man from Shizuji coming?

1584
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,580
The old man from Shizuji?

1585
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:38,580
He's the one who bought the bomb.

1586
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:40,580
He said he didn't want to.

1587
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:43,580
Did your father buy something?

1588
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,580
Did he buy something?

1589
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:50,580
Say it!

1590
01:50:01,580 --> 01:50:04,580
If you want something, go to me.

1591
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:09,580
You don't like it?

1592
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:13,580
No, I bought the bomb.

1593
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,580
I asked my friend's sister to buy it.

1594
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,580
I was waiting for it.

1595
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,580
Why didn't you tell me?

1596
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:20,580
It's my birthday.

1597
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,580
It's my father's.

1598
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:27,580
The bomb.

1599
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,580
I found all of them.

1600
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:32,580
One of them was a broken motor.

1601
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:49,580
The criminal bought the goods and

1602
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:51,580
put the bomb on it.

1603
01:50:52,580 --> 01:50:55,580
The goods were in the beginning.

1604
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:58,580
Yes.

1605
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:04,580
When did you release the phone?

1606
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:07,580
It's the day before the Black Friday.

1607
01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:10,580
It's the press release on November 23.

1608
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:15,580
What?

1609
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,580
He's trying to blow up the place he couldn't buy.

1610
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,580
How did he blow up the place?

1611
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:25,580
There's a way.

1612
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:29,580
There's only one way.

1613
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:35,580
The answer I wanted to know the most was in the locker.

1614
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:41,580
Here you go.

1615
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:48,580
The fire extinguisher.

1616
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:52,580
The way is the goal.

1617
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,580
The way is the way of the fire extinguisher.

1618
01:51:58,580 --> 01:52:00,580
It's too much.

1619
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:02,580
It's too much.

1620
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:06,580
What do you mean?

1621
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:11,580
Who is this girl?

1622
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:16,580
This person.

1623
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,580
The hair was short.

1624
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,580
The police is looking for the girl.

1625
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:28,580
Thank you very much.

1626
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:31,580
The criminal is in the photo.

1627
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:35,580
The left side is the black one.

1628
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:40,580
This girl is still young and a woman.

1629
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:41,580
That's great.

1630
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:46,580
What about the real Satonaka Koji?

1631
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,580
The secret.

1632
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:51,580
The Satonaka Koji was living in a homeless house.

1633
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:54,580
His family was trying to get him out of the house.

1634
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:57,580
Maybe he sold his own private property.

1635
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:02,580
He rented an apartment in a rented apartment.

1636
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,580
That's right.

1637
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,580
He's a criminal.

1638
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,580
What's the truth?

1639
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:12,580
The truth is the truth.

1640
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:15,580
He's the one who's been living here for a long time.

1641
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:21,580
But he's been exposed to the reaction of life on the screen.

1642
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:27,580
He's been exposed to the front of his face as he lives.

1643
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:47,580
The Satonaka Koji

1644
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,580
I'm so sorry.

1645
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:21,580
I'm sorry.

1646
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:28,580
If you're so sorry,

1647
01:54:29,580 --> 01:54:31,580
you should not have.

1648
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:38,580
As a person who used the bomb,

1649
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:43,580
there's one more bomb that's going to explode.

1650
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:48,580
There are 12 bombs in total.

1651
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:51,580
What's the last one?

1652
01:54:52,580 --> 01:54:53,580
I've searched it all.

1653
01:54:53,580 --> 01:54:58,580
I've searched the items that were in the locker and the items in the delivery.

1654
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,580
If I find anything else,

1655
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,580
I won't open it yet.

1656
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:06,580
The items of the delivery!

1657
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:08,580
I'm sorry.

1658
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:12,580
I have to do this job that you can't teach me.

1659
01:55:14,580 --> 01:55:17,580
If you're so concerned,

1660
01:55:17,580 --> 01:55:19,580
you should not have done that.

1661
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,580
Hey, wait!

1662
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:23,580
Do you remember the delivery?

1663
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:27,580
I don't remember it for three days.

1664
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:30,580
Look, there's a small fairy house.

1665
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:33,580
There's only one.

1666
01:55:33,580 --> 01:55:36,580
What are you doing now?

1667
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,580
The key.

1668
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,580
The key!

1669
01:55:46,580 --> 01:55:47,580
Yay!

1670
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:49,580
The present!

1671
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:54,580
Take it.

1672
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:56,580
4, 5, 4,

1673
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:58,580
13 bombs!

1674
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:00,580
It's here!

1675
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,580
It's here!

1676
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:12,580
It's here!

1677
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:15,580
It's here!

1678
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:36,580
It's here!

1679
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:38,580
It's mine!

1680
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:40,580
It's mine!

1681
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:43,580
It's mine!

1682
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:46,580
Did you find the items inside?

1683
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,580
Hello?

1684
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:50,580
It's a child.

1685
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:52,580
Mom, please call the police.

1686
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,580
No!

1687
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:54,580
Hide!

1688
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:56,580
It's a secret cell.

1689
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:58,580
It's here!

1690
01:57:07,580 --> 01:57:09,580
Hurry!

1691
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,580
It's here!

1692
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:15,580
It's here!

1693
01:57:27,580 --> 01:57:29,580
It's here!

1694
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:31,580
It's here!

1695
01:57:33,580 --> 01:57:34,580
Hey!

1696
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,580
What's going on?

1697
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:45,580
What's this?

1698
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:50,580
You're using it for a good cause.

1699
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:53,580
Can I still use it?

1700
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:55,580
Sorry.

1701
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:57,580
I don't have any items.

1702
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:59,580
I can't use it anymore.

1703
01:58:10,580 --> 01:58:12,580
I had high hopes for you.

1704
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:15,580
To think you'd be fired from daily fast Japan.

1705
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,580
You did a good job.

1706
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,580
20 yen increase per parcel.

1707
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:25,580
16 billion yen in the images.

1708
01:58:25,580 --> 01:58:27,580
It's a huge expense.

1709
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:30,580
Have you forgotten your English?

1710
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:38,580
You're the only one who can speak Japanese when you're on my side.

1711
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:40,580
When are you coming back?

1712
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:42,580
I can't go back.

1713
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:45,580
I decided to buy a white iron chair.

1714
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:47,580
What do you mean?

1715
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:49,580
This is what it means.

1716
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:58,580
Thank you for everything.

1717
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:04,580
You said you wanted to do well at the center of Nishimusashi.

1718
01:59:04,580 --> 01:59:10,580
You should have stopped doing what you did to help.

1719
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:13,580
I didn't know what to do.

1720
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:27,580
Didn't you send an email to America?

1721
01:59:28,580 --> 01:59:33,580
You said you were going to send a message to America.

1722
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:37,580
But you ignored it.

1723
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:50,580
But you didn't tell me anything.

1724
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:54,580
I was prepared for the worst.

1725
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:56,580
There was something we could have done.

1726
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,580
Maybe not four years ago, but definitely before Black Friday.

1727
01:59:59,580 --> 02:00:02,580
You can't just cancel Black Friday.

1728
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:03,580
People look forward to that.

1729
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:06,580
And remember, customer centric.

1730
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,580
Magic word.

1731
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:14,580
What?

1732
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:16,580
Have a present for you.

1733
02:00:23,580 --> 02:00:26,580
The truck will leave in an hour.

1734
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,580
And we can go back.

1735
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:31,580
I got a call from Igarashi.

1736
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:33,580
He said he would come here.

1737
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:36,580
Really?

1738
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:40,580
He said the next center is like this.

1739
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:41,580
What?

1740
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:45,580
Congratulations.

1741
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:54,580
What should we do?

1742
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,580
If you like it.

1743
02:00:56,580 --> 02:00:58,580
Even if you say so.

1744
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:02,580
Your number is here.

1745
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:16,580
How much is one 20 yen?

1746
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:21,580
100 yen for a box and 2000 yen for a baseball bat.

1747
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,580
What's going on?

1748
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:30,580
I want my father to be fine.

1749
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,580
Don't be so sad.

1750
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:35,580
25 yen?

1751
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:37,580
I'm alive.

1752
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:40,580
Excuse me.

1753
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,580
The one from Delifas.

1754
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:44,580
The one from Delifas.

1755
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:48,580
This won't explode.

1756
02:01:48,580 --> 02:01:50,580
Thank you.

1757
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:52,580
Wait a minute.

1758
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:55,580
I want to hear something.

1759
02:01:55,580 --> 02:01:56,580
Me?

1760
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:58,580
Go to that side.

1761
02:01:58,580 --> 02:01:59,580
Okay.

1762
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:04,580
Here you go.

1763
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:07,580
Congratulations.

1764
02:02:07,580 --> 02:02:09,580
You're crying.

1765
02:02:18,580 --> 02:02:20,580
I'm sorry.

1766
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:40,580
I'm so sorry.

1767
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:42,580
Wait.

1768
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:44,580
The boat.

1769
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:46,580
The boat is here.

1770
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:49,580
Mr. Funado.

1771
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:50,580
Come here.

1772
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:51,580
What?

1773
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,580
You're not sleeping at all.

1774
02:02:53,580 --> 02:02:55,580
Mr. Funado.

1775
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:18,580
Mr. Funado.

1776
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:48,580
Mr. Funado.

1777
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:13,580
What?

1778
02:04:13,580 --> 02:04:15,580
What do you want?

1779
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:18,580
What do you want?

1780
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:30,580
What? What? What do you want?

1781
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:48,580
Even if we do, we can't do it well

1782
02:04:48,580 --> 02:04:54,580
If we noticed, we became a shell

1783
02:04:54,580 --> 02:05:00,580
Even if we lost, we were destroyed, we were taken away

1784
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:09,580
There was nothing cold

1785
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:27,580
Even if we can't sleep, we can't do anything

1786
02:05:58,580 --> 02:06:06,580
Even if you were broken, you would never return

1787
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:11,580
I don't care, just live with me

1788
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:17,580
Even if we can't go back to the things we lost

1789
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:25,580
Even if we can't go back to the things we lost

1790
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:44,580
Hey, let's go back to the things we lost

1791
02:06:44,580 --> 02:06:49,580
Let's walk through the long night

1792
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:57,580
I want to, I want to, fly away, fly away, fly away

1793
02:06:57,580 --> 02:07:03,580
I didn't have the right to erase the light

1794
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:15,580
I've been avoiding everything, everything that I've been avoiding

1795
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:22,580
Even if you were to erase me, erase me, even if you can't remember

1796
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:28,580
I'll fall in love with you for the first time

1797
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:34,580
You're the light that lighted up me, the one that lights up

1798
02:07:34,580 --> 02:07:42,580
I don't care if you're going to leave or go back

1799
02:07:46,580 --> 02:07:55,580
Even if you're going to leave or go back to the things we lost

1800
02:07:55,580 --> 02:08:05,580
Even if you're going to leave or go back to the things we lost

1801
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:13,580
Even if you were to erase me, erase me, even if you can't remember

1802
02:08:13,580 --> 02:08:19,580
I'll live with you, the things we lost

1803
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:23,580
Even if we can't go back to the things we lost

1804
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:29,580
Even if we can't go back to the things we lost

1805
02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:36,580
Even if we can't sing well, we're a character
