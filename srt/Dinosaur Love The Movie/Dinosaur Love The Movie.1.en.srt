191
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,710
Caan

192
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,760
when did you apologize sincerely

193
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,740
If you don&#39;t mean it, don&#39;t say it

194
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,560

198
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,530
It&#39;s Caan

199
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,000
The Caan who played with Maker

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,610
They&#39;re an on-screen couple

201
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,580

202
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,930

Hello

204
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,380
What&#39;s up

205
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,890
Mike has something to tell you

206
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,760
maybe still tease you

207
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,310

208
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,630
let&#39;s go get something to eat

209
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,360
I&#39;m going to talk to Mike

210
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,420
Where is he

211
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,180
He&#39;s in the men&#39;s room on the third floor

212
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,640
you go with me

213
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,200
may be good news for you

214
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,050
Yeah

215
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,290
Twitch

216
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,860
why are you so slow

217
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,290
that is

218
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,070
i want to apologize to you for what happened last night

219
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,170
i know i&#39;m unreasonable

220
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,450
sorry

221
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,130
don&#39;t be mad at me

222
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,430
Maker

223
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,680
Maker

224
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,650
You stop apologizing for things you don&#39;t feel you did wrong

225
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,380
OK

226
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,160
Twitch

227
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,480
Are you going to change your mind about me?

228
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,290
if you think so

229
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,280
let&#39;s break up

230
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,230
don&#39;t don&#39;t

231
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,040
sorry

232
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,160
i won&#39;t talk about you anymore

233
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
don&#39;t break up with me

234
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,800
we have been together for three years

235
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,050
ok Ruk

236
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,589
About Caan

237
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,880
I really just consider him a friend

238
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,760
It was Kaan who tried his best to get it together.

239
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,079
i don&#39;t have any idea about him

240
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,020
can you swear

241
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,790
Say nothing ever happened to you and Caan

242
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,630
that is

243
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,580
I

244
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,550
I did not do it on purpose

245
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,000
It&#39;s Kaan&#39;s fault

246
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,610
Kaan came to pester my Ruk

247
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,190
Stop blaming others, Mike

248
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,820
let&#39;s break up

249
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,610
I said I don&#39;t know

250
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,960
No, Ruk

251
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,140
I don&#39;t want to break up

252
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,200
can&#39;t we continue dating

253
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
finally broke up

254
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,430
[Sure enough, it is good news as you said]

255
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,760
if that&#39;s what you want

256
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,830
congratulations

257
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,540
are you mad at me

258
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,580
don&#39;t look at me like that

259
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,960
Twitch

260
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,070
Maker

261
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,310
take it if you want it that much

262
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,260
But the price is your friendship

263
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,460
The friendship ends here

264
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,910
I wish you happiness in the future

265
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,050
i won&#39;t be mad at you

266
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,030
don&#39;t hate you

267
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,190
From now on

268
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,050
you and meck

269
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,650
air to me

270
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,850
Twitch

271
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,880
Twitch

272
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,460
you open the door for me

273
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,240
Ruk are you still mad at me?

274
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,380
You&#39;ve never been mad at me for so long

275
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,010
♫ I like it ♫

276
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,090
Twitch

277
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,630
child

278
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,350
your friend is not here

279
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,500
I see he hasn&#39;t come back for several days

280
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,580
Maybe I&#39;m so anxious that I&#39;m leaving the house.

281
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,580
oh

282
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,310
honestly

283
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,740
I&#39;ve wanted to inquire about your friend several times.

284
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,480
Has your friend been meddled by a third party?

285
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,200
I understand that the current morality is not good

286
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,030
Have you been intervened by a third party?

287
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,720
really

288
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,420
or say no

289
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,380
no

290
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,390
Yeah

291
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,850
that&#39;s okay

292
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,500
then i inquire about another matter

293
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,960
That show you were in with Maker

294
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,940
I like it very much

295
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,570
Is it a sequel?

296
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,130
Which drama&#39;s sequel is coming

297
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,160
our yearbook, right?

298
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,610
it&#39;s the sequel to that show

299
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,760
seriously can i make a cameo

300
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,210
What

301
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,630
it doesn&#39;t seem to work

302
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,580
That&#39;s it, your friend isn&#39;t here

303
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,400
Let&#39;s go back

304
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,720
No matter how hard you knock on the door

305
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,720
OK

306
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,700
Tell your friend Mike I like him a lot

307
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,510
Not very happy recently

308
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,940
go Go

309
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,080
I think that must be the case

310
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,330
People with bad character like to meddle in other people&#39;s relationships

311
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,470
But did I get involved too?

312
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,120
It doesn&#39;t matter

313
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,450
by the way friends

314
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,480
Has the traffic of Meck and Caan declined recently?

315
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,430
don&#39;t meddle in other people&#39;s business

316
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,740
Take care of your studies first

317
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,010
People are curious

318
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,180
study hard

319
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,690
can you graduate

320
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,070
People are curious

321
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,160
How many years do you have to study to graduate?

322
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,690
you see he doesn&#39;t feel well

323
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,910
ask him if he&#39;s okay

324
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,070
Ruk, are you okay?

325
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,730
why do you look downcast

326
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,140
fine

327
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,680
friends

328
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,240
I think

329
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,460
I want to transfer

330
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,350
Really

331
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,020
- do you want to transfer school - do you want to transfer school

332
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,070
where are you going to transfer

333
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,020
did something happen to you

334
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,920

Who is a couple among the three

338
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,470
I&#39;m dumbfounded

339
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,880
Back then I saw you and Kaan had a great time

340
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,850
But why later alienated

341
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,890
I&#39;m actually dating Mike

342
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,220
Oh My God

343
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,280
calm

344
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,430
But it does not matter

Scared? He didn&#39;t tell you?

595
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,140

Brother Dino

I will help you with tutoring

642
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,720
Thanks

643
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,360
Walk

644
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,790
The first question is correct

645
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,130
As for the second question, you replaced the wrong value

646
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,220
First replace this number here

647
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,120
the formula is right

648
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,900
Everything else should be fine

649
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,840
do you understand what I said

650
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,720
do you know

651
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,150
You don&#39;t even blink when you look at me today

652
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,210
i just feel weird

653
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,480
because i wear a suit

654
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,760
Um

655
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,530
how little rabbit

656
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,470
Am I handsome

657
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,340
Then don&#39;t you change your clothes?

658
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,040
why change

659
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,810
you look at me so intently

660
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,030
I won&#39;t change easily

661
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,750
change

662
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,310
You make me shy

663
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,700
Or do you want to help me change

664
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,050
You better change it yourself

665
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,960
um wait for me here

666
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,120

00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,290
every time I have a crush on you

679
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,330
I just fold a star and put it in the jar

680
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,470
very interesting

681
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,990
but if you make me feel bad

682
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,910

I just let you take one out

686

Um

687
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,020
Can we date when we are full?

688
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,390
have to fill up first

689
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,750
Then can I fold it myself?

690
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,970
it will be full tomorrow

691
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,830
no

692
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,000
why not

693
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,590
So do you have a crush on me today?

694
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,880
Brother Dino

695
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,140
I have an appointment with a friend and I have to hurry over

696
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,270

697
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,270

You take care of your body too

703
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,750
Bye-Bye

704
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,820
You didn&#39;t forget anything, did you?

705
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,750
Um

706
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:18,760
No

707
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,620
OK

708
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,010
you don&#39;t look too excited

709
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,420
I&#39;ve been through it once

710
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,920
That&#39;s good

711
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,180
In fact, every school is the same

712
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,740
Don&#39;t worry about welcome

713
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,110
um don&#39;t worry

714
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,610
I&#39;m more worried about dormitories and part-time jobs

715
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,350
part time

716
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,190
Why

717
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,150
I want to earn some spare change while I&#39;m at school

718
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,770
oh

719
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,230
Are you interested in working in my shop?

720
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,890
bar?

721
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,020
actually a restaurant

722
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,650
in between

723
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,620
Um

724
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,280
Do you want to come to work for a month?

725
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,090
if you do feel dissatisfied

726
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,090
i won&#39;t say anything

727
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,500
Then I will find you a new job

728
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,550
interested

729
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,110
someday i start working

730
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,210
Take it easy

731
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,960
I guess we&#39;ll have to wait until the orientation is over.

732
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,740
I&#39;m afraid you can&#39;t handle it

733
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,070
There are classes and activities

734
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,810
I have to come to the store to work

735
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,980
I can&#39;t do anything well

736
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,840
I see

737
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,860
Did Dino send you a message?

738
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,500
No

739
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,260
he is a bit busy

740
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,460
He asked me to tell you

741
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,800
Don&#39;t take your folded stars out of the jar

742
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,040
then can i see him

743
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,530
this is the rule

744
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,950
In fact, all teaching assistants

745
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:00,100
Not allowed to pursue freshman

746
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,940
Not allowed to talk to freshman

747
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,130
But Dino is also ready to break the rules

748
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:05,850
talked to you

749
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,310
if you don&#39;t let him talk to you

750
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,730
he will beat us for sure

751
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,390
Don&#39;t talk to him too much

752
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,520
can chat but

753
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,560
try not to let people know

754
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,770
otherwise you will be punished

755
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,080
I will pay attention

756
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,010

952
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,820
we&#39;ve known each other for a while

953
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:15,480
a period of time

954
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,850
Ah Kung is enough

955
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:21,340
how

956
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:23,140
can&#39;t i know him

957
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,860
Um

958
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,380
What is it that I can&#39;t even know him?

959
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,570
Forget it drink

960
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,150
The kid&#39;s face is all white

961
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,010
People don&#39;t pick up on you

962
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,100
By the way, is your name Sim?

963
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,260
Called but he just didn&#39;t want to come

964
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:52,770
Dino

965
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,430
about that roommate

966
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,790
By the way, what&#39;s your roommate&#39;s name?

967
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,180
Charan

968
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:08,090
Well, please ask him

969
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,210
Is he going to run for school grass?

970
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,620
After school started, I asked my sophomore senior to contact him

971
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,340
OK, let me ask for you

972
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,650
I agree

973
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,190
he looks good

974
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,360
-Yep

975
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,320
But every time I look at his face

976
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,380
Especially like someone who is going to worship Indra

977
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,210
- yes - i&#39;m ready to fold my hands and worship him

978
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:29,620
right

979
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,020
Tall and handsome but expressionless

980
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,540
sleepy

981
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,020
haven&#39;t woken up haven&#39;t woken up yet

982
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,390
That day

983
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,430
the day I introduced myself

984
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:40,570
do you remember

985
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,520
Remember

986
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,000
Still impressed

987
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,170
I&#39;ll wait until he&#39;s done introducing himself

988
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,720
I&#39;ve driven three times around the school

989
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,410
What is your name

990
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:50,110
Charan

991
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:50,840
May I have your name

992
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,530
Charan

993
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,710
Enough is enough, have you drunk too much?

994
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,280
drunk look at your faces

995
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,570
do you want to buy some other drinks

996
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,210
I say no snacks

997
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,140
Do you want to go down and buy?

998
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,010
OK

999
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,720
It&#39;s good to buy it once.

1000
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,980
what about Ruk what do you want to eat

1001
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,570
It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ll come by myself

1002
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:13,280
OK

1003
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,440
then go downstairs

1004
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,300
let&#39;s go

1005
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,890
then i bid farewell

1006
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,260
I will send you

1007
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,420
let&#39;s go together

1008
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,030
Walk

1009
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,340

1010
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,180
let&#39;s go

1011
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,150
OK

1012
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,330
what to eat

1013
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,610
you drink too much

1014
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:35,910
where are we going

1015
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,340
I&#39;m going to drink them all

1016
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,520
I&#39;ll wait and see

1017
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,130
don&#39;t talk

1018
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,080
walk straight to see

1019
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,720
You all vomited on the side of the road the other day

1020
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,010
I never vomited who vomited

1021
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,500
- it&#39;s you - oops

1022
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,920
i forgot to take the car keys

1023
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,710
You stay with Ruk, I&#39;ll be right back

1024
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,460
good

1025
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,390
goodbye

1026
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,340
let&#39;s go to the car and wait

1027
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:55,760
let&#39;s go

1028
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,770
calm down my friend

1029
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,790
Twitch

1030
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,370
i want to talk to you

1031
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:00,420
What&#39;s up

1032
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,030
don&#39;t get my friend in trouble

1033
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,170
Freshmen have rules, teaching assistants have rules

1034
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,190
Better stay away from Dino

1035
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,290
Or do you feel close to Dino?

1036
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,760
Take it easy while training

1037
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,040
Is this a personal idea?

1038
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,870
what personal thoughts

1039
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:28,660
i mean is it your personal opinion

1040
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,650
your mind is too narrow

1041
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,330
I get close to Dino hyung

1042
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,230
Doesn&#39;t mean I want to take it easy while training

1043
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,410
It sounds like you don&#39;t know much about Dino

1044
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,870
do you think you know him well

1045
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:54,380
understand to a certain extent

1046
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:58,150
Of course we have to understand the nature of those who pursue us

1047
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:00,970
do you think the same as me

1048
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,770
I don&#39;t know either

1049
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,860
But I kindly remind you

1050
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,120
where are they

1051
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,180
should be waiting by the car

1052
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:22,430
I&#39;ll wait for you by the car

1053
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,720
Wait a minute

1054
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:28,760
i have something to tell you

1055
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,750
what&#39;s the matter with you

1056
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,950
nothing but don&#39;t want you to go back

1057
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,730
How many stars are in a can of stars

1058
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,980
There are now twenty

1059
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,010
Twenty, when will it be full?

1060
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,860
I don&#39;t know when it&#39;s full, I&#39;ll tell you

1061
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,910
how much can i get today

1062
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,170
don&#39;t tell you

1063
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,230
what don&#39;t tell me

1064
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,560
how many

1065
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:57,840
give you five

1066
00:57:58,970 --> 00:57:59,940
only five?

1067
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:00,620
Um

1068
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,510
give ten

1069
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:04,150
no haggling

1070
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,120
five is enough

1071
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,010
ten

1072
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,420
Five is your favor for me

1073
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:12,920
five left

1074
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,760
I share my affection for you with you

1075
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,870
I am leaving

1076
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:35,520
want something

1077
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,210
I&#39;ve been looking at this for a long time

1078
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:40,640
i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good or not

1079
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,620
then i will buy it for you

1080
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,090
do you want anything else

1081
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,600
Brother Dino, but the price is a bit expensive

1082
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,200
Don&#39;t worry

1083
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:50,380
what about this

1084
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,150
This is also good but too expensive

1085
00:58:55,150 --> 00:58:56,030
I buy for you

1086
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,820
Are you here for shopping?

1087
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,720
what&#39;s the matter

1088
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,310
all right now all right

1089
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,110
but not necessarily in the future

1090
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:15,480
who is behind you

1091
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,580
very familiar

1092
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,290
Looks like a freshman in our college

1093
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:21,090
answer if you ask

1094
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,410
who is it

1095
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,200
do you know him well

1096
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,340
can&#39;t answer

1097
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,260
Then you are going to the training room tonight

1098
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,950
I&#39;m calling my junior teaching assistants, including you.

1099
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,240
Dino Ruk

1100
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,100
have you waited long

1101
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:48,030
Seniors and sisters, hello

1102
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,240
Boris, did you come with them?

1103
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,450
yeah i asked them to come here

1104
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:55,790
but going back

1105
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,540
what are you doing here

1106
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,760
Actually it&#39;s our own business

1107
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,420
But it&#39;s not a secret if you want to know

1108
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,870
Let&#39;s talk about school grass and school flowers

1109
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,550
he school grass

1110
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:09,740
are you kidding me

1111
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,840
I didn&#39;t say anything

1112
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,300
Are you just thinking about it yourself?

1113
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,380
he happened to be friends with charan

1114
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,720
Junior senior wants Charan to run

1115
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,240
but he refused

1116
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,580
So I want Ruk to help recommend other students

1117
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,620
You also know

1118
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,870
After the training camp

1119
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,150
I&#39;m about to run for school grass and school belle

1120
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,620
Ok, I know

1121
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:31,480
Yes

1122
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:32,940
what else is there

1123
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,830
Don&#39;t think no one knows what you did

1124
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:40,270
i hope there is no privilege

1125
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:43,290
Let this student not participate in the training camp

1126
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,190
Ever since I took care of my juniors

1127
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,910
no problem happened

1128
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,050
I don&#39;t think there will be any in the future

1129
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,370
but i heard

1130
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,630
The seniors gave the juniors who did not come to the training camp

1131
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,740
issued cogs

1132
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:58,060
is it a girl

1133
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,080
Still the senior&#39;s girlfriend

1134
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,580
What a privilege this is

1135

1139
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:17,210
otherwise you have to reveal

1140
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,440
thank you senior

1141
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:18,960

we&#39;re back we&#39;re back

1145
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,120
Now our teaching assistants have been selected

1146
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,690
There are three groups

1147
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,760
applaud them

1148
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,210
Are you ready to hear the rules of the game?

1149
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,470

1150
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,110
Ready

1151
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:53,920
The name of this game is too long too long

1152
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,770
dumbfounded dumbfounded

1153
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:00,590
Everyone is confused why this game is called this name

1154
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,920
This is a legend, let me tell you in detail

1155
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,510
Before that we listen to the rules of the game

1156
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,350
Ok our rule is

1157
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,120
We give prompts to three groups

1158
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:13,400
This prompt is to lead you to a place

1159
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,200
Let&#39;s help solve the puzzle together

1160
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:16,790
Yes

1161
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:22,610

1162
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,490
- has eight legs - god

1163
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,910
Has two tongues and four nostrils

01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,630
black

1166
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,170
Our seniors and sisters are all dumbfounded

1167
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,180
sit until dawn

1168
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:31,850

1169
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:32,590

From 4:00 pm to 4:00 am

1171
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,090
so the name is too long too long

1172
01:02:36,370 --> 01:02:37,530
what is the answer do you know

1173
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,120
two black dogs

1174
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,660
Right at the school gate they are a couple

1175
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,340
we can&#39;t find it

1176
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:44,340
oh my god what

1177
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,140

1178
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,500

1179
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,230

Well choose in order

1187
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:14,200
Okay, now all three groups have received the prompts.

1188
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,740
After a while the referees will issue a signal

1189
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,800
Count one, two, three by our seniors

1190
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:26,680

01:03:28,090 --> 01:03:29,140

I can only do this

1199
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,200
why don&#39;t you count yourself

1200
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:45,190
are we going to look for it

1201
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,120

Need not

1234
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,140
In case you climb up and fall down

1235
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,870

1236
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:42,450

1247
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,340
Don&#39;t worry about the stars, worry about yourself first

1249

01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,340
it was just an accident

1253
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,740
Actually I don&#39;t want accidents to happen

1254
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,250
but if it happens

1255
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,600
I don&#39;t have that pain

1256
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,480
Brother Dino, don&#39;t blame others

1257
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,330

1258
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,510

1264
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,640
But it was only me that had an accident

1265
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,200
you don&#39;t blame your friends

1266
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,720
I&#39;m still your bunny

1267
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,070
