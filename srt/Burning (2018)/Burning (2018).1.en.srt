20
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:19,875
Congratulations, sir! Congratulations!

21
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,292

Okay. Drum roll please.

25

The lucky number is 85! Congratulations.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,208
Who has number 85?

27
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,125
Does anyone have number 85?

28
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:54,958
Oh there you are! Congratulations!

29
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,625
Do you have a girlfriend?

30
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,125
I don't.

31
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,958
What are you going to do with this?
This is a girl's watch.

32
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,958
You should start looking for one.

33
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,292
Lee Jong-su.

34
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,750
Don't you remember me?

35
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,500
We lived in the same neighborhood
when we were little.

36
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,958
Manu-ri, Tanhyeon-myeon in Paju City.

37
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,958
It's me, Shin Hae-mi!

38
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:24,042
I had plastic surgery.
I got pretty, right?

39
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:28,042
Are you free? It's my break soon.

40
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,250
Did you serve in the military?

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,417
Of course.

42
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:45,208
And then?

43
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:47,958
And then what?

44
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,958
I graduated from college

45
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:59,750
and I have a part time job now.

46
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,708
But I'm doing something else on the side.

47
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,292
Like what?

48
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,833
If I may ask...

49
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,958
I'm writing

50
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,542
You're writing? What are you writing?

51
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,833
A novel.

52
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,750
Wow. Then are you a writer?

53
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,458
Not officially.

54
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,042
I'm trying to become one.

55
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:31,208
How cool.

56
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,458
Writer Lee Jong-su.

57
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,708
- How's work?
- Okay.

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,292
It's fun.

59
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,833
I like this kind of work. Physical work.

60
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:54,000
I only come to work when they call me
so it gives me a lot of freedom.

61
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:57,833
So that's cool.

62
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,958
Now you seem like
the Hae-mi I used to know.

63
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,958
Do you want this? From the raffle.

64
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,250
I've never worn a watch before.

65
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,500
Damn. It's so tacky.

66
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,000
Hey, do you want to
grab a drink with me tonight?

67
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:39,708
Why not?

68
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:48,958
Guess what?

69
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,875
I'm going to Africa.

70
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,708
Africa? Why?

71
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,750
I've been saving up to travel.

72
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,958
But why Africa?

73
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,292
This is pantomime.

74
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,250
I'm learning pantomime these days.

75
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,250
Why? Do you want to become an actress?

76
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,750
You think anyone can become an actress?

77
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm just learning it for fun.

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,917
Look. I can eat tangerines
whenever I want.

79
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,333
That's good. You're talented.

80
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,917
This has nothing to do with talent.

81
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:51,250
This is how it works.

82
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,250
Don't think there is a tangerine here.

83
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,458
Just forget that there isn't one.
That's the key.

84
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,833
The important thing
is to think you really want one.

85
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,958
Then your mouth will water,
and it'll really taste good.

86
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,042
Do you know the Bushmen
who live in the Kalahari Desert?

87
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,333
They have two types of "starving people."

88
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,958
Starving people. "Hunger" in English.

89
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,042
"Little Hunger" and "Great Hunger."

90
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,958
Little Hunger is a person who is
literally hungry.

91
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,958
Great Hunger is a person who is
hungry for the meaning of life.

92
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:03,458
Someone wishing to know why we live,
what meaning there is in life,

93
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,667
that sort of thing.

94
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:11,625
They are the truly hungry people.
So they are called "Great Hunger."

95
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:16,458
So you're going to Africa to meet
"Great Hunger"?

96
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,333
Cool, right? Great Hunger...

97
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,833
Jong-su.

98
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,208
Lee Jong-su.

99
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,000
Will you do me a favor?

100
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:37,042
I have a pet cat.

101
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,208
Can you feed it while I'm in Africa?

102
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,458
Do I have to bring the cat to my place?

103
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,958
No.

104
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,042
You have to come to my place

105
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,958
because a cat shouldn't be removed from
its house.

106
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,417
What's with all the luggage?

107
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm moving into my house in Paju.

108
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,708
- Today?
- Yes.

109
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,917
Who lives in your Paju house?

110
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:27,708
No one.

111
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,667
My mom left when I was little

112
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,500
and my sister got married a few years ago.

113
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,958
So only my dad lives there
raising the cows,

114
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:44,042
but he ran into a problem,
so now I have to return home.

115
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,958
You're not asking what the problem was?

116
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,042
There are always problems.

117
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,833
We're here.

118
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,625
Hello.

119
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:54,333
Nice place.

120
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,958
The toilet was next to the kitchen sink
in my old room.

121
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:20,208
This room faces North,
so it's always chilly and dark.

122
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:24,125
It gets sunlight only once a day.
From over there.

123
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:30,000
The sunlight hits the Seoul Tower window
and bounces into my room.

124
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:34,875
It's only for a brief moment.
You have to be lucky to see it.

125
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,958
Boil.

126
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,208
Come on out.

127
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,958
Boil.

128
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,708
Your cat's name is Boil?

129
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,958
Yes, Boil.

130
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,958
I found him abandoned in
the basement boiler room.

131
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,250
He hides and doesn't come out
if there's a stranger here.

132
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,000
He has severe autism.

133
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,667
Boil doesn't exist only in
your imagination too, does he?

134
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:14,958
Am I coming here to feed an imaginary cat?

135
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:19,458
You think I asked you to come here
to feed an imaginary cat?

136
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,000
That's funny.

137
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:29,333
Should I forget that there isn't a cat?

138
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,958
Do you remember?

139
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,125
You said that I am ugly.

140
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,000
Really? I said that?

141
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:42,458
One day, on my way home from school,

142
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,708
you crossed the street and told me that.

143
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,875
"You are really ugly."

144
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,417
It was the only thing
you ever said to me in junior high.

145
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,667
Now tell me the truth.

146
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,208
Why can't you say anything?

147
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
Wait.

148
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,000
Put it on.

149
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,958
What, punk? Moo...

150
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,292
Hello?

151
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,500
Hello?

152
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,958
Hello?

153
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:18,542
Recent figures prove the severity
of our country's youth unemployment.

154
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:24,917
It is growing at the fastest rate
among OECD member countries.

155
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,083
Reporter Park Seong-ho will explain.

156
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:32,958
The growth of our unemployment rate
is the fastest within the OECD.

157
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,833
He claims that he set
a new vision for America.

158
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:54,750
A poll by the Washington Post and ABC
found that 94% of Trump voters...

159
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:55,875
Hello?

160
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,708
He was awarded high marks
for fulfilling his campaign promises,

161
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:04,958
such as immigrant deportation,
the Mexico border wall,

162
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,750
and abolishing Obamacare.

163
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:27,833
Boil, where are you?

164
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,042
Boil?

165
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:36,667
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

166
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,958
Look what we've got here?

167
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,958
What's this, Mr. Boil?

168
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,125
If you wanted to hide,
you should've hidden your poop too.

169
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:03,708
You're introducing your poop to me first?

170
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,875
Before a "Nice to meet you"?

171
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,083
You will not be disadvantaged for
refusing to testify.

172
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:58,000
However, if you forfeit your right
not to testify and do testify,

173
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:02,500
your testimony may be used against you
to prove your guilt.

174
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,083
Do you understand?

175
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:05,750
Yes.

176
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:11,417
Now. Would the prosecution
please state the arraignment?

177
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:13,417
The defendant, a livestock worker,

178
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,250
assaulted and injured
a civil servant of Paju City,

179
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:18,417
obstructing
the legitimate execution of duty,

180
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,958
and fracturing
the government official's right hand,

181
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,333
requiring six weeks of treatment.

182
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,750
Fine. Did you receive the indictment
including what you've just heard?

183
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:31,958
Yes.

184
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:35,958
Then do you accept the charges?

185
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,917
And do you have anything else to say?

186
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,750
The defendant accepts all charges,
Your Honor.

187
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:42,708
Okay.

188
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:44,125
Mr. Lee.

189
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,542
Do you agree
with your attorney's statement?

190
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:56,042
Mr. Lee?

191
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,458
Did you graduate from college?

192
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:08,750
Yes.

193
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:10,958
But you still don't have a job?

194
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:13,875
What was your major?

195
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,458
- I studied creative writing, sir.
- Creative writing.

196
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,208
So you studied writing.

197
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,000
What kind of writing
are you going to create?

198
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:28,958
I'm planning to write a novel.

199
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:30,125
Novel?

200
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,250
Wow...

201
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,208
So, what kind of novel
do you want to write?

202
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,042
I'm not sure yet...

203
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,917
How about writing about your father?

204
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:48,833
In my opinion,
he's like a protagonist in a story.

205
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,417
Look at his life! It's so turbulent!

206
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:57,958
He was nuts back in the day.
Aren't all protagonists nuts?

207
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:02,542
He was number one in Paju High.

208
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,958
Not for his grades, but for his pride.

209
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:12,625
After he returned
from working in the Middle East,

210
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:15,958
I told him to buy an apartment building
in Gangnam with the money he earned.

211
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,125
I promised he wouldn't regret it.

212
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,333
But he didn't, because of his pride.

213
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,542
Instead, he returned to Paju
and became a livestock farmer,

214
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,625
and now he's broke and in jail.

215
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:31,958
Even now.

216
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:36,667
He should apologize to the victim
and write a letter of apology.

217
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,125
He should submit a petition
to the judge for a reprieve.

218
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,667
But he's being stubborn.

219
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,708
He doesn't even listen to his lawyer.

220
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,208
That's why I wanted to see you.

221
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:55,083
Visit your father and talk to him.

222
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:59,958
Tell him to tame his temper
and write that letter of apology.

223
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:03,708
Immediately. Like tomorrow.

224
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,042
Got it?

225
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,042
Hey, I'm back.

226
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,833
You're still not showing yourself?
It's been over two weeks.

227
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:58,542
Hello?

228
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,083
Hello?

229
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,208
Hello?

230
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,000
I got through. Hello?

231
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:10,917
It's me, Hae-mi!

232
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,833
It was really hard making this call.

233
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,542
We might get disconnected.

234
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:22,958
I'm at Nairobi Airport in Kenya.

235
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:28,500
There was a bombing near the airport.
I was stuck here for three days.

236
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,125
Are you okay?

237
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:35,833
Yes, I'm okay.
I think it happens often here.

238
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,917
Anyway, I finally got a flight
out of here.

239
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:42,292
I arrive at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

240
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,958
Will you come to the airport?

241
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,958
I'll be there. For sure.

242
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,458
Hello?

243
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,000
Jong-su!

244
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,667
You're here.

245
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:06,958
Give me that.

246
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:11,042
Ben! This is my one and only friend,
Lee Jong-su.

247
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:12,958
Hi. I'm Ben.

248
00:37:14,417 --> 00:37:16,125
We're Nairobi comrades.

249
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:20,458
We were stuck at Nairobi Airport
together for three anxious days.

250
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,917
We were the only two Koreans there.

251
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:26,958
I'm hungry.

252
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,750
I slept through the flight
and didn't eat anything.

253
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,292
I want some Korean food.

254
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,417
Like tripe stew.

255
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,292
Does it have to be tripe stew?

256
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:40,042
I've been craving it for some reason.

257
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,000
I know the best tripe restaurant in Seoul.

258
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:45,958
Really?

259
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,625
Jong-su, let's go eat tripe stew.

260
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,042
Yeah, I'm on my way.

261
00:38:05,542 --> 00:38:07,042
I'm in my friend's car.

262
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,250
He came to pick me up.

263
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,917
What?

264
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,208
Yes, I'm fine.

265
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,833
You know health has never been an issue,
thanks to my superior DNA.

266
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,833
What?

267
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,958
Come on...

268
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,958
Wow... How can you be so naive?

269
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:44,667
You're old enough to know better.

270
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,250
You should keep a record of that.

271
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,958
Because that is an epic event
in the life of Ms. Kim.

272
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,500
Yes...

273
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,500
I miss you too.

274
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,292
Okay.

275
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,208
I'll stop by sometime this week.

276
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,292
Yes.

277
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:10,500
Okay, Mom.

278
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:21,958
I joined the Sunset Tour
on my way to the Kalahari Desert.

279
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,417
It's a program that shows you
the sunset of the desert.

280
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,958
But it turned out to be a parking lot.

281
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:35,083
There was nothing but trash
tourists left behind.

282
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,875
Everybody came with someone,
but I was the only one by myself.

283
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:44,917
I really felt all alone there.

284
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:49,958
I wondered why I was even there,
all alone.

285
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,292
Then the sun started to set.

286
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,958
The sun was setting beyond
the endless sand-covered horizon.

287
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:03,667
At first it was orange.

288
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,958
Then it turned blood red.

289
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:12,000
Then purple, then navy.

290
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:17,042
It got darker and darker
as the sunset disappeared,

291
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,333
and my eyes suddenly welled up with tears.

292
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,667
"I must be at the end of the world."

293
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,208
That's what I thought.

294
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:45,125
"I want to vanish just like that sunset."

295
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:54,667
Dying is too scary, but...

296
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,500
I wished I could disappear
as if I had never existed.

297
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:12,250
It's fascinating to see people cry.

298
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:18,458
Fascinating? Why?

299
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:24,667
Because I've never
shed a single tear in my life.

300
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,500
I suppose I did when I was really little,

301
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:31,125
but I can't remember ever shedding a tear.

302
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:33,708
That is fascinating.

303
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,958
But you do feel sadness, don't you?

304
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,667
Maybe. I'm not sure.

305
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,958
But since I've never shed a single tear,

306
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,958
I'm not sure
if it was real sadness that I felt.

307
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,958
May I ask what you do for a living?

308
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,625
Well, I do this and that.

309
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,958
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you,

310
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,958
but to put it simply,

311
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:02,833
I play.

312
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,417
You play?

313
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,292
Yes.

314
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:10,958
Nowadays, there is no distinction
between working and playing.

315
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,042
May I ask

316
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,125
who your favorite writer is?

317
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,208
William Faulkner.

318
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,917
Oh, Faulkner.

319
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,250
When I read his work,

320
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,000
I feel like I'm reading about myself.

321
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:38,625
Since you write fiction,

322
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,958
I'd like to have a chat with you sometime.

323
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,958
I want to tell you my story.

324
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,083
Isn't she cute?

325
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,958
She falls asleep anywhere
when she's sleepy.

326
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:01,667
It doesn't even take ten seconds.

327
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,125
- Hey, you're here!
- Yes.

328
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,500
- I parked the car out front.
- Thank you.

329
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,083
Excuse me for a second.

330
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:13,000
Did you step on it?

331
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,292
No.

332
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,625
I just quietly
followed you from the airport.

333
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,625
That's harder.

334
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,958
Speeding up and slowing down...

335
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,958
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

336
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:35,708
Hae-mi...

337
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:36,917
Hae-mi! Wake up.

338
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,542
It's time to go home.

339
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,833
Want me to take you home?

340
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,250
Go ahead.

341
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,125
I have a long way to go, anyway.

342
00:44:07,417 --> 00:44:10,417
Jong-su, it was nice meeting you.

343
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,875
Likewise.

344
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,958
Say something.

345
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,958
If you called you should say something.

346
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:57,208
Why did you call
if you are not going to talk?

347
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,875
DEAR HONORABLE JUDGE,

348
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:39,917
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK. WE WRITE
TO REQUEST YOUR FAVORABLE CONSIDERATION

349
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:42,958
FOR THE DEFENDANT LEE YONG-SEOK WHO IS
BEING TRIED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,

350
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,833
ASSAULT, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE.

351
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:48,417
LEE YONG-SEOK WAS AN HONEST FARMER
AND OUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR.

352
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,458
Hello?

353
00:46:58,625 --> 00:46:59,667
Excuse me!

354
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,500
Nobody's home. What is it?

355
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,125
What is it about?

356
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:11,958
Is your husband home?

357
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,125
He isn't here.

358
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,958
What is it?

359
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:23,917
I'm here to get signatures for a petition.

360
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,458
He isn't here.

361
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,625
- I'll come back again.
- Okay.

362
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:38,667
Actually, I don't know
your father that well.

363
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,458
He didn't really interact with us.

364
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,042
Whatever he did, he always did alone.

365
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:52,000
Sir, this is just a petition.
It won't cause you trouble in any way.

366
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:54,000
No, it's just this part.

367
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,958
"Lee Yong-seok was an honest farmer
and our friendly neighbor."

368
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,750
Frankly, he was never friendly.

369
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,333
Sorry about that.

370
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,250
You write very well.

371
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:17,250
We still have a calf left at our house.

372
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,125
Do you know anyone who'd want to buy it?

373
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,667
- A calf?
- Yes.

374
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,292
Boy or girl?

375
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,125
It's female.

376
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:28,042
I'll have to ask around.

377
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,500
Hello?

378
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,708
Is someone else here?

379
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:47,417
Good to see you again, Jong-su.

380
00:49:50,042 --> 00:49:52,042
Hae-mi wanted to see you.

381
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,000
No, Ben kept asking me to call you.

382
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,875
Did you have trouble finding this place?

383
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:01,042
No. I used my phone.

384
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,458
Ben says he lives near here.

385
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,958
It's nice.

386
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,083
It's quiet.

387
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,292
Keep going.

388
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,000
Ben was reading my palm.

389
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:24,667
Hae-mi, you have something different
from other people.

390
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,208
What's that?

391
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,542
There's something in your heart.

392
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,833
A stone.

393
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:39,958
The stone is making you suffer.

394
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:45,875
That's why you can't fully enjoy things.

395
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:52,875
That's why you can't appreciate
tasty food,

396
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:57,958
or tell a guy you like that you like him.

397
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,958
Then what should I do?

398
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:08,250
You need to remove the stone.

399
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,000
Want me to do it?

400
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,292
You can do that?

401
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:14,417
Just trust me.

402
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,958
Hold my hand...

403
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,250
And close your eyes.

404
00:51:32,333 --> 00:51:34,333
Now open your hand.

405
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:39,958
What's this?

406
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,958
What do you think? It's a stone.

407
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,292
I took it out of your heart.

408
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,500
Where did you get this?

409
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:49,000
Back there from the flower bed.

410
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,208
- To do this?
- Yes.

411
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:53,917
- You brought one back to do this?
- Yes.

412
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:54,958
What for?

413
00:51:55,042 --> 00:51:56,458
For fun.

414
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,083
I'll do anything for fun.

415
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:05,750
Jong-su.

416
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,000
Do you like pasta?

417
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:09,958
What?

418
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,542
He said he'll cook us pasta at his place.

419
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,958
- Hello.
- How was your trip back home?

420
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,958
Great, thanks to you.

421
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,292
Ben, you're really good.

422
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:02,208
I envy people who cook well.

423
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,292
Jong-su.

424
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,708
Can you cook too?

425
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,250
I guess, since I live alone.

426
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,042
But I can only make a few dishes.

427
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:18,208
I like to cook

428
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:23,000
because I can make what I want,
any way I want.

429
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:28,958
What's better is that I get to eat it.

430
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:32,000
Just as humans make offerings to the gods,

431
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:37,917
I make my own offering and consume it.

432
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:39,958
Offering?

433
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,042
An offering. It's a metaphor.

434
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,000
What's a metaphor?

435
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:51,125
A metaphor is...

436
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,250
Well, ask Jong-su.

437
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,083
- Hae-mi.
- Yes?

438
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,958
Do you know where the bathroom is?

439
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,667
Ben, where's the bathroom?

440
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:08,958
Down the hall.

441
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,958
How much older is he than me?

442
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,625
Six or seven years?

443
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,417
How does he live like that at his age?

444
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,958
Traveling abroad, driving a Porsche,

445
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:07,958
listening to music while cooking pasta...

446
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,958
I guess he's young and rich.

447
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,125
He's the Great Gatsby.

448
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,917
What do you mean?

449
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:21,833
Mysterious people who are young and rich

450
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:25,000
but you don't know what they really do.

451
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,542
There are so many Gatsbys in Korea.

452
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:39,125
Why do you think he's seeing you?

453
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,917
Have you ever think about that?

454
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,542
He said he likes people like me.

455
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:54,917
He thinks I'm interesting.

456
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:11,958
- Hi.
- Hey guys!

457
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:12,958
Hello.

458
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:16,292
This is my new friend, Lee Jong-su.

459
00:57:16,458 --> 00:57:17,500
He writes.

460
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,000
You're a writer?

461
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,958
I'm not published yet.
I'm just writing at the moment.

462
00:57:23,417 --> 00:57:24,958
If you write, you're a writer.

463
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,500
A "writer." Someone who writes.

464
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,667
Ben, it was just a question.

465
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:31,875
I'm going inside.

466
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:34,500
Me too.

467
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,542
Provence.

468
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,000
You're right.

469
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,208
I remember that well.

470
00:57:49,958 --> 00:57:55,000
The bushmen light a bonfire at night
and dance around it.

471
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,042
They've been doing this
since a long time ago.

472
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:03,417
The oldest and wisest woman
plays the drums.

473
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,333
Then everybody dances to its rhythm.

474
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:10,292
At first, they stretch their arms
toward the ground.

475
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:11,542
Like this.

476
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:15,708
This is the Little Hunger dance.

477
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:17,958
The dance of the people who are hungry.

478
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:20,083
And as the dance continues,

479
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:26,333
their arms slowly rise
and reach toward the sky.

480
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:31,083
This is the Great Hunger dance.

481
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:35,875
The dance which seeks the meaning of life.

482
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:42,667
They dance from early evening
until deep into the night.

483
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:49,042
As they dance, Little Hunger
gradually turns into Great Hunger.

484
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:54,500
I can't explain it in words.

485
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,917
You need to see it for yourselves.

486
00:58:56,958 --> 00:58:58,958
Then show us.

487
00:59:01,042 --> 00:59:02,958
- Really?
- Yes.

488
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,042
Show us. It sounds interesting.

489
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,833
Okay. I'll try.

490
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,958
But I need a beat.

491
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,958
Please clap your hands. Like this.

492
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,667
And slowly, it turns into Great Hunger.

493
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:32,500
A little calf is sitting on a hot pot

494
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:35,958
Crying out loud

495
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:41,417
Mommy!

496
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:44,958
Oh, my butt is burning up

497
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,500
A little calf is sitting on ice

498
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:52,708
Crying out loud

499
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:58,042
Mommy!

500
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,208
Hello?

501
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:06,958
Jong-su, where are you? Are you home?

502
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:08,917
Yes, I'm home.

503
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,875
I knew you'd be home.

504
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:16,042
Listen, I'm heading there now with Ben.

505
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:17,542
Here? What for?

506
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,417
We were driving by.

507
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:21,958
When I told him I used to live there,

508
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
he said he wanted to see it.

509
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:27,958
We're on our way now. We'll be there soon.

510
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:18,042
Hi.

511
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,292
What's that sound?

512
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:26,458
That's the North Korean
propaganda broadcast.

513
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,875
North Korea is right over there.

514
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,250
Interesting.

515
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:39,958
It's disappointing
that my old house is gone.

516
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,417
It used to be right over there.

517
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,042
Now it's gone without a trace.

518
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,208
And the well is gone too.

519
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,458
There used to be a well next to our house.

520
01:03:55,625 --> 01:03:57,875
I fell into it when I was little.

521
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,417
Do you remember?

522
01:04:05,917 --> 01:04:07,833
You fell into a well?

523
01:04:07,917 --> 01:04:08,958
How old were you?

524
01:04:10,292 --> 01:04:12,250
Maybe when I was seven?

525
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:15,833
I fell in while playing by myself.

526
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:20,625
I was looking up from below
and crying for hours.

527
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:26,625
I was terrified that I'd die
if nobody found me.

528
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:30,750
But then his face appeared.

529
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:34,333
Jong-su found me, and I was rescued.

530
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:38,292
But he doesn't even remember.

531
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,250
I brought some food.

532
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:43,917
Okay.

533
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:15,917
I feel like I'm at my house.

534
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,875
My old house.

535
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,667
This isn't bad.

536
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,958
Except for the smell of cow poop.

537
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:48,667
This is nice.

538
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:53,208
This may be my best day ever.

539
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:19,750
I feel like smoking pot.

540
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,292
Want to join me?

541
01:06:22,417 --> 01:06:23,708
Pot?

542
01:06:23,958 --> 01:06:25,292
Marijuana.

543
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,958
I can't stop giggling when I smoke that.

544
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:27,833
I hate my father.

545
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:34,667
My father has an anger disorder.

546
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:41,083
He has rage bottled up inside of him.
It goes off like a bomb.

547
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,875
Once it goes off,
everything gets destroyed.

548
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:54,042
My mom left my sister and me
because of it.

549
01:14:00,667 --> 01:14:06,958
The day my mom left,
I burned all her clothes.

550
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:13,917
My father made a fire in the yard

551
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:19,417
and made me burn them with my own hands.

552
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:27,292
I still have dreams about that night.

553
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,625
Sometimes I burn down greenhouses.

554
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,125
Excuse me?

555
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:41,958
I said sometimes I burn down greenhouses.

556
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,750
I have a hobby of burning greenhouses.

557
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:53,500
I choose an abandoned
greenhouse and set it on fire.

558
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:56,083
Once every two months?

559
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,667
I think that's the best pace

560
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,958
for me.

561
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,500
Pace?

562
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:10,292
So you burn down
other people's greenhouses?

563
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:12,708
Of course.

564
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:16,542
It's a crime, so to speak.

565
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:22,000
Just like how you and I are smoking
this pot.

566
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:24,125
It's a clear crime.

567
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:30,125
It's very simple though.

568
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:34,958
You spray kerosene then throw a lit match.

569
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:36,500
That's it.

570
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:41,500
It takes less than ten minutes
for it to burn down.

571
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:47,042
You can make it disappear

572
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,333
as if it never existed.

573
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:52,500
What if you get caught?

574
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:55,917
I won't get caught. Ever.

575
01:15:57,292 --> 01:16:00,958
The Korean police don't care about
those sorts of things.

576
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:04,458
In Korea,

577
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,958
there are tons of greenhouses.

578
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:13,292
Useless, filthy, unpleasant-looking
greenhouses.

579
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:19,625
It's like they're all waiting for me
to burn them down.

580
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,208
And as I watch them burn to the ground,

581
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,958
I feel great joy.

582
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:30,958
Then I feel...

583
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:34,833
I feel a bass sound right here.

584
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,333
A bass that rings to my very bone.

585
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:45,833
And you judge
whether or not they're useless?

586
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,417
I don't judge anything.

587
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,625
I just accept it.

588
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,417
I accept that they're waiting
to be burnt down.

589
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,958
It's like rain.

590
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,083
Rain falls.

591
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,750
The river overflows,

592
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:18,958
causing a flood that sweeps people away.

593
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,667
You think the rain judges anything?

594
01:17:25,042 --> 01:17:28,208
There is no right or wrong there,

595
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:30,458
just the morals of nature.

596
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,250
The morals of nature are like

597
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:38,292
simultaneous existence.

598
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,250
"Simultaneous existence"?

599
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:44,667
I'm here, and I'm there.

600
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:48,958
I'm in Paju, and I'm in Banpo.

601
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:52,042
I'm in Seoul,

602
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:54,042
and I'm in Africa.

603
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,333
Something like that.

604
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,417
That kind of balance.

605
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:06,958
When was the last time
you burned one down?

606
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:09,542
Well...

607
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:12,250
It was right before I left for Africa,

608
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,750
so it's been about two months.

609
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:18,958
Which means it's about time
for another one.

610
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:24,125
Then you must have decided
which one you'll burn down next.

611
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:27,708
I have.

612
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:30,958
A great one to burn down.

613
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,083
I think it'll be really fun to burn down.

614
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,292
To be honest,

615
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,750
I came here to scout.

616
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,958
Scout?

617
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:47,833
Does that mean it's nearby?

618
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,542
That's right.

619
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:54,125
It's very near.

620
01:18:55,958 --> 01:18:58,083
Very, very near...

621
01:19:07,083 --> 01:19:10,958
I'm in love with Hae-mi.

622
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,667
Fuck. I said I love her.

623
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:01,250
This tree has gotten really big.

624
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:07,083
Why do you undress so easily
in front of men?

625
01:20:10,417 --> 01:20:12,958
Only whores do that.

626
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,958
I'll keep an eye out for the greenhouses.

627
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,083
You do that.

628
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,250
Ones that are really near.

629
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,958
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

630
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:02,500
Please leave a message after the tone.

631
01:23:05,542 --> 01:23:08,542
Hae-mi. Let's talk.

632
01:23:17,917 --> 01:23:19,083
Come in!

633
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,083
This way!

634
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:32,292
State your number from left to right.

635
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:34,750
- One!
- Two!

636
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,958
- Three.
- Four!

637
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,458
- Five.
- Six.

638
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,958
Seven! The end!

639
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:42,958
Where do you live, number one?

640
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,750
I live in downtown Paju.
It's five minutes away.

641
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:47,125
- Can you work nights and after hours?
- Yes, sir.

642
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,750
Where do you live, number two?

643
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,083
Bucheon, sir.

644
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,875
How are you going to commute from Bucheon?
It takes 2 hours.

645
01:23:53,958 --> 01:23:55,000
No problem, sir. I can--

646
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:56,958
Where do you live, number three?

647
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,083
Where do you live, number three?

648
01:24:10,417 --> 01:24:11,958
- Okay, number four.
- Yes, sir.

649
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,958
- Where do you live?
- Munsan, sir.

650
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,333
- Can you work nights and after hours?
- Yes, sir.

651
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:54,750
ROAD ATLAS OF PAJU CITY

652
01:26:57,958 --> 01:27:03,125
HAE-MI

653
01:27:03,542 --> 01:27:04,958
Hello?

654
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:12,958
Hello?

655
01:29:13,125 --> 01:29:15,000
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

656
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:18,667
Please leave a message after the tone.

657
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,917
What are you doing?

658
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:14,958
Pardon?

659
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,292
What are you doing?

660
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,958
I'm just looking.

661
01:32:16,042 --> 01:32:18,125
The phone has been turned off.

662
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,917
Please leave a message after the tone.

663
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,500
Hae-mi! Shin Hae-mi!

664
01:32:31,833 --> 01:32:32,958
What's wrong?

665
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,667
Hello, ma'am.

666
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,292
I can't seem to reach Hae-mi.

667
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,458
I... need to get in.

668
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,875
I have to feed the cat.

669
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,958
It might starve to death.

670
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,708
There is no cat.

671
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:52,917
We don't allow pets in the building.

672
01:32:53,958 --> 01:32:55,917
There is a cat.

673
01:32:56,542 --> 01:32:59,042
I used to come and feed it.

674
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:04,625
You have a master key, right?

675
01:33:05,917 --> 01:33:09,250
You can't ask me to open
the door like that.

676
01:33:09,833 --> 01:33:12,125
I can get into big trouble.

677
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:36,250
See? There's no cat.

678
01:33:37,958 --> 01:33:40,292
She seems to have gone on a trip.

679
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,750
She cleaned up her room.

680
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:48,333
She doesn't usually clean
her room like this.

681
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,958
I don't think she went on a trip.

682
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:17,875
Welcome to the Crop Festival!

683
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:21,000
They all seem fine, but
you never really know their story.

684
01:34:21,083 --> 01:34:23,125
Some of them are drowning
in credit card debt,

685
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,417
and because of that
some of them go into hiding.

686
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:30,625
Hae-mi turned her phone off
out of the blue, too.

687
01:34:34,125 --> 01:34:37,542
Frankly, women need to spend money
on a lot of things.

688
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,708
It's difficult for women.

689
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:42,083
They complain if you wear makeup,

690
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:44,042
and complain if you don't.

691
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:46,958
They complain if you wear
revealing clothes,

692
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:49,667
and complain if you dress casually.

693
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:52,292
Have you heard of the saying,

694
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:57,875
"There's no country for women"?

695
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,042
What?

696
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:06,500
Nothing.

697
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:18,958
Come visit and enjoy our food.

698
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:49,292
Is Hae-mi here?

699
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:52,125
It's been a while since she last came.

700
01:35:53,875 --> 01:35:54,958
I can't seem to reach her either.

701
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,833
Fuck...

702
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,958
Ben.

703
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,083
What brings you here?

704
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:46,208
I was passing by and saw your car outside.

705
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:48,958
I thought it might be yours.

706
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:50,125
Is that so?

707
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:52,708
Have a seat.

708
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,042
May I?

709
01:38:55,458 --> 01:38:57,125
Do you want to order something?

710
01:38:57,542 --> 01:38:59,292
It's okay.

711
01:38:59,417 --> 01:39:01,125
I have to leave soon.

712
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:08,917
Are you still working on your story?

713
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,042
I'm trying.

714
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:17,958
You said you liked Faulkner,
so I wanted to give him a shot.

715
01:39:21,917 --> 01:39:25,250
Come to think of it, I was wondering...

716
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,333
What happened to the greenhouse?

717
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:32,125
The greenhouse.

718
01:39:32,625 --> 01:39:34,833
You still remember that.

719
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:36,958
I burned it down, of course.

720
01:39:38,458 --> 01:39:39,750
Without a trace.

721
01:39:41,208 --> 01:39:42,625
I said I would.

722
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:46,833
Near my house?

723
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:48,042
Of course.

724
01:39:48,917 --> 01:39:50,417
Very near.

725
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:53,208
When?

726
01:39:57,667 --> 01:40:00,250
THE COLLECTED SHORT STORIES OF
WILLIAM FAULKNER

727
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:05,125
A day or two after
I stopped by your house?

728
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,208
That's strange.

729
01:40:10,625 --> 01:40:13,958
Ever since you came by,
I checked every morning.

730
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:18,542
I checked every single greenhouse
near my house.

731
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:23,458
You checked the greenhouses every day?

732
01:40:24,542 --> 01:40:27,292
Yes, every single one.

733
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:33,417
If any one of them had burned down,
there is no way I could have missed it.

734
01:40:35,958 --> 01:40:37,958
Yet, you have.

735
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,958
It happens.

736
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,917
Maybe you missed it
because it was too close.

737
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:47,000
I don't think so.

738
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:50,958
How strange.

739
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:56,833
Sometimes you can't see things
that are too close to you.

740
01:40:58,958 --> 01:40:59,875
Ben!

741
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,958
Sorry I'm late.

742
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:07,083
Something came up at the store.

743
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,667
It drove me crazy.

744
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:10,958
It's okay.

745
01:41:11,333 --> 01:41:14,750
But we're running late,
so we don't have time to drink tea.

746
01:41:15,958 --> 01:41:17,000
Hello.

747
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:23,500
Are you in touch with Hae-mi?

748
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:26,250
It's been a month
since I last talked to her.

749
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:27,875
Right?

750
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,125
I can't reach her either.

751
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:32,458
Hae-mi just

752
01:41:32,542 --> 01:41:34,625
disappeared into thin air.

753
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,958
Did Hae-mi say anything to you?

754
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:44,667
Like what?

755
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:50,208
Like wanting to go on a trip...

756
01:41:50,292 --> 01:41:51,292
Or maybe...

757
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,958
I'm not sure,
but I doubt she went on a trip.

758
01:41:56,417 --> 01:41:57,958
She can't afford it.

759
01:41:58,667 --> 01:42:01,958
As far as I know, she's broke.

760
01:42:03,125 --> 01:42:05,625
She doesn't contact her family

761
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:06,958
and doesn't have any friends.

762
01:42:07,958 --> 01:42:11,292
Hae-mi is lonelier than she seems.

763
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:20,458
Jong-su. You know...

764
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:24,417
Hae-mi thought of you as someone special.

765
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,958
She told me so.

766
01:42:29,083 --> 01:42:32,250
She said you were the only person
in this world she trusts.

767
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:35,667
That you'd always be on her side.

768
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:41,958
It made me jealous for some reason.

769
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:46,958
I had never been jealous before
in my life.

770
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:32,333
Jong-su?

771
01:43:33,208 --> 01:43:34,708
Aren't you Jong-su?

772
01:43:35,958 --> 01:43:36,875
Yes.

773
01:43:37,458 --> 01:43:39,000
He is!

774
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:40,750
You haven't changed one bit!

775
01:43:41,708 --> 01:43:43,875
How have you been?

776
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,958
What brings you here?

777
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,708
Did Hae-mi send you?

778
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:53,042
No.

779
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:55,958
Hae-mi...

780
01:43:57,542 --> 01:44:00,875
You couldn't have just come in here
by chance, am I right?

781
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:03,292
Eat.

782
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:04,500
Yes, ma'am.

783
01:44:05,125 --> 01:44:06,833
Su-jin must be married by now.

784
01:44:07,667 --> 01:44:09,333
Yes, she has kids as well.

785
01:44:09,708 --> 01:44:10,958
She does?

786
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:16,958
Do you keep in touch with your mother?

787
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:20,208
No.

788
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:25,417
I'm guessing that Hae-mi sent you here.

789
01:44:26,292 --> 01:44:27,958
So tell her

790
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,500
she can't come home until she pays off
all her credit cards.

791
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:38,625
By the way,

792
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:44,917
do you remember
when Hae-mi fell into a well?

793
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:46,000
A well?

794
01:44:46,958 --> 01:44:48,250
Did that happen?

795
01:44:49,333 --> 01:44:50,958
When she was seven,

796
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:55,042
she fell into a well.

797
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:02,917
She cried for hours
down at the bottom of the well.

798
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:09,083
Crying and looking up,

799
01:45:11,708 --> 01:45:13,625
just staring up at the round sky,

800
01:45:14,417 --> 01:45:18,542
waiting for someone to find her.

801
01:45:24,333 --> 01:45:26,083
I'm sorry.

802
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:34,125
I was just thinking about
how Hae-mi must have felt.

803
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:40,958
That never happened.

804
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:44,292
If it did, why wouldn't we know about it?

805
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:47,125
Is that what Hae-mi told you?

806
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:51,958
She makes up stories really well.

807
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:55,000
Her stories are very believable.

808
01:45:56,958 --> 01:46:00,333
There wasn't even a well
next to our house.

809
01:46:34,833 --> 01:46:37,000
- Good morning, sir!
- Yes?

810
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:40,958
I have a question.

811
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:44,500
Was there a well here a long time ago?

812
01:46:44,958 --> 01:46:45,958
A well?

813
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:46,958
Yes.

814
01:46:47,292 --> 01:46:50,208
A well deep enough to fall into.

815
01:46:51,542 --> 01:46:54,958
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

816
01:49:41,042 --> 01:49:44,917
Through Him, and with Him, and in Him.

817
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:48,250
O God, Almighty Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

818
01:49:48,333 --> 01:49:54,458
all glory and honor is yours,
forever and ever.

819
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,667
- Amen
- Amen

820
01:49:57,750 --> 01:50:00,208
- Amen
- Amen

821
01:50:00,292 --> 01:50:07,042
- Amen
- Amen

822
01:57:22,958 --> 01:57:24,958
Hello?

823
01:57:26,667 --> 01:57:28,125
Jong-su.

824
01:57:31,208 --> 01:57:32,958
This is Jong-su, right?

825
01:57:34,542 --> 01:57:35,333
Yes.

826
01:57:36,958 --> 01:57:38,750
It's Mom.

827
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:47,333
They come to my house
and call me all the time.

828
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:50,958
They even come to the bathrooms
that I clean in a department store.

829
01:57:50,958 --> 01:57:52,417
In their black suits.

830
01:57:53,958 --> 01:57:56,708
They look like grim reapers.

831
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:00,958
All that for just five million won.

832
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:05,917
If only I had been younger,
I'd have sold my organs.

833
01:58:07,542 --> 01:58:11,958
Look what I'm saying to my son
who I haven't seen in 16 years.

834
01:58:25,625 --> 01:58:26,958
I'll take care of it.

835
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:28,958
What?

836
01:58:30,958 --> 01:58:32,958
I'll take care of it.

837
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:34,958
Don't worry.

838
01:58:36,417 --> 01:58:39,833
You have money? How?

839
01:58:53,458 --> 01:58:54,875
Mom.

840
01:58:55,417 --> 01:58:56,208
Yes?

841
01:59:02,042 --> 01:59:06,958
Remember Hae-mi's house
in the middle of the village?

842
01:59:08,417 --> 01:59:10,083
Did it have a well?

843
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:11,292
A well?

844
01:59:12,417 --> 01:59:15,042
Yes, it did. A dried up well.

845
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,875
Really?

846
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:22,667
Hae-mi said she fell into it once.

847
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:25,458
I don't know about that,
but there was a well.

848
01:59:27,833 --> 01:59:29,958
What's wrong?

849
02:00:14,333 --> 02:00:18,417
BEN

850
02:00:22,042 --> 02:00:22,958
Hello?

851
02:00:23,417 --> 02:00:25,542
Jong-su, where are you?

852
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:28,667
I'm in Gangnam.

853
02:00:29,958 --> 02:00:31,000
Where in Gangnam?

854
02:00:33,917 --> 02:00:34,958
Let's see...

855
02:00:42,667 --> 02:00:46,458
I thought this truck looked familiar.
It really was you.

856
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:49,500
What brings you here?

857
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:50,750
Are you here to see me?

858
02:00:54,708 --> 02:00:57,042
Actually, I'm here to talk about Hae-mi.

859
02:00:57,958 --> 02:00:59,917
You could've just called.

860
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:03,625
Come inside.

861
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:05,708
You're here already, so come in.

862
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:07,958
You can park in our garage.

863
02:01:35,542 --> 02:01:36,833
Going up.

864
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:51,417
Good timing, actually.

865
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:55,292
My friends are coming over
for dinner and drinks.

866
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:57,750
Join us.

867
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:01,708
You've already met them, so it'll be okay.

868
02:02:02,292 --> 02:02:03,625
Fourth floor.

869
02:02:03,750 --> 02:02:04,958
Are you having a party?

870
02:02:05,417 --> 02:02:07,250
It's more like a gathering,

871
02:02:08,292 --> 02:02:10,958
than a party. A casual gathering.

872
02:02:25,417 --> 02:02:29,208
You must have a lot to prepare
since there are many guests.

873
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:31,667
Not really.

874
02:02:32,125 --> 02:02:36,417
It's a potluck dinner,
so everyone brings food.

875
02:02:37,542 --> 02:02:40,208
I just prepare the drinks
and some finger foods.

876
02:02:41,708 --> 02:02:44,250
Someone was supposed to come early
and help,

877
02:02:44,333 --> 02:02:45,958
but she's running late.

878
02:02:46,958 --> 02:02:47,958
What's that sound?

879
02:02:48,625 --> 02:02:51,958
Oh, I have a cat.

880
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:55,958
You didn't have one last time.

881
02:02:55,958 --> 02:02:57,083
Right.

882
02:02:57,708 --> 02:03:00,667
I brought a stray cat home not long ago.

883
02:03:00,958 --> 02:03:02,750
It was so cute.

884
02:03:09,625 --> 02:03:10,875
It really is cute.

885
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,125
Isn't it?

886
02:03:13,958 --> 02:03:15,208
Do you like cats?

887
02:03:19,958 --> 02:03:20,958
What's its name?

888
02:03:22,750 --> 02:03:23,958
I haven't named it yet.

889
02:03:24,625 --> 02:03:27,333
Naming it was more difficult
than I thought.

890
02:03:32,958 --> 02:03:35,667
Jong-su, what kind of
a story are you writing?

891
02:03:36,625 --> 02:03:38,000
If you don't mind my asking.

892
02:03:40,958 --> 02:03:43,667
I don't know what to write yet.

893
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:45,625
How come?

894
02:03:48,708 --> 02:03:49,750
To me,

895
02:03:51,292 --> 02:03:53,250
the world is a mystery.

896
02:03:59,542 --> 02:04:01,708
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

897
02:05:22,917 --> 02:05:23,958
Sorry, Ben.

898
02:05:23,958 --> 02:05:26,958
I meant to come earlier, but...

899
02:05:26,958 --> 02:05:30,750
- What's all this?
- I bought a bit too much.

900
02:05:31,333 --> 02:05:33,000
Shut the door, or the cat will escape.

901
02:05:33,667 --> 02:05:35,958
Oh my! No! The cat got out!

902
02:05:35,958 --> 02:05:38,208
What do we do?

903
02:05:38,292 --> 02:05:40,292
Go catch it, of course.

904
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,125
Where are you?

905
02:06:04,875 --> 02:06:06,958
Come out kitty.

906
02:06:07,833 --> 02:06:11,458
Here kitty, kitty. Come here.

907
02:06:12,958 --> 02:06:14,708
Here kitty.

908
02:06:24,083 --> 02:06:25,417
Where are you?

909
02:06:27,833 --> 02:06:29,042
Hey kitty.

910
02:06:51,083 --> 02:06:52,000
Hey kitty.

911
02:06:57,833 --> 02:06:58,750
Stay still.

912
02:07:07,458 --> 02:07:08,250
Come here.

913
02:07:11,875 --> 02:07:12,958
Hey, kitty.

914
02:07:15,958 --> 02:07:17,083
Come here, little cat.

915
02:07:19,042 --> 02:07:20,417
Hey Boil.

916
02:07:21,417 --> 02:07:22,667
Boil.

917
02:07:26,958 --> 02:07:27,958
Boil.

918
02:07:35,958 --> 02:07:36,875
Here kitty.

919
02:07:40,083 --> 02:07:42,125
Wow, he caught it!

920
02:07:45,417 --> 02:07:46,625
Amazing.

921
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:48,333
How did you catch it so easily?

922
02:07:48,875 --> 02:07:50,042
It's very fast.

923
02:07:50,917 --> 02:07:52,750
Can I hold him?

924
02:07:59,125 --> 02:08:01,958
- Did you come out to greet us?
- Yes.

925
02:08:01,958 --> 02:08:03,000
With the cat.

926
02:08:03,958 --> 02:08:04,958
Hey guys.

927
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:07,750
- How was traffic?
- Awful!

928
02:08:07,958 --> 02:08:09,958
Hello!

929
02:08:11,958 --> 02:08:15,250
Chinese people throw their money
when they pay.

930
02:08:15,333 --> 02:08:16,958
- Like this.
- Why do they do that?

931
02:08:17,333 --> 02:08:19,708
They consider money to be filthy.

932
02:08:19,875 --> 02:08:21,542
We treasure money,

933
02:08:21,667 --> 02:08:23,417
but they treat it like it's nothing.

934
02:08:23,542 --> 02:08:25,292
Maybe it's because they're so proud.

935
02:08:25,417 --> 02:08:27,958
Chinese people have
a strong sense of pride.

936
02:08:27,958 --> 02:08:29,833
They crumple and throw their bills.

937
02:08:29,917 --> 02:08:32,500
They go, "Yi, er, san, si," and throw it.

938
02:08:32,625 --> 02:08:33,958
Like, "Here! Take it!"

939
02:08:33,958 --> 02:08:36,292
The Chinese are similar to the Americans.

940
02:08:36,458 --> 02:08:39,000
We think they're like us
because of the Confucius culture.

941
02:08:39,083 --> 02:08:40,125
How are they similar?

942
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,708
They're both gigantic geographically.

943
02:08:41,958 --> 02:08:42,958
That's true.

944
02:08:43,083 --> 02:08:45,917
They always place themselves
at their center,

945
02:08:45,958 --> 02:08:47,542
whereas we're always conscious of others.

946
02:08:47,667 --> 02:08:48,500
Just like you.

947
02:08:48,833 --> 02:08:52,125
They're really bold when they ask for
makeup samples.

948
02:08:52,292 --> 02:08:54,000
You know how stores hand them out
in the streets.

949
02:08:54,125 --> 02:08:58,333
but our duty-free store gives them out
only if you buy expensive items.

950
02:08:58,458 --> 02:08:59,958
I tell them loud and clear,

951
02:08:59,958 --> 02:09:03,250
"Meiyou. No samples. Meiyou."

952
02:09:03,333 --> 02:09:06,458
But they just stand there and go,
"You! You!"

953
02:09:06,542 --> 02:09:08,958
"You have them! Give them to me!"

954
02:09:09,333 --> 02:09:12,667
Still, I would like to date a Chinese guy.

955
02:09:12,833 --> 02:09:14,042
Please do.

956
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:17,208
Chinese men are so nice to their women.

957
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:18,958
They treasure their women.

958
02:09:18,958 --> 02:09:21,458
So a Chinese man treasures his woman,

959
02:09:21,542 --> 02:09:24,250
not his money. He throws his money.

960
02:09:24,875 --> 02:09:29,250
- He should throw it at me.
- Better if it's a credit card.

961
02:09:29,333 --> 02:09:31,875
But at the same time,
he should treasure me.

962
02:09:32,083 --> 02:09:33,750
Korean guys won't even step
in the kitchen.

963
02:09:33,875 --> 02:09:35,083
That's right.

964
02:09:35,208 --> 02:09:37,625
- I do.
- That's right, you do.

965
02:09:37,708 --> 02:09:40,833
- What do you do in the kitchen?
- He eats in the kitchen.

966
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,250
- Seriously.
- I eat too much.

967
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:46,500
He does. You need to go on a diet.

968
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:47,958
Look at his gut.

969
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:50,208
- Is it bad?
- It's not that bad.

970
02:09:53,292 --> 02:09:56,958
Jong-su, why are you leaving?

971
02:09:57,417 --> 02:09:59,625
You should stay and hang out.

972
02:10:03,958 --> 02:10:06,458
Didn't you want to talk about Hae-mi?

973
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:11,958
I don't think I need to anymore.

974
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:17,125
Jong-su. You're too serious.

975
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:20,417
It's no fun being serious.

976
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:21,958
Enjoy yourself.

977
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:28,208
You need to feel the bass right here.

978
02:10:29,875 --> 02:10:33,042
You need to feel it ring from your bones.

979
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:35,417
It's the only way to be alive.

980
02:11:17,208 --> 02:11:19,917
This case is a serious offense.

981
02:11:19,958 --> 02:11:24,042
The defendant assaulted a civil servant
who was performing his duty.

982
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:26,708
The court finds the defendant
guilty of obstruction of justice,

983
02:11:26,833 --> 02:11:29,208
assault, and damage of property.

984
02:11:29,417 --> 02:11:31,625
The defendant claims this act of violence,

985
02:11:31,708 --> 02:11:33,958
which caused the plaintiff injury

986
02:11:33,958 --> 02:11:36,500
requiring six weeks of medical treatment,
wasn't intentional.

987
02:11:36,625 --> 02:11:38,667
But the defendant swung a chair,
breaking fixtures

988
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:40,625
and injuring the plaintiff.

989
02:11:40,708 --> 02:11:43,708
Thus, the court concludes
this was clearly assault.

990
02:11:44,458 --> 02:11:47,208
Considering that the defendant is
refusing to settle,

991
02:11:47,292 --> 02:11:50,667
and that the plaintiff wants
the defendant to be punished,

992
02:11:51,042 --> 02:11:54,708
and that the defendant has been
penalized before for a similar crime,

993
02:11:54,833 --> 02:11:57,958
this court concludes that
an appropriate punishment is necessary,

994
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,125
and sentences the defendant as follows.

995
02:12:02,458 --> 02:12:07,958
This court sentences the defendant
to 18 months in prison.

996
02:12:09,958 --> 02:12:12,208
Case dismissed.

997
02:12:29,250 --> 02:12:31,750
Come on. Climb up.

998
02:12:32,292 --> 02:12:36,333
Let's go. Climb up. Go.

999
02:12:42,083 --> 02:12:43,667
Good girl.

1000
02:12:56,958 --> 02:12:58,333
So long.

1001
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:03,833
She's saying something.

1002
02:18:50,125 --> 02:18:51,125
Hey, Jong-su!

1003
02:18:51,750 --> 02:18:53,875
There are a lot of greenhouses here.

1004
02:18:55,958 --> 02:18:56,958
Where's Hae-mi?

1005
02:18:58,958 --> 02:19:00,958
You asked me to join you and Hae-mi.

1006
02:19:02,250 --> 02:19:03,625
Isn't she with you?

1007
02:28:14,833 --> 02:28:18,833
