The type of evidence we had on Kim Samdoo

546
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,586
wouldn't take down our chairman, right?

547
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,173
Once again, the chairman...

548
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,511
will get away with it, right?

549
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,767
I'm sure you'll have
a better chance next time.

550
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,738
(SCOFFS)

551
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:29,745
THE LATE MIN SEONWOOK

552
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,455
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY SENIOR

553
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,248
PRIME MINISTER'S AWARD FOR FUTURE POLICE

554
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,800
MIRYEO: <i>Do you think</i>
<i>Jiyong will accept all this?</i>

555
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,847
If it's legal, is it always good?

556
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,351
And if it's illegal, is it always bad?

557
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,397
If I had revealed the truth,

558
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:02,820
would the law have rooted out great evil?

559
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,032
Or would they have concluded

560
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,743
Jiyong was a heinous criminal...

561
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,621
and Seonwook died in vain?

562
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,376
My dad was...

563
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,420
a civil servant.

564
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,968
He killed himself
while being investigated for corruption,

565
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,303
but he was...

566
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,599
being framed.

567
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,145
But he was the one

568
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,898
who ended up dead.

569
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,068
None of the press

570
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,196
tried to reveal the truth.

571
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:49,908
So...

572
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,581
I was excited when the Vigilante appeared.

573
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:02,504
Through him, I wanted
to cause an uproar in the world.

574
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,431
I guess you and I have
something in common now.

575
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,688
Vigilante,

576
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,941
you can't disappear yet.

SEUNGCHEOL: <i>Unlike what the press</i>

<i>the truth always comes out in the end.</i>

592
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,073
<i>And I believe that will never change,</i>

593
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,076
<i>no matter what kind of society we live in.</i>

594
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,581

The President will lead the oath.

599

Valedictorian, please come forth.

600
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,064
All rise.

601
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,817
