1
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,017
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:27,944
By the way,

3
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,406
how did you know I'd be here?

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,160
I looked up and found
that the university has fixed off days.

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,372
And I found out you lived in Seoul
during my part-time job.

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,875
-Part-time job?
-Yes.

7
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,877
When I was acting like you'd saved me.

8
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,212
Was I any good?

9
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,882
Then you must know who employed you.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,383
I thought it was you?

11
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:55,221
The agency gives us a job,
and we act as we're told

12
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,766
and get paid. That's all.

13
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,977
We don't know who requests the jobs.

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,564
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

15
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,910
Hey, bro.

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,080
You're on a date. I'm so
jealous. So, are you enjoying the dinner?

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,790
What do you want?

18
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,418
I saw you talking with Jo Heon.
What did you talk about?

19
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,170
None of your business.

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>Jiyong, it's me.</i>

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>I told you, you need me.</i>

22
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,803
Jo Heon is a puppet of those in power.
He's our common enemy.

23
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,806
It's time for us to join forces.

24
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,391
You're with him, aren't you?

25
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,228
I think you are.

26
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,355
You're not telling me
what you talked about.

27
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,648
He knows about me.

28
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,691
What?

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,443
Only two people know about me.

30
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,945
You and Jo Heon.

31
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,197
<i>It's suspicious.</i>

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,742
Someone other than me knows about you?
Damn it.

33
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>We're not meeting today.</i>

34
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,830
<i>And one more thing.</i>

35
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,416
I know you cloned my cell.
Bring me his cloned phone.

36
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,294
Then we'll talk in person.

37
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,755
<i>About you and me working together.</i>

38
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,094
What... How did you know
I was peeping into your phone?

39
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,055
You're making it so obvious.
How can I not know?

40
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
But you're not...

42
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,063
thinking of getting out of this

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,109
after killing Jo Heon and me, are you?

44
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,288
Contact me after cloning his phone.

45
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,893
Wow...

46
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,940
This is too big for Yeon Jaehak
to handle by himself.

47
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,983
It has to be Sewool's.

48
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,033
They have illegal servers
in a place like this?

49
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,667
QQ Coin?

50
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,257
The bastards are doing
everything that makes money.

51
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,927
Daeseok, run!

52
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,450
Go! Hurry!

53
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:48,741
VIGILANTE

54
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,470
What?

55
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,599
What's going on? There's nothing here.

56
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,481
They were definitely here.
Computers and servers.

57
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,739
See? They were here.

58
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,121
Then what about the reporter
you said was killed?

59
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,879
This is crazy.

60
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,431
Let's wrap it up and go back.
I'll talk to her.

61
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,521
Ma'am, we understand what you said.
We will look into it.

62
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,567
We'll call you in for questioning
if necessary,

63
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,943
so you should go home for now.

64
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,988
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

65
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,786
CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL
EOM JAEHYUB

66
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,667
Jo Heon speaking.

67
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,628
It's been a while
since I sent you to catch the Vigilante.

68
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,963
Why is there no news?

69
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,257
I got some leads.

70
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,759
I'll call you when I get him.

71
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,011
After I retire?

72
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,557
You entrusted me with it,
so please continue to do so.

73
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,395
The realignment is around the corner.

74
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,524
Take care of it before that
so it won't hold me back.

75
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,109
Understood, sir.

76
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,421
Jiyong, let me hold it for you.

77
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,673
Your phone was off two nights ago.

78
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,967
Were you doing something important?

79
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,594
I went to bed early because I was tired.

80
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,178
So with who?

81
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,639
What do you mean? I slept alone.

82
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,558
Just be honest.

83
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,020
- He's not answering.
- Right.

84
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you going
to keep secrets from us like this?

85
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,612
See? He's acting suspicious, isn't he?

86
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,447
Yes, very.

87
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:25,374
- HAPJEONG STATION EXIT 2,
LOCKER NO. - 1004

88
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,925
Good!
You could be a professional.

89
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,010
One, two.

90
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,555
Good!

91
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,643
It's not enough.

92
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,811
I'd like it to be more intense next time.

93
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,021
Thank you.

94
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,111
You're working out harder lately.

95
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,405
You seem to have gotten faster.

96
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,658
I should stay in tip-top shape
all the time.

97
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,204
You never know
when fun things will happen.

98
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,813
CALLS
EOM JAEHYUB, CAPTAIN EUN

LIVE BROADCAST, REPO25H

100
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,079
<i>I am sure you all heard actor Yeon Jaehak,</i>

101
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,832
<i>who had been arrested</i>
<i>for running an illegal website,</i>

102
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>committed suicide.</i>

103
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>He died on the day he was supposed</i>
<i>to meet our staff.</i>

104
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,841
<i>These are the texts he sent us.</i>

105
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,676
<i>Hello, this is actor Yeon Jaehak.</i>

106
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,054
<i>I have evidence</i>
<i>that Sewool Future Resources is</i>

107
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,515
<i>the one who ran the illegal website,</i>
<i>not me.</i>

108
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,934
<i>I'd like to tell you the truth in person.</i>

109
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,771
<i>A person who was going to</i>
<i>commit suicide wouldn't send this.</i>

110
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,315
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

111
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>This is where Yeon Jaehak</i>
<i>supposedly ran the illegal website.</i>

112
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:23,075
<i>As soon as you enter the location,</i>
<i>you can see hundreds of mining machines</i>

113
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,412
<i>and traces of QQ Coin mining.</i>

114
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:33,335
<i>Also, there is circumstantial evidence</i>
<i>that someone tried to kill our reporter.</i>

115
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,882
In fact, a reporter was murdered,
with his body still missing.

116
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,593
And reporter Choi Miryeo,
who was with him,

117
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,178
narrowly escaped.

118
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,014
There is another case.

119
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:51,020
You have probably heard of an illegal
cryptocurrency exchange through QQ Coin

120
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,480
that happened recently.

121
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,482
<i>A whopping 800 billion.</i>

122
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,737
<i>Since the transaction,</i>
<i>there is no trace of the culprit.</i>

123
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,698
There is one more thing.

124
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:08,037
Chairman Kim Samdoo who was recently
released after being found not guilty...

125
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,415
Sir, you have a call from the Vole.

126
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,546
To what do I owe the pleasure?

127
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,714
<i>Mr. Kim.</i>

128
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>Turn on</i> REPO25h <i>right now.</i>

129
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,180
Turn on the TV. <i>REPO25h.</i>

130
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,726
<i>Here are the texts</i>
<i>we received from Yeon Jaehak.</i>

131
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,313
<i>I'll reveal everything about Eom Jaehyub,</i>

132
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,566
<i>aka the Vole,</i>
<i>who is backing Sewool.</i>

133
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,319
It seems there's one more dog
sniffing around.

134
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,032
Is this how you plan to work?

135
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,207
Eom Jaehyub...

136
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,921
EOM JAEHYUB

137
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,431
<i>Yes, this is all circumstantial for now.</i>

138
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:15,396
<i>However, we are slowly uncovering evidence</i>
<i>to back up this assumption.</i>

139
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:20,192
<i>Did Yeon Jaehak really commit suicide?</i>

140
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:26,532
<i>And what are the connections between</i>
<i>Sewool and Eom Jaehyub, the Vole?</i>

141
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>We promise to only deliver</i>
<i>the facts and truth</i>

142
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,374
<i>without caving in</i>
<i>to any external pressure and threats.</i>

143
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,085
Shit. You think that's true?

144
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,753
It better not be.

145
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,549
Isn't it too big a case
to be bait for the Vigilante?

146
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,259
Choi Miryeo...

147
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,637
-Hello, sir.
-Hello...

148
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,933
Kwak Changhyun, are you fucking crazy?

149
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,227
Who said you could air that?

150
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,564
-Pardon?
-The report on <i>REPO25h.</i>

151
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,317
You gave Choi the right

152
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,736
to cover anything
without your permission, so...

153
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,029
Hey!

154
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,947
How could you really do that?

155
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,825
Do you know who just called me?

156
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,036
God damn it.

157
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,205
Why did Moon from Dongseon have to...

158
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,665
God damn it!

159
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,586
In any case,
you take care of this.

160
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,171
Understood?

161
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,423
But how can I...

162
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,050
I mean Choi Miryeo!

163
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,803
Make sure she never does
something like this again.

164
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,765
I made myself clear.

165
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,060
If you can't, just quit!

166
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,272
Damn it.

167
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,693
Son of a bitch.

168
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,654
-Good work.
-Good work.

169
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,238
- Good work.
- Where's Miryeo?

170
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,949
Hey, Choi Miryeo.

171
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,202
Hey, what are you going to do now?

172
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,706
-What do you mean?
-You acted on your own,

173
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,584
aired whatever you liked,
and had Reporter Moon killed!

174
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,086
How could a reporter...

175
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,714
Do you even have any feelings of guilt?

176
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,217
How could you do that as a reporter?

177
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,762
Should I stop reporting
just because Daeseok was killed?

178
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,349
-Should I stop the show?
-What did you say?

179
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,185
You receive bribes,
and you're wined and dined

180
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,689
by all kinds of organizations,
companies, and sponsors.

181
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,483
How dare you tell me
what kind of reporter I am!

182
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,453
Am I wrong?

183
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,962
What am I going to do now?

184
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,341
Just wait and see how far I go.

185
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,522
Clean up. Now!

186
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,734
Clean this all up. Before I burn it all.

187
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,246
- So?
<i>- Yes, it's ready.</i>

188
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,081
Make sure to bring the body.

189
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,249
Yes, sir.

190
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,642
-Soedol.
-Yes.

191
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,811
Chop more firewood.
It won't be enough.

192
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,896
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,512
Get in!

194
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,851
What the heck?

195
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,247
Who are you?

196
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,249
Hello.

197
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,043
I'm Jo Heon, team leader of the RIU.

198
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,630
So?

199
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,258
How did you know I'd be attacked here?

200
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,552
Was there a tip?

201
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,636
No.

202
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,389
I came for something else.

203
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:07,396
Do not give the Vigilante any more prey.

204
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,358
I don't follow you.

205
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,443
Do not make it worse

206
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,114
in order to get scoops.
That's what I mean.

207
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,619
If you don't want to be in danger again.

208
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,372
That sounds strange.

209
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,918
Are you unable to catch the Vigilante?

210
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,171
Or are you choosing not to?

211
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,132
Don't you need

212
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,968
my show to catch the Vigilante?

213
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,429
I don't.

214
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,392
The Vigilante will be caught soon.

215
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,686
So you should stop now.

216
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,368
CONTINUE WITH THE RECENT DESTINATION?

217
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,789
Why were you lurking around Choi Miryeo?

218
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,918
What are you talking about? You hit me!

219
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,336
Uncuff me, you son of...

220
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,507
Why were you lurking around Choi Miryeo?

221
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,802
What are you talking about?
I was just passing by, you bastard.

222
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,512
Son of a bitch.

223
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,266
Here. Write down

224
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,311
everyone you've met
for the last six months.

225
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:34,066
Everyone? Even the owner
of my favorite noodles restaurant?

226
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,360
Wait!

227
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,905
Remember now?

228
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,114
I do.

229
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,199
Write them down.

Here, sir.

236
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,402
Who's Mr. Bang?

237
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:23,532
He's the one who told me
to bring Choi Miryeo.

238
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,326
Chairman Kim Samdoo uses
his services often.

239
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,246
I only know his last name.

240
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
SOEDOL

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,001
And Soedol?

242
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,296
He's Mr. Bang's right-hand man.

243
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,549
He's well-versed in karate, judo
and wushu. Pretty much everything.

244
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,427
I heard he's a huge guy.

245
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
The Squeezer?

246
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,892
He's one of Kim Samdoo's guys.

247
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,312
He's a fat bald guy.

248
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,855
He's so freaking strong

249
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,442
that he squeezes people to death.
So he's called the Squeezer.

250
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,569
What ridiculous names.

251
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,529
By the way, where are we going, sir?

252
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,158
The place you went to most recently.

253
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,202
75-9 SAJI-RO, YONGIN-SI

254
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,544
If we're going there,
could you bring more people?

255
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,796
SOU, SWAT, or something like that.

256
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,840
Why would you go alone?

257
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,053
Or if you could drop me here,
I'll take a cab.

258
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,306
You don't need me anymore.
I told you everything.

259
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,278
All right. Be careful with them.

260
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,988
Let's hurry up.

261
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,907
Cut this part as well.

262
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,496
Hey. Were more people supposed to come?

263
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,123
No, I don't think so.

264
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,629
Who are you?

265
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,049
We asked who you are, you bastard.

266
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,300
Are you deaf?

267
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,224
I'm with the police!

268
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,103
Please kneel down where you are now.

269
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,607
If you do as I say,
I'll treat you like human beings.

270
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,568
You bastard!

271
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,880
I should get out.

272
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,591
Shit. Why can't I get if off? Fuck!

273
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,305
Stay back. You bastard!

274
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,776
-Sir.
-Here.

275
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,557
<i>Good evening. Breaking news.</i>

276
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,894
<i>I'm in front of a temporary building</i>
<i>in Gyeonggi.</i>

277
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,022
<i>It looks like a normal factory,</i>

278
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>but it has been revealed</i>
<i>to be a vigilante murder factory.</i>

279
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,779
<i>The vigilante suspects</i>
<i>are now pleading the Fifth</i>

280
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,447
<i>and refusing to talk.</i>

281
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,201
<i>The location is completely cordoned off,</i>
<i>and KCSI is investigating the scene.</i>

282
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,452
They're finally caught.

283
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,289
<i>We have analyzed the weapons</i>
<i>found at the scene,</i>

284
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,626
<i>and discovered the DNA</i>
<i>of the Vigilante's victims.</i>

285
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,878
<i>We have evidence that two of the suspects</i>

286
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:51,716
<i>have worked for the company</i>
<i>that sponsors vigilante activities.</i>

287
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,802
<i>We also found files that contain</i>

288
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,888
the details of the Vigilante cases
in the computers.

289
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,642
But the Vigilante has never hidden bodies
until now.

290
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,102
Is it really them?

291
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,982
<i>We'll need to investigate further</i>
<i>to be sure,</i>

292
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,151
<i>but it seems the suspects formed</i>
<i>a vigilante organization</i>

293
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:15,073
<i>and got rid of the victims' bodies</i>
<i>or displayed them</i>

294
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,825
<i>at each member's discretion.</i>

295
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,704
These lame guys are the Vigilante?

296
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,959
Jo Heon.

297
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,087
You're the team leader of the RIU.

298
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,632
How could you do this
without reporting it to me?

299
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,468
You think I gave you the right to do that?

300
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,555
What will the media, politicians
and civic groups say?

301
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,688
Are you sure they're the Vigilante?

302
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,732
I am confident.

303
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,525
That's not what I'm asking...

304
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,364
I have the evidence.

305
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,038
How could you let some dog bust our farm?

306
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:04,914
I'm sorry, sir.

307
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,546
And why is Jo Heon claiming
that we're the Vigilante?

308
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,258
That's what I don't understand either.

309
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:20,055
Why he helped Choi Miryeo
and framed us.

310
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,643
It can't be the Vole, since he wants
Choi Miryeo dead more than anyone.

311
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,979
And the Vole's the one
who appointed Jo Heon.

312
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,565
It's complicated.

313
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,029
No, it's actually simple.

314
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,949
There's one more dog now. That's all.

315
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,952
All right?

316
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,413
Yes, sir. I'll take care of them both.

317
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,559
-Thank you.
-Of course,

318
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,062
I should join you in doing good
at a time like this.

319
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,563
-Right?
-Thank you.

320
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,273
-Hong, take a picture.
-Yes, sir.

321
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,735

325
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,661
Be careful what you say.

326
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,499
-What do I do now?
-Oh, right. Come this way.

327
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,255
I can't believe the Vigilante was
a mere crime organization.

328
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,800
What did I tell you? I could just tell.

329
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,137
I knew they were just criminals
from the beginning.

330
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,246

-Congratulations on your acquittal.
-Congratulations, sir.

336
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
Hand in your resignation.

337
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,278
Post your apology
on the viewer bulletin board.

338
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,950
Our company image is a mess
because of the Vigilante. Such a mess!

339
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,995
Do you really believe
they're the Vigilante?

340
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,789
Is your judgment

341
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,666
really that poor?

342
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,088
I have nothing more to say. Just quit.

343
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,383
Get out.

352
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:36,037
<i>"Heaven's Net. Forgive me,"</i>
<i>was written on the wall.</i>

353
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,164
<i>It is similar to the case</i>

354
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,084
<i>of Jeong Deokheung's murder</i>
<i>from two months ago.</i>

355
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,544
<i>It has not been a week</i>
<i>since the police arrested...</i>

356
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,629
It's the Vigilante.

357
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,634
It's the real Vigilante.

358
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
Right?

359
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,226
He's trying to prove
that the police have fabricated it.

360
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,228
"They're not real."

361
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,773
"The real Vigilante is here."

362
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,164
<i>The police are trying</i>
<i>to find out if it's by the Vigilante.</i>

363
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,583
<i>Some claim that the pig farm case was...</i>

364
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,253
<i>...fabricated to look</i>
<i>like the Vigilante's doing...</i>

365
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,131
That's my brother! You're the best!
You're so cool!

366
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,303
-It's done. Good work.
-Thank you. Good job.

367
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,680
Mr. Kim, why don't you

368
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,974
-and the pastor take a picture?
-Sure.

369
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,058
Sir.

370
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,146
Choi Junsik's been killed
by the Vigilante.

371
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,690
And the ledger is gone.

372
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,663
Let's take a photo.

373
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,752
Let's take it next time.

374
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,423
- Bring the car around.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,010
Contact the loan sharks and druggies
and tell them

376
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,679
to pause their business
and bring the money over.

377
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,847
Yes, sir.

378
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,497
Kim Jiyong.

379
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,772
I'm sure you're busy.
What brings you here, sir?

380
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,111
I'm here to give you a last chance.

381
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,955
Stop this.

382
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,332
Stop all this...

383
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,086
and follow me.

384
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,881
I'll lead you.

385
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,801
I felt it when I first saw you...

386
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,930
You've killed someone before.

387
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:29,187
And when you didn't arrest me, I realized

388
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,481
that you take care

389
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,276
of cases unofficially on someone's orders.

390
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,239
You and I don't seem very different.

391
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:47,330
So how and where are you going to lead me?

392
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,917
No matter how great something is,

393
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:57,006
if it's uncontrollable,
it's nothing more than a lethal weapon.

394
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,927
The world's better off without it.

395
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,720
Kim Jiyong.

396
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:08,726
If I guide you well,
you could go places.

397
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,019
Sir.

398
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,980
Have you ever been

399
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,025
in the shoes of the weak?

400
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,655
Of those who are bullied and abused?

401
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,034
Do you know

402
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,414
how it feels to not be able to do anything
when crimes ruin...

403
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,043
your life?

404
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,631
When the law you believed was just

405
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:44,178
is endlessly generous to criminals,
but neglects victims...

406
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,139
When the law that must be sacred

407
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,977
judges differently depending on the person

408
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,854
and doesn't protect victims...

409
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,484
When that happens,

410
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,198
I believe you have the right
to protect yourself.

411
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,372
Now go ahead and say it.

412
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,751
I'm sure you have something to say.

413
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,799
No, keep going.

414
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,094
I'll hear you out.

415
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,888
Then, one more thing.

416
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,601
I'll ask you just one more thing.

417
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,023
Let's say someone who ruined
someone else's life

418
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,319
doesn't repent,
even after a generous verdict,

419
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,699
and commits the same crimes
after they're released.

420
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,578
If you could save lives
of more innocent people

421
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,541
by depriving this one criminal
of their human rights,

422
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,671
is that right

423
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,507
or wrong?

424
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,594
That's your biggest problem.

425
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,807
Your confidence that you can't be wrong.

426
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,268
People like you

427
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,814
become monsters eventually.

428
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,651
Jiyong.

429
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,782
Was it painful?

430
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,117
Or...

431
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,704
was it fun?

432
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,166
Today, I will...

433
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,419
stop you.

434
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,761
I didn't ask you if I'll become a monster
in the future.

435
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,348
I asked you if I was wrong!

436
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,099
What do you think is the crime

437
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,020
that society punishes most heavily
across all ages and countries?

438
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,275
Murder? Rape?

439
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
Arson?

440
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,363
No, it's...

441
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,200
treason.

442
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:59,373
The one who challenges the existing power
and fails it!

443
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,629
Kim Jiyong,
you are not a violent offender.

444
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,133
You are a traitor!

445
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,927
You're challenging the existing system!

446
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,972
The law! The law you talked about!

447
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,641
You're challenging the law.

448
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,445
Even if you feel that you're right,

449
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,325
you're challenging the system
with violence.

450
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,494
You need to think it over.

451
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,873
I'll answer to your question.

452
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,209
I agree with you.

453
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,754
But that's how I feel as a human being.

454
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,466
It means nothing to me
as a police officer.

455
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,720
My job gives meaning to my life.

456
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,348
And I'm proud to be a police officer.

457
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,854
But as proud as I am
to be a civil servant,

458
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,149
there are so many
incompetent and lazy police officers,

459
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,528
even corrupt ones.

460
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,863
That's what pains me.

461
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,993
And that's why I feel sorry for you.

462
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,080
The man who abhors crimes

463
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,209
and is ready to fight against crimes!

464
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,671
If you slightly change direction,

465
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,800
you could become
such a great police officer.

466
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,103
Traitor Kim Jiyong.

467
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,942
Die.

468
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,237
I think that's the only solution.
