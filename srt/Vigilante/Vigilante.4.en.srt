1
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,017
ALL CHARACTERS, EVENTS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,037
EMERGENCY

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,687
I'm so nervous!
Holy shit!

4
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,481
I've been waiting for this day!

5
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,070
Wow.

6
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,368
What? Are you worried
about the CCTV cameras?

7
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,205
Don't worry. I turned off all of them.

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:28,838
Actually, I've been
erasing some of your traces.

9
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,424
You haven't been caught until now,

10
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,302
partially thanks to me.

11
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,263
-Who are you?
-Hold on.

12
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,224
You're so impatient.

13
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,062
How do I explain it?
I've been waiting for this moment.

14
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,734
I'm a fan of yours.

15
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,446
And someone you really need.

16
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,452
Let's work together.

17
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,956
I really want to do this with you.

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,042
Or you can

19
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,837
think of me as your sidekick.

20
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,012
Wait! Wait!

21
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,514
I think you got me wrong.

22
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,516
I told you, I'm a fan of yours.

23
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,435
A fan! Don't you get what I mean?

24
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,104
I am a fan of yours.

25
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,701
You think you'll never get caught?

26
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,327
Please.

27
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,663
I bet the police are on your tail.

28
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,540
But if you and I work together,

29
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,876
then it'll be perfect, Jiyong.

30
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,132
Let's hunt even bigger prey together.

31
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,927
What do you say? Don't you get excited
just thinking about it?

32
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,110
What I'm doing isn't hunting.

33
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,030
I'm doing what the law fails to do.

34
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,532
And you tarnished it.

35
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,909
Did I?

36
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,077
What an honor.

37
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,749
What are your rules?
Why did you kill Jang Soondo?

38
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,502
I don't have rules.

39
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,047
I killed that bastard
because he deserved it.

40
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,556
Stay away from me.

41
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,811
Jiyong!

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,064
Wait. Now is the time.

43
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,733
Take off my mask now.

44
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,319
Don't you want to know who I am?

45
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,239
I don't care.

46
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,410
Go your own way.

47
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,624
You can't leave me like this.

48
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,918
Hey! Jiyong!

49
00:04:54,752 --> 00:05:01,217
VIGILANTE

50
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,268
BOHYE MEDICAL CENTER

51
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,477
Slowly.

52
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,354
THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT

53
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,025
-Is this all?
-Yes.

54
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,235
I've shown you all of them.

55
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,702
Is there a male employee here
who is of similar height to me?

56
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,668
No. I'm the tallest one here.

57
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,959
DON'T YOU NEED AN ALIBI?

58
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,336
LET ME HELP YOU. FROM YOUR FAN.

59
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,194
Are you all right?

60
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,362
Do you want to see a doctor?

61
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,739
I shouldn't treat these glorious wounds.

62
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,074
How did it go yesterday?

63
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,409
It's all been handled.

64
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,204
But Choi Miryeo from REPO25h
was at the scene.

65
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,498
She filmed the areas around the hospital.

66
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,749
What should I do?

67
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,794
She really has a good hunch.

68
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,004
Put me through to that company.

69
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,089
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,427
What were you guys doing?

71
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,603
Some bastard trespassed on our turf

72
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,355
and even killed Soondo.

73
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,025
And no one saw him?

74
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,530
What are we, a bunch of fucking idiots?

75
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,906
I'm sorry, Boss.

76
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,742
Find him and bring him to me.

77
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,078
I'm going to kill him.

78
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,205
Understood?

79
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,540
-Yes, Boss!
-Yes, Boss!

80
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,921
Who are you?

81
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,468
-What are you doing here?
-Who are you?

82
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,846
I'm with the police.

83
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,016
I'm here about the Jang Soondo case.

84
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,394
The police?

85
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,647
I'd like to see your CCTV footage.

86
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,400
Would you cooperate?

87
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,320
We'd like to see the CCTV footage, too.

88
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,948
So we can see the face
of the Vigilante or whatever.

89
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,744
We don't know
if this is a Vigilante case yet.

90
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,287
What are you talking about?

91
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,707
Everyone on TV keeps saying
that it's the Vigilante.

92
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,335
That's what the trashy press reports.

93
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,212
By the way,

94
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:30,551
are you Jang Soondo's older brother?

95
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:32,720
Jang Soonil,

96
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,348
eight priors. That you?

97
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,313
Yes, I am Jang Soonil.

98
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,191
Soondo's older brother. What about it?

99
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,781
You must be upset

100
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,824
about your brother.

101
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,579
We will solve the case
as soon as possible.

102
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,836
And let me tell you just in case.

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,297
Don't try and take matters
into your own hands.

104
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,469
You know what I mean, right?

105
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,514
Hmm.

106
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,145
It's a bit narrow here, so...

107
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,313
-Hello.
-Hello.

108
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,691
Please, don't get up.

109
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,318
It's so hierarchical here.

110
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,905
Ms. Choi. Say hello.

111
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,032
The Vice-Chairman of DK Group.

112
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,287
It is nice to meet you.

113
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,830
I'm Jo Gangok.

114
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,300
What brings you here?

115
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,178
I heard you were the first one
to name the Vigilante?

116
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,847
I was very impressed.

117
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,932
The Vigilante's punishment of the wicked.

118
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,102
Violence that makes people
feel safe, not anxious.

119
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,272
It's all thanks to you
that the Vigilante has such an image.

120
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,442
I mean, names are very important.

121
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,360
If designer goods were called
"luxury goods,"

122
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,946
or conscientious objection was called,
"religious objection."

123
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,906
They wouldn't be the same.

124
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,869
That's...

125
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,953
very true.

126
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,455
What profound insight!

127
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,373
You are talented,

128
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,541
and we're like-minded.

129
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,629
So I'd like to support you. Fully.

130
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,717
I appreciate your offer.

131
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,094
But I want to write articles

132
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
without any external influences.

133
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,308
Watch it, Ms. Choi.

134
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,940
You're a great reporter.

135
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,609
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

136
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,111
Then let me ask you one thing.

137
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,698
I heard you might've filmed the Vigilante?

138
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,870
Isn't this it? The USB.

139
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:03,954
Right?

140
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
Ms. Choi.

141
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,248
That's not yours.

142
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,542
It belongs to the broadcasting station.

143
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,213
The Vice-Chairman here is
the biggest sponsor of our company.

144
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,843
My journalism is not governed
by money, sir.

145
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,012
Why are you so narrow-minded?

146
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,515
You can work more freely

147
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,267
if he sponsors you. Don't you get that?

148
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,560
- Director.
- Yes?

149
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,188
Ms. Choi is right.

150
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,607
Can I talk to her alone?

151
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,734
Oh, sure.

152
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,741
I'll be frank.

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,620
I like the Vigilante.

154
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,791
I also sponsor the companies
hiring the young people

155
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,794
who were arrested
for copying the Vigilante.

156
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,170
Off the record, of course.

157
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,755
There's no reason.

158
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,967
I just like him.

159
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,346
And I think the message
he's trying to send to the world

160
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,268
is more important
than revealing his identity.

161
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,770
I know how you feel.

162
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,695
I know

163
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,240
you love the Vigilante.

164
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,953
So let's...

165
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,707
protect him together.

166
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,388
You'll find out soon enough
that we're on the same side.

167
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,489
The method the culprit used
to erase his traces

168
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,740
is the same as the Vigilante's.

169
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,951
There's nothing on the CCTV cameras
or dashcams.

170
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
Look at this.

171
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,957
After he killed Jang,
he even rappelled down.

172
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,960
There are no traces
of fingerprints or hair.

173
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,671
This bastard must take us for fools.

174
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,258
This isn't something anyone can do.

175
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,012
Excellent intelligence,
meticulous planning,

176
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,431
and bold execution.

177
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,601
He's a very diligent and righteous psycho.

178
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,270
It might be

179
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,149
someone who knows us very well.

180
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,444
Professor Lee Junyeop said
something similar.

181
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,739
That he must know the direction
of the police investigation.

182
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,576
Could it be someone related to the police?

183
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,622
Let's hope not.

184
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,543
Detective Woo, send today's data
to Professor Lee Junyeop

185
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,962
-and ask what he thinks.
-Yes, sir.

186
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,214
Give it to me. I'll go myself.

187
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,656
Your face is a mess. That must hurt.

188
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,243
But if Jiyong's this hurt, I can't imagine

189
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,120
what the other guy looks like.

190
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,997
Don't be ridiculous.

191
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,165
Jiyong's still a baby outside. A baby.

192
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,085
Do you know how much I go easy on him
when we spar?

193
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,461
I can end him in an instant.

194
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,047
Really? Then go to the Judo Gym.

195
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,841
End him today.

196
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,926
Come on,
I can't do that to my friend.

197
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,012
Look at his face.
How can I do that to him?

198
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,848
We're police officers. We have to be fair.

199
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,232
Maybe someone borrowed money
from a loan shark.

200
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,610
He could get any amount of money
out of anyone.

201
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,288
What brings you all the way here?

202
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,540
Here. This is

203
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,543
the Vigilante pattern again.

204
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,225
What are those seats for?

205
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,563
For my students who are helping me.

206
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691
I'm developing a profiling app.

207
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,445
Professor.

208
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,074
Can I see photos of the students?

209
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,330
You know I can't divulge

210
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,248
personal information.

211
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:08,008
Captain Eun told me that you said

212
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,388
the Vigilante seems to know the direction

213
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,806
of the police investigation.

214
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,518
Yes. It seems so to me.

215
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,982
What if...

216
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,821
If the Vigilante is a cop,

217
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,366
what would you do?

218
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,787
I'm not sure.

219
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,210
What would you do?

220
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,841
PRO-VIGILANTE COMPANY

221
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,638
"Sewool Future Resources."

222
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:42,269
SEWOOL FUTURE RESOURCES

223
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,191
Kim Samdoo.

224
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,112
CHAIRMAN KIM ACQUITTED OF MURDER CHARGES

225
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,322
FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE

226
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,406
Moon Daeseok.

227
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,037
DON'T YOU NEED AN ALIBI?

228
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,455
LET ME HELP YOU. FROM YOUR FAN.

229
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,424
Hey, guys. You won't believe this.

230
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,842
This is unbelievable.

231
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,304
Remember that monster
we saw in the corridor earlier?

232
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,056
The huge guy.

233
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:24,103
He's the team leader of the regional
investigation unit for the Vigilante.

234
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,230
Isn't that incredible?

235
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,648
It's shocking, right?

236
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,526
Wow...
Was he a gangster before?

237
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,862
You're not getting my point.

238
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,490
That's not important right now.

239
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,908
Why did he come here?

240
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,203
I heard he met with Professor Lee.

241
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,041
It means he's finally closing in
on the Vigilante.

242
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,543
Stop it.

243
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,627
"Professor."

244
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,922
"I think I'm finally
on the Vigilante's tail."

245
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,174
What are you doing? "Tail"?

246
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,053
"Then let's put it into soup and boil it."

247
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,014
You're so not funny.

248
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,391
You should study hard.

249
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,101
It's shocking, Jiyong.

250
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,644
Don't you think so?

251
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,647
Hey, get out.

252
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,109
I came all the way to tell you the news.

253
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,402
Let me stay longer.

254
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,503
Welcome!

255
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,299
I'd like to check your CCTV footage.

256
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,928
Gosh. You already did yesterday.

257
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,972
There's nothing.

258
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,267
Yesterday?

259
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,604
Who did?

260
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,190
Aren't you from the same family?

261
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,818
The Ogeori Mob already checked
all the CCTVs in this neighborhood.

262
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,903
Why check it again?

263
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,456
Sir.

264
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,418
I guess it's better
to double-check, right?

265
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,963
You could miss something the first time.

266
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,550
People usually check it
two or three times.

267
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,344
No.

268
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,305
Thank you for your cooperation.

269
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,516
Thank you.

270
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,105
Goodbye, sir.

271
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,287
What the fuck?

272
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,294
What is this?

273
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,007
- What the hell?
- Mr. Jang Soonil.

274
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,386
I'll speak informally to you from now on.

275
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,304
What the hell are you--

276
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,521
Jang Soonil.

277
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,691
I told you not to do anything.

278
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,528
You bastard. You're no cop, are you?

279
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,155
How dare you do this in here?

280
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,242
Hey! Kill him!

281
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,664
Damn it.

282
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,477
Wait! Are you really a cop?

283
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,856
If you touch me, you'll lose your job.

284
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,025
Jang Soonil.

285
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,236
You want to meet me when I'm not a cop?

286
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,334
So, what did you find
after digging around?

287
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,252
Nothing.

288
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,840
Don't do anything.

289
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,886
Nothing at all.

290
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,532
-Ahn Hongsung.
-Here.

291
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,117
Okay.

292
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,452
-Min Seonwook.
-Here.

293
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,412
Okay.

294
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,830
-Kim Jiyong.
-Here.

295
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,460
Kim Jiyong.

296
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,005
What's wrong with your face?

297
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
Huh?

298
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,677
Stand up.

299
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,768
How did you get hurt?

300
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,730
Sparring went a little too far
at my gym, so...

301
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,065
At what gym?

302
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,817
A gym near my house, sir.

303
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,944
Is that so?

304
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,530
Then describe the situation.

305
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:32,411
There's an instructor who teaches me.
He wanted to spar with me, so we did.

306
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,122
I pushed hard from the start, and he got--

307
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,331
Stop.

308
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,251
Not that.

309
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,837
I'll ask you again.

310
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,715
How did you hurt your face? Explain.

311
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,849
-Professor.
-What is it?

312
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,059
The police are here to see Kim Jiyong.

313
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,198
Hello.

314
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,951
I'm a detective from Yongsan Station.

315
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:19,458
I'm Lee Junyeop, a professor here.
What is this about?

316
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,294
Is he the man?

317
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,172
Yes. He saved me.

318
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,883
- But his face... Oh, no.
- Hold on.

319
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,261
Could you tell me what's going on?

320
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,223
I was walking at night,
and drunk guys started to harass me.

321
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,144
It could've gone bad,
but he came and helped me.

322
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:43,273
We haven't found the harassers yet,
so we came to get a statement from him.

323
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,777
But we didn't imagine it would be
a National Police University student.

324
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,740
Can I talk to you for a moment?

325
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,825
Jiyong.

326
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,910
Yes.

327
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,786
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

328
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,039
A National Police University student

329
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,501
fought with a civilian.
I thought it could be a problem.

330
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,254
Violence for any reason is still violence.

331
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,655
The timing at National Police University
was just right.

332
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,950
I'm sure Jiyong liked it, right?

333
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,159
As you expected,

334
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,662
he seemed to be in a bind.

335
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,330
So he must have.

336
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,123
Right. I'm sure he liked it.

337
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,500
We work so hard for him.

338
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,751
Yes.

339
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,337
And I reviewed the files from Choi Miryeo.

340
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,049
Kim Jiyong was filmed,
but it was too dark, so it'll be fine.

341
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,842
And Choi Miryeo's started investigating

342
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,594
Kim Samdoo's company.

343
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,056
She's amazing.

344
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,308
She never disappoints me.

345
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,851
Shall I take action?

346
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,942
A reporter's investigating for news.
What action?

347
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,320
Nothing, sir.

348
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,343
The Fool.

349
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,723
DON'T YOU NEED AN ALIBI? LET ME HELP YOU.

350
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,224
FROM YOUR FAN.

351
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,526
You think you'll never get caught?

352
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,111
Please.

353
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,572
I bet the police are on your tail.

354
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,074
But if you and I work together,

355
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,035
then it'll be perfect, Jiyong.

356
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,291
Let's hunt even bigger prey together.

357
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,212
What do you say? Don't you get excited
just thinking about it?

358
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,065
DON'T YOU NEED AN ALIBI? LET ME HELP YOU.
FROM YOUR FAN.

359
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,726
JIYONG
LET'S MEET

360
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,814
Right?

361
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,274
You need me, right?

362
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,873
How may I help you?

363
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,459
What? Ms. Choi Miryeo?

364
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,337
I'm here to meet Mr. Moon Daeseok.

365
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,422
Sure.

366
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,967
- Daeseok. You have a guest.
- Okay.

367
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,470
What?

368
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,560
Sewool Future Resources?

369
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:55,734
It's known as a company that operates
raw material imports, game development,

370
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,736
sports goods imports, and entertainment.

371
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:02,031
But it actually runs
the largest illegal gambling site in Korea

372
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,783
and even runs illegal bonds.

373
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,745
It's also rumored
to be a drug distributor.

374
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,915
The guy who was killed by the Vigilante.
Was it Seo Dooyeop?

375
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,792
He worked for them, probably.

376
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,046
What about Chairman Kim Samdoo?

377
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,340
He's an animal.

378
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,927
Anyone who gets
on his wrong side becomes handicapped

379
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,971
or disappears.

380
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,849
You saw it. Recently,
he was proven innocent again.

381
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,184
As if it was nothing.

382
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,022
Is there anything related to DK Group?

383
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,483
I'm not sure.

384
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,569
The chairman of that group is
also one of the worst ones.

385
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,154
So who knows?

386
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,698
By the way, what about Sewool?

387
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,241
Are you looking into it?

388
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,367
Yes.

389
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,078
I got curious.

390
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,497
That's great.

391
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,332
Can you help me, then?

392
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,168
I'm under a lot of pressure
not to cover it,

393
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,421
so it'd be great if an influential
reporter like you showed interest.

394
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:03,176
I'm actually supposed to meet
actor Yeon Jaehak.

395
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,260
You know him, right?

396
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,180
He was arrested as an illegal
site operator a few years ago.

397
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,183
Yes.

398
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,228
It was big.

399
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,979
He called me out of the blue

400
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,399
and said he had some dirt on Sewool

401
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,943
and wanted to expose it.

402
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,738
Apparently, no one is listening to him.

403
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,360
It makes me dizzy.

404
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,327
God, the stench.

405
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,998
You see, people are

406
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,834
closer to pigs than monkeys.

407
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,337
Without clothes,
you can't tell the difference.

408
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,547
Like this.

409
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,426
Sir, I'm sorry.

410
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,512
-Please spare me, sir.
-Wait.

411
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,223
Who was he again?

412
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,685
The one who testified against you
for solicitation of murder.

413
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,937
No, that's not true.

414
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,022
I didn't do it.

415
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:42,108
Please believe me.

416
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,776
-Please believe me.
-And this one?

417
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,612
When Seo Dooyeop died,

418
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,073
he ran off with the money and goods,
in fear of the Vigilante.

419
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,035
I worked under you like a dog
for seven years.

420
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,787
You know I've been
the sales king many times.

421
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,748
The pigs are whining too much.

422
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,542
-Director Hong.
-Yes, sir.

423
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,002
Kill them.

424
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,212
Let's eat some pork belly.

425
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,340
Yes, sir.

426
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,800
Sir!

427
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,428
They stink.

428
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,889
Sir! Sir!

429
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,891
-Please, sir.
-Sir!

430
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,523
Go away!

431
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,275
Go away!

432
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,196
Go away!

433
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,822
Go away!

434
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:38,081
A REPO25h reporter is
going around investigating Sewool.

435
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,376
It isn't Moon Daeseok?

436
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,710
No, sir.

437
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,631
What the hell?

438
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,427
Please, sir!

439
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,845
God damn it.

440
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,766
Sir, please don't...

441
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,659
Mr. Yeon Jaehak?

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:16,953
Are you there?

443
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,377
It's Moon Daeseok from Dongseon Daily.

444
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,588
Mr. Yeon Jaehak.

445
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,190
Mr. Yeon Jaehak?

446
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,823
Damn it!

447
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,332
I'll call the police.

448
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,341
It isn't suicide.

449
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,305
Why would he have asked to meet
if he was going to die?

450
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,140
Look here, Miss.

451
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,768
There is no sign of murder,

452
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,603
and a suicide note has been found.

453
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,898
Look. Text messages we exchanged.

454
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:27,982
Look at them.

455
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,153
Do they look like texts from someone
who was going to kill himself?

456
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,783
All right. Please leave.

457
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,869
I'll call you if something comes up.

458
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,965
Do you think Yeon Jaehak left it at home?

459
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,927
I'm sure he knew it was dangerous.

460
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,970
EUNHYUN POLICE STATION

461
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,267
Any idea where it might be?

462
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,774
The place we were supposed to meet at.

463
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,609
Jaehak suddenly changed the location.

464
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,569
Where is it?

465
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,582
LET'S MEET

466
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,417
I'M SCARED. ARE YOU GOING TO HIT ME AGAIN?

467
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,878
I'LL CONTACT YOU NEAR THE BUS TERMINAL
TOMORROW AT 9

468
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,839
I'LL DECIDE THEN WHETHER TO MEET YOU

469
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,153
Don't you just love this fresh air?

470
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,237
You're all talk.

471
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,990
Cut it out.

472
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,617
Beer?

473
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,745
Hey, I'm a busy man,
but that sounds great.

474
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,455
-What about you?
-I'm busy.

475
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,082
Why bother? Of course, he can't.

476
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,709
Hold on. This bastard.

477
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,669
He's acting weird these days.

478
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,629
-What?
-You have secrets, don't you?

479
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,714
Be honest.

480
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,257
Hey.

481
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,386
Hello.

482
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,849
Do you remember me?

483
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,228
Oh, yes.

484
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,191
I don't know the details,
but I think I helped you last time.

485
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,234
Shouldn't you treat me to a meal?

486
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,570
I actually wanted to meet you.

487
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,489
This is great. Let's go.

488
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,326
-Bye.
-Bye.

489
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,999
That traitor bastard.

490
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,918
That cool bastard.

491
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,714
I think we're around the same age.

492
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,383
Isn't it strange for us to speak formally?

493
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,676
Let's talk casually.

494
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,056
-Sure. What do you want to eat?
-Sundae gukbap.

495
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,808
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

496
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,066
-I'm going to hit the restroom.
-Okay.

497
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,247
May I help you?

498
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,167
I'm Jo Heon, team leader
of the regional investigation unit.

499
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,628
I'm investigating the Vigilante.

500
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,839
So?

501
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,466
About four years ago,

502
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:46,180
Professor Lee Junyeop and I were
dispatched to South America together.

503
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,017
If you think about it,
you're like my junior officer.

504
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,064
So may I speak informally to you
from now on?

505
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,360
Sure, sir.

506
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,989
You've seen me before, right?

507
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,449
Yes. I saw you
when you visited the school.

508
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,326
Since you're a cop,

509
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,997
you must be interested
in the Vigilante case?

510
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,917
Of course. I watch the news
and everything about it.

511
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,878
It's also related to the report
I'm writing now.

512
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:23,134
Then how do you think
the Vigilante would...

513
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,471
write a report...

514
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,599
on the Vigilante?

515
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
Well...

516
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,658
I think he'd write it objectively...

517
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:54,248
without sounding antisocial.

518
00:38:54,749 --> 00:39:00,087
Why? To hide the fact
that he's the Vigilante?

519
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,672
No.

520
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,051
Because the Vigilante wouldn't think

521
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,469
he's committing crimes.

522
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
That's interesting.

523
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,225
It is.

524
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,562
Yes, that's right.

525
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,815
That's the peculiarity of the Vigilante's

526
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,400
crimes.

527
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:27,740
So I'm focusing on eradicating the crimes

528
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,661
rather than catching the Vigilante.

529
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,254
The Vigilante will be caught soon.

530
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,215
So...

531
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,967
don't do it again.

532
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm advising you.

533
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,766
Your talents would go to waste.

534
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,727
I mean it.

535
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,109
I don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

536
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,195
Jiyong.

537
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,279
Yes.

538
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,201
I'm not sure.

539
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,412
What would you do?

540
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,040
If the Vigilante is caught

541
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,337
and it turns out
he's a steady and righteous person

542
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,717
with a good job and a good reputation,

543
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,971
and if...

544
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,933
he's even young and good-looking,

545
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,854
the public will go wild.

546
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,481
Beyond our control.

547
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,694
Maybe that's why...

548
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,074
he isn't trying to hide his crimes...

549
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,619
but rather flaunt them.

550
00:40:58,998 --> 00:40:59,999
So?

551
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,502
We'll create a list of candidates
for the Vigilante.

552
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,756
Pick the worst of them...

553
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,885
and frame him for all the crimes.

554
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,096
"Look."

555
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,226
"The Vigilante you were so wild about
is worthless."

556
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,103
"He's a loser."

557
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,690
That is...

558
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:30,029
the best way to put vigilantism...

559
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,701
to rest.
