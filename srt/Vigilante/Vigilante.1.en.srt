1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,225
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS
AND INCIDENTS IN THIS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,477
I will now announce the ruling.

3
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:26,026
The accused stomped on and kicked
the victim's head and chest multiple times

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,696
in front of their child
for the sole reason of being offended,

5
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,740
resulting in the victim's death.

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,325
The accused has a history

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,579
of being punished for crimes of
a similar manner in the past,

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,957
and a heavy sentence is inevitable
for taking an innocent life

9
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,001
over a minor dispute.

10
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,838
However, considering

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,883
the fact that there was
no intention to kill,

12
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:55,430
the fact that he tried his best
to settle with the victim's family,

13
00:00:56,306 --> 00:01:00,018
and the fact that he is
being treated for mental illness,

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,520
and taking into account his deep remorse

15
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,439
and reflection on the crime,

16
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,401
I sentence him
to three and a half years in prison.

17
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,670
Little shit.

18
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,279
Wake up!

19
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,283
Mom!

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,014
12 YEARS LATER

21
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,324
Hello.

22
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,828
You son of a bitch!

23
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,454
How dare you call the cops on me.

24
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,456
-How dare you!
-Why are you doing this?

25
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,668
You son of a bitch.
Did you think I'd never find you?

26
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,962
Did you think so, you piece of shit?

27
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
Come here, you bastard.

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,965
-Why are you doing this?
-Are you sorry?

29
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,675
-Yes, I'm sorry.
-You should be, you shit.

30
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,510
-I'm sorry.
-Yes, you should be sorry!

31
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,595
You son of a bitch.

32
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,888
You should be.

33
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,806
So you should be taught a lesson.

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,183
Call the cops on me.

35
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,642
You piece of shit.

36
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,895
You fucking loser.

37
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,315
Because of you, I had to go
to the police station over nothing.

38
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,817
You son of a bitch.

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,445
God damn it.

40
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
What?

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,579
What are you looking at,
you pieces of shit?

42
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,040
Call the police.

43
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,627
You. Go ahead
and call the fucking cops on me.

44
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,463
Do it, and I will fucking kill you all!

45
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,885
That piece of shit.

46
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,428
Hey.

47
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,056
Who are you?

48
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,226
Are you following me?

49
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,854
Answer me, you bastard!

50
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,068
Choi Sungsoo, 18 criminal convictions.

51
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,156
How are you roaming freely like this?

52
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,826
How?

53
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,870
I can

54
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,166
because that's what the law decided,
you bastard!

55
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,881
God damn it...

56
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,466
Son of a bitch!

57
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,806
You can't be living like this.

58
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,434
My family was ruined because of you.

59
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,893
What kind of law is this?

60
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,176
Thank you.

61
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,803
For remaining a piece of shit.

62
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:44,964
VIGILANTE

63
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:57,018
Now, this graph shows the arrest rates
for murder cases from 2018 to 2021

64
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:01,022
based on the crime statistics
of the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

65
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,150
As you can see, it's odd.

66
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,569
The arrest rates are over 100%.

67
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,696
So how did this happen?

68
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,199
It's because

69
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,786
these statistics include cold cases
we've solved.

70
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,289
If we exclude the cold cases,

71
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,083
from 2012 to 2021,

72
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,713
the average arrest rate for murders
is 98.5%.

73
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,549
-Professor.
-Yes?

74
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,385
What about the rest of the cold cases?

75
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,181
Exactly.

76
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,602
Why haven't they been solved?

77
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,774
Maybe they're already serving time
for other crimes like the Hwaseong Case.

78
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,902
Murder consists
of a significant proportion

79
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,946
of first-time offenders.

80
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,113
But there is

81
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,576
a high possibility
that they're not first-time offenders.

82
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,331
Then what if someone
who committed murder in the past

83
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,959
is lucky enough to be sentenced
for a petty crime?

84
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,336
When they are released...

85
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,214
While there is
no statute of limitations for murder,

86
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,299
it's likely to be a long-term cold case.

87
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,552
In fact, it happens a lot.

88
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,765
It's something you have to keep working on
as a police officer.

89
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,142
Having said that,

90
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,895
write down your opinions on this matter

91
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,939
and submit them by our next class.

92
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,023
Okay? That'll be all.

93
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,485
-That'll be all.
-Sorry, guys.

94
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,239
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

95
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,841
Seonwook must not
be feeling himself today.

96
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,468
Didn't he use to be a judoka?

97
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,803
It's not that.

98
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,180
It's that Jiyong is that good.

99
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,766
He's growing at an incredible pace.

100
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,728
Those two can go out in the field
right now.

101
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,732
I know. But let's not show it.

102
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,900
They'll get full of themselves.

103
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,282
One full point.

104
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,703
MIN SEONWOOK, KIM JIYONG

105
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,414
Bow.

106
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,781
God, that bastard.

107
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,626
SEONPO STATION, UNPROVOKED ATTACK
ARREST WARRANT REJECTED

108
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,090
You were so good today.
I learned something new.

109
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,343
I totally let you win.

110
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,722
You may be better than me
at everything else,

111
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,350
but not at judo.

112
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,228
Right. Hey.

113
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,772
That shampooing trick.

114
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,526
You used it at
the National Sports Festival too, right?

115
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,488
Hey, it's good for preventing hair loss
and it smells good.

116
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,864
It's freaking expensive.

117
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,119
I think I can beat you too,
you punk.

118
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,956
By the way, use that expensive shampoo
on me next time.

119
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,999
So that I can be fragrant in the club.

120
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,793
Crazy bastard.

121
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,253
-Jiyong.
-Yes?

122
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,005
You should go clubbing with us
before we get appointed.

123
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,967
I can't. You know I'm busy on weekends.

124
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,720
You can't be that busy, you bastard.

125
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,888
What's wrong with you?

126
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,432
I'm sleeping.

127
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,355
She dropped them again.

128
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,692
Ma'am.

129
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,862
Ma'am. Ma'am?

130
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:26,245
I told you, you have to tie them tighter.

131
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,791
Like this.

132
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,334
Done.

133
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,506
For your trouble.

134
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,426
Thank you.

135
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,721
Oh, wait.

136
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,684
Careful.

137
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,060
YONG GUKBAP RESTAURANT

138
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:15,127
Kim randomly attacked a stranger near
Seonpo Station on the 27th last month,

139
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,797
and a warrant for his arrest
was reviewed today.

140
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,090
It has been confirmed
that it was rejected.

141
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,469
Last month, Kim broke into a house

142
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,137
near Seonpo Station, urinated,

143
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,431
and went on a rampage.

144
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,392
The resident was attacked
while trying to stop him,

145
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,229
and his injuries require
18 weeks to recover.

146
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,648
Kim fled after committing the crime

147
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,401
and was arrested at his house
a week later, on the third.

148
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,196
The court stated that
they rejected the warrant

149
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,657
because Kim was sleeping
and had no intention

150
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,408
to flee or destroy evidence.

151
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,538
The family of An, the victim,
expressed their fear of retaliation,

152
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,582
and citizens are enraged
by the court's decision.

153
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,712
They expressed their anger
questioning whom the law is for.

154
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,798
Kim was held in custody,

155
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,009
and released around 10:00 p.m.
after the warrant was rejected.

156
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,849
UNPROVOKED ATTACK NEAR SEONPO STATION.
ARREST WARRANT REJECTED?

157
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,435
"Assaulted homeowner who tried to stop him
from urinating on their property."

158
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,771
"Requires 18 weeks to recover."

159
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,691
"The arrest warrant was rejected."

160
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,606
My, my. You still live here?

161
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,400
Why the hell won't you move?

162
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,861
Because you have no money?
Are you that poor?

163
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,613
Because of that bastard,

164
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,741
I even appeared on the news.
It's fucking embarrassing.

165
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,285
What are you looking at, you little shit?

166
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,371
Do you want to die?
Want me to beat you up like your dad?

167
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,999
I suddenly want to pee.

168
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,627
I might wet myself. I really need to go.

169
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,503
"Did the law punish them properly?"

170
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,929
Who are you, bastard?

171
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,680
The pee got on me, you little...

172
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,559
You bastard.

173
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,855
You're dead today, you bastard!

174
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,608
Hold on. Stop. God damn it.

175
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,985
Fuck!

176
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,699
DO NOT LITTER

177
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,204
DOCTOR WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED VICTIMS AND
FILMED EVERYTHING, STILL SEEING PATIENTS

178
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,957
He put a patient to sleep, raped her,

179
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
and even secretly filmed it,

180
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,919
but was sentenced to six months in prison?

181
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,922
He wasn't even stripped
of his license, damn it.

182
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,758
"Was it premeditated?"

183
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
Who are you?

184
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,161
I'm doing surgery. Get out.

185
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,957
What do you want?

186
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,809
Quit being a doctor and find another job.

187
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,489
Good morning.

188
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
Hey! I didn't tell you to come in.

189
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,336
I investigated this.

190
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,755
Why don't you take a look?

191
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,632
-What's that?
-A scoop.

192
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,306
What? Are you kidding? This is
just a collection of violent crimes.

193
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,558
Do you know what those cases
have in common?

194
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,812
It's that the perpetrators
have all been released

195
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,190
because of the court's absurd rulings.

196
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,901
What do you mean?

197
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:34,154
The Seonpo Station unprovoked attacker
whose arrest warrant was rejected.

198
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,282
The doctor who kept his license
after habitually

199
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,368
sexually assaulting his patients.

200
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,122
The man who got two years in prison
for killing and burying his girlfriend.

201
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,376
The person who got probation for running
over his friend over owed money.

202
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,754
Those cases were all covered in the news
and evoked outrage.

203
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,216
"The law is not protecting
the citizens properly."

204
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,386
"The law is on the perpetrators' side."

205
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,889
Because of loopholes in the law,

206
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,143
perpetrators are being released
without being punished properly,

207
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,981
and someone is making them pay
for what they did.

208
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,191
Interesting.

209
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,779
Why don't you try writing a script?

210
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:22,369
Can't you see what the public wants?

211
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,830
An era that's cold to the weak

212
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,249
and lenient with those with connections.

213
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,002
The law's failing
to punish them accordingly,

214
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
and someone's punishing them
with violence.

215
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,385
People want a dark hero like this person.

216
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,305
But isn't it likely to be a coincidence?

217
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,556
All right, then.

218
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,350
You don't seem to get what I'm saying.

219
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,353
So I'll just go to
another broadcasting company.

220
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,565
Ms. Choi, wait.

221
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,985
What's the rush? After we verify it...

222
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,486
Keep verifying it, then.

223
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,906
I'll take it to a company
who's interested.

224
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,450
Wait.

225
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,662
So what will the title be?

226
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,878
"Vigilante."

227
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,715
YOUNG ONE, LET JUSTICE FLOW LIKE A RIVER

228
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,219
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

229
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,223
One, two, three!

230
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,684
Maybe they keep committing crimes

231
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,438
because they only get two to three years
even after destroying someone's life.

232
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,857
I think that's somewhat off the point.

233
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,901
I can raise the issue of it, can't I?

234
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,321
But who are you to do it?

235
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,405
Seonwook.

236
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,451
Let's write it with the idea
that they all paid for their crimes.

237
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,995
Or we'll get more homework like last time.

238
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,875
I mean, how will we reform them
when they don't even repent?

239
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,585
Then what do we do?

240
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,129
Should the police retaliate?

241
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,967
Aren't we supposed to believe in reform?

242
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,848
I thought you'd be
more sympathetic to the victims.

243
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,976
Just forget it.

244
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,565
Reform.

245
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,067
-That hurt.
-Come on.

246
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,152
-Hey.
-There you go.

247
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,320
Shoot!

248
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,907
-Stop!
-That's good!

249
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,076
-Nice shot!
-Pass!

250
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,787
-Hey!
-Here!

251
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,123
-Good!
-Nice!

252
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,336
Hey!

253
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,463
Make a shot!

254
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,383
Yes!

255
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,386
That's a foul!

256
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,857
Kim, the unprovoked
attacker near Seonpo Station,

257
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,027
showed up at the victim's house again

258
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,238
right after the warrant for his arrest
was rejected,

259
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,825
and was punished by the Vigilante.

260
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,830
He just came and started to beat me.

261
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,709
I didn't do anything wrong,
but he kept saying I should repent.

262
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,173
What are the police doing
when he's bullying innocent citizens?

263
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,759
That shameless bastard.

264
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,846
Next is the victim of
the unprovoked attack near Seonpo Station.

265
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,431
I'm not sure

266
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,185
if he helped us
or if they just got into a fight.

267
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,979
Well... In any case...

268
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,232
VICTIM MS. A

269
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,859
...thank you.

270
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,906
Thank you.

271
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,910
We survived thanks to you.

272
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,872
I'm sure you've heard the saying
that the law is not made for victims.

273
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,833
These complaints have continued
to accumulate

274
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,836
and now, someone has taken the law
into their own hands.

275
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,380
Vigilante.

276
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:05,967
It refers to a group of citizens
who arm themselves to undertake the law.

277
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,012
How shall we accept
this mysterious vigilante...

278
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,389
I knew this would happen.

279
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,934
If I wasn't a police officer,
I'd crush them, too.

280
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,352
Wouldn't you, Jiyong?

281
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,647
He's a hero. A dark hero.
I hope he keeps doing it.

282
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,693
Hey, this is a police university.
Watch your mouth.

283
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,029
Fine.

284
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,245
THANK YOU, VIGILANTE

285
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,961
VIGILANTE

286
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,172
THE VIGILANTE. GOOD OR EVIL?

287
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,385
"The Vigilante..."

288
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,615
I'm listening.

289
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,868
Sir, the broadcast was a hit.

290
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
We're getting a lot of feedback.

291
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,872
We must plan a follow-up show soon.

292
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,374
-As soon as possible.
-Sure, let's do that. We should.

293
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,002
I told you it was a scoop.

294
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,340
So what's next?
There's a follow-up, right?

295
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,844
Another common point in these cases.

296
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,015
The incidents only take place on weekends.

297
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,602
Don't worry and just trust me.

298
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,146
Something will happen this week, too.

299
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,612
Hooray!

300
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm late.

301
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,118
I uploaded all the new case files

302
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,163
from the National Police Agency
on the server.

303
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,748
Can you guys categorize them?

304
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,417
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,340
DUI PROBATION

306
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,675
"Crossing the centerline while DUI..."

307
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,552
ONE DEAD, ONE IN CRITICAL CONDITION...

308
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,637
Get out.

309
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:20,310
How dare you come here.

310
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,688
How could you even think of coming here?

311
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,608
Leave. Get out.

312
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,776
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,820
I...

314
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,782
I deserve to die.

315
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,244
-I am so sorry.
-You killed a person.

316
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,914
-You think sorry will cut it?
-I'm sorry.

317
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,332
"Are they...

318
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,751
remorseful?"

319
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,338
I'm really sorry.

320
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,677
-How could a human being do that?
-I'm sorry.

321
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,345
Bring my husband back!

322
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,354
Ms. Choi?

323
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,195
Ms. Choi.

324
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,407
Why still no case? It's already Wednesday.

325
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,286
What about this week's episode?
There's no Vigilante case.

326
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,665
How about we expose
the perpetrator of the Siyoon Case?

327
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,626
Are you crazy?

328
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,254
You think we haven't done that
because we didn't know?

329
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,799
The name of the case is the "Siyoon" Case.

330
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,929
It's named after the victim,
not the perpetrator.

331
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,016
Why should we hide such a man?

332
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,144
How long are we going to
protect the criminal's rights?

333
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,730
Let's do it.

334
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,608
We know who it is because we covered it.

335
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,820
If it becomes a problem,

336
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:59,200
I'll tell them I did it,
since it's the media's duty to prevent

337
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,286
secondary damage.

338
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,456
The Vigilante will take the bait.

339
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,874
I guarantee it.

340
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,593
"A lot of criminals think

341
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,096
"they've been caught
because of the victims."

342
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,481
THE REPO25H BROADCAST HAS STARTED

343
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,110
These days, faces and personal information

344
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,364
of felons such as serial killers
are often revealed.

345
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,368
However, in the past,
felons were rarely disclosed

346
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,371
for human rights reasons.

347
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,624
The Siyoon Case from 2015 is one of them.

348
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,795
Jeong, a man in his 40s,

349
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:55,674
committed a terrible crime
against a student at an amusement park,

350
00:27:55,757 --> 00:28:00,595
and was sentenced to only seven years
in prison, claiming temporary insanity.

351
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,974
We will not call this case
the "Siyoon" Case anymore.

352
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,936
The victim had to change her name
because of this.

353
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,354
After much consideration,

354
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,274
REPO25h has decided to disclose
the identity of the criminal.

355
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,237
The name of the child sex offender is

356
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,488
Jeong Deokheung.

357
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,492
That's him.
He was released a few days ago

358
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:25,370
and is already living
and breathing among us.

359
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,997
Jeong, in his 40s...

360
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,043
What's with you?
I thought you weren't interested.

361
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,630
How could I not be interested?
I'm a cop, too.

362
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,011
That's so unlike you, punk.

363
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,776
CHILD SEX OFFENDER
SHOULD BE SENTENCED TO DEATH

364
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,489
Back when Jeong was
sentenced to just seven years in prison

365
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,324
for what he'd done to Siyoon,

366
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,785
people were dissatisfied
with the punishment.

367
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,205
Police officers have been dispatched
after receiving complaints,

368
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,500
but there are too many protesters
for them to control.

369
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,335
Come out, Jeong Deokheung!

370
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,670
Let me see your face!

371
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,131
Guys, I'll smash his head.

372
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,382
You sons of bitches!

373
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,969
Keep it down! I couldn't sleep a wink
because of you!

374
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,222
That bastard is a Deokheung sympathizer?

375
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,807
Is he Deokheung's real brother?

376
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,852
Were you even interested
when the victim's family protested?

377
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,397
The house prices will drop
because of this. Get lost!

378
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,193
...it's elastic and fits perfectly...

379
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,570
Those bastards.

380
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,573
...gives you nice volume.
It is fancy...

381
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
You think
it'll be all right?

382
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,916
What do you mean?

383
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,126
It's more intense that I expected.

384
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,506
What if someone kills Jeong Deokheung

385
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,300
before the Vigilante punishes him?

386
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,760
Then...

387
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,599
... they become a vigilante, too.

Hey.

395
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,087
You're early.

396
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:25,091
Yes, I still have some
categorization work left to do, so...

397
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,259
Is that so?

398
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,602
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

399
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,270
Right.

400
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,274
Let me see.

401
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,569
What?

402
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,698
It's almost done already.

403
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,702
You're working too hard on it.

404
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,456
I mean, it's just a club activity to you.
It's not like I'm paying you.

405
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,582
Don't say that, sir.

406
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,627
I'm just honored to be helping you
with your profiling app.

407
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,719
-Anyway, Jiyong.
-Yes?

408
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,847
That won't get you good grades.

409
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,641
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

410
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,191
FUCK OFF, SEX OFFENDER

411
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,236
AGAINST JEONG DEOKHEUNG'S RELEASE

412
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,286
DIE, JEONG DEOKHEUNG

413
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,738
-Captain.
-Yes?

414
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,740
Take a look at this.

415
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,286
JEONG DEOKHEUNG

416
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,371
What?

417
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,207
Is Deokheung from China? A Korean-Chinese?

418
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,251
No, he's Korean.

419
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,630
God, I can't believe this bastard.

420
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:39,011
Captain, Deokheung's electronic
anklet signal was cut off at Incheon Port.

421
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,265
Could he be trying to stow away?
Since everyone knows him in Korea.

422
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,641
-Detective Woo.
-Yes.

423
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,395
Request the Coast Guard for cooperation
and check the stow-away points.

424
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,856
And you two, go keep an eye on the victim.

425
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,691
-Remember it's confidential.
-Yes, sir.

426
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,908
What's the point of tightening security?

427
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,368
You lost the criminal

428
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,287
and made the citizens more anxious.

429
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,123
Do your job properly
and stop wasting tax money.

430
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,541
This is why...

431
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:12,628
Let's go.

432
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,133
The key to preventing retaliatory crimes

433
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,179
is thorough punishment of perpetrators
and protection of victims.

434
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,309
But there are many cases
where the victim's information is...

435
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,393
JEONG VANISHED OVERNIGHT

436
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,896
...leaked to the perpetrator these days.

437
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,480
And it causes...

438
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,693
It's causing more subsequent crimes.

439
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,820
What could be the reason?

440
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,698
Kim Jiyong.

441
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,159
-Kim Jiyong.
-Jiyong.

442
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,243
Yes, sir.

443
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,120
Can you tell us?

444
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,459
Well...

445
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,670
I think it's because

446
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:58,299
many criminals think they were caught
because of the victims.

447
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,929
It seems they put the blame on the victim,
rationalize their behavior,

448
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,600
and commit crimes again.

449
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,525
All right. Have a good weekend.
See you next week.

450
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,540
Okay.

451
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,096
Did you get anything?

452
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,768
They might get all the credit.

453
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,524
Set up the camera. Let's at least
capture Deokheung getting caught.

454
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
Yes, sir.

455
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,737
We can't film the police capturing him.

456
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,908
That's not what the public wants to see.

457
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,704
A video of the Vigilante
crushing and punishing the criminals!

458
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,707
That's what we need to film
to hit big. Okay?

459
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,919
Why are you yelling? It's easier said
than done. How will we do it?

460
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,464
I'm just trying to get
the next best thing. Got another plan?

461
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,350
-Look.
-Yeah, that's him.

462
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,687
JEONG DEOKHEUNG! STOWED AWAY FROM INCHEON?

463
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,321
EXPRESS BUS TO INCHEON

464
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
What?

465
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,160
God damn it.

466
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,580
All right. I understand.

467
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,416
God damn it. I got it.

468
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,212
He must have dumped his anklet in the sea.
It's tracked to the ocean.

469
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,965
We checked all the ships that left today,

470
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,550
but nothing's come up.

471
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,303
And these are the ships
scheduled to leave tonight.

472
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,848
Why are there so many ships?

473
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,725
How will we investigate all of them?

474
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,727
What if he's already fled?

475
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,898
Request additional guards from
the Coast Guard and tell Jo to join them.

476
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,982
Yes, sir.

477
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,859
Where did this bastard go?

478
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,653
Yes.

479
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,782
Yes, sir. I'll come down right now.

480
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,784
Okay.

481
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,536
What a mess.

482
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,621
What did they say?

483
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,874
They want us to come to Incheon.
They're short-handed.

484
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,043
-Let's go, then.
-Hey, wait.

485
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,629
At least one of us should stay.

486
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,547
You stay here.

487
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,633
Okay.

488
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,426
-See you later.
-See you.

489
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,887
-Stay safe.
-You too.

490
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,365
Excuse me. Wait.

491
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,498
Could you pull up your visor?

492
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,504
I'm with the police.

493
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,216
Could you pull up the visor?
I want to see your face.

494
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,726
What for?

495
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,021
Never mind.
Thank you for your cooperation.

496
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,148
You can go.

497
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,828
Doors closing.

498
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,669
Bucheon.

499
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,338
Gwangmyeong.

500
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,631
Ansan.

501
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,176

504

Sir! Jeong Deokheung isn't
trying to stow away.

505
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,573
We have to get to Siyoon's house
in Suheung! Now!

506
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,910
-Hey! To Suheung!
-To Suheung!

507
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,715
Aren't they REPO25h
who first reported about Deokheung?

508
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,091
They seem to be in a hurry.

509
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,885
It's weird, right?

510
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,430
Let's follow them. Let's go!

511
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,982
God damn it.

512
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,502
Where is it for?

513
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,547
Unit 716.

514
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,132
Someone ordered food
for those guarding it.

515
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,262
That wasn't necessary.

516
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,771
Put down the knife.

517
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,440
Put it down, or I'll smash your head.

518
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,150
-Now.
-You shit.

519
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,657
Who are you? Who the hell are you?

520
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,975
Jeong Deokheung, you son of a bitch!

521
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,121
You son of a bitch. You piece of shit.

522
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,205
What's going...

523
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,296
Let go of me! Let go of me.

524
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,467
Go! Run!

525
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,302
Now! Hurry.

526
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,431
Hey!

527
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,781
Siyoon.

528
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,034
Everything's ruined because of you.

529
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,329
What are you talking about?

530
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:30,042
You completely ruined my life, you bitch.

531
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,671
Why is that my fault?

532
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,507
I'm the victim. Why?

533
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:41,261
I should've fucking killed you back then.
Then none of this would've happened.

534
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,307
The whole world is
pointing the finger at me

535
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,601
and cussing me out. Damn it!

536
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,484
So I'm going to kill you now

537
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,446
and live the rest of my life
comfortably in prison.

538
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,371
Shit.

539
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,960
You should've lived
the rest of your life repenting.

540
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,462
What are you talking about, you shit?

541
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,968
Resent the law that freed you.

542
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,098
What the fuck are you talking about,
you bastard?

543
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,193
You son of a bitch!

544
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,752
Please!

545
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,535
Please, don't kill me.

546
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,206
-Do you want to live?
-Yes...

547
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,665
Then write an apology letter.

548
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,460
A sincere one.

549
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,882
I will.

550
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,719
I will do it.

551
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,442
Get out of the way!

552
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,799
You can't come in.

553
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,637
But I live in this apartment.

554
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,723
I'm sorry.

555
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,894
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

556
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,563
Watch out for the stairs.

557
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,649
Be gentle.

558
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,362
What... What happened?

559
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,155
-Detective Ko.
-God damn it.

560
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,116
Take him to the hospital! Hurry!

561
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,200
Damn it!

562
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,999
-You can't enter.
-My friend is in there.

563
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,125
No, you can't enter.

564
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,576
There is a void in the law.

565
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,374
It is often lenient to bad guys

566
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,835
who don't deserve it.

567
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:47,341
HEAVEN'S NET
I'M SORRY. FORGIVE

568
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,467
Now...

569
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,094
I will fill that void.

570
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,390
This...

571
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,726
is justice.
