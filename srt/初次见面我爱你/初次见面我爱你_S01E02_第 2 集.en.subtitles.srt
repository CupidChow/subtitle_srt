1
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,636
The pirate is here!

2
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,406
Attack!

3
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,942
His best friend from childhood was Dae-ju.

4
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,012
And the person he loved the most
was his mom.

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,080
Mom.

6
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:49,249
-Have you been doing well?
-Mom!

7
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,024
Mom looks angry.

8
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,627
Ms. Choe, Ms. Lee.

9
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,095
How is Min-ik's birthday party going?

10
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,130
-We're working on it, ma'am.
-We're working on it, ma'am.

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,535
What do you want for your birthday?

12
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,574
A boat.

13
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,778
I thought it would be
a fantastic birthday party.

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,751
MIN-IK, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR 7TH BIRTHDAY

15
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,787
Until I saw the actual boat.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,235
Here. Take it.

17
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,405
I'm sick of it now.

18
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,874
Really?

19
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,278
What do I do with this then?

20
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,750
Let's make this our secret place.

21
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,254
Whenever we have any secret
we want to tell each other,

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,823
we will come here.

23
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,125
Cool.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,432
Gosh.

25
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,537
Ms. Jeong.

26
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,006
Please...

27
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,742
help me.

28
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,645
Pardon? How...

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,414
How would I help you?

30
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,519
Min-ik.

31
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,786
Ms. Jeong.

32
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,689
Wait.

33
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,025
Gosh, what's going on?

34
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,230
Min-ik.

35
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:46,833
Min-ik!

36
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,500
What's wrong?

37
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,369
What?

38
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,041
Is it back?

39
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,212
Right. I was too upset
to leave like that, so I came back!

40
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,547
That's right. It's back, isn't it?

41
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,317
I mean, I didn't come back because of you.

42
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,085
I came back to clear my name.

43
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,791
I just want to clear my name.
I said nothing about your clothes.

44
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,693
-My shirt.
-Okay.

45
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,731
Gosh.

46
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,238
Are you sure you can leave the hospital?

47
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,039
There's a place I need to go.

48
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,574
Me too.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,479
Hello.

50
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,948
Where are you headed?

51
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,750
-Tanhyeon Studio.
-Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

52
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,652
You know I never break an appointment.

53
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,621
Why would I accompany you when I'm fired?

54
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,689
I need to go to the police station
and clear my name.

55
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,562
Get off then. I'll go
to the police station after work.

56
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,531
What if you don't show up?

57
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,937
Stay in then.

58
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,273
Are you getting off or not?

59
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,445
We're going to the police station
once the shoot is over, okay?

60
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,281
I'm not running away. Just wait...

61
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,323
Mr. Do.

62
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:55,995
Who is she?

63
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,164
My goodness. It's Eulwangni.

64
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,266
I mean, Ms. Lee Eul-wang.

65
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:01,801
Is she?

66
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,536
What do we do?

67
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,871
She knows I'm fired.

68
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,508
Yesterday, she even told me
she'd come to my farewell party. Gosh.

69
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,981
Gal-hee, what are you doing here?

70
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,717
Hello, Ms. Lee. I just had a thing.

71
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,854
-What about you? Why are you here?
-What?

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,660
Well, the director called our team.

73
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,763
He couldn't reach Mr. Do or you.

74
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,501
Are you all right, Mr. Do?

75
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,138
Yes, I'm fine.

76
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,973
You're here.

77
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,077
Who is he now?

78
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,612
You know him. It's the director.

79
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,717
Hello. Why aren't you answering the phone?

80
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,418
Everyone is waiting in there.

81
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,619
Well...

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,156
I'll wait outside.

83
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,397
Don't leave.

84
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,106
Stay right next to me

85
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,442
from now on,

86
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,614
no matter what happens. Understood?

87
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,089
All right. Mr. Do,
please stand next to Da-yeong.

88
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,663
-Who is that?
-What?

89
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,732
Who's Da-yeong?

90
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,367
Why do you ask me that?

91
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,539
Da-yeong, raise your hand.

92
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,541
Yes, ma'am.

93
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,209
She's the one.

94
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,513
Why do you keep
asking me things like that?

95
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,082
You're the one
who's good at recognizing people.

96
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,391
All right. Let's try it again.

97
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,895
You know what to do. Ready, start.

98
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,231
Why is she calling me?

99
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,802
I'm sorry, but I can't talk to you now.

100
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,904
Are you locked up in jail
or dumped in a river?

101
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,339
Do you know rumors are going around here?

102
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,308
Why didn't you answer your phone?

103
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,077
It's more like I'm held hostage.

104
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,784
Okay. That was nice.

105
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,320
Kids, this is the last one.

106
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,988
Come on up to the film set.

107
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,395
Pull yourself together.

108
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,098
Stay focused.

109
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,474
Mr. Do.

110
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,260
Damn it!

111
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,898
Mr. Do, where are you going?

112
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,867
The door is opening.

113
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,003
The door is closing.

114
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,205
Are you trying to screw me or something?

115
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,676
I told you to stay right next to me.
Did you not hear that?

116
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,745
Why are you yelling at me?

117
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,948
Why are you sweating so much?

118
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,757
What are you?

119
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,628
Why do you ask?
I'm Jeong Gal-hee who just got fired.

120
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,429
That Jeong Gal-hee
whom you fired with a smile.

121
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,099
The legendary pushover of T&T Mobile,
Jeong Gal-hee. Do you need more?

122
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,700
I know all that.

123
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,270
Ms. Jeong.

124
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,639
But why aren't you changing?

125
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,974
I know.

126
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,075
I'm fired already.

127
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,912
But the patient and nosy part
of me never changes.

128
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,047
So I'm wiping the sweat
off your face again.

129
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,215
The door is opening.

130
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,449
Dr. Gu.

131
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,718
I need to see Dr. Gu.

132
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,957
I knew you'd be like this.

133
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,561
We should go to a detective,
not a doctor. You promised me.

134
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,565
Name.

135
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,401
Do Min-ik.

136
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,475
Do Min-ik.

137
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,313
It's either one of these two.

138
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,416
The world has gone crazy...

139
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,853
-Address.
-Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul...

140
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,555
or I've gone insane.

141
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,491
Excuse me. You're not him.

142
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,561
I'm asking him, but why are you answering?

143
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,097
I'm sorry. But...

144
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,601
he doesn't even remember his address.

145
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,070
Excuse me, sir.

146
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,907
Whom were you supposed
to meet with at the scene?

147
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,342
My friend.

148
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,478
But he didn't show up for some reason.

149
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,814
He didn't even call you?

150
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,249
We're close enough to be excused

151
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,086
even when we don't show up
without calling each other.

152
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,721
I see.

153
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,590
You said you saw
the culprit's face, right?

154
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,959
Yes.

155
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,029
I saw it with my own eyes.

156
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,632
Do you think you can recognize him?

157
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,035
How did it go?

158
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,638
Okay.

159
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,107
I'll see you tomorrow.

160
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,178
BOSS

161
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,215
I still remember it vividly.

162
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,851
As if he's sitting right next to me.

163
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,920
I've got the surveillance camera footage.

164
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,589
Okay. Let me see.

165
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,494
We can barely see anything near the dock
as it's too dark.

166
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,630
And this one is from the parking lot.

167
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,399
Look.

168
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,669
It's him.

169
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,805
The guy in the black clothes
and the black cap.

170
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,708
I can't see his face at all.

171
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,309
-Rewind it a little.
-Okay.

172
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,082
Stop!

173
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,756
What? Were you in a group?

174
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:31,957
Well...

175
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,361
The secretaries ate too much.

176
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,096
So we went out to exercise. Look.

177
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,699
There are golf clubs and baseball bats.

178
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,834
They all are sporting goods.

179
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,102
What about the trotter?

180
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,873
We were going to use it
instead of dumbbells.

181
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,210
What is she saying?

182
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,712
-Zoom it in.
-Okay.

183
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,920
"I'm going to kill him."

184
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,389
-That's what she said.
-"I'm going to kill him?"

185
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,491
Kill him? Whom?

186
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,760
Me?

187
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,298
I meant, the scenery was so amazing

188
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,067
that it was killing me.

189
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,805
That's not important though.
We should keep watching.

190
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,211
What? Stop. Here.

191
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,748
Who is it?

192
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,450
You know who it is. Can't you see it?

193
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,852
Who is he?

194
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,389
He's your colleague and closest friend.

195
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,093
The person Mr. Do was
supposed to meet with there.

196
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,198
Dae-ju?

197
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,272
This was at 11:53 pm.

198
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,443
It means he was already there
when you arrived.

199
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,380
Then where did he go without seeing you?

200
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,316
The closest people are the quickest
to betray.

201
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:13,959
YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

202
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,662
Ms. Jeong, how do you know the place?

203
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,964
It's a place only Dae-ju and I know.

204
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,432
There's no such place.

205
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,068
A place only Director Gi and you know?
Come on.

206
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,372
It's a place where all the secretaries
who worked with Director Gi

207
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,040
and I know.

208
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,945
I'm tired. Let's just go home.

209
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,681
Okay. I should go home.

210
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,349
I wasn't talking about you. Me.

211
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,319
I'm tired. Take me home.

212
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,924
You have money.

213
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,526
You have your car. But...

214
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:50,863
there's one thing you don't have.

215
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,565
What? What do I not have?

216
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,001
A secretary.

217
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,078
I did go there to kill you.

218
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,816
I got fired after working hard,
so I was upset.

219
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,918
Thinking of my mom,

220
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,287
I was furious and frustrated.

221
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,692
But I spared your life like this anyway.

222
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,365
I guess I'm done
being your secretary here.

223
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,268
When I got fired, I was so distraught

224
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,604
that I couldn't even say goodbye.

225
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,611
Thank you for everything,

226
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,813
Mr. Do Min-ik.

227
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,196
Well...

228
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,475
You weren't coming home,
so I thought you'd finally left.

229
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,984
You must be

230
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,087
Uncle, right?

231
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,824
"Uncle"?

232
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,660
Not technically.

233
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,428
It's not like we're related.

234
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,236
We're not related,
but we do have some sort of relationship.

235
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,239
We've lived and eaten together

236
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:42,408
since I was seven.

237
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,349
Listen to what
that cuckoo chick is saying.

238
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,184
Will you stop calling him a cuckoo chick?

239
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,155
Min-ik is my son no matter what they say.

240
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,759
Now you are even trying
to deceive yourself.

241
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,129
You took care of him
while your husband was alive.

242
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,365
You did as much as you could.

243
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,768
After Dad gave him his post,
he fooled around with another woman.

244
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,270
What an ungrateful brat.

245
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,672
Why don't you just call me a fool?

246
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,078
Why aren't you looking at my face?

247
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,566
Why are you giving me that look?

248
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,335
It's like

249
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,271
the first day I met you.

250
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,641
That strange face.

251
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,354
Are you ill?

252
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,225
No, I'm not.

253
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,496
I have some sense of honor.
I can't fall sick again.

254
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,799
When I came here at seven,

255
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,169
I could barely stand,
but you took good care of me.

256
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,382
No one in the world

257
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,919
should know that we are strangers.

258
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,457
My role is to be a good mom,

259
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,028
and your role is to be a perfect son.

260
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,631
Don't forget.

261
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,535
That's the only reason you can stay here.

262
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,071
I've

263
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,441
always been appreciative of that.

264
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,812
And I love you

265
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,348
as always, Mom.

266
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,196
It's been more than two decades.
Aren't you sick of playing house?

267
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,771
Do Min-ik, male, 34 years old.

268
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,274
In 1992, he had a microsurgical clipping

269
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,077
for a congenital giant aneurysm
in this hospital.

270
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,847
He didn't develop any complications
after the surgery,

271
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,983
but he came back in the ER,
hurt from a fall yesterday.

272
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,985
The problem is

273
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:45,023
that the clip was placed
right next to the face recognition region.

274
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,569
Eight.

275
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,105
Nine.

276
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,407
Five. Butterfly.

277
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,511
Your vision is fine.

278
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,823
Your cognitive functions seem fine too.

279
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,560
All right. Look at this face carefully.

280
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:30,169
Pick the same face
with the one on the monitor.

281
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,943
What?

282
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,978
Did I do something wrong?

283
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,384
Do you think they are the same person?

284
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,286
-Loyalty.
-Loyalty.

285
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,489
Are they different people?

286
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,960
I guess you think that way because
they are wearing the same clothes.

287
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,163
Can't you recognize people's faces at all?

288
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,732
It was just

289
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,068
a couple of people at first.

290
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,238
But now I can't recognize anyone.

291
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,541
No.

292
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,244
Except for one person.

293
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,646
Who? Is it a family member?

294
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,749
A friend?

295
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,186
Who is it you can recognize

296
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,355
when you can't even recognize
your mom's face?

297
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,232
My strict boss taught me
how to be patient.

298
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,235
And this cardigan shows
my passion as a secretary--

299
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,670
So how old are you?

300
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm 29.

301
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,978
Gosh, what's with the HR?

302
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,513
I told them to hire people under 26.

303
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,148
Pardon?

304
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,551
All right then.

305
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:54,586
It was nice meeting you.

306
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,221
Gosh, please wait.

307
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,490
Is this about my age?

308
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,126
You know it.

309
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,929
A secretary is the beauty of an office.

310
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,598
They are supposed
to be shining and pretty.

311
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,468
I want someone young and sweet.

312
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,804
Look how rough and dry you are.

313
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,373
Sir.

314
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,743
Which university did you go to?

315
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,378
Me?

316
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:21,480
I went to Harvard.

317
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,083
How old are you?

318
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,686
I was born in 1958.

319
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,055
What time do you usually get off work?

320
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,456
It depends.

321
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,859
I often work overtime.

322
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,195
What are you doing now?

323
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,797
I'd like to interview you.

324
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,999
-What?
-It's not just for secretaries.

325
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,868
I'd like to know

326
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,371
if my future boss would be competent,
good-natured, and hardworking

327
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,939
before I decide to work here.

328
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,142
Gosh, how rude...

329
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,511
An executive is the face of a company.

330
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,146
He should be a good-looking...

331
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,314
Come over here.

332
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,549
...and vigorous man
who makes me want to work.

333
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,851
Hey, stop right there!

334
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,558
I hope he doesn't feel hurt.

335
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,395
Gosh, it feels great to say
what's on my mind.

336
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,931
But I feel a little bad for him.

337
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,542
Did another company accept my application?

338
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,482
Hello?

339
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,517
This is the inpatient ward
of Sangmo Hospital.

340
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,288
The patient isn't answering his phone.

341
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,724
So I'm calling his guardian.

342
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,199
This is where

343
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,768
the clip was placed
to block your cerebral aneurysm.

344
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:50,936
And this is

345
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,472
the region that's in charge
of face recognition.

346
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,608
This is just an assumption,

347
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,110
but I guess

348
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,712
the clip slipped due to external shock
and narrowed the blood vessel

349
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:04,449
connected to the face recognition region
when you fell.

350
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:06,351
So?

351
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,855
Are you saying it's some kind of disease?

352
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,525
It's called prosopagnosia.

353
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,697
It's a symptom caused by a malfunction

354
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,632
of the brain region
in charge of face recognition.

355
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,235
Do you think I'm blind or something?

356
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,637
You might not recognize people
you already know.

357
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:27,973
And sometimes the face
you just saw might change

358
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,374
after a blink of an eye.

359
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,144
When it gets worse,
all the faces of people...

360
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,745
Yes, carry on.

361
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,415
Never mind.

362
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,383
That doesn't happen a lot.

363
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,318
The result of the cerebrovascular scan
isn't so bad.

364
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,721
Let's just wait a few days more
without jumping to conclusions.

365
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,656
In many cases,

366
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,925
it gets better
after showing a temporary symptom.

367
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,294
Right.

368
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,230
It will get better.

369
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,599
Who...

370
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,704
You really must be mad at me.

371
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,949
You must be really upset. But how
could you pretend not to know me?

372
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,217
You didn't even answer the phone.

373
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,551
Right, I'm upset.

374
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,754
What happened yesterday?

375
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,291
I called to tell you I can't make it.

376
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,360
But you didn't answer the phone.

377
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,297
You came.

378
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,900
What?

379
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:03,335
You came there.

380
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,175
Did you check
the surveillance camera or what?

381
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,648
Actually, I almost went there,

382
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,651
but I left as I heard
Ms. Lee had a problem.

383
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,487
Ms. Lee?

384
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,624
Something just came up.

385
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,726
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:29,794
Dae-ju.

387
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,798
You don't keep a secret from me, do you?

388
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,044
I do.

389
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,447
What is it?

390
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,386
Next time.

391
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,823
I'll tell you at That Place.

392
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,661
What about you?
You don't keep secrets from me, right?

393
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:06,064
I guess I have one.
I'll tell you at That Place.

394
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,809
Oh, right. Don't you need a driver?

395
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,078
I prefer a bicycle.

396
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,913
Why do you ask?

397
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,516
I think I need to find a driver.

398
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,985
That's good.

399
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,722
The father of my former driver
passed away,

400
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:31,957
so I'm attending his funeral.

401
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,491
I'll find one there.

402
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,810
Do Min-ik speaking.

403
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,546
Hello, this is Director Kim
from the art center.

404
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,748
I haven't heard from Ms. Jeong.

405
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,516
I was wondering if you're not coming.

406
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,820
Oh, right. I'll be there on time.

407
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,054
Okay.

408
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:04,756
Oh, wait.

409
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:06,891
Do you know

410
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,061
what my mom is wearing today?

411
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,763
What she's wearing?

412
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,301
She's wearing a normal black jacket.

413
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,770
She's also wearing a floral shawl.

414
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,873
Chairwoman Sim.

415
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,676
What do you think
about switching these two?

416
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,416
That would be nice.

417
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,086
Okay. Bye.

418
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,693
A floral shawl.

419
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,069
Hey, come over here!

420
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,572
Are you all right?

421
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,675
Are you okay? Stand up.

422
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,576
All right.

423
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,688
Come with me!

424
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,592
What was that?

425
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,634
A floral shawl.

426
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,340
Excuse me.

427
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:12,951
You're here.

428
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,271
I'm here.

429
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,307
Congratulations on the exhibition.

430
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,012
I love you as always.

431
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,452
Who on earth are you?

432
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,160
What's going on?

433
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,629
Is it sexual harassment?

434
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
Min-ik, what are you...

435
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:24,189
Min-ik.

436
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,634
He's an executive at a mobile company.

437
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,204
Why is it so hard for him
to get a new phone?

438
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,440
You said it will get better.
You said it's a temporary thing!

439
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,909
What?

440
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,511
Isn't that Mr. Do's voice?

441
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,715
Is the symptom getting worse?

442
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,684
They're gone.

443
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,119
It's not just that people's faces
keep changing.

444
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:57,655
All their faces have disappeared now.

445
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,192
I hoped it wouldn't go that far.

446
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,762
Dr. Gu, what's wrong with me?

447
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,566
You promised me when I was seven.

448
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,035
You promised

449
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:14,339
that I wouldn't have a problem
with my brain again!

450
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,375
Your condition is worsening rapidly.

451
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,411
It is highly likely to be chronic.

452
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,923
Give me medicine then.

453
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:35,660
What?

454
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:38,696
Medicine won't help?

455
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,533
Or do I need an injection?

456
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,370
Or another surgery?

457
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,607
What a quack!

458
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,610
What can't you cure with medicine?

459
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,079
What can't you fix with surgery?

460
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,116
Dr. Park said

461
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,519
she had met some patients like you
in the States.

462
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:05,490
She's coming back in a few days.
We will work with him to find a way.

463
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,292
Don't you remember?

464
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,296
You could've been died
in surgery when you were seven,

465
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,231
but you managed to get over it.

466
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,337
I don't want

467
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,008
to try so hard to get over it.

468
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,146
I always pretend to be fine.

469
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,150
I don't want any of that.

470
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,485
So make me be able
to recognize people again.

471
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,422
Once you do that,

472
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:39,657
I'll give you money

473
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,361
and my clothes.

474
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,596
I'll give you...

475
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,700
I'll give you whatever you want.

476
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:52,437
So just make me see faces again.

477
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,952
You haven't found it yet?

478
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,188
We are checking
all the dashcams of the cars

479
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,090
that have been parked for a long time.

480
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,793
Before that,

481
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,596
we'd like to meet that person.

482
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,065
It's not Dae-ju.

483
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,967
Please hurry and find him.

484
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,137
I need to see who did this to me

485
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,471
and ask him

486
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,608
what he wants from me.

487
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,952
Get in.

488
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,804
Which floor are you going to?

489
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,240
Please press the button for the rooftop.

490
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,845
Rooftop floor.

491
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,349
37th floor.

492
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,232
Who are you?

493
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,503
What are you doing in my office?

494
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:16,514
It's me, Lee Eul-wang. Mr. Gi's secretary.

495
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,985
I believe you recognize my face.

496
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,258
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

497
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,561
By the way,

498
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,531
what were you doing in my office
at this hour?

499
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,936
It's about the joint meeting next week.

500
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,839
Gal-hee and I are supposed
to check your schedule and set the date,

501
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,774
but there was no way I could check it.

502
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,610
I'm sorry.

503
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,646
I'll send it to you right away.

504
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,985
I heard you postponed the interviews
for the secretarial position.

505
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,457
That's because

506
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,893
I have a situation.

507
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,762
I think you should find one soon.

508
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,764
The CEO election is
just around the corner.

509
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,499
You'll be too busy on your own.

510
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,684
JEONG GAL-HEE
CONTRACT

511
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,266
"Secretary..."

512
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,403
"Work experience..."

513
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:50,775
Sir.

514
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,010
Gosh, no.

515
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,646
Why did he drive past me?

516
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,050
If I don't get it within today,
it means I didn't get the job.

517
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:04,655
What?

518
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,567
Money?

519
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:22,106
Did you see what I'm going through?

520
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,647
Have you finally decided
to get me out of the gutter?

521
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,085
This is a lot of money.

522
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,587
What is this?

523
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,192
I know you're fired.

524
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,961
So I command you
to be on compulsory vacation.

525
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,596
Rule number one, idle away.

526
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,799
Rule number two, idle away
until you spend all the money here.

527
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,278
Jung-hee!

528
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,223
What is this?

529
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,193
I wanted to take care of it quietly,
but it didn't work out.

530
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,663
It's obviously a handwriting
of a blind person.

531
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,232
It can't be a handwriting
of a sighted one.

532
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,268
You don't even work. Where did you get...

533
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,571
No way.

534
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,212
Are you working as a masseur again?

535
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,249
I told you not to do that.

536
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,117
I don't want you

537
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,219
to massage other people's body

538
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:44,121
until bruising your hands.

539
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,658
Do you know why Nam-hee didn't pass?

540
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,760
Are you sure she didn't make it?

541
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,529
Yes. And it's because of you.

542
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,798
Me?

543
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,433
She didn't pass so you can get some rest.

544
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,235
She doesn't want you to work so hard

545
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,737
to pay her tuition.

546
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,873
It doesn't matter how I live.

547
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,275
Now you should spend

548
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,512
the money like toilet papers.

549
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,349
How can I do that?

550
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:13,851
It's your blood, sweat, and bruises.

551
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,787
You're not listening.

552
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,622
All right then.

553
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,292
Let's go somewhere else.

554
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,427
What's going on?

555
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,162
What are you doing?

556
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,233
You are blessed to be sighted.

557
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,339
This is where toilet papers belong to.

558
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,376
No way. You're not doing it, right?

559
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,577
Gosh, stop it!

560
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,919
Well, I know it's something
a blind person would want to see.

561
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,056
But it's not something
a sighted person can stand.

562
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,734
Come home late!

563
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,564
Nam-hee...

564
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,400
You did a good job.

565
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,506
Gosh.

566
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,176
I can't believe this.

567
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,344
Gosh.

568
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,292
I KNOW YOU'RE FIRED

569
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,327
SO I COMMAND YOU
TO BE ON COMPULSORY VACATION

570
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:07,131
"So I command you
to be on compulsory vacation."

571
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,814
All right. I can do that.

572
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,417
What's the big deal?

573
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,186
Do you think I can't do that?

574
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,057
I'll go out and spend all the money today.

575
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,334
Really? You're at Daehak-ro?

576
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,104
You're so lucky
that you're fired, Gal-hee.

577
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,140
You can watch plays whenever you want.

578
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,490
Gal-hee, I'm going

579
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,792
to Mr. Sim's dinner appointment.

580
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:17,261
Gosh, I knew it.

581
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,197
You are busy with work
every time you have a plan with me.

582
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,503
By the way,

583
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,141
is it always empty like this on weekdays?

584
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,455
Mr. Do, you're here...

585
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,392
Right, I'm here.

586
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:50,160
Gosh.

587
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,019
No way.

588
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,554
Did you do this?

589
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,364
I didn't want to see people's faces.

590
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:33,604
That's why people don't want
to see your face.

591
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:37,207
Enjoy the play.

592
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,509
No, wait.

593
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,916
I'm not here to watch a play.

594
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,918
Then what?

595
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,587
I'm here to see you.

596
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:52,756
Me?

597
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,225
Why?

598
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,865
Ms. Jeong, congratulations.

599
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,668
I've decided

600
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,104
to hire you back.

601
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,344
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

602
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,184
Get lost!

603
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,520
You said you'd do anything for me,
but now you want me to get lost?

604
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:25,622
You fired me with a smile, remember?

605
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,558
There was a misunderstanding. Wait.

606
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,194
Tell me what you want.

607
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,198
I'll revise the contract as you wish.

608
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,434
All right.

609
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,738
Can I interview you then?

610
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,973
What? What did you say?

611
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,775
Why do you want me back?

612
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,746
You fired me yourself.
Why do you want me back now?

613
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,048
No reason.

614
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,518
I just realized...

615
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,155
that you were...

616
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,526
that kind of person to me.

617
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,027
"That kind of person"?

618
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,137
What do you mean?

619
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:14,705
Well...

620
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,207
Someone important?

621
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,346
Someone you should be grateful to?

622
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,785
Or is it...

623
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,524
Someone precious?

624
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,003
Someone convenient.

625
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,646
Am I a loan service or something?

626
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,415
Or some sort of auto-flushing toilet?

627
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:02,119
How could you call me like that?
"Someone convenient"?

628
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,855
I think it's a compliment.

629
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,123
"Convenient"

630
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,959
is a word used for a remote control.

631
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,562
Something you throw away when it breaks.

632
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,400
Just go.

633
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,403
I decided to stop being patient.

634
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,307
And I'm on vacation now.

635
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:24,975
Vacation?

636
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,418
Do you know why this is green?

637
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,153
My brother worked hard for this...

638
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,890
until his wrists turned green
with bruises.

639
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:44,461
And he told me

640
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,597
to go on a vacation

641
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,899
and have fun.

642
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,136
I'll try my best to have fun.

643
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,006
I'll do whatever I want
without caring about others.

644
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,076
I'll say whatever I want without
being considerate of others' feelings.

645
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,411
I'll sleep when I'm sleepy

646
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,647
and wake up whenever I want to.

647
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,221
Go home safely.

648
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,057
I won't see you off.

649
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,478
Nam-hee, do you want to go to Hawaii?

650
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,781
Don't be ridiculous.

651
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,150
What's wrong with you?

652
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,855
One, ten, a hundred...

653
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,057
What about Jeju Island?

654
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,263
The chicken is here.

655
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,813
Mr. Do?

656
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,565
I'm here for another interview.

657
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,701
Earlier today,

658
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,304
I was so nervous
that I didn't answer properly.

659
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,910
I'm very sorry to hear that,

660
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,513
but you've already failed the interview.

661
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,419
Can you give me a second chance?

662
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,487
No.

663
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,857
Are you sure?

664
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:54,992
Don't even think about it.

665
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,760
I just have to.

666
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,332
This is

667
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,401
all I can do.

668
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,173
Gal-hee,

669
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,709
I can only see you.

670
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,115
The faces of all the people are gone

671
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,284
in my head.

672
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,922
I can't even recognize my mom or Dae-ju.

673
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:29,960
But strangely,

674
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,664
you're the only one I can see.

675
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,372
The best hotel in the country.

676
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,909
I believe you've heard of it.

677
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,045
Here. Use these as a tablecloth.

678
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,225
Jung-hee.

679
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,064
So... In the hospital...

680
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,567
It might get worse.

681
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:12,903
I might not

682
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,240
get better forever.

683
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:20,844
I can't tell who are looking at me,

684
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,447
whether they are crying or smiling,

685
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:26,917
and whether they are friends or enemies.

686
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,953
I can't tell anything.

687
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,890
So I desperately

688
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,794
need you now.

689
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,300
So I want you to spend your vacation

690
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,843
with me.

691
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,345
What is this?

692
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,680
MY DAMN TROTTER

693
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,316
A bribe.

694
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,209
So I desperately

695
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:28,912
need you now.

696
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,881
So what?

697
00:52:31,681 --> 00:52:32,983
I won't

698
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,685
change my mind.

699
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,034
What are you guys doing out here?

700
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,241
What?

701
00:52:58,909 --> 00:52:59,943
Why?

702
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:04,681
You startled me!

703
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:06,716
-She got in.
-What?

704
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,285
Nam-hee made it!

705
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,291
Really? Are you serious?

706
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,832
-Nam-hee!
-Gal-hee!

707
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,469
-Nam-hee did it.
-Jung-hee.

708
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,075
Well done.

709
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,483
Gal-hee, will you pay for my tuition?

710
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:42,919
What?

711
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,457
Life always puts us to a test.

712
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,259
I'll go to the States...

713
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,861
and wash off

714
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,030
all the servility

715
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,000
and our lowly life.

716
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:01,238
And I'll become a woman of power
that you've always dreamed of

717
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,773
and return home in glory.

718
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,409
Thank you, Gal-hee.

719
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,144
Thank you so much.

720
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,015
Jung-hee.

721
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,156
A life with breaks?

722
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,325
A life with leisure time?

723
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,762
That has never been allowed.

724
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:26,997
So our lives...

725
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,365
Sold out!

726
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,034
Our lives have always been tough.

727
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,503
The secretaries of T&T Mobile

728
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,872
who've never been allowed
to take a short break

729
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,676
have finally got the waiting room.

730
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,311
Yes!

731
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,146
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

732
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,149
For the first time in 43 years...

733
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,817
If it weren't for you,

734
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,953
temporary workers like us would

735
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,122
never been able
to get a waiting room, right?

736
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,858
She's the only full-time secretary
of T&T Mobile

737
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,627
who's served Chairman Do Wan-bae
and Director Gi Dae-ju.

738
00:54:57,694 --> 00:54:59,663
Even her nickname is Eulwangni

739
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,631
which means the Queen of Subordinates.

740
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,402
All the hard time
we've gone through is over.

741
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,772
Gal-hee really wanted to see this place.

742
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,008
If she comes back, it will prove
that she's such a pushover.

743
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:14,411
All right. It's our happy day.

744
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,112
Let's make a toast then.

745
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,348
Patience is...

746
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,617
-A virtue.
-A virtue.

747
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:29,793
Mr. Do.

748
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,176
You're Dae-ju, aren't you?

749
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,515
Who else would it be?

750
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,085
Stop making jokes.

751
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,488
Let's meet at That Place tonight at 9 p.m.

752
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,359
I think I should tell you
what I didn't say the other day.

753
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,800
I sent a gift to your office.

754
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,936
-What?
-You can look forward to it.

755
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,938
You will love it.

756
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,739
You're here, Mr. Do.

757
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,175
You startled me.

758
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,347
So...

759
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,418
Are you back?

760
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,853
The current temperature in Seoul
is 12 degrees Celsius.

761
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,923
The concentration of fine dust
is 20 micrograms which is quite low.

762
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,691
The stock price of T&T Mobile

763
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,461
rose by 1.73 percent
compared to yesterday.

764
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,597
I got you blueberry yogurt
and flat white for breakfast.

765
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,168
And you're having the joint meeting
with media teams at 2 p.m.

766
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,405
-Shall we sign the contract first?
-Let's shake hands first.

767
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,841
Congratulations on having me back.

768
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:39,823
I guess he's here.

769
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,837
Sir.

770
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,206
Look at this.

771
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,316
This guy.

772
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,318
It's him, right?

773
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:11,988
The closest people
are the quickest to betray.

774
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,063
Who is he?

775
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,900
He's your new driver.

776
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,942
Nice to meet you. I'm Do Min-ik.

777
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,144
Nice to meet you.

778
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,081
My name is Eun Jeong-su.

779
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,952
All right. The three of us
will make a good team.

780
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,454
Good luck!

781
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:57,734
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM KWANG-KYU
AND STELLA JANG

782
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,077
Go on a blind date.

783
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:09,812
What do you look like?

784
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,916
The CEO of Cinepark, Veronica Park.

785
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,652
Seventy-five percent of murderers

786
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,086
are the victim's acquaintances.

787
00:59:17,153 --> 00:59:18,621
-Who are you?
-We're police officers.

788
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,657
The 13th. Kingdom Hotel at 9 p.m.

789
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,692
I'm Veronica Park.

790
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,395
-I'm Gi Dae-ju of T&T Mobile.
-Gi Dae-ju?

791
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:26,863
As soon as my illness is cured,

792
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,366
the contract between you and me
will be terminated immediately.

793
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,535
