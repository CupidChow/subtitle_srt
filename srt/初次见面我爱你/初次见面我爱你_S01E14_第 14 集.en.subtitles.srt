1
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,541
Is one day all you need?

2
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,309
Pardon?

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,079
If I let you be my secretary
for one more day,

4
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,549
will you leave with no regrets?

5
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,853
Yes, only if you let me.

6
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,093
I still

7
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,629
hate you.

8
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,267
I'm still angry about what you did to me.

9
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,239
But without you, there's no one

10
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,645
I can recognize.

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,729
So

12
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,032
tomorrow...

13
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,505
Come to work

14
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,075
wearing this.

15
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,946
Thank you.

16
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,250
Thank you so much, Mr. Do.

17
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,559
Mr. Do Min-ik is suffering from
a serious illness.

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,832
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

19
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,638
Where is my name?

20
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,210
GI DAE-JU

21
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,912
Here it is.

22
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,681
May of 2004?

23
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,752
That's when my mom passed away.

24
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,624
Aromi.

25
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,993
Pennsylvania.

26
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,062
Is it 46 million won?

27
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,118
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

28
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,389
It's you, isn't it?

29
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,158
You saw it.

30
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,127
Why did you do such a thing?

31
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,735
I asked why you did it.

32
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,406
Think of who made your mom die.

33
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,520
How may I help you?

34
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,790
Jung-hee, I'm going to work.

35
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,992
Gal-hee, we have a visitor.

36
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,027
But she's not saying anything.

37
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,262
Gal-hee.

38
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,765
Yes. We have a very important guest.

39
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,534
Show her into the room
where she can stay in.

40
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:56,636
Oh, she's staying over?

41
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,273
I don't know who you are,
but you can use this room.

42
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,977
It's empty because
my sister is in Pennsylvania now.

43
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,144
Do you know?

44
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,014
There's this famous school
called the University of Pennsylvania.

45
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,416
She studies there.

46
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,954
Did you not hear him?

47
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,790
Our sister is in Pennsylvania,

48
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,692
so you can use this room.

49
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,197
See you.

50
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,835
By the way, how do you know Gal-hee?

51
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,103
Are you her friend?

52
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,773
I bet you're like her family.
That's why you're staying over, right?

53
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,747
Have you been doing well?

54
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,719
You must be sick.

55
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,724
I'm the one who should be sick.
You shouldn't be like this.

56
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,736
Hello, Mr. Do.

57
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,450
Your breakfast is
blueberry yogurt and flat white--

58
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,584
I had breakfast.

59
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,220
The stock price of T&T Mobile today is--

60
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,422
I checked it already.

61
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,660
You got...

62
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,829
the cast removed.

63
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,097
I did.

64
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,733
I have no problem with my arm.

65
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,468
So you can ask me anything today.

66
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,005
I'd like to check the meeting room.

67
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,873
Okay. I'll go and check if it's possible.

68
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,446
It's your mother. I'll wait outside.

69
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,060
Is she still here?

70
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,799
What brings you all the way to my office?

71
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,434
Today is a special day.

72
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,936
After the board meeting,

73
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,105
the stockholders' meeting
is just a formality.

74
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,142
So this is technically the CEO election.

75
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,444
Your wedding didn't work out,

76
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,047
but you will do this right, won't you?

77
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,917
There's something I want to eat, Mom.

78
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,754
When I was seven, after the surgery,

79
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,089
you made me samgyetang.

80
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,327
I'm sure I'll definitely
pass the board meeting.

81
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,630
So please make me

82
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,466
samgyetang as a gift.

83
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,845
He looks so cool.

84
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,416
What are you doing, Jeong Gal-hee?

85
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,918
You promised you wouldn't
see him as a man.

86
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,557
You're just a temporary secretary
for one day.

87
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,093
Pull yourself together and focus on work.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,495
If something happens to Mr. Do today,

89
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,431
you will be screwed.

90
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,201
Hey!

91
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,770
-Jeong Gal-hee.
-Jeong Gal-hee.

92
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,610
Good to see you, Gal-hee.

93
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,079
I'm so glad to see you.

94
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,850
It feels like eating chicken
after suffering from enteritis.

95
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,820
Let's eat some trotter
after the board meeting tonight.

96
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,022
We have some questions to ask you.

97
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,357
-We do
-We do

98
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,996
All right. I guess I would want

99
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,699
to drink tonight.

100
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,101
Oh, right. Did you hear the news?

101
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,471
Mr. Gi handed in his resignation.

102
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,772
Really? Why?

103
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,308
I don't think it's accepted though.

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,246
Yesterday, I heard my boss
talking to Mr. Sim on the phone.

105
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,882
He said they would convene
the disciplinary committee.

106
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,857
My goodness.

107
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,895
Why did you ask us to dress up like this?

108
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,898
We wouldn't look alike this way.
We look totally different.

109
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,033
The thing is...

110
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,104
My gosh.

111
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,307
I just can't enjoy a movie
after watching its preview.

112
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,846
The movie is about to start now.

113
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,315
Shall we go and watch it?

114
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,591
I marked the pages of the directors
who are coming today.

115
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,193
Please check them once again.

116
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,262
What do you think?

117
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,963
About what?

118
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,366
Do you think I deserve

119
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,168
to become the CEO of this company?

120
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,045
Of course. I believe you are
more qualified than anyone else.

121
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,447
I can't even recognize people's faces

122
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,350
so I have to memorize
all of them like this.

123
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,821
I will have to run the company

124
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,225
with this disability.

125
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,563
When my older brother
started to lose his sight,

126
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,365
my mom told him this.

127
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,470
"Jung-hee, why are you crying?"

128
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,639
Mom.

129
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,109
Am I disabled?

130
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,013
While I was playing with my friends,

131
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,016
some lady came to us

132
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,053
and told the kids not to hang out with me.

133
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,388
She said I'm a disabled person.

134
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,629
She's right, Jung-hee.
You have a disability.

135
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,066
But you know what?

136
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,503
All people are disabled.

137
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,006
Throughout my whole life,

138
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,942
I've never met someone

139
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,645
who's perfectly normal.

140
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,383
I don't think
the lady who said that to you

141
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,852
is a perfect person.

142
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,121
So from now on,

143
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,957
if someone makes fun of you,

144
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,227
you should be generous and embrace them.

145
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,564
Because they are

146
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:36,168
pitiful people who don't even know
that they are disabled.

147
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,012
So if someone says that you don't deserve

148
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,914
to be the CEO because of your illness,

149
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,284
I'm sure the person is
not qualified as well.

150
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:56,155
After all, no one
in this world is perfect.

151
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,726
You've worked really hard.

152
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,998
Mr. Park. Mr. Choe.
I haven't seen you for a long time.

153
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,101
I should get going now.

154
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,005
I'll be waiting outside until it's over.

155
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,375
If anything happens in here,
send me a signal.

156
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,277
What signal?

157
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,113
Well... Something like this.

158
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,183
Gosh, I'm sorry.

159
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,285
Or something like this.

160
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,988
Is it too big?

161
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,424
Forget it. I don't need your help.

162
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,926
All right then. If something
urgent comes up,

163
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,195
just wink at me.

164
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,396
Wink?

165
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,565
Even if I send you a signal from here,

166
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,801
there's no way you can find out
what's going on.

167
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,303
It's not a text or a call,
but just a wink.

168
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,871
I can figure it out.

169
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,774
If anything happens to you,

170
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,844
I can know it right away no matter what.

171
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,081
So please just send me a signal
with no hesitation.

172
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,769
So the tuition fee from the chairman

173
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,838
came from selling the fish?

174
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,974
Why did you not tell me sooner?

175
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,777
You should've told me.

176
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,580
When your mom passed away,

177
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,116
I promised her one thing.

178
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,287
That I will protect you
no matter what happens.

179
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,289
Your mom was treated

180
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:41,227
way worse than even a fish at work.

181
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,030
But I promised I'd make you
the owner of this company.

182
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,268
How could you hand in your resignation
without even consulting me?

183
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,266
Ms. Park?

184
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,067
Who is it?

185
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:26,539
How dare you wake me up
from my spring dream!

186
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,580
It's you, Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

187
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:42,721
It feels like I'm Chun-hyang or something.

188
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,490
You came all the way here

189
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,926
to see me in broad daylight.

190
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,295
I think I told you
I handed in my resignation.

191
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,064
Are you okay
about dating an unemployed boyfriend?

192
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,233
You're dating a girlfriend
who's made of money.

193
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,670
You can sponge off me as much as you want,
and I'll still be rich.

194
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,775
I mean, why don't you
even try to sponge off me?

195
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,678
Actually, I'm going through
something frustrating.

196
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,080
I knew you would make me smile.

197
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,950
Hang on.

198
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,988
Now that you're unemployed,
you have no money

199
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,023
and a lot of spare time.

200
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,762
Over there.

201
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,300
There's an empty filming set

202
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,604
where no one is around.

203
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,275
Would you like to go there
and stay with me for a while?

204
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,278
I think I will be

205
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,716
able to make you very happy.

206
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,020
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
in a quite spot.

207
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,924
I love a jobless boyfriend. Let's go.

208
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,769
Where are Mr. Lee and Mr. Park?

209
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,205
It's almost time for the board meeting.

210
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,543
I prepared an interesting show
for you guys before the meeting.

211
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,987
All right. Come over here.

212
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,822
Please stand in two lines here.

213
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,558
Stand in two lines
and get in there in one line.

214
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,994
Keep a straight face and stand straight.

215
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,629
Stay quiet and keep a straight face.

216
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,137
Please come in.

217
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,876
Go inside in one line.

218
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,784
What is going on?

219
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,753
No way.

220
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,270
Mr. Do, let me ask you
a simple question before we begin.

221
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,906
Among these people,

222
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,308
which one is Mr. Park?

223
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,548
He winked.

224
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,884
Okay. I got it.

225
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,889
It's code blue. What do I do?

226
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,125
Gal-hee, you have to think. Think.

227
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,528
Mr. Park and Mr. Lee

228
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,431
went in there with a bunch of people
wearing the same suits.

229
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,201
It means someone knows
about Mr. Do's illness.

230
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,371
What if Mr. Do fails to recognize them?

231
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,843
No. He has memorized
and practiced so hard.

232
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,246
I'm sure he will recognize them.

233
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,783
But still...

234
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,087
Some of the directors might
turn their backs on him. What should I do?

235
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,791
What should I do to help Mr. Do?

236
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,193
Oh, right. Did you hear the news?

237
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,162
Mr. Gi handed in his resignation.

238
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,731
I don't think it's accepted though.

239
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,536
Yesterday, I heard my boss
talking to Mr. Sim on the phone.

240
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,205
He said they would convene
the disciplinary committee.

241
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,316
Ms. Park.

242
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,520
I said I wanted to talk to you.

243
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,255
I didn't mean I'd take my shirt off.

244
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,092
You can talk to me. I'm listening.

245
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,727
MS. JEONG

246
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,262
Jeong Gal-hee, you brat.

247
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,232
I'm going to sue you
for obstruction of business!

248
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,633
Hello, Ms. Jeong.

249
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,636
What?

250
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,772
I think Mr. Sim didn't
accept your resignation

251
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,807
and is planning
to take disciplinary action.

252
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:33,145
I'm really sorry to ask you
something like this,

253
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,883
but can you please come over here
and help Mr. Do?

254
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,123
Please, Mr. Gi.

255
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,025
If you don't take his side,

256
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,428
I don't think

257
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,298
Mr. Do will be able to become the CEO.

258
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,074
You've looked after me since I was seven.

259
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,676
I hate to tell you that I'm ill again.

260
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,044
I...

261
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,348
can't see your face.

262
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,484
Think of who made your mom die.

263
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,523
Why?

264
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,892
I'm a little hesitant.

265
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,261
What?

266
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,763
I think I've done more than enough.

267
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,834
What else do I have to do?

268
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,171
Hey, Mr. Chastity.

269
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,806
Being hesitant at a time like this

270
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,609
is like serving an appetizer
with no steak.

271
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,411
It's like taking jjajangmyeon away

272
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,313
after serving pickled radish.

273
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,584
Two, three, four, and five.

274
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,122
I still have five buttons left to undo.

275
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,657
And you've done more than enough?

276
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,126
No, that's not what I meant.

277
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,394
Do you think

278
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,529
I don't know what it means?

279
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,398
What are you talking about?

280
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,234
I meant I've done everything I could.

281
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,402
No.

282
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,604
It means you don't
want to do anything else.

283
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,272
And it just sounds a little nicer.

284
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,110
Doing your best for someone

285
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,447
is different from having done enough.

286
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,784
It's more like doing everything you can.

287
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:26,558
So...

288
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,628
are we doing

289
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,030
everything we can again?

290
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,199
I should get going.

291
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,071
I think you're right.

292
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,507
I just can't make an excuse
and say I don't want to do it.

293
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,311
This is the moment
Min-ik needs me the most.

294
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,481
Were you talking about Do Min-ik?

295
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,284
I'm sorry. I'll call you later.

296
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,631
Why did I tell him the right thing?

297
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,569
Ms. Jeong.

298
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,872
I'll get there as soon as possible,
but it will take some time.

299
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,411
-Hop on.
-What?

300
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,181
It will take more than 30 minutes
to get to your car from here.

301
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,316
Just get on.

302
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,654
But promise me one thing.

303
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:34,192
Next time we meet,
we will hang out together like two adults.

304
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,462
I'll try my best.

305
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:39,231
Call.

306
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,834
Among these people,

307
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,638
which one is Mr. Park?

308
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,147
Why? Can't you tell?

309
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,324
You've worked really hard.

310
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,365
-The notebook seems new.
-Right.

311
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,702
I'll keep a record of people's faces
from now on.

312
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,370
A record?

313
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:23,642
If I keep a record of people
I meet every day,

314
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,811
I think

315
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,248
it will help me understand
and recognize them better.

316
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,317
I've been doing it for a few days.

317
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,420
Who did you meet today?

318
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,523
The first person I met today

319
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,159
was you, Jeong Gal-hee.

320
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,228
Do you want to look?

321
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,532
"Today Ms. Jeong is wearing a red cardigan

322
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,035
with some cute flyaway hair

323
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,437
the way she looks every day."

324
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,707
And there are Mr. Park and Mr. Oh.

325
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,676
I realized something writing this down.

326
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,580
Mr. Oh rubs his nose like this

327
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,015
when he feels awkward.

328
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,218
And Mr. Park raises

329
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,920
his glasses like this.

330
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,357
That's right. That's what he does.

331
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,874
It's strange. Why can't you tell
who is Mr. Park?

332
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,879
Do you want me to tell you?

333
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,552
The fourth from the left.

334
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,187
He's Mr. Park.

335
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,489
And...

336
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,894
the one on the far right is Mr. Lee.

337
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,532
Do you need more?

338
00:23:55,834 --> 00:24:00,205
The one sitting on the far right
from here is Mr. Choe.

339
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,241
Next to him, there's Mr. Woo.

340
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:07,112
I heard you were on a diet.
I can tell you lost some weight.

341
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:14,786
And there are Mr. Yang,
Mr. Kwak, and Mr. Kim.

342
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,189
And the person sitting next to me

343
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,692
is Chairwoman Sim Hae-ra.

344
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,297
Mr. Sim, what kind of trick
are you trying to pull off?

345
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,801
You really don't have any problems?

346
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,275
Look.

347
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,712
This is from the Neurosurgery
of Sangmo Hospital last month.

348
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,281
What kind of treatment did you get there?

349
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,584
I'm sure I heard

350
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,321
you're suffering
from serious prosopagnosia.

351
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,292
That's ridiculous.

352
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,194
That's not true, right?

353
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,430
Mr. Sim must be mistaken, right?

354
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,567
Mr. Do?

355
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,373
I believe you are
more qualified than anyone else.

356
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,409
After all, no one
in this world is perfect.

357
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,182
Mr. Sim

358
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,118
is right.

359
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,426
"A person whose
physical or mental condition is

360
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,129
not fit for the task

361
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,698
cannot be elected the CEO."

362
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,902
You all are aware of that.
It's the company policy.

363
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,509
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

364
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,846
Those who believe that my illness

365
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,515
is a reason for disqualification
as the company policy states

366
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,184
shall vote for Mr. Sim Hae-yong.

367
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:54,586
Min-ik.

368
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:00,792
But I

369
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,828
don't agree that my illness is

370
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,397
a reason for disqualification.

371
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,700
I memorized and studied so hard

372
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,803
to recognize who you are.

373
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,039
And somehow

374
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,409
the illness made me become a better CEO.

375
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:22,247
If I could read your facial expressions,

376
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,018
I might have lied about my illness.

377
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,354
But I can't

378
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,891
even read your faces.

379
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,795
So all I can do is tell you the truth.

380
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,297
Yes. I'm almost done memorizing it.

381
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,535
There are 23 employees
who are between 160 and 170.

382
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,004
There's Mr. Park...

383
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,305
If I were

384
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,375
still called Mr. Mind Reader,

385
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,245
I wouldn't have paid attention
to every single employee.

386
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:59,317
If I could still do everything on my own,

387
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,988
I wouldn't have tried to listen to others.

388
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,223
I tell the truth,

389
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,959
pay attention to employees,

390
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,329
and try to listen to people around me.

391
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,332
Don't you think
that's what it takes to become a CEO?

392
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,403
Earlier today,

393
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,106
someone told me this.

394
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,976
That all people live with a disability.

395
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,015
I can't say I'm a perfect person.

396
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,183
But if you allow me,

397
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:36,354
I'd like to perform my duties as CEO

398
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,758
consulting and counting on the directors.

399
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,476
It's almost over.

400
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,312
Is he ever going to come?

401
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,190
All right then.
Let's take a show of hands now.

402
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,460
I'd like to abstain.

403
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,796
Mr. Choe.

404
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,434
Mr. Do just lost one vote.

405
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:28,640
Then the one who gets more than five votes
will be the nominee for CEO.

406
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,043
Mr. Sim, would you go first?

407
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,555
Five votes.

408
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,699
-Ms. Jeong.
-Please hurry.

409
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,206
Why am I acting
like Jeong Gal-hee's minion now?

410
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,945
I think we're done. Shall we go
and have some gukbab near here?

411
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,416
There's a gukbab restaurant Mr. Do hates.

412
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,452
We should still take a show of hands
for the other candidate.

413
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,687
That's the rule.

414
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:21,326
All right. Those who want Mr. Do
to be the nominee for CEO,

415
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,027
please raise your hand.

416
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:44,949
Mr. Gi.

417
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,786
It's not over yet, is it?

418
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,855
Mr. Gi, you handed in your resignation.

419
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,791
I did, but...

420
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,927
Mr. Sim didn't accept it to refer me

421
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,662
to the disciplinary committee.

422
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,132
So, unfortunately,
I still happen to be the director.

423
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,705
Then we have ten directors
including Mr. Gi.

424
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,077
If Mr. Do gets five votes,
it's a tie with Mr. Sim.

425
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,880
And the board should take a vote again
in two weeks.

426
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,949
Is that right?

427
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,586
Mr. Gi?

428
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,995
As the nominee for CEO of T&T Mobile,

429
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:37,635
I vote for Mr. Do.

430
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,294
Why...

431
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,598
Why do you make me feel bad every time?

432
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,667
How much longer do I have to be grateful
to you?

433
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:14,873
Min-ik.

434
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,076
On the way here,

435
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,478
I decided something.

436
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,182
No matter what,

437
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:26,618
I will never hate you.

438
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,022
So if you have a reason to hate me,

439
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,092
just let it slide at least once.

440
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,928
What are you talking about?

441
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,496
I'm fine.

442
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,267
You should go to Ms. Jeong
if you want to thank anyone.

443
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,203
If it weren't for her,

444
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,274
I wouldn't have even known
what you were going through.

445
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,391
You did a good job, Mr. Do.

446
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,593
Well... Okay.

447
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,265
It would've been nice
if you passed the board meeting today,

448
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,001
but you still have one more chance.

449
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,304
If you manage to change Mr. Choe's mind...

450
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,044
I'm talking too much, right?

451
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,723
This is your schedule for this month.

452
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,225
These are documents for the work
transition to the next secretary.

453
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,200
And one of the moss balls seems ill,
so I separated it.

454
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,068
It happens when the weather is hot.

455
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,170
Put some ice in the jar for a few days.

456
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:29,207
And pat it once in a while
when you have time.

457
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,576
Then it will get better soon.

458
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,449
I should get going now.

459
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,321
You trusted me, but I only hurt you.
I'm sorry about that.

460
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,059
And thank you for letting me work
as your secretary one more day.

461
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,045
Wait.

462
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,955
Yes, Mr. Do.

463
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,164
Thank you for today.

464
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,372
You're welcome.

465
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,875
Thank you for today too.

466
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,270
MY DAMN TROTTER

467
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,983
Go ahead and pour me a drink.

468
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,155
I think I should get drunk tonight.

469
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,694
Sure. I'm pouring you a drink.

470
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,571
All right. It's time for a quiz.

471
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,209
What quiz?

472
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,945
First, let me ask you, Jeong Gal-hee.

473
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,348
What's the color
of your boss' socks today?

474
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,482
Grey.

475
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,818
What time did your boss come to work?

476
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,319
At 8:37 a.m.

477
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,023
Did you find any strange file
in your boss' office

478
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,159
or see him call the Inspection Team?

479
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,963
The Inspection Team?

480
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,670
I didn't hear anything like that.

481
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,679
Ms. Lee.

482
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,147
-Hello.
-Hello.

483
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:28,286
Gal-hee says Mr. Do

484
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,189
didn't call the Inspection Team today.

485
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,559
How did the board meeting go?

486
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:39,664
Mr. Do and Mr. Sim got
the same number of votes.

487
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,699
There will be a revote in two weeks.

488
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,669
What? Mr. Sim didn't win?

489
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,006
Why? Did you want Mr. Sim

490
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,542
to win the vote?

491
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,780
No, that's not what I meant.

492
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,866
The moon is so bright.

493
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,338
So...

494
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,808
This crazy guy has made up his mind.

495
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,945
I choose you. Jeong Gal-hee.

496
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:31,849
Is the crazy guy

497
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,319
looking at the moon too?

498
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:56,274
And pat it once in a while
when you have time.

499
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,876
Then it will get better soon.

500
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:27,605
Does this

501
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,107
really help?

502
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,078
All right.

503
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,547
Get better.

504
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,018
Get better.

505
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,206
It smells horrible.

506
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,642
Is this a bribe?

507
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:05,776
It's a gift.

508
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,745
Thank you for everything.

509
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,547
My sister caught me acting,

510
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:10,981
so I have to start studying again.

511
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,655
-Let's go.
-Where?

512
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:21,525
To your sister who believes
acting is no better than studying.

513
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,128
I want to go and see

514
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:25,730
what she looks like.

515
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,905
Jeong Gal-hee? Is it you again?

516
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,742
Why are you here with my sister, Nam-hee?

517
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,679
I owe this lady in many ways.

518
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,647
You never stop causing trouble.

519
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,216
Do you think she's the only one

520
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,184
who caused trouble for me?

521
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:48,819
Why am I

522
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,821
acting like a minion of you two?

523
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,424
I'm even offering you a bribe.

524
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,427
I'm sorry.

525
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,762
What about your boss?

526
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,505
Jeong Nam-hee.
Send her back to the theater.

527
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,573
I can't.

528
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,343
I'll make her study and become a success.

529
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,114
What did your father do?

530
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,682
He worked at a construction site.

531
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,583
What about your mother?

532
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,252
She delivered food at Dongdaemun.

533
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:22,520
That's strange.

534
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,523
But how did they end up
with children like you guys?

535
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,625
What's wrong about us?

536
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,928
Your family is quite good at acting.

537
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,564
Gal-hee, you deceived
your boss for months.

538
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,099
Do you think that's easy...

539
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,134
What? Is someone here?

540
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,637
He's my older brother.

541
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,742
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

542
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,611
Nice to meet you. I'm Jeong Jung-hee.

543
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,387
The show begins at 11 a.m. today.

544
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,256
You have to come
to the theater with Gal-hee.

545
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,594
Thank you for your offer,

546
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,130
but as you can see, I'm blind.

547
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,333
Then you would know it even better.

548
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,537
How clearly Nam-hee can deliver

549
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,973
her lines.

550
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:35,226
And thank you for letting me work
as your secretary one more day.

551
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,074
Where's the bedroom?

552
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,676
It's here.

553
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,278
Where's the living room?

554
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,779
It's here.

555
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:57,882
Where's the kitchen?

556
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,319
It's here.

557
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,923
This is the size
of my second-floor bathroom.

558
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,130
Do we really need a big place

559
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,000
to hang out like two adults?

560
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,844
Gosh, you're right.

561
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,981
Actually, the more cramped, the better.

562
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,821
Did I tell you this?

563
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,024
Today, I ate ginseng, wild ginseng,

564
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,992
and red ginseng all together.

565
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:44,528
Brace yourself.

566
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,097
I'll treat you with no mercy today.

567
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,773
Am I really asking too much?

568
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,408
Why is it so hard
to undo your second button?

569
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,443
Who is it this time?

570
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,679
Hey, Min-ik.

571
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:03,614
Where are you?

572
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,550
If you're free,
will you have lunch with me?

573
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,819
Why all of a sudden?

574
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,422
What about Ms. Jeong?
Did she go somewhere?

575
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,656
What?

576
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,293
Well...

577
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,228
The thing is...

578
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,198
I don't know where she is.

579
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,402
Street 36, Daehak-ro, Theater Hungry.

580
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:27,571
Who is this?

581
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,940
Nice to meet you.
I'm the original Veronica Park.

582
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,610
Jeong Gal-hee will be there by 11 a.m.

583
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,746
Stop bothering my boyfriend
and eat lunch with Jeong Gal-hee.

584
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,653
Hello?

585
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,489
What was that?

586
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,693
Come to think of it,

587
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,631
I didn't even buy her a meal
after the meeting yesterday.

588
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,167
All right. Even though I fired her,

589
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,803
I can eat with her once.

590
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,577
Hello? Can I make a reservation for lunch?

591
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,080
What kind of champagnes do you have?

592
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:14,251
Gi Dae-ju is the only real name
we can find on the list.

593
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:16,587
We got him.

594
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,822
But the rest of them are encrypted.

595
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,524
It's not easy to find out.

596
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,128
And the most recent item is

597
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:27,364
the drivers' waiting room.
So I asked them to look into it.

598
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:32,903
Don't tell Mr. Do
about what we've found out.

599
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,005
Call me as soon
as you find out anything new.

600
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,440
Yes, sir.

601
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,486
I handed in my resignation as I promised.

602
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,022
What?

603
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,059
"An imitation of Wang Chung-chung"?

604
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,898
Hey, did you even steal my painting?

605
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:03,133
I thought Mr. Eun's hospital bill

606
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,668
was more important than this painting.

607
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:07,271
The painting was a bribe
from Taeman Industries.

608
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,673
You got it in return
for signing a contract with them.

609
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,881
This is why we should replace

610
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,350
calendars and secretaries every year.

611
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,763
Darn it.

612
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,264
We made a drivers' waiting room

613
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,400
and spent the money on the welfare
of dispatched workers

614
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,669
such as industrial accidents,
bonuses, and overtime pay.

615
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,772
We've never dipped into the company money
unless it's black money.

616
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,481
Do you expect me to spare you
after the things you've done?

617
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,249
If this is about money,

618
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,752
I'll pay back every single penny
with all my money.

619
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:57,454
If that's not enough,
you can file a lawsuit against me.

620
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,789
Why would I do that?

621
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,724
I should thank you.

622
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,095
I actually needed to put on a show.

623
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,131
And you just

624
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,267
gave me great materials like this.

625
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,236
You promised me, Mr. Sim.

626
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,105
Why would I care about the promise
when I didn't become the CEO?

627
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,544
If I pretend to punish the thieves,

628
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,014
a couple of directors
might change their minds.

629
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,750
If you mess with the employees,

630
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,552
I will never let it slide.

631
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:29,987
Gosh, you're scary.

632
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,424
All right. Let's wait and see who wins.

633
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,493
Good luck.

634
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,134
Just in case,

635
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,436
you should prepare the medical certificate
from the accident

636
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:47,504
and the employment contract.

637
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,339
And give me the numbers of drivers

638
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,341
who got fired by Mr. Sim
for unfair reasons.

639
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:52,976
Okay.

640
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,212
Don't worry.

641
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,914
You know it too.

642
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,349
The ledger is not just
about the money we spent.

643
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,952
It also says about the black money
they have received.

644
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,788
If Mr. Sim makes it public,

645
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,624
I will disclose all the dirty money
the directors have received

646
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,994
and the bribes they've given
to politicians.

647
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,067
I'm sorry

648
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,337
that things have come this way.

649
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,473
Please don't say that.

650
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,509
It's my fault

651
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,512
that things ended up this way.

652
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,485
If you need anything else,
please just call me.

653
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,092
I need to meet someone

654
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,661
before things get any worse.

655
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,385
Why are you wearing a suit
on a hot day like today?

656
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,287
She doesn't even have a mom.

657
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,990
I don't want people to look down on her
because she has a blind brother.

658
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,593
Gal-hee, are you sure
you are all dressed up?

659
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,298
I'm really not in the mood,

660
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,400
but I'm trying my best.

661
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,608
Just go and listen to Nam-hee
delivering her lines.

662
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:37,781
What?

663
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:42,119
You should wear something pretty.
Why are you wearing this?

664
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,453
I know.

665
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,690
I don't have to wear this anymore.

666
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,426
Why am I wearing this again?

667
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,929
Come on.

668
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,202
Why?

669
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,374
I forgot something.

670
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,509
Forgot what?

671
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,412
Jeong Gal-hee went to the theater
with her brother,

672
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,148
but Do Min-ik can't see people's faces.

673
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:13,984
You're right. What about it?

674
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,553
Nothing.

675
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,624
If you are out of step by mistake,
dance the tango.

676
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,963
Something better might happen.

677
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:41,945
Ms. Jeong.

678
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,682
What?

679
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,751
Who is he?

680
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,699
It begins now.

681
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:08,305
-This is exciting.
-It's so nice.

682
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:11,208
I even like something spoiled or rotten.

683
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,809
I like it

684
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,044
-It's fun, isn't it?
-I like it

685
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,546
Who is he?

686
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,816
-The beggars from last year
-The beggars from last year

687
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,220
Beggars are dancing around.

688
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,857
Isn't Nam-hee here yet?

689
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,193
Why do they keep whispering?

690
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,531
They are even holding hands.

691
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,100
Gal-hee, I'm so nervous.

692
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,970
Don't be nervous. It's okay.

693
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,841
Gosh, just give me some of it.

694
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,344
-Why are you eating alone?
-This is so good.

695
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,513
There's Nam-hee.

696
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,418
Damn it!

697
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,422
She's so cute.

698
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,095
Jung-hee, let's get out of here.

699
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:08,398
I feel bad for people
that we keep whispering.

700
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,734
Let's go.

701
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,736
Let go of her!

702
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:14,571
Bend over.

703
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,641
That's right.

704
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,577
We should share everything.

705
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,915
Let's eat.

706
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,349
Where are they going?

707
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,495
She always wore loafers
when she was with me.

708
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:39,696
She's wearing heels now.

709
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,266
She's even wearing
a flowered dress to look pretty.

710
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,872
Why are they walking arm in arm
when it's so hot?

711
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,878
We should buy some flowers, right?

712
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,046
Good.

713
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,885
We will have the cheapest one, please.

714
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:08,725
Here's your bouquet.

715
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,861
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

716
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,534
He even bought flowers?

717
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,137
Am I the only one who's feeling hot?

718
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:21,905
Is there an ice cream store here?

719
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,475
Let's eat some ice cream
waiting for Nam-hee.

720
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,043
Ice cream?

721
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,795
She can just give him a tissue.
Why is she wiping it with her hand?

722
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,165
-Why is it so hot today?
-Gosh.

723
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:52,903
You're sweating a lot.

724
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,804
Raise your arm.

725
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,074
Where is she touching now?

726
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,883
-Is it good?
-Do you like it?

727
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,385
We said the same things.

728
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,719
Hello?

729
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,521
This is the restaurant.

730
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,724
I'm calling because you're not coming
for your reservation.

731
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,095
Well... The thing is...

732
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,069
Where did they go?

733
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,698
She's doing things she did for me
for another guy now.

734
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,468
He's shorter than me, and his face...

735
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,939
Does his face look better than mine?

736
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:07,811
Excuse me. Are you expecting someone?

737
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,547
Why? Don't you think she's coming?

738
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,649
No, that's not what I meant.

739
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,417
She is coming.

740
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,922
I'll make sure

741
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,691
she will come back to me.

742
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,499
It's Mr. Do.

743
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,102
Why is he calling you when you're out?

744
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:36,439
Why is he calling me? Is something wrong?

745
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,042
Jung-hee, I'm so nervous.

746
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,778
It's obvious.
If he asks you to do something,

747
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,413
tell him you can't go.

748
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,452
Yes, Mr. Do.

749
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,323
Hey, where are you now?

750
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,493
I'm out for something. Why?

751
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,863
I'll text you the address
of a restaurant now.

752
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,464
Come over here.

753
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:04,301
-Now?
-Why? You can't?

754
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,503
Tell him you can't.

755
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,371
No?

756
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,041
Well...

757
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,643
I can't go there right away.

758
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,446
Just come.

759
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,881
Pardon?

760
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,017
I won't move an inch until you come.

761
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,553
Just come

762
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,188
right away.

763
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,862
Gal-hee. Jung-hee.

764
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:38,568
Nam-hee, the play was great.
Take care of Jung-hee.

765
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,139
-Jeong Gal-hee!
-Jeong Gal-hee!

766
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,917
Mr. Do.

767
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,510
Why did you want to see me?

768
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:56,846
Well, it's...

769
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,619
I...

770
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,687
You know what?

771
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,125
After firing you like that,

772
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,862
I couldn't get over you staying here.

773
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,332
So I thought
about all sorts of weird things

774
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,568
like going to Cuba or learning salsa.

775
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,005
When you left after working one extra day,

776
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,441
I thought that I should've asked you

777
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:26,976
to stay.

778
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,979
I wasn't happy
even after the board meeting ended well.

779
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,715
I was just sad about your absence.

780
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,386
So I couldn't even go back to my office.

781
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,223
Was it

782
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,393
easy for you

783
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:46,129
to get over me?

784
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,537
I asked you to put on the cardigan again

785
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:58,141
because I wanted to see you that way.

786
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,611
And I fired you

787
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,349
because that's

788
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,453
how much I loved you.

789
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,796
What

790
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,132
did you just say?

791
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,872
Did you say

792
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,209
that you love me?

793
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,015
Please say it again.

794
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,421
Is it love?

795
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,562
I love you.

796
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:06,609
I'm sorry that you've been

797
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,480
feeling so anxious.

798
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,382
I'd like to introduce myself again.

799
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,951
My name is Jeong Gal-hee.

800
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:51,321
I work for a great boss
who overlooks my mistakes.

801
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,288
I'm Do Min-ik.

802
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,724
The crazy guy who fell in love
with both sides of you.

803
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:56,893
The secretaries are doing this

804
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,561
because there's nothing else they can do.

805
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,096
I'm trying to make a plan,

806
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,831
and I need your help.

807
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,300
