1
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,943
What is it?

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,414
Why do I have to impersonate you?

3
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,648
Wait.

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,717
Ms. Park!

5
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,161
I'll make...

6
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:06,199
your boss CEO.

7
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,634
What?

8
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,136
Isn't it your ultimate goal?

9
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,806
To make your boss CEO.

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,949
If you manage to complete your mission
of impersonating me for a month,

11
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,618
I'll vote for your boss

12
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,421
at the CEO election of T&T Mobile

13
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,659
with my 100,000 stocks.

14
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,081
I know I sound crazy.

15
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,488
I'm not sure if I can describe
how I feel now.

16
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,958
But it's true that I liked Veronica Park.

17
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,962
And I did try to kiss you.

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,600
I like both you and her,

19
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,203
so I feel so pathetic and stupid.

20
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,273
I just hate myself.

21
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,208
Still,

22
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,312
I thought I should be dating
Veronica Park.

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,348
She's the one

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,551
I liked from the beginning.

25
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,853
But...

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,624
as I came running here, I realized

27
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,894
why I started

28
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,631
to have feelings for her
in the first place.

29
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,768
It was because she reminded me of you.

30
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:55,909
She was like you
when she massaged my hand.

31
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,448
And she reminded me of you
when she liked the instant coffee.

32
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,921
Her lips smiling at me

33
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,426
were like yours.

34
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,798
So...

35
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,870
this crazy guy has made up his mind.

36
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,509
I choose you. Jeong Gal-hee.

37
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,701
Now that you're not saying anything,

38
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,136
I feel nervous.

39
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,543
You know I can't read your face.

40
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,346
I can't see anything.

41
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,615
Mr. Do.

42
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,085
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,188
But can you

44
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,592
give me some time to think?

45
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:25,064
Sure. I understand you need time.

46
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,269
Yesterday, I just told you

47
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,105
that I couldn't get over Ms. Park.

48
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,175
And now, here I am, telling you things
like this. You must feel confused.

49
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,314
Take your time and think about it.

50
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,951
Go back in there and get some rest.

51
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,833
So...

52
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,136
Is your brother coming?

53
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,939
It would take him two days to get here.

54
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,077
I didn't even tell him that I got injured.

55
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,812
He thinks I'm working late.

56
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,149
Then are you staying here all alone
with a broken arm?

57
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,852
I will be discharged tomorrow.

58
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,788
I'll just wash up and go to bed.

59
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,973
Mr. Do, I'm really fine.

60
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,142
You can't wash up with a broken arm.

61
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,278
Give me your hand.

62
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,549
Your hand.

63
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,092
Then please wash my hand.

64
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,273
How do I wash your hand?

65
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,612
"Six steps of proper handwashing."

66
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:24,784
"Step one. Put your palms together
and rub against each other."

67
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,094
Well...

68
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,530
You're not going to try
all the six steps, are you?

69
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,465
Can't you see it?

70
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,734
It says you'll have 260,000 more germs

71
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,670
only in 3 hours if you don't
wash your hands properly.

72
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:50,610
"Step two, grasp your hands
together and rub them."

73
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,785
Can you make it quick?

74
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,520
Let's move onto step three.

75
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,322
"Put your palm on the back
of the other hand and rub them."

76
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,524
The back of your hand?

77
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,228
The hospital seems clean,
but it's a breeding ground for germs.

78
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,665
Besides, fine dust is
a serious issue these days.

79
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,368
It's very important for us
to wash hands properly nowadays.

80
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,872
"Step four, rub your thumb

81
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:23,876
against the palm of the other hand."

82
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,814
"Step five, put your palms together,

83
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,250
interlock your fingers, and rub them."

84
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,935
Well...

85
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,806
I know I don't seem like someone
you can trust.

86
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:59,245
So even if you tell me
that you don't like me,

87
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,981
I would have nothing to say.

88
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,650
Actually, no.

89
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,153
Don't say that you don't like me.

90
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,424
I'll give you as much time as you want.

91
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,092
Mr. Do.

92
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,561
We can talk about it later--

93
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,799
Even if you turn me down,

94
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,635
there's nothing I can do.

95
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,971
No.

96
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,507
Please don't turn me down.

97
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,876
Gal-hee, you are

98
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,513
such a positive person.

99
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,351
Right?

100
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,326
You don't have to try step six.
You should go.

101
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,863
I think that was enough
to kill all the germs.

102
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,902
Here.

103
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,278
People do this
when someone hurts his or her arm.

104
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,578
VERONICA PARK

105
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:48,854
Did something happen?

106
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,223
Six, four, two, one.

107
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,661
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message

108
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,396
-after the beep.
-Why is the phone turned off?

109
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,666
No way.

110
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,736
He can't still be waiting for me.

111
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,905
Ok-sun!

112
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,844
Let me change my name!

113
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,247
Are you all right?

114
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,051
I hurt my heck. It means I'm almost fine.

115
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,986
What?

116
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,722
I will never have to bow
to others my whole life.

117
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,026
Keeping it straight like this
just suits my character.

118
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,861
It feels somewhat comfortable...

119
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,630
Is this my bag?

120
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,998
Oh, right.

121
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,899
Secretary Park asked me
to give this to you.

122
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,436
Hey, something kept ringing in your bag.

123
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,905
GI DAE-JU
29 MISSED CALLS

124
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,708
Did something happen to you?

125
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,646
Please give me a call when you can.
I'll be waiting.

126
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,182
You saw me doing fine.
You should go home now

127
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,451
Ok-sun! Ok-sun...

128
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,819
Hey!

129
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,768
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

130
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,408
Did you get hurt?

131
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,777
Why are you still here?

132
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,245
What happened?

133
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,580
There was a car accident.

134
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,282
It's not serious though.

135
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,885
I'll be fine if I wear this
for a few days.

136
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,155
By the way,

137
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,324
if someone doesn't show up for five hours,

138
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,760
you should just curse
the person and leave.

139
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,996
Don't be silly and wait the whole time.

140
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,399
Look who's talking. When you're hurt,

141
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,768
you should get some rest

142
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,504
whether someone's waiting for you or not.

143
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,240
You're way too nice.

144
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,309
Don't come running like this again.

145
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,341
You said you'd make your choice by today.

146
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,710
Min-ik or me?

147
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,714
That's too bad.

148
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,718
I've been going back and forth on it,

149
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,287
so I can't really decide.

150
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,956
Will you please make it quick?

151
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,825
It bothers me that I have to keep
secrets from my friend.

152
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,862
And things like this keep happening
every time we meet.

153
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,698
It weighs on my mind.

154
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,602
Okay.

155
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,706
Then...

156
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,315
I don't think it's Do Min-ik.

157
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,158
Wrong.

158
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,660
And it's not you.

159
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,862
Bye, then.

160
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,231
It's not me?

161
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,834
Are you leaving now?

162
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,336
I told you.

163
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,707
I always say hi, but never say bye.

164
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,343
But still,

165
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,881
I thought you had feelings for me.

166
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,249
Was I mistaken?

167
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,384
I like it

168
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,621
that you're not intimidated by me.

169
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:47,359
And I'm grateful that you foolishly
waited for me for five hours.

170
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,397
On top of that, I admire how well you
turned out growing up without parents.

171
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,832
I respect you.

172
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,501
But there's one thing
I don't like about you.

173
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,369
What is it?

174
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,706
That you're way too chaste.

175
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,679
Now you will like everything about me.

176
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,784
Ms. Lee, how long do we have to wait?

177
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,621
Is Gal-hee really coming?

178
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,125
Ms. Lee, I got into a car accident.

179
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,294
I don't think I can make it
to the gathering today.

180
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,397
I'm just slightly injured,
so you don't have to worry.

181
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,866
I'll call you tomorrow.

182
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,235
She got into an accident on the way here.

183
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,370
What?

184
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,039
Fortunately, it's not so serious.

185
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,378
I was going to make her join us today.

186
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,648
Why? Is something wrong?

187
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,622
Actually, there's something

188
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,293
I've been trying to tell you guys.

189
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,567
How would I tell her?

190
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,304
Jeong Gal-hee.

191
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,511
You're here.

192
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,018
Where's your boss? Did he leave?

193
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,755
I have something to tell you, Ms. Park.

194
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,157
Do you need money?

195
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,428
I told you I'd pay for your hospital bill.

196
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,929
Mr. Do said...

197
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,766
he likes me.

198
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,668
Not you, Veronica Park.

199
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,938
He chose me, Jeong Gal-hee over you.

200
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,613
My neck.

201
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,949
Why am I feeling excited?

202
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,785
Thank you for being happy
for me, Ms. Park.

203
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,656
Actually, this is my first time

204
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,992
to hear that someone likes me.

205
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,728
How did it feel? Did you like it?
Were you happy?

206
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,696
"I started to have feelings
for Veronica Park

207
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,865
because she reminded me of you."

208
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,400
He said that.

209
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,037
I wasn't even sure
if I hurt my arm or my heart.

210
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,473
My heart was fluttering,

211
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,241
and I felt like throwing up.

212
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,377
I even felt dizzy.

213
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,345
Me too.

214
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:56,382
He said, "Now you will like everything
about me."

215
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,084
Then a salmon that goes up
the river got into my mouth...

216
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,621
What?

217
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,758
I'll just write the rest down in my diary.

218
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,426
Just continue.

219
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,294
So...

220
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,530
I made up my mind.

221
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,168
About your offer
that you'd make Mr. Do CEO.

222
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,737
I refuse it.

223
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,372
You don't want him to be CEO?

224
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,508
Of course I do.

225
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,243
But I believe

226
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,845
Mr. Do will be able

227
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,215
to make it on his own
without anyone's help.

228
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,517
What if

229
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,387
he doesn't forgive you?

230
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,558
Even if that happens,

231
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,596
I think I should tell Mr. Do the truth

232
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,667
and apologize to him about what I've done
before anything else.

233
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,536
Okay.

234
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,943
Good luck.

235
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,379
Thank you.

236
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,848
Thank you, Ms. Park.

237
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,719
Then can I talk to Mr. Do tomorrow?

238
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,988
Let's do this.

239
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:15,094
Let me dump him first.

240
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,529
-Will you?
-We had a deal.

241
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,733
If my relationship
with Mr. Gi Dae-ju gets serious,

242
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:26,004
I will end things with your boss myself.

243
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,873
Are you going to be okay?

244
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,143
At 6 p.m. tomorrow evening.

245
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,848
Once I, Veronica Park, have it out
with Ms. Park Seok-ja,

246
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,017
you, Veronica Park, will

247
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,221
come clean afterward.

248
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,264
Let's meet alive.

249
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,199
Okay.

250
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,576
I should've told you sooner.

251
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,880
The reason I couldn't do it...

252
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,419
Right.

253
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,955
Because I had feelings for him.

254
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,091
I should be honest.

255
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,293
Before I knew it,

256
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,763
I came to like you, so...

257
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,369
What? It's Mr. Do.

258
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,543
I haven't told him yet.
Shall I answer the phone?

259
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,893
Hello?

260
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,996
Well... Were you asleep?

261
00:19:58,497 --> 00:19:59,631
Not yet.

262
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,501
What's the matter?

263
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,005
Well... I mean...

264
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:11,577
I know how it feels to be alone
in the hospital because I've been there.

265
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,514
At night, the place makes me

266
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,719
feel somewhat lonely and forlorn.

267
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,523
I thought that having a conversation
with me might help.

268
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,091
I'm

269
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,661
not used to things like this.

270
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,230
If you don't like talking on the phone,

271
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,235
I can come over to the hospital again.

272
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,270
Gosh, no.

273
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,838
No?

274
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,575
Well... Actually, I really

275
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,079
didn't mean that I'd go there.

276
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,349
It's just a figure of speech.

277
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,656
-Mr. Do.
-Yes?

278
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,460
Mr. Do?

279
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,629
What?

280
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,500
You're not lying, are you?

281
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,937
You like me, not Ms. Park.

282
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,440
And you called me
so I wouldn't feel lonely.

283
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,410
You really mean that, right?

284
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,878
Why?

285
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,281
Do you think I'm lying?

286
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,486
Yes. It feels like a lie.

287
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,157
I've spent my whole life worrying about

288
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,092
and taking care of others.

289
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,497
Having someone like me
and worry about me...

290
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,033
It never happened to me.

291
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,038
I'll do all that from now on.

292
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,907
I'll worry about you,

293
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,077
and like you.

294
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,814
I will make your coffee as well.

295
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,620
Now that you say that,

296
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,589
I feel really nervous.

297
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,391
Well...

298
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,694
I should go to sleep.

299
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,595
You should get some sleep too.

300
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,364
Okay.

301
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,900
Take good care of yourself. Goodnight.

302
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,006
Why is she feeling nervous?

303
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,843
Is she afraid I wouldn't break up
with Veronica Park?

304
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:30,515
All right then. I should hurry
and end things with her first.

305
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,152
ARE YOU FEELING BETTER?

306
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,454
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU

307
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,680
Are you feeling well?

308
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,582
I have something to tell you.

309
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,084
Can I see you tomorrow for a moment?

310
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,223
He will be very surprised.

311
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,031
I heard you came by.

312
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,971
I will be discharged tomorrow.
How about Seoul Park at eight?

313
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,306
I have something to tell you too.

314
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,369
So Ms. Lee's plan is

315
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,337
to have Gal-hee join us.

316
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,608
But Gal-hee is not coming to work now.
What do we do now?

317
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,345
Why did she have to get hurt
at a time like this?

318
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,081
It would've been nice
if she could spy on Mr. Do for us.

319
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,316
Excuse me.

320
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,852
Gosh, I'm startled.

321
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,222
Mr. Do.

322
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:21,026
Would you please tell me
how to make coffee?

323
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,194
-What?
-Pardon?

324
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,029
Why would you want to know that?

325
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,131
Once Gal-hee is back,
she will do it for you.

326
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,499
It's not like Ms. Jeong...

327
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,701
is here to make coffee.

328
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,837
I mean, I was just...

329
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,239
Why are you yelling at me?

330
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,107
Ms. Jeong hurt her arm.

331
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,677
She needs to get a good rest.

332
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,180
I'm a man in my mid-30s. I should be able

333
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,449
to make my own coffee.

334
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,486
Who knows? I might

335
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,622
want to make coffee for someone else.

336
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,791
I'll show you how.

337
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,226
Here.

338
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,097
Turn the power on first.

339
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,665
Once it blinks...

340
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,901
What is Ms. Lee going to do now?

341
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,604
I bet she has plans.

342
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,545
The thing is,

343
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,615
I really feel sorry about my daughter.

344
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,284
Is something wrong?

345
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,287
You rarely came to see me these days.

346
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,189
I don't have good feelings about this.

347
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,958
So I told Min-ik to go to see Ms. Park.

348
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,594
What did he say? Did they meet?

349
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,396
I haven't heard from him since then.

350
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:39,170
Chairwoman Sim, why don't you have
dinner with me tonight?

351
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:40,539
Dinner?

352
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,356
Yes, Mom.

353
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,225
If you don't have plans tonight,

354
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,761
will you have dinner with me?

355
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,262
What?

356
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,432
Alone with you?

357
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,534
Why? Don't you like it?

358
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,605
I just think this is the first time.

359
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,274
I do have an appointment tonight,

360
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,278
but I think I can make it.
I'll see you there.

361
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:30,455
If you hear me scream in there,
come running in three seconds.

362
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,725
And have an ambulance ready
in front of the hotel.

363
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,093
Yes, Ms. Park.

364
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,579
Are you here to show me
that you can drink a lot?

365
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,715
What are you doing without eating?

366
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,327
You'd better drink it
before I say anything.

367
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,296
In about ten minutes,

368
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,633
you will want to drink anyway.

369
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,403
If you don't want to break
your body part in about 15 minutes,

370
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:19,704
you'd better stop.

371
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,940
Mother.

372
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,243
I, Veronica Park,

373
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:29,581
will now make an important announcement.

374
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,484
I, Veronica Park...

375
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,685
What?

376
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:38,089
I, Veronica Park...

377
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,627
-am seeing someone--
-Ms. Park.

378
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,264
Gosh, look who's here.

379
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,365
My goodness.

380
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,200
Chairwoman Sim.

381
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,836
What are you doing here?

382
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,074
I just came to have dinner with my son,

383
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,643
and I heard you were here.

384
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,714
I heard you got hurt.
Are you all right, Ms. Park?

385
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,718
Ms. Park?

386
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,587
Go ahead and say hello to Chairwoman Park.

387
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,789
Okay.

388
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,891
Hello.

389
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,263
Hello, Ms. Park.

390
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,999
Yes.

391
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,735
Please have a seat, Chairwoman Sim.

392
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,504
You're here to have dinner with your son.

393
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,740
We can have dinner together.

394
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,941
Shall we?

395
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:31,776
Well...

396
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,613
Actually, I have something
to tell Ms. Park.

397
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,183
If you please excuse us, can we go out

398
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,751
and have a talk by ourselves?

399
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,323
Why? Did my daughter
cause some trouble again?

400
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,793
No, she didn't. It's me...

401
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,732
You wench. What did you do?

402
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:55,333
Why are you trying to stop him speaking?

403
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,770
You know what? No matter what it is,

404
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,206
I'm going to make
at least one thing happen today.

405
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,075
If she did something wrong
like she did last time,

406
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,910
I will teach her a lesson.

407
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,547
If not, I will set a date.

408
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:13,284
If you have something to say,
you should spit it out here.

409
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,090
Your food is ready.

410
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,859
Okay.

411
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,795
Gosh, Chairwoman Park.

412
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,232
Ms. Park isn't someone
who would cause trouble.

413
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,267
Please calm down.

414
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,870
The four of us have
never gotten together before.

415
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,806
Let's sit down and eat first.

416
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,452
Hello, Nam-hee. I just wired the money.

417
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,022
Hey, it wouldn't kill you
to send the money a little late.

418
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,526
Why do you always have to be so punctual?
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

419
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,494
I sent some extra money this month.

420
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,430
Now that you're in the States,
you should eat some steak and stuff.

421
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,968
Make sure not to get sick or hurt.

422
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,805
You're the one who should eat well.

423
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,907
Why do you sound so horrible?

424
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,475
Is something wrong?

425
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,278
Hey, Jeong Nam-hee.
Come over here and wipe this.

426
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,446
I'm sorry, but I have to go
and attend a class.

427
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,216
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

428
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:19,584
I'm coming.

429
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,090
Hello.

430
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,093
What kind of hairstyle would you like?

431
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,297
I just want to look neat.

432
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,300
I have an important appointment today.

433
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,835
Please wait a moment.

434
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:41,272
Mom.

435
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,709
I guess this is my last time
to look like this.

436
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,147
What if...

437
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,586
Mr. Do doesn't forgive me?
What should I do?

438
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,554
Gal-hee.

439
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:01,092
You'll never find heaven if you run away.

440
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,928
You remember how miserable it was

441
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,098
to live as someone else and not yourself.

442
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,534
It was hellish.

443
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:17,442
Just calm down
and tell him how you're feeling.

444
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,143
Then...

445
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,313
he will understand you.

446
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,398
You're so talkative

447
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,735
that you even started talking so early
when you were a baby.

448
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,704
But why are you being so quiet now?

449
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,777
My neck hurts.

450
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,513
Is it that bad?

451
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,417
When I heard you got into an accident
on your way to the concert to see me,

452
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,819
I felt really bad.

453
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:02,987
"Concert"?

454
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:06,257
Your secretary said you had an accident
on your way to a preview.

455
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,493
I was going to stop by...

456
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,596
If your voice is not coming out,

457
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:15,500
I can make a hole
in your throat with this.

458
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,876
Well... I was going to go to the preview

459
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,679
after the concert.

460
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,552
Is it because you hurt your neck?
Your voice sounds a little weird.

461
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,096
Code blue. Your boss is with me now...

462
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,099
Mom.

463
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,269
Do you want me to break

464
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,004
your fingers too?

465
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,174
Have some manners
when you eat with your elders.

466
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,812
I understand. She's a businesswoman.

467
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,447
Where did it go?

468
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,782
Let me try calling you.

469
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:11,656
No. Stop it.

470
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,327
BOSS

471
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,132
It's not ringing.

472
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,600
Stop it.

473
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,573
Don't bother, Mr. Do.

474
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,744
Please don't do that, Mom.

475
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,413
I guess I put it on silent...

476
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,088
Isn't it 9013?

477
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,092
Isn't it your phone number?

478
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,694
It's 8618.

479
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,498
You know me.

480
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:57,835
I'm Veronica Park.
I use more than ten phones.

481
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,303
What are you talking about?

482
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,439
I have all your numbers.

483
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,342
Look. Ok-sun number one,
Ok-sun number two, Ok-sun number three.

484
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,643
Mom.

485
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,480
Mr. Do is not eating because of us.

486
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,821
Please eat this. And have some of this.

487
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,831
Please enjoy.

488
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,872
These are peanuts.

489
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,208
Right. Don't you like peanuts?

490
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,311
Spit it out.

491
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,880
Did you spit it all out? Rinse your mouth

492
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:44,115
with this. Hurry.

493
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,017
What's wrong?

494
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,018
Peanut.

495
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,790
Well...

496
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,056
I guess you like peanuts very much.

497
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,742
Gosh, Min-ik! My gosh...

498
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,178
Why is he being so rude?

499
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,649
Go to him.

500
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,966
Mr. Do Min-ik, are you all right?

501
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,842
Mr. Do Min-ik.

502
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,913
Do you have an upset stomach?

503
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,048
What was wrong?

504
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,117
Well...

505
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,219
I think we need to talk.

506
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,620
What if I have an upset stomach?

507
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,621
What?

508
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,857
What will you do
if I have an upset stomach?

509
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,259
What am I supposed to do?

510
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,998
Actually, I have an ambulance ready
in front of the hotel.

511
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,600
Do you want to go to the hospital?

512
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,975
Can you massage my hand?

513
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,109
What?

514
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,921
Does this work?

515
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,595
"Go down. Go down."

516
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:14,031
"It shall go down as if there's
sesame oil in your stomach."

517
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:19,103
"Stop bothering my girl
and go down immediately."

518
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,610
Who are you?

519
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,081
Well...

520
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,018
Let me tell you who I am.

521
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,992
VERONICA PARK

522
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,574
I'm sorry I couldn't pick up.

523
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,809
I'm in front of the carousel now.

524
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,344
Where are you?

525
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:01,946
So...

526
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,849
You are now

527
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,653
in front of the carousel.

528
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,756
Mr. Do Min-ik, let me explain.

529
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,957
No.

530
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:15,326
I'll be

531
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,430
right there.

532
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,106
Mr. Do Min-ik!

533
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,243
Gosh, what do I do?

534
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,312
MR. DO, I'M REALLY SORRY
I DIDN'T MEANT TO LIE TO YOU

535
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,681
"I didn't mean to lie to you.

536
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:40,685
But before I knew it, I came to like you.

537
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,187
And I wanted to keep seeing you.

538
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,790
I wanted to keep seeing you..."

539
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,102
Gal-hee, don't be nervous.
Just take it slow.

540
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,573
Just do as you practiced.
With all your heart.

541
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,377
Mr. Do.

542
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,857
Your neck...

543
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,860
Did you eat peanuts?

544
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,532
Are you...

545
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,835
Veronica Park?

546
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,428
How did you know I'm allergic to peanuts?

547
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,562
Your secretary.

548
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,665
Your secretary told me.

549
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,004
I thought you were Veronica.

550
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,806
I'm your secretary, Ms. Jeong.

551
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:12,276
What if I'm deceiving you too?

552
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,415
What if there's something
I'm lying to you about?

553
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,384
A bandage like this is not common, is it?

554
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,522
It's number 99. I'm sure
it's Veronica Park's key.

555
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,063
Why are these here?

556
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,267
Ms. Jeong.

557
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:38,702
Is it you?

558
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,544
Mr. Do, the thing is...

559
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,745
It's not you, right?

560
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,882
It's not.

561
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,820
I met that woman so many times.

562
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,756
During all those times I spent with her,

563
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,628
you've been lying to me?

564
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,935
That's impossible.

565
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,271
It can't be right.

566
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,274
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

567
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,811
I'm so sorry.

568
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:25,783
Why?

569
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,987
Why did you do it?

570
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,591
Why did you do this to me?

571
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,761
I didn't mean to do that.

572
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,432
Ms. Park was coming late,

573
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:45,402
and the food looked so delicious.

574
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:48,639
At first, it was a joke.

575
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,807
"A joke"?

576
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,050
I find the illness devastating.

577
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:06,223
But was it just a joke to you?

578
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,826
No, that's not what I meant.

579
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,730
I'm sorry.

580
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,534
I'm really sorry, Mr. Do.

581
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,603
It must've been fun.

582
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,740
What?

583
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,708
Your boss can't see people's faces.

584
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,077
So you pretended to be a secretary by day

585
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,547
and be someone else at night.

586
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,016
I bossed you around at work,

587
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,151
but I fell for you

588
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,320
and begged you to be with me.

589
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,793
It must've been fun for you

590
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,263
to see me hopelessly in love.

591
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,831
No.

592
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,302
It wasn't fun at all.

593
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,404
I had no idea. I thought I was crazy,

594
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,039
so I even got a CT scan.

595
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,608
And I blamed my dead father.

596
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,812
You know why I didn't
trust my secretaries.

597
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,981
I even said

598
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,718
I'd never trust anyone again
if you deceived me.

599
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,723
How could you do this to me?

600
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,193
I'm sorry.

601
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,664
I'm sorry...

602
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,404
Mr. Do.

603
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,673
Let go of me.

604
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,286
Did you not hear me?

605
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,527
I understand you hate me.

606
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,530
I know I've wronged you.

607
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,401
But please take this before going to bed.

608
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:29,433
What were you thinking?

609
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,701
You just ran out like that

610
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,603
and didn't even answer the phone.

611
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,305
Why does Ms. Park want
to cancel the wedding?

612
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,608
Did you not hear me?

613
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:38,909
Min-ik!

614
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,678
Do Min-ik!

615
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,278
How did it go? Did you tell him?

616
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:22,913
Did he forgive you?

617
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,117
I couldn't say anything.

618
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,054
As I saw

619
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,625
his angry face,

620
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:42,966
I was so afraid and scared.
I felt so guilty.

621
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:48,272
I forgot all about the words I prepared.

622
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:52,376
I just said

623
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,078
I'm sorry.

624
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,315
That's all I could say.

625
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,153
You practiced it all night.

626
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:08,659
He was even more hurt than when
he realized he couldn't recognize faces.

627
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,564
But I...

628
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,070
I didn't even think how it'd feel like

629
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,339
to be deceived by someone like me.

630
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,575
I just...

631
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,715
I was just excited that Mr. Do liked me.

632
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,953
I just felt like
I was on top of the world.

633
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,569
I wanted to help him,
but ended up breaking his heart.

634
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:57,374
What do I do, Mom?

635
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:02,579
What should I do now?

636
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,619
Mr. Do Min-ik.

637
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,195
Do you have prosopagnosia or what?

638
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,298
I'm a cop.

639
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,266
-A cop?
-Oh, okay.

640
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:00,837
How may I help you?

641
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,106
Did you find Eun Jeong-su?

642
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:06,343
No, this isn't about Eun Jeong-su.
We're here to meet Gi Dae-ju.

643
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,544
Dae-ju?

644
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,950
Yes, Boss. I have something
to report to you.

645
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,359
-Mr. Eun.
-We checked the security camera footage

646
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,594
from the convenience store just in case.

647
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:27,998
The last person Eun Jeong-su met
before he disappeared was...

648
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,302
Gi Dae-ju.

649
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:42,312
Why? Do you still think
we're suspecting an innocent person?

650
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,182
Dae-ju?

651
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,384
This was at 11:53 p.m.

652
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:51,021
It means he was already there
when you arrived.

653
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:54,358
Are you for his resignation or against it?

654
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,529
I'm in favor.

655
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,598
PENNSYLVANIA, GI DAE-JU

656
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,799
"Dae-ju"?

657
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,603
Why is Dae-ju's name on this file?

658
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,577
Mr. Do Min Ik.

659
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,779
Where is Gi Dae-ju now?

660
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,450
Well... I'm sorry,

661
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,054
but can I talk to him first?

662
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,238
Why are you staring at me like that?
It makes me feel shy.

663
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,111
All right.

664
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,481
I thought we should settle
the girl issues first.

665
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,483
Eun Jeong-su.

666
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,752
What?

667
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,187
How do you know him?

668
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,524
Why are you asking that?

669
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,527
I asked how you know him.

670
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,631
Actually, I was going to tell you this.

671
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:11,034
You heard it from Mr. Sim, right?

672
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,336
Mr. Eun used to be his driver.

673
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,539
What?

674
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,907
Well...

675
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,976
I think I need to find a driver.

676
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,178
That's good.

677
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,448
The father of my former driver
passed away,

678
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,983
so I'm attending his funeral.
I'll find one there.

679
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:28,685
Do you remember that?

680
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,888
You asked me to find
a driver for you urgently.

681
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,023
Mr. Park.

682
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,426
Do you know any driver
who can start working immediately?

683
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,664
Min-ik is urgently looking for a driver.

684
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,134
I don't know. Is there anyone good?

685
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:48,171
Everyone I know is employed now.

686
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,475
Well...

687
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,913
I met Mr. Eun at the funeral that day.

688
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,551
He once woke me up and asked me to pick
him up in the middle of the night...

689
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:04,588
You know your uncle.
He just fires drivers easily.

690
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,324
He sounded frustrated,

691
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,559
and he said he was looking for a job.

692
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,995
It's not easy to find a new job.

693
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,265
Director Do Min-ik of our company
is looking for a driver.

694
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,200
Would you feel uncomfortable
working for him?

695
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,771
Not at all. I'd be grateful.

696
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,406
But...

697
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,510
could you not tell him

698
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,578
that I used to work for Mr. Sim?

699
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,514
They are family.

700
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,251
He wouldn't feel comfortable
about hiring me.

701
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,319
That's why I didn't tell you sooner.

702
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:38,722
We ran into each other at work
from time to time.

703
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,690
And we just said hello.

704
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:41,958
Did you meet him?

705
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,628
Yes, I met him just now.

706
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,329
So what about Mr. Eun?

707
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,198
Are you sure that's it?

708
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,000
Should there be something else?

709
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,835
When you went to the funeral,

710
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,905
why did you meet him
at the convenience store?

711
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,641
Did you put a tail on me or something?

712
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,676
I asked why.

713
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,013
I just ran into him.

714
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,515
I went there to buy socks.
I met Mr. Choe, Mr. Park,

715
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,083
and everyone there.

716
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,753
I met all the employees
who came to buy cigarettes there.

717
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,022
Does it upset you that much?

718
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,224
You really don't know?

719
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,060
The day I had the accident there,

720
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,429
the guy who stabbed me...

721
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,998
is Eun Jeong-su.

722
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:27,837
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.

723
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,974
The accident happened
even before I met Mr. Eun.

724
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,477
Are you saying Mr. Eun met me
at the funeral after trying to kill you

725
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,680
and got a job as your driver?

726
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,982
Do you think it makes sense?

727
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,483
What if it's not that

728
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:44,254
you met Mr. Eun
for the first time at the funeral?

729
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,555
What?

730
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:47,991
What if you had known him the whole time?

731
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,427
I told you.

732
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,430
I just happened borrow his phone that day.

733
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,598
Thank you.

734
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,500
It was so dark
that I couldn't even see his face.

735
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,136
So...

736
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,305
are you...

737
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,408
suspecting me now?

738
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:13,116
Is that why you called the police?

739
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,723
Darn it.

740
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,159
Actually, there's one thing
I lied to you about.

741
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:26,563
On your seventh birthday, the boat...

742
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,133
Here. Take it.

743
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,136
I'm sick of it now.

744
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:34,371
Really?

745
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,607
I wasn't sick of it at all.

746
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,310
I wanted to play with it every day.

747
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,480
But you seemed to like it.

748
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:48,351
I thought you wanted it,
so I lied that I was sick of it.

749
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:52,822
I had no idea I'd hear something
like this after 20 years.

750
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,263
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

751
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,432
Would you go
to the police station with us?

752
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:03,633
Okay.

753
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:39,035
My gift is always too good for you, right?

754
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,570
EXCLUSIVE SCREENING RIGHTS CONTRACT

755
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:44,941
I believe this will make you CEO
with no problem, Mr. Do Min-ik.

756
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,646
Now that I've completed my mission,
I'm going to quit today.

757
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,414
Salute.

758
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,842
You're here, Boss.

759
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,611
MEDIA TEAM 1
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

760
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,252
Hello, Mr. Do.

761
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,597
Did you take the pills?

762
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,333
I made an appointment

763
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,437
with Dr. Gu this afternoon just in case.

764
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,447
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

765
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,716
That's all I can tell you.

766
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,553
I don't know what else to say.

767
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,857
I know how you feel better than anyone.

768
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,598
Do you know what it is like

769
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:52,001
not to be able to see faces?

770
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,973
It feels like a sign of a person
is turned off.

771
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,543
I have to see, but I can't.

772
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,514
I have to read,

773
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,685
but I can't read.

774
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:14,023
It makes you doubt the friend you trust.

775
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,759
And it makes you trust
someone who tries to harm you.

776
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,363
Sometimes,

777
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,367
I'm not even sure who I am.

778
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,506
And to me...

779
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:32,675
To me,

780
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,448
you, Jeong Gal-hee,

781
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,752
were the only person I could see.

782
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,931
You know what happens when the trust

783
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,303
between a boss and a secretary breaks.

784
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,943
Jeong Gal-hee.

785
00:59:10,813 --> 00:59:11,948
You're fired.

786
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,883
Mr. Do. It's me, Ms. Jeong.

787
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,085
Do you not know what "fired" means?

788
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,921
Go back. You don't belong here anymore.

789
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,290
But there's one thing you should know.

790
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,927
When you told her about your feelings,
she was incredibly happy.

791
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:58,861
What's this?

792
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,297
Find out who the involved secretaries are.
I'll fire them all.

793
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:04,701
Mr. Do Min-ik is suffering
from a serious illness.

794
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,804
