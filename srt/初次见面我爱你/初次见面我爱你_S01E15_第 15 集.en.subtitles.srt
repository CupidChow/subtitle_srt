1
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,775
You didn't have to.

2
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,528
Armand de Brignac Blanc de Blancs.

3
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,331
It's the wine you always ordered for me
but never got to drink yourself.

4
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,734
Today, I ordered it for you.

5
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,993
I'd like to introduce myself again.

6
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,665
My name is Jeong Gal-hee.

7
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,501
Dad passed away when I was 12,

8
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,870
and Mom passed away when I was 19.

9
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,274
I have no money or parents.
I have nothing.

10
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,778
But I have a big brother and
a little sister, who always root for me.

11
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,015
At work, I have amazing secretary friends.

12
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,653
And I work for a great boss

13
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,023
who overlooks my mistakes.

14
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,193
I see.

15
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,029
So that's who you are.

16
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,365
As you already know,

17
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,601
I'm Do Min-ik.

18
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,672
The crazy guy who fell in love
with both sides of you.

19
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,312
Shall we make a toast?

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,848
To what?

21
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,318
To our first encounter

22
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,021
as Jeong Gal-hee and Do Min-ik.

23
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,603
I don't think they're from this floor.

24
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,605
-What happened?
-What's this?

25
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,040
A "breach of confidence"?

26
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,142
"T&T Mobile hereby announces

27
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,444
a disciplinary meeting
for all permanent employees

28
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,481
and dispatched workers
involved in the improper group, Euldoguk,

29
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,917
as well as the termination
of the dispatched workers' contracts."

30
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,253
No way.

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,489
"Mr. Gi and Ms. Lee will be punished
on the following grounds.

32
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,491
By establishing
the improper group, Euldoguk,

33
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,093
-Ms. Lee disturbed the order..."
-Hi, Ri-ra.

34
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,263
-"...while Mr. Gi cooperated with Ms. Lee.
-What?

35
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,233
-Also, dispatched workers in Euldoguk..."
-Darn it.

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,935
"Damaged the company's

37
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,304
reputation and credibility
by leaking company secrets.

38
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,372
The dispatched workers' contracts
are hereby terminated."

39
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,974
-Myeong-jeong.
-Hey.

40
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,176
What do we do now?

41
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,897
Guys, what are we supposed to do now?

42
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,766
If you don't cancel their dismissal,
I'll accuse you

43
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,236
of exchange of favors,
breach of trust, and bribery.

44
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,339
If a breach of trust was so easy to prove,

45
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,040
I wouldn't be in my position by now.

46
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,910
Regarding bribes, luckily,
you guys pocketed enough money

47
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,712
so that it'd be no problem.

48
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,382
If the law can't punish you,
we'll go to the press...

49
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,086
There are a ton of people

50
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,721
who have pocketed more money than I have.

51
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,191
Go ahead and try. Fine, I accepted
a few paintings and offered some money.

52
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,859
Who'd write about that?

53
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,063
It's got a stain.

54
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,164
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

55
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,037
Neither you nor I want the ledger
to be exposed.

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,839
Why don't we wrap it up here?

57
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,244
Be grateful that I'm not suing you
for embezzlement.

58
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,998
I'm sorry that you've been
feeling so anxious.

59
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,015
Gal-hee, can't you take the day off?

60
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,193
The weather is so nice. Let's go
on a picnic with Nam-hee or something.

61
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,099
On a beautiful, sunny day like this,

62
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,201
going on a picnic isn't what I want.

63
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,105
I want to go to work.

64
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,277
Baby, come to work with me.

65
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,115
Who is it?

66
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,290
Mr. Do, what are you doing here?

67
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,959
Who is he?

68
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,462
That's my little sister, Nam-hee.

69
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,164
Hello, I'm Do Min-ik.

70
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,967
Let me go and get my bag.

71
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,204
Do I look like I'm going to work?

72
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,240
Are you visiting somewhere?

73
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,411
We're going on a date. A date.

74
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,681
What's going on?
Are you going out with your boss?

75
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,815
A date?

76
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,652
What about work?

77
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,322
Take the day off.
You can tell your boss right now.

78
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,691
How...

79
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,128
Can I take the day off?

80
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,429
Yes, you can.

81
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,501
Why couldn't you tell me earlier?

82
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:46,205
My hair is a mess, and
I'm not even wearing any makeup.

83
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,941
Remember? Your boss

84
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,676
can't see people's faces.

85
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,112
Still,

86
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,782
this is our first date.

87
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,584
I would've loved to put on pretty clothes

88
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,187
for you.

89
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,291
I'll be waiting in the car.

90
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,193
Take your time.

91
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,628
Okay.

92
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,632
-Bye.
-Bye.

93
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,034
Mr. Do.

94
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,304
Well...

95
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,639
You look pretty.

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,341
You think so?

97
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,010
I just took off my glasses.

98
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,880
Why did you bring that cardigan though?

99
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,249
You could've worn anything you wanted.

100
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:08,187
You wanted to be able to recognize
at least one person in the world.

101
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,425
I feel the same. I want you
to be able to recognize me

102
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,595
no matter what.

103
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,034
Do you remember the concert
at the Center for Performing Arts

104
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,537
we were going to watch?

105
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,673
Why don't we see it today?

106
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,475
Sure. I'll book the tickets right away.

107
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,945
I already did.

108
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,816
I just wanted to know
if you'd like to see it.

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,584
Well...

110
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,388
Anything would be fun
as long as I doing it with you.

111
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,532
Please, Mr. Do.

112
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,777
Please, Ms. Jeong.

113
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,150
The car looks amazing.

114
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:16,322
By the way, where are you two headed?

115
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,060
Well, we're just...

116
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,896
Nam-hee, let them enjoy their date.

117
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,898
I apologize, Mr. Do.

118
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,234
Please don't mind us.

119
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,670
I hope you two have a great time.

120
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,881
Goodness. While perfectly healthy people
ride a nice car,

121
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,584
a blind man has to walk.

122
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,790
Oh, my. Isn't that sad?

123
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,496
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

124
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,899
Don't be.

125
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,402
They don't have a car.
We should, of course, give them a ride.

126
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,838
Where can I drop you off?

127
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,742
Can you drop us off at the nearest beach?

128
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,744
A beach?

129
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,046
We booked tickets for a concert.

130
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:15,815
Nam-hee, you know this, right?

131
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,018
The only luxury
a blind man like me can afford is

132
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,088
some fresh air.

133
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,857
That girl is blinded with love right now.

134
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,127
She wouldn't give a darn
about her blind brother.

135
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,030
Nam-hee, will you stop?

136
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,666
I can take you to the beach.

137
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,768
We don't have time to do that.

138
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,573
I've been looking forward
to our first date so much.

139
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,909
I really wanted us
to be by ourselves today.

140
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,846
First,

141
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,849
we'll drop them off at the beach.

142
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,585
And then we can be by ourselves.

143
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,955
We'll have grilled clams
like the last time

144
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,757
and go to a nice cafe.

145
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,362
That sounds good.

146
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,052
This feels so light.

147
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,758
Catch me if you can!

148
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,327
Jung-hee!

149
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,230
-Wait, Jung-hee!
-He said we'd be by ourselves.

150
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,873
-Jung-hee!
-Try and catch me!

151
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,646
I thought you said we'd be by ourselves.

152
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,116
I'm just worried
he'll fall into the water.

153
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,019
Let me hang out with him
just a little longer.

154
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,055
We can have dinner
by ourselves later, I promise.

155
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,257
This is it.

156
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,226
We can leave Jung-hee to Nam-hee.

157
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,861
-We should go now.
-Right now?

158
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,296
-Let's go!
-Wait.

159
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:53,372
You didn't have to wear high heels.

160
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,447
There you go.

161
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,052
May I ask you something?

162
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,621
I think I'm lost.

163
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,690
Can you help me find
my sister and her boyfriend?

164
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:16,095
They were around here a minute ago.

165
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,030
I lost them while playing tag.

166
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,988
Didn't you say
we'd have dinner by ourselves?

167
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,356
I mean...

168
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,893
He got hungry after running around.
What can we do about that?

169
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,831
Let him have some food first.

170
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,370
Jung-hee.

171
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,373
Are you sure you can't see?

172
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,010
How can you know exactly
where the meat is every time?

173
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:06,312
I'm not sure.

174
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,982
At this moment, it's as if I can see.

175
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,590
Are you done? Let's go.

176
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,592
Mr. Do.

177
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,329
Oh, okay.

178
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,432
Nam-hee. This is the first time

179
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,168
I've eaten Korean beef
since the 2010 World Cup.

180
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,302
What about you?

181
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,339
For me, this is the first time ever.

182
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,442
Until now, I only ate
US and Australian beef.

183
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,744
I didn't even know
Korea produced beef too.

184
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,113
I thought all meat was frozen.

185
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,048
I didn't know
you could buy fresh meat too.

186
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,151
Mr. Do, you know what?

187
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,288
My family wasn't affected
by the IMF crisis at all.

188
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,124
We were always poor.

189
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,898
Excuse me! Three more portions, please.

190
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,033
Coming up.

191
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,102
Mr. Do.

192
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,807
Well...

193
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,410
No. The moment you drink that,

194
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,414
we're trapped here forever.

195
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:18,851
Of course.

196
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,154
You probably get to enjoy
expensive liquors all the time.

197
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,490
You wouldn't care for soju
poured by a blind man.

198
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,627
I'll drink it.

199
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,179
BED AND BREAKFAST, WE HAVE VACANCIES

200
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,589
Do you expect me to let you stay here?

201
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,360
So why did you drink that soju?

202
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,128
You drank too.

203
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,535
I don't think this is a good idea.

204
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,638
Why don't we wait until I sober up

205
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,039
and go back to Seoul?

206
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,675
Why didn't you make a reservation
beforehand?

207
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,877
It's impossible to get rooms
this late around here.

208
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,780
Since he's a director and everything,

209
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,682
I thought he'd take us
to a six-star hotel.

210
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,219
You're the ones who changed
the destination all of a sudden.

211
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,123
I can't even tell whether
this is a six-star hotel or an inn.

212
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,993
Being blind sure comes in handy sometimes.

213
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,832
Maybe this is a good thing.

214
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,567
What?

215
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,370
Let's make those two go to sleep soon.

216
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,140
Then we can spend a long, long night

217
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,478
just the two of us.

218
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,757
If you're ready, shoot!

219
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,763
GWANGBAK BUILDING

220
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,266
You win Gwangbak Building
near Gangnam Station!

221
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,168
What are you doing?

222
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,237
The thing is,

223
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,907
in return for being such a dirty guy
for me last night,

224
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,678
I'd love to give you a little something.

225
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,415
But what could I possibly give you?

226
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,517
I have nothing but money and buildings.

227
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,687
So I decided to give you
one of my buildings as a present.

228
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,659
What I want is not the building,
but the owner of it.

229
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,064
Also, last night, I wasn't being
a dirty guy for you,

230
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,899
but for myself.

231
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,303
Wait, please don't be like that.

232
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,873
You're making me
want to give you even more.

233
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,543
What should I give you? What do you want?

234
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,279
You don't have a car, do you?
Should I get one for you?

235
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,848
Pick one. A sedan,
a sports car, or an SUV?

236
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,983
The very reason why I can be so dirty

237
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,220
happens to be my strong thighs,
trained by years of bike riding.

238
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,623
Are you sure about this?
Can you really give up on these thighs?

239
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,392
I can't.

240
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,495
Why do I become so stupid

241
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,997
when I'm with you?

242
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,544
Hi, Eul-wang.

243
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,779
It's a woman?

244
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,483
So that's what happened in the end.

245
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,420
Okay. I'll be right there.

246
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,656
Hello, Mr. Park.

247
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,993
I just sent you the press release
by e-mail.

248
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,528
Please take a look.

249
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,066
ONE-PERSON PROTEST
AGAINST UNFAIR DISMISSAL

250
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,070
It won't be easy, Eul-wang.

251
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,074
Mr. Sim dragged you into this just to hold
a disciplinary meeting against you.

252
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,842
You'll be fine.

253
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,878
It's not like you really were involved.

254
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,346
Ms. Lee!

255
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,184
Didn't I tell you to keep a distance
from me at work?

256
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,454
I'll stop you guys from getting fired
by all means--

257
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,589
-No.
-We'd rather get fired.

258
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,424
What?

259
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,728
Even if get to keep my job this time,
my contract will be over in three months.

260
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,063
Then I'll have to worry
about keeping my job again.

261
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,399
I don't want to live like this anymore.

262
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,068
They illegally sign a new contract
with a different agency every year.

263
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,572
That's because they don't want to hire
dispatched workers permanently.

264
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,807
Even if we get our jobs back,
our situation will be the same

265
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,476
unless this practice stops.

266
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,078
So are you going to
just give up like this?

267
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,246
No.

268
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:42,748
We'll fight.

269
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,483
Even if we get fired in the end,

270
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,552
we'd like to let people know
why we did this

271
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,322
so that employees like us
can be treated fairly in the future.

272
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,969
DISPATCHED WORKERS' FIGHT

273
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:10,943
FOR PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT

274
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,183
Ms. Jeong.

275
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,387
Yes, Mr. Do.

276
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,297
You're not supposed to fall asleep.

277
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,067
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

278
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,638
Why would you apologize?

279
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,975
You said we'd be by ourselves
once they fell asleep.

280
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,975
What are you doing outside so late?

281
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,411
I'm sorry, Mom,

282
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,614
for not telling you
about my condition earlier.

283
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:32,984
I'm not

284
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,888
going to feel sorry for you
just because you're sick.

285
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,291
So don't expect me to cut you any slack.

286
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,060
I want you to become the CEO
no matter what.

287
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,231
Of course.

288
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,269
You don't have to worry about that.
Just prepare some samgyetang for me.

289
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,605
Also,

290
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,974
someday,

291
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,245
I want us to visit a beach together
or something.

292
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,448
You, me,

293
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,051
and Uncle too if he wants.

294
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,624
All right. Goodnight.

295
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,798
You're up.

296
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,870
It seems we're

297
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,339
finally by ourselves.

298
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,208
I guess so.

299
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,748
What?

300
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,918
Nothing.

301
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,421
I just wish I could see it.

302
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,958
Dae-ju saw it, and so did Veronica Park.

303
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,327
I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.

304
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,363
The way you look at me.

305
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,598
I wish I could show it to you too.

306
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,736
How my face looks right now.

307
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,907
By the way, have I told you this?

308
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,476
I've seen

309
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,280
your face.

310
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,983
You've seen my face?
Including facial expressions?

311
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,452
Yes.

312
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,320
But the thing is,

313
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,791
it doesn't work every time.

314
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:25,597
It only happens when my blood pressure
suddenly goes up

315
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,999
and my heart starts racing.

316
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,937
Then how do you raise your blood pressure?

317
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,672
Well...

318
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,510
While compression stockings
didn't help at all,

319
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,580
when our bodies are touching,

320
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,650
it always seems to make my blood pressure

321
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,752
shoot up.

322
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,655
Strangely.

323
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,827
"When our bodies are touching"?

324
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,366
Like in front of the excavator that day,

325
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,536
when we were extremely close
to each other.

326
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,840
In that case,

327
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,410
what do we do?

328
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:19,885
Something like this?

329
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,426
Is it working?

330
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:30,729
Can you see my face?

331
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,163
No.

332
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,400
I can't see it at all.

333
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,937
Could it be that

334
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,074
more body parts should be touching?

335
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,112
How is it now?

336
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,082
That's strange.

337
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,117
Why isn't it working?

338
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,119
It seems like

339
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,556
hugging is

340
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,259
still not enough.

341
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,898
Then what are we supposed to do?

342
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,866
That'd be

343
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:44,803
up to you.

344
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,138
How much are you ready to do?

345
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,343
Well... I mean...

346
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,980
As long as it can make you see my face,

347
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,584
shouldn't we try everything we can?

348
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,688
"Everything we can"?

349
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,892
Just so you know,

350
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:13,765
my lips are here.

351
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,341
What are you thinking of?

352
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,945
I was just thinking of putting my arm

353
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,280
around you.

354
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,551
Oh, I see.

355
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,021
That's what you meant.

356
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,890
Now I know.

357
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,262
But don't you think that's a bit unusual?

358
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,898
You hold hands, hug,

359
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,267
and then put your arm around each other?

360
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,850
If I had opened my eyes at that moment,

361
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,553
would I have seen your face?

362
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,256
But at that moment,

363
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,126
I didn't want to open my eyes.

364
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,496
Your lips were what I longed for.

365
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,199
You were the one I wanted.

366
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,135
I could see that

367
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,705
even without opening my eyes.

368
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,074
DISPATCHED WORKERS ARE WORKERS TOO
PROTECT BASIC LABOR RIGHTS

369
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,209
Guys.

370
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,079
I'm all for fighting, but a hunger strike
isn't what I signed up for.

371
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,682
Why don't we shave our heads instead?

372
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,951
My hair may grow back,

373
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,187
but a skipped meal never comes back.

374
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,524
I'm putting this up now, so swallow that.

375
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,827
Right now!

376
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,333
HUNGER STRIKE, DAY 1

377
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,709
Should we go for dinner together
after work?

378
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,378
How about the restaurant
we went to the other day?

379
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,746
That sounds great.

380
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,119
STEP DOWN, EVIL CEO!

381
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,690
DISPATCHED WORKERS ARE WORKERS TOO
PROTECT BASIC LABOR RIGHTS

382
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,892
Ms. Lee.

383
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,697
What are you all

384
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,468
doing out here?

385
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,774
That sounds great.

386
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,354
Mr. Do.

387
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,327
It's Eun Jeong-su.

388
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,433
I'm here to apologize to you.

389
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,351
What do you take me for? A moron?

390
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:55,887
Hey! Do something!

391
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,822
As you can see,

392
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,860
I got badly injured at work,
but the company refused to acknowledge it.

393
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,897
It was Ms. Lee who paid me compensation.

394
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,099
I only went there to get the ledger.

395
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,768
I had no intention of harming you.

396
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,506
You heard it from Mr. Sim, right?

397
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,809
Mr. Eun used to be his driver.

398
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,380
So it was my uncle

399
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:24,782
who did that to you.

400
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,989
There he is.

401
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,959
They're police officers. I called them.

402
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,597
I know I can never be forgiven
for hurting you.

403
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,434
Still, I wanted to apologize
to you in person

404
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,503
before I turn myself in.

405
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,915
I sincerely apologize,

406
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,117
Mr. Do.

407
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,354
Give me your hands.

408
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,361
You have the right to remain silent
and consult an attorney.

409
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,631
Anything you say may be used
against you in court.

410
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,566
-Follow us.
-Come.

411
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,279
Are you saying

412
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,318
you knew Mr. Do couldn't recognize
people's faces from the beginning?

413
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,757
And you all have been pretending
all this time?

414
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:41,793
I'm sorry.

415
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,562
We heard only recently.

416
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,941
Mr. Do, it's Lee Eul-wang.

417
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,611
You met Mr. Eun, right?

418
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,322
I did something
I can never be forgiven for.

419
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,826
Please blame only me

420
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,095
and forgive the others.

421
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,868
Did you have to go that far?

422
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,606
I wanted to give them
a little compensation.

423
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,011
Dae-ju's mom died while trying
to save your father's fish.

424
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,714
Jeong-su was abused and
abandoned by your uncle.

425
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:41,819
If I hadn't done this,
no one would've compensated them.

426
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,354
Mr. Do.

427
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,506
Mr. Do.

428
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,846
What?

429
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,917
Are you going to tell me
to forgive them too?

430
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,489
No, I don't want to.

431
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,892
None of you know

432
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,630
how people's faces look to me.

433
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,001
Mr. Eun, who hurt me,

434
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,704
my uncle, who hurt Mr. Eun,

435
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,207
Ms. Lee, who came up with this,

436
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,443
and my father.

437
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:16,447
I resent them all.

438
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,550
I'll be angry at them
for the rest of my life.

439
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,352
Okay.

440
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:23,788
You can do that.

441
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,359
I'll resent them with you.

442
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,062
I'll be angry at them with you.

443
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,032
So you can resent them and be angry

444
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,603
for as long as you want.

445
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:10,668
We demand compensation from the company!

446
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,603
-We demand compensation!
-We demand compensation!

447
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,472
Hire dispatched workers permanently

448
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,307
and provide steady employment!

449
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,476
-Provide steady employment!
-Provide steady employment!

450
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,580
-Protect dispatched workers' rights!
-Hey.

451
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,617
What are you doing back here?
I thought you didn't want to see us again.

452
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,719
-Step down!
-Step down!

453
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,889
-We demand compensation...
-I'm sorry about earlier.

454
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,925
I got carried away.

455
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,228
We're the ones who should apologize.

456
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,666
If we'd known we'd get fired anyway,
we would've told you earlier.

457
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:45,269
Still, I'm happy you didn't get fired.

458
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,140
Did you say you signed a contract
directly with Mr. Do?

459
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,109
How long is the contract?

460
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,245
Well...

461
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,950
It says it's valid
until I wish to terminate it.

462
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,987
You're so lucky.

463
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,855
You'll never have to worry
about getting fired.

464
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,559
Come to think of it,
you've come such a long way.

465
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,395
It wasn't long ago that you made a scene,
saying you'd kill your boss,

466
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,931
after he fired you.

467
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,375
Hello, Mr. Do.

468
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,546
Dinner?

469
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,784
HUNGER STRIKE, DAY 1

470
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,454
Okay.

471
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:39,724
Go.

472
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,094
I know you hate keeping your boss waiting.

473
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,765
Go. Mr. Do must be devastated.

474
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,034
You should go and comfort him.

475
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,614
You're so lucky.

476
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,117
You'll never have to worry
about getting fired.

477
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,289
What's wrong?

478
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,457
You don't like the food?

479
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,026
I do.

480
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,863
Then...

481
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,568
try this.

482
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,309
Come to think of it,
you've come such a long way.

483
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,116
Why aren't you eating?

484
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,018
Well...

485
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,594
After saying I'd resent them
with you... I'm sorry.

486
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,665
It all started with that ledger.

487
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,401
I do hate the secretaries

488
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,838
and am angry at them for hurting you.

489
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,874
But after all,

490
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,044
I used to be the minion of T&T Mobile.

491
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,081
I could get fired anytime

492
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,883
and worried my contract
wouldn't be renewed every day.

493
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,852
When I got fired,

494
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,822
the other secretaries
got just as furious as I was.

495
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,059
Now they're all fired
and on hunger strike.

496
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,794
I can't...

497
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,001
I can't be eating here.

498
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,248
Go.

499
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,120
Pardon?

500
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,821
I can't forgive Eun Jeong-su

501
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,523
or any of the secretaries right now,
but...

502
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,626
I just wanted to have nice food with you.

503
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,195
I didn't come here to see you like this.

504
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,936
I'll stay here, hating you all.

505
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,271
You go there

506
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,007
and hate me.

507
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,486
Excuse me. Will you take a look at this?

508
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,188
-Thank you.
-Please sign our petition.

509
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,223
-Thank you.
-Sign our petition.

510
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,225
Hey.

511
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,094
I haven't been eating for hours,

512
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,929
and I'm starting to see things.

513
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,499
Is the girl running over here
Jeong Gal-hee?

514
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,474
I told you to be with your boss.
Why are you back here?

515
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,045
The thing is,

516
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,415
I've put on some weight and
been looking into weight loss camps.

517
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,318
But this would be perfect.

518
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:55,719
I don't even have to pay anything.

519
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,155
And I have friends
who will starve with me.

520
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,958
Hey, who says we're friends?

521
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,063
What can I do first?

522
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,233
Here.

523
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,269
Put this on and hand out our statements.

524
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,605
WE CONDEMN T&T MOBILE'S EVIL DEEDS

525
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,374
Goodness.

526
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:21,045
Hey, she can't even keep her boss waiting.

527
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,913
Do you expect her to criticize him?

528
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,349
You can give them back to us and leave.

529
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,084
We understand.

530
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,439
The number you have called
cannot be reached...

531
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,710
Why isn't she picking up her phone?

532
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,579
Could she be

533
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,349
still there?

534
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:03,554
Please sign our petition.

535
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,055

536
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,423
Please take this.

537
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:09,593
Excuse me. Please
take a look at this. Thank you.

538
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,997
Excuse me. Please take a look at this.

539
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,065
-Permanent employment!
-Permanent employment!

540
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,169
-Permanent employment!
-Permanent employment!

541
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:24,742
Mr. Do.

542
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,876
STEP DOWN, EVIL CEO!

543
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,282
Well...

544
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:35,686
Did you eat?

545
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,923
We're on a hunger strike.

546
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:43,761
Is that where you're going to sleep?

547
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,166
I'll spend the night here,

548
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,103
but tomorrow, I'll work as usual...

549
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

550
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,306
It's cold.

551
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,964
You're early.

552
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,401
Can you come in for a moment?

553
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,917
Ta-da.

554
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,223
Pig's trotters?

555
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,524
Come here.

556
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,868
While no one is watching,

557
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,837
eat some food
before you go out and protest.

558
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,741
I can't.

559
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,677
Don't be like that.

560
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:41,612
Have just one piece.

561
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,020
This is the second day
of the hunger strike. This is not okay.

562
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:51,989
The secretaries are

563
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,425
doing this

564
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:56,427
because there's nothing else they can do.

565
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,466
Don't go there.

566
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,901
Mr. Do.

567
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,104
I don't care if you shout

568
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:10,107
I should step down or die out there.

569
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,977
But I don't want you to stand there
all day without eating anything

570
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,280
or sleep under a cardboard box
in the cold.

571
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,249
I also don't want people on the street
to feel sorry for you

572
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:20,751
and whisper about you.

573
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,821
So

574
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,390
have just one piece.

575
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:32,863
Even when I'm

576
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,468
out protesting,

577
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,137
I can't stop feeling sorry for you

578
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,339
and thinking about you.
It's driving me crazy.

579
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,745
I want you to eat well.

580
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:49,546
You don't have to worry about me.

581
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,184
I promise I'll come back

582
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:57,454
strong and healthy after the protest.

583
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:05,496
HUNGER STRIKE, DAY 3

584
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,768
What do we do now?

585
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:14,772
None of the reporters who interviewed us
are writing any articles.

586
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,941
Mr. Sim won't bat an eye.

587
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,977
Guys, tear everything down!

588
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,011
-Yes!
-Yes!

589
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,347
If you're tired, go home and sleep!

590
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,649
-Why are you sleeping here?
-Get out of here!

591
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,152
-What are you doing? Stop!
-Get out!

592
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,020
No!

593
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,421
-Do as I say!
-Hurry up!

594
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,590
This isn't going to change anything.

595
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,526
-Let go.
-I feel sorry for you.

596
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,094
-I said let go!
-There's no point...

597
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,630
Who are you?

598
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,864
Mr. Do.

599
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,336
Well, I appreciate your hard work.

600
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,305
Who am I?

601
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:58,315
"Director of T&T Mobile Media Team One"?

602
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,684
That's right.

603
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:03,954
Do you see this?

604
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:06,623
"The beginning of power abuse,

605
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,660
Chairman Do Wan-bae." That's my father.

606
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:10,961
"The corrupt and bribed CEO,

607
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,763
Sim Hae-yong." That's my uncle.

608
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,833
And then

609
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,770
"No to the second generation."
This jerk happens to be

610
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,839
me.

611
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,343
May I ask why you're here?

612
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:30,314
I can take care of this. You may go back.

613
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,017
But this was Mr. Sim's order.

614
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,456
I'll talk to Uncle later.

615
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,459
Don't worry and go back.

616
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,194
It's not that I'm worried.

617
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,430
-You can go back.
-It's just...

618
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:47,931
-Go back now.
-Okay.

619
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:49,900
-Be polite.
-We'll be going.

620
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,168
Please talk to Mr. Sim.

621
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,470
We trust you.

622
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,671
Let's go.

623
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,954
Your CT scan results haven't changed much.

624
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,924
Enough of that.

625
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,126
Please take a careful look
at the ingredients.

626
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,629
It's over-the-counter cold medicine.

627
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,564
Can it be taken on an empty stomach?

628
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,901
When did she last eat?

629
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,270
About three days ago.

630
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,804
What?

631
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,407
Then what she needs is food, not medicine.

632
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,409
She won't eat. That's why I'm doing this.

633
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,077
Go and make her eat something first.

634
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:37,114
Or bring her to the emergency room
so we can give her some fluids.

635
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,386
She won't come to the hospital either.

636
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,056
By the way,

637
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,294
have you seen any other faces
since the funeral?

638
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,665
I've told you about
Dr. Park's patient in the US, right?

639
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:55,966
Recently--

640
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,201
There's a starving and sick
person out there.

641
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,336
Who cares about faces?

642
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,537
Goodness.

643
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,272
You were willing to give me anything

644
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,274
as long as I made you see faces.

645
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,010
Who says medicine has come a long way?

646
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,080
There isn't even medicine
that can be taken on an empty stomach yet.

647
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,850
Give me that.

648
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,558
Why did I ever operate
on that crazy idiot?

649
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,163
Aren't you going to do anything
about the secretaries and drivers?

650
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,799
They haven't eaten for three days.

651
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,400
I know.

652
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,402
They've been such a nuisance.

653
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:35,005
That's why I was going to clean
everything up. Why did you stop it?

654
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,140
If you hadn't violated
the dispatched labor law

655
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:38,775
and compensated the employees properly,

656
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,644
they wouldn't be doing this now.

657
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,512
Have you lost your mind?

658
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,748
They're the ones
who pocketed company funds.

659
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,683
And you're accusing me?

660
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,020
If you can't hire them directly
immediately,

661
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:53,123
at least start a negotiation
so that they can stop their hunger strike.

662
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,859
If I was going to negotiate with them,
I wouldn't have started.

663
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,495
I should step up and get rid of them

664
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,831
to win the directors over to my side.

665
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:04,001
Are you saying you're ignoring them
to keep your CEO position?

666
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,502
What else can I do?

667
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,437
Even after revealing that you're ill,

668
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,140
I'm barely holding onto my position.

669
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,153
Hello, Ms. Park.

670
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,489
You're here.

671
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:28,125
Why did you want to see me here?

672
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,294
Do you see this building?

673
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,267
It's Gwangbak Building.
It belongs to your daughter, right?

674
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,737
You sure are one ambitious man,
aren't you?

675
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,474
You already seem to take
such a keen interest in our property.

676
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,176
Why are we here?

677
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:47,477
Listen, you punk.

678
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,984
I would've loved
to take you to the cleaners,

679
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,388
but that'd apparently make me broke too,

680
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:01,124
so I decided to offer you this building.

681
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,960
Take this and leave my daughter alone.

682
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,563
One building can't break us up.

683
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,000
But I can't give you two!

684
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,169
There's something
I haven't told you about me.

685
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,505
I only buy things I'll keep
for more than 10 years

686
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,175
and date women I'm willing to spend
the rest of my life with.

687
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:22,179
You're nothing but a toy
I got for my daughter!

688
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,014
That sounds

689
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,249
pretty amazing to me.

690
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:31,154
That means I can make her smile
and make her happy.

691
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,624
I'd love to be your daughter's toy
for the rest of my life.

692
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,180
I hear the secretaries are
causing trouble.

693
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,490
What's this?

694
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,725
You sounded so confident,
so I thought, "Why not?"

695
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,027
Eat this and become the new CEO.

696
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,638
Why are you just standing there?

697
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,016
I'm sorry. I don't think I can eat this.

698
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,852
Haven't you been pestering me for it
all this time?

699
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,454
I know.

700
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,690
This is

701
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,094
the first samgyetang
you've made for me in 20 years.

702
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,063
I would've loved to eat it.

703
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,068
I'm sorry.

704
00:52:53,603 --> 00:52:54,838
I'm really sorry, Mom.

705
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,856
MEDICINE

706
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,203
I should step up and get rid of them

707
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,605
to win the directors over to my side.

708
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,050
Hi, it's me. Where are you?

709
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,727
What's going on?
Why did you bring me here?

710
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,432
It took me a while before I could call you
after hearing about your mother.

711
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,102
I've had too much on my mind.

712
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,439
I haven't been able to call you
for the same reason. I'm sorry.

713
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,208
It was for me

714
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,978
that Ms. Lee started all this.

715
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,213
And as a result,

716
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,582
you got hurt.

717
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,783
Are you crazy?

718
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,053
After hearing how your mother passed away,

719
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,356
how could you support me at the meeting?

720
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,360
I feel enough resentment
for your father though, so don't worry.

721
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,832
Who is the suit for?

722
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,202
Me?

723
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,070
I'd like to get my wifey

724
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:36,806
a suit.

725
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,608
Just a moment, please.

726
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,412
You're the crazy one.

727
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,381
Why would you get a suit
for an unemployed man?

728
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,150
You'll need it soon.

729
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,788
Dae-ju.

730
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,658
I'm trying to make a plan,

731
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:57,160
and I need your help.

732
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,565
T&T MOBILE CEO APPLICATION LETTER

733
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:07,537
What's this?

734
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,272
I got it back
from the administrative office.

735
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,646
What are you doing?

736
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,382
I withdraw my application
for the CEO position.

737
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:20,884
What?

738
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,920
It means I give up.

739
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,425
If you drop out,
I'm the only candidate left.

740
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,660
Do you expect me to believe you?

741
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:32,462
There's one condition.

742
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,300
I want to go home.

743
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,405
I miss my mom.

744
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,876
I want to take a shower.

745
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,647
I want to eat chicken.

746
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,867
HUNGER STRIKE, DAY 4

747
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:16,806
Ms. Jeong.

748
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,543
You didn't have to come out here.

749
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,316
What's the food you're craving
the most right now?

750
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:28,985
Why are you asking that?

751
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,954
Pig's trotters? Pizza?

752
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,858
I could eat anything right now.

753
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,192
What about chicken or hamburgers?

754
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,094
That sounds awesome.

755
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,198
No. I can't eat, Mr. Do.

756
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,936
Right.

757
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,805
I'm sure you're craving a lot of things,

758
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:53,243
but after starving for four days,
it's probably best to start with porridge.

759
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:58,948
Get up.

760
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,686
Take this off and
come have porridge with me.

761
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,626
Mr. Do, please don't do this.

762
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,629
Everyone, go back now.

763
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,433
The company is ready
to start a negotiation with you.

764
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,135
You can go back and eat now.

765
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:22,172
What are you talking about?

766
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,774
I've talked to Mr. Sim.

767
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:26,209
There will be an announcement tomorrow.

768
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,611
He said he'd give you more details
over the phone.

769
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,114
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

770
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,583
Take it, Ms. Lee.

771
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,521
Lee Eul-wang speaking. Pardon?

772
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:43,326
Okay. Tomorrow at 2 p.m. I see.

773
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:57,674
We did it!

774
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,879
Are you so happy?

775
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,049
Yes, I am. I couldn't be happier.

776
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,853
The secretaries don't have to worry
about getting fired anymore.

777
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,323
I can also eat anything I want now.

778
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,092
But more than anything,

779
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,296
I'll be the CEO's secretary
in just a few days.

780
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,239
Why are you looking at me like that?

781
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:30,373
What?

782
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,811
I'm happy that you're happy.

783
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:41,017
I really wish I could show you
how my face looks right now.

784
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,720
I want you to see how happy I look.

785
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,954
Then

786
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,157
show me how happy you are

787
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,929
by holding me tight.

788
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,967
