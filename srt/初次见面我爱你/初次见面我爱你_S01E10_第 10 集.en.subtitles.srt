1
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,372
Oh, my.

2
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,543
You're Mr. Do Min-ik, right?

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,311
Who are you?

4
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,282
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

5
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,263
You're saying you're Veronica Park?

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,369
So we finally meet for the first time
at a place like this.

7
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,905
"First"? What do you mean?

8
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,074
Are you saying

9
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,843
you're Veronica Park

10
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,712
and this is our first time
to meet each other?

11
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:20,947
Yes.

12
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,248
Who are you?

13
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,151
Who are you to impersonate Veronica Park?

14
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,753
"Impersonate"?

15
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,522
Hey!

16
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,526
I'm the only daughter
of the great Park Group.

17
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,895
I'm the CEO of Cinepark, Veronica--

18
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,430
You stay here.

19
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,499
Stay here?

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,701
Hey!

21
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,303
How dare you...

22
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,772
-Gosh, sir.
-I'm sorry.

23
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,474
I think my hair got stuck.

24
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,708
Yes, Boss.

25
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,610
I have something to report to you.

26
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,631
Hey, are you crazy?

27
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,590
Did you see him?

28
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,461
Yes. He shaved his face
and changed his hairstyle,

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,763
but it was definitely him.

30
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,964
Okay.

31
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,066
It's 9:10 p.m.
at the Sangmo Hospital Intersection.

32
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,269
Call the control center
and get the security camera footage.

33
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,713
Oh, right.

34
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,616
That lady.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,862
-Mr. Do.
-What?

36
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,098
It's me, Ms. Jeong.

37
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,134
Where have you been?

38
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,869
I'll tell you later.

39
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,239
Did you see a loud lady standing here?

40
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,275
-Who?
-I just ran into a woman.

41
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,110
Do you know what she told me?

42
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,815
"Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park."

43
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,988
I know we're living in a world
full of swindlers these days,

44
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,723
but how could she be so brazen?

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,625
She said we just met for the first time.

46
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,793
We met so many times,

47
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,094
and I even kissed...

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,131
Anyway.

49
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,068
She was wearing this strange hat
that looks like a curtain.

50
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,770
You should go inside and look for her.
I'll look for her outside.

51
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,539
Wait.

52
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,341
I guess she's already left.

53
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,009
You caught her already.

54
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,311
She wouldn't stay here.

55
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,381
Then I should at least tell her.

56
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,616
Who?

57
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,985
Who do you think? The real Veronica Park.

58
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,487
Mr. Do, you don't have to do it now.

59
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,059
Mr. Do, I need to go to the restroom.

60
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,964
It ruined my style.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,434
Who are you?

62
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,037
Who are you to impersonate Veronica Park?

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,510
I guess someone has been impersonating me.

64
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,284
How dare she make me,
the real Veronica Park

65
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,052
a fake one?

66
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,254
I'm going to catch her.

67
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,891
I'll just rip her apart and grind her

68
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,093
to make baby food.

69
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,203
Are you saying there's
a fake Veronica going around?

70
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,105
Wait until I catch her.

71
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,675
I'll just rip her apart and grind her

72
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,510
to make baby food.

73
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,150
BOSS

74
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,686
Hello?

75
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,988
Ms. Park?

76
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,594
Maybe I shouldn't have called her
for things like this.

77
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,000
Why isn't Ms. Jeong coming?

78
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,447
What kind of story is so interesting?

79
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,118
So the brazen bitch
who's been impersonating me

80
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,621
is you, Jeong Gal-hee?

81
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,559
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

82
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,993
I don't know what to say.

83
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,397
I have no excuse for that.

84
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,665
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,601
I get that you just imitated

86
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,504
my way of talking somehow

87
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,407
with the know-how you accumulated
dealing with the guys I dated.

88
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,743
But what about my face?

89
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,346
You can easily find pictures of me
if you search my name online.

90
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,182
What kind of magic trick did you use

91
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,818
to impersonate my face?

92
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,887
Well... It's...

93
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,294
I can explain.

94
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,696
Ms. Jeong.

95
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,099
Are you in there?

96
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,969
Ms. Jeong.

97
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:50,743
If you can't answer my question,

98
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,714
I'll go and ask him myself.

99
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,150
Gosh, Ms. Park.

100
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,051
Excuse me.

101
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm sorry to ask this
to someone I just met.

102
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,156
"Someone you just met"?

103
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,260
Mr. Do.

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,928
What took you so long?

105
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,864
I can't find my mom without you.

106
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,934
Well...

107
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,403
She's coming from 10m away.

108
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,806
She's in a black dress with a blue bag.

109
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,913
Mom.

110
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,315
Why are you so late?

111
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm sorry. I ran into someone
on my way here.

112
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:38,124
Now I see what's going on.

113
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,093
Can't your boss

114
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,197
recognize people's faces?

115
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,508
It was a joke at first.

116
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:00,112
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,682
I was just Jeong Minion.

118
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,185
But when I showed up

119
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,754
as the heiress of Park Group,

120
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,560
he treated me in a totally different way.

121
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,499
I did it once out of curiosity.

122
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,236
And twice by mistake.

123
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,308
As I kept dating Mr. Do,

124
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,678
I ended up falling for him
before I knew it.

125
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,283
He liked me back

126
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:43,022
thinking I was you.
When I saw him being like that,

127
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,059
I thought I shouldn't be doing this.

128
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,031
But I wanted to keep seeing him like that.

129
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,802
Now the pieces of a puzzle
are being put together.

130
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,740
That's why Chairwoman Sim

131
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,343
thinks Director Do likes me.

132
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,345
And that's what

133
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,414
she told my mom.

134
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,320
I've also deceived people

135
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,356
and pulled all kinds of scams myself
to promote movies in my theater,

136
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,059
but nothing has been this spectacle.

137
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,095
It even makes me want to admire you.

138
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,365
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

139
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,368
I'm so sorry.

140
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,774
I don't even have the right to apologize.

141
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,978
I'll tell Mr. Do all about this tomorrow

142
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,581
and gladly accept any punishment.

143
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:42,915
I'll let you

144
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,351
get punished tomorrow.

145
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,087
You know me.

146
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,056
Once I find someone's weak point,

147
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,726
I make sure to take advantage of it.

148
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,195
I'll give it a lot of thought all night

149
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,864
and come up with the punishment
you deserve.

150
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,634
Come to my office tomorrow morning.

151
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,271
Now

152
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,841
there's something I need
to take care of urgently.

153
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,361
So your daughter is not coming?

154
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,830
She wouldn't come to a place like this.

155
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,498
Chairwoman Sim.

156
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,867
Please excuse me for a second.

157
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,435
Hello, Mr. Kim.

158
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,542
Thank you so much
for taking care of my daughter.

159
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,216
I guess she didn't tell you yet.

160
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,552
Our relationship is a little...

161
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,987
What?

162
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,957
Is she seeing someone else?

163
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,159
Did you know that?

164
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,362
I can't believe this.

165
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,232
I'll just stitch up her eyelids

166
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,734
so she can never see guys again.

167
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,037
Please don't do that.

168
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,972
It's hard for me too,

169
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,541
but I'm trying to move on.

170
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,544
Does that mean

171
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,514
you still have feelings for her?

172
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,184
I liked her a lot.

173
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,920
My gosh. You're my son-in-law.

174
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,522
Well...

175
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,757
I've known her for such a long time.

176
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,227
I'm sure her relationship with the new guy
will last only for a week.

177
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:38,030
Even if she promised eternal love,
it would last only for a month.

178
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,167
I'll make sure she will

179
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,436
walk down the aisle with you.

180
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:50,976
Please don't give up on her until then.

181
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,112
Well, ma'am...

182
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,119
Gosh, why are you two being so intimate?

183
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,523
About the exclusive screening rights
for Cinepark.

184
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,927
I'll make sure to have my daughter
sign the contract within this week.

185
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,463
Are you serious?

186
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,970
You're finally making my son
the CEO of my company.

187
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,740
Don't you think so, Min-ik?

188
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,529
Thank you for working hard
until late night today.

189
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:49,368
I'm going home with Mom,
so you should go home too.

190
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:50,870
MS. JEONG

191
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,739
I can't do anything without you.

192
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,975
I'm sorry about that.

193
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,011
And...

194
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,014
thank you for being there for me...

195
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,719
THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME

196
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:14,560
MS. JEONG

197
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,790
Well... Ms. Jeong, what's wrong?

198
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,892
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,262
I feel really bad.

200
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:57,469
Gosh, Mom. I'm so sorry.

201
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,140
I can't let you go like this.

202
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,510
I didn't know Gal-hee
was such a great actress.

203
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,547
She even weeps crocodile tears

204
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,583
to make her boss the CEO.

205
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,720
She's lived the history of T&T Mobile
and has worked

206
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,488
for the late Chairman Do and Mr. Gi.

207
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,157
Let me ask Ms. Lee.

208
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,160
Who do you think will be the next CEO?

209
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,563
I always tell you not to gossip.

210
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,599
You should all go if you're done.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,904
-Okay.
-Please forgive me, Mom.

212
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,114
FUNERAL HALL

213
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,014
Hey, Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

214
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,422
Did you not see me sitting right here?

215
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,026
I've been sitting here the whole time,
but you wouldn't talk to me.

216
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,529
How could you be so indifferent?

217
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,735
And how could you be so dull?

218
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,272
Why do you think
I stayed here until 3 a.m.

219
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,409
when I haven't even met
Director Park's mom before?

220
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,711
Are you saying

221
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,950
you've been sitting here until now

222
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,985
just to see my face?

223
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,122
Unfortunately, you were
sitting back-to-back with me.

224
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,491
So I finally get to see your face now.

225
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,695
You're one strange man.

226
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,633
If you wanted to see my face that badly,

227
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,403
you could've hung out
with me at least once.

228
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,443
I guess you still don't want to be
in a serious relationship with me.

229
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,945
I should go now.

230
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,857
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

231
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,060
Mr. Gi Dae-ju?

232
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,697
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

233
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,733
Are you upset?

234
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,972
Do you think this is what I want?

235
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,348
What kind of people
do you think approach me?

236
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,385
Those who want my money
for their business.

237
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,187
Those who want to use my name
to build personal connections.

238
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,825
Let's be honest. You are one of them.

239
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:11,630
They are just happy when I spend money
or introduce someone important.

240
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,932
But after taking advantage of me,

241
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,969
they just turn away.

242
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,874
Do you know what I realized
after going through that 12 times?

243
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,646
I can never be in love.

244
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,217
I should just have fun
with some guy I'm interested in.

245
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,056
It's better

246
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,225
not to let anyone break my heart
in the first place.

247
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,312
If you can't trust me, you don't have to.

248
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,849
But you should love someone.

249
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,118
It doesn't have to be me.

250
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,957
I used to live without money,
but I endured it somehow.

251
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,860
I've also lived without parents.

252
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,130
It was hard, but I could handle it anyway.

253
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,132
But I can't live without love.

254
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,037
People can't live without love.

255
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,175
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

256
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:38,117
Then how about we do this?

257
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,956
It's not like we have just a fling,
but it's also not too serious.

258
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:48,760
Why don't we try dating for one month
with things going right between those two?

259
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,533
I need some time to figure out
if you are someone I can trust.

260
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,604
Does that sound like an acceptable deal?

261
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,108
I knew it.

262
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,913
That's not going to work
for you, Mr. Chastity.

263
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,757
Does this mean you're in?

264
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,759
To be honest,

265
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,428
I'm not sure about this.

266
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,099
I just give either all my heart or none.

267
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,202
I've never done anything
that's between the two options.

268
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,472
But...

269
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,908
I will give it a try.

270
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,279
If that's the only way I can be with you.

271
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,816
Mom, I don't know
what you're doing here at this hour,

272
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,954
but you should have some manners
and give me time to get my guard up.

273
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,192
I told you to behave modestly
and get married with someone good.

274
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,296
The whole world cries out for peace
these days.

275
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,834
But you still believe
that violence is the only solution.

276
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,137
I'm so sick of it now.

277
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,208
Premature menopause and late childbearing
is a serious issue these days.

278
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,644
But you still go around
and flirt with random guys.

279
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,045
That attitude of yours

280
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,715
makes me shudder.

281
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,984
How could you tell a guy
who's just like Gandhi

282
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,919
that you're seeing someone else?

283
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,355
I swear I didn't say that.

284
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,657
Is that so? Then I guess

285
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:03,161
someone else said that to him
pretending to be you.

286
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,632
Jeong Gal-hee, that wench...

287
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,335
Once you get to the office,

288
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,771
take a day off

289
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,673
on the 20th the first thing.

290
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,108
Is it

291
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,210
the day

292
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,580
of my funeral?

293
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:26,285
It's your wedding day.

294
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,322
The fortune-teller in Cheongdam-dong says
it's an auspicious day.

295
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm going to print
the wedding invitations today.

296
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,032
You can't.

297
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,968
It means I have less than a month left.

298
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,505
There's something I need to do
for a month.

299
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,842
Ms. Park Seok-ja.

300
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,484
You might be able

301
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,721
to make me stand at the wedding.

302
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:03,855
But...

303
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,593
I'm Veronica Park.

304
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,029
Running away from the wedding

305
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:14,266
holding another man's hand
in front of 1,000 guests.

306
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,304
It's no big deal to me.
I believe you know it already.

307
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,739
Are you threatening me now?

308
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,975
I'm offering a deal.

309
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,848
Maybe I should find a guy for this.

310
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:31,083
My goodness.

311
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,419
So what's your condition?

312
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,456
One month.

313
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,524
In 1999,

314
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:42,661
when I lost you at Seoul Station,

315
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,063
I shouldn't have looked for you.

316
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,199
Then I want you

317
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,236
to sign the contract
with T&T Mobile today.

318
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,743
I've already signed it.

319
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,689
Don't be nervous, Gal-hee.

320
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,725
It was going to happen anyway.

321
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,064
No matter what the punishment is,
just accept it gladly.

322
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,904
You're here.

323
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,939
Let's go.

324
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,176
What? Where?

325
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,332
This one.

326
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,353
Ms. Park.

327
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,757
Would you please tell me what is going on?

328
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,993
Do you know what made me
feel offended the most?

329
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,565
Jeong Gal-hee, your pronunciation

330
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,367
was so lame.

331
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,070
"Awesome" shouldn't be pronounced
that way.

332
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,574
Can't you sound more graceful?

333
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,589
I will now give you
a severe punishment. Listen carefully.

334
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,093
From now on,

335
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:00,131
you're the real Veronica.

336
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,241
The housekeeper found this in your pants.

337
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,745
I don't think it's Veronica's. Who is she?

338
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,252
How did you know?

339
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,121
It's not even diamond. It's just
a plated earring with some rhinestones.

340
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,556
And this design.

341
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,025
It's a Cartier replica.

342
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,426
A replica?

343
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,161
Yes. It's a fake.

344
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,766
It's what people buy
when they can't afford the original.

345
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,403
And that's what they do
when they can't be the original.

346
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,906
Well... Give me that.

347
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,908
It belongs to Ms. Jeong.
I'll give it back to her.

348
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,710
Why did you have
her earring in your pants?

349
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,947
I told you to fire her.

350
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,783
Just do as I say unless you want to get
betrayed by your secretary twice.

351
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,691
Why did I bring this?

352
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,801
The number you have called
cannot be reached...

353
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,003
Why isn't he answering?

354
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,849
Has your driver not arrived yet?

355
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,719
Get in.

356
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,462
Is everything all right these days?

357
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,902
I was wondering if you got sick
and went to a doctor or something.

358
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,137
I had a bad feeling about it
when I got in.

359
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,773
This is such an expensive taxi.

360
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,145
Is he a new driver?

361
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,849
-I fired the former driver.
-Again?

362
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,453
He kept spying on me
through the room mirror.

363
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,022
He should look at the room mirror
when he drives.

364
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,591
That's just ridiculous.

365
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,760
Ridiculous?

366
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,497
Why do you think
your driver didn't come today?

367
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,665
I don't know.

368
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,500
He might have run away
after causing trouble

369
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,102
or stolen some information.

370
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,005
That's what

371
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,308
drivers and secretaries do in this world.

372
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,023
What do you mean?
Why do you want me to become you?

373
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,860
There's a guy I should date for a month.

374
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,729
But my family is supposed to think

375
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,732
that I'm dating your boss.

376
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,834
Then...

377
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,705
You should date Director Do
for the next month.

378
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,144
Not as Jeong Gal-hee,
but as Veronica Park.

379
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,612
I can't.

380
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,951
Did you forget that you said
you'd gladly accept any punishment?

381
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,988
But still...

382
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,657
I can't deceive Mr. Do again.

383
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,360
Yesterday,

384
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,629
I was the one who should apologize.

385
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,766
But he kept saying sorry to me.

386
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,203
I like him, but I lie to him.

387
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,540
He trusts me, but I betray him.

388
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:31,342
I can't do that anymore.

389
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,846
Now that it's already like this,

390
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,649
I'll tell Mr. Do about the whole thing
and end it.

391
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,185
Please

392
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:45,123
punish me in a different way.
Then I'll gladly accept it.

393
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,726
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

394
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,134
Do you only care about your love?

395
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,907
You know it too.

396
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,210
What men did to me

397
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,080
and how they left me.

398
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,548
But...

399
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,689
If you refuse to do it,
I have only one option left.

400
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,024
On the 20th of next month,

401
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,661
I will hold your boss' hand

402
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,164
and walk down the aisle.

403
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,934
It's only for one month.

404
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,304
If you're going to tell
your boss the truth anyway,

405
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,473
it doesn't matter when you do it.

406
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:40,912
If my relationship with the guy
becomes serious in a month,

407
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,049
I will end things
with Mr. Do Min-ik myself.

408
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,919
So, Gal-hee,

409
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,855
help me.

410
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,225
Please.

411
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,040
It is a replica of our product.

412
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,275
But why...

413
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,012
I'd like to buy the original of it.

414
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,414
Are they twins?

415
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,018
They are even dressed alike.

416
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,902
How can I lie to him again?

417
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,750
-I'm sorry, Mr. Do.
-What?

418
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:28,219
I mean, hello, Mr. Do.

419
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,323
What did you do wrong?
Why did you just apologize?

420
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,327
Is it because my driver didn't come?

421
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,329
He didn't come?

422
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,199
He didn't tell me that.

423
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:50,408
Well... What about the flash drive?

424
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,243
What did Mr. Gi say?

425
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,878
He says he doesn't know.

426
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,149
What? It was found in his office.

427
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,785
How could he not know?

428
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,455
Don't get Dae-ju involved in this anymore.

429
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,823
I never doubt him.

430
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,192
I'd rather doubt that the Earth is round.

431
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,930
I should get my laptop fixed then.

432
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,306
Well...

433
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,043
What are you going to do tonight?

434
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,313
I should have my brother
discharged from the hospital today.

435
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:30,048
That's good. I'll come with you.

436
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,916
I should go to your place anyway.

437
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,619
My place? Why?

438
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,227
We need to go to your place
to take your brother home.

439
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,829
Well... Right.

440
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,611
What is this?

441
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,280
Can't you read?

442
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,515
It's the contract

443
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,252
with T&T Mobile regarding the exclusive
screening rights for Cinepark.

444
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,455
I already signed the contract.

445
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,391
Review the document
and have it signed by T&T Mobile.

446
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,762
Are you doing this because we are dating?

447
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,797
The day I read the proposal,

448
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:22,433
I signed it already.

449
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,036
I just

450
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,173
didn't tell you
because I wanted to play hard to get.

451
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,276
Thank you.

452
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,347
But I'd like you to send the contract
directly to the company.

453
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,116
Mr. Chastity.

454
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:43,121
The document is supposed to be sent
directly to the company.

455
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,092
That's why I'm giving this
to you right now.

456
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,430
"I, Gi Dae-ju,

457
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,033
won the contract with Cinepark."

458
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,236
I want you to brag about it.

459
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,644
I'll make sure you won't regret this.

460
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:13,017
I also want to make an offer

461
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:19,490
that you won't regret.

462
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,095
In Paju,

463
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,798
there's an amazing villa

464
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:28,866
that grows completely dark
at around 5 p.m.

465
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,502
It's so remote

466
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,440
that you wouldn't know
even if someone dies there.

467
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,911
And fortunately,

468
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,281
it happens to be mine.

469
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,219
Well... I'm just saying

470
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,255
that I'm staying there tonight.

471
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,158
And I was wondering

472
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,661
if you want to come.

473
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,935
You go there first.

474
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,904
I have an appointment.
I'll join you as soon as it's over.

475
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:12,043
I should have some firewood prepared.

476
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,378
To set fire

477
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,549
to you, Mr. Chastity.

478
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,057
Nice to meet you.

479
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,259
I'm Do Min-ik.

480
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,596
Nice to meet you too. I'm Jeong Jung-hee.

481
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,767
Give me that. I'll carry it.

482
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,770
There's something else you should carry.

483
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:40,972
Pardon?

484
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,541
Put your arms on here.

485
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,976
-My arms?
-Yes.

486
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,512
-Sit down.
-Okay.

487
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,716
-All right.
-What?

488
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,219
My gosh.

489
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,622
Gosh, your back is so...

490
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:00,525
You're strong enough
to do some manual labor.

491
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,493
It's a waste that you work in the office.

492
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,164
I'm so sorry, Mr. Do.

493
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,331
What?

494
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,439
I'm sorry.

495
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,009
Taxis don't like to come all the way here.

496
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,419
It's Mr. Eun.

497
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,556
I guess he's not feeling well.

498
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,525
He wants to ask you
if he can take a few days off.

499
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,595
-Sure. He can do that.
-Okay.

500
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,767
Jung-hee, we're almost here.

501
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:45,770
Put me down.

502
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,541
Thank you.

503
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,385
I knew it.

504
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:05,489
I'm sorry.

505
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,928
You should go home now.

506
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,535
Wait. Can I use your bathroom?

507
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,141
My legs are killing me.

508
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,461
Was it here like this?

509
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,429
Okay.

510
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:46,931
Are you saying

511
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,067
you came late because you had to put
the earrings in Ms. Jeong's place?

512
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,371
Yes.

513
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,940
Why?

514
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,075
Why do you ask?

515
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,244
It's not like Ms. Jeong always
has to wear fake earrings.

516
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,380
That's not the point.

517
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,516
Why do you even care

518
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,185
if her earrings are fake or not?

519
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,921
-That's because...
-Because what?

520
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,890
Because I...

521
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,362
Because you what? Because you like her?

522
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,464
What are you talking about?

523
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,801
I told you. I like someone else.

524
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,405
You have been acting weird
since the stockholders' meeting.

525
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,640
You keep saying that you like her,

526
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,142
but your eyes are always on Ms. Jeong.

527
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,110
And you spend most of your time with her.

528
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:34,945
Hey, that's...

529
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,150
It's...

530
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:43,888
Well...

531
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,891
There's actually something
I'm not sure about.

532
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,592
What is it?

533
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,227
When I'm with Ms. Jeong,

534
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,163
my blood pressure goes up.

535
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,397
Your blood pressure?

536
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,833
It never happens
when I'm with the woman I like.

537
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,469
But when I'm with Ms. Jeong,

538
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,672
my heart flutters.

539
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,443
It beats really quickly.

540
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,446
Whatever the reason,
you don't have to hesitate.

541
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,348
Ms. Jeong has feelings...

542
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,617
I mean, she thinks you're a good boss.

543
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,919
If you like Ms. Jeong,

544
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,421
you should give up on that woman
and date Ms. Jeong.

545
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,123
I can't give up on her.

546
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,324
What?

547
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,527
She's not someone you can easily forget.

548
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,796
If you ever get to meet her,

549
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,431
you will understand what I mean.

550
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,066
Really?

551
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,936
Who is she?

552
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,140
Veronica Park.

553
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,984
What did you just say?

554
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,589
Do you mean the woman you like

555
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,692
is Veronica Park of Cinepark?

556
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,660
Do you know her?

557
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,463
Why did you not tell me sooner?

558
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:03,934
Well... I thought
we would stop dating soon.

559
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,369
So there's nothing

560
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,838
serious between you two, right?

561
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,242
It's just that you have
a crush on her, isn't it?

562
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:13,544
We kissed.

563
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,026
I'm sorry, but I can't make it today.

564
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,299
There's something I need to take care of.

565
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,970
You said you'd come. Why...

566
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,706
Mr. Gi Dae-ju?

567
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,009
Hello?

568
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,178
Mr. Chastity?

569
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,381
Hey!

570
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,850
If you don't want to give up on her,

571
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,719
what's with Ms. Jeong?
Are you just toying with her?

572
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,721
I'm not toying with her.

573
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:02,860
Do you know how I felt when Ms. Jeong
refused to renew the contract?

574
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,628
When I was seven,

575
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,933
my real mom abandoned me here.
That's how I felt.

576
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,101
Then what are you trying to do?

577
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,406
I don't know, Dae-ju.

578
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,010
I know you might not believe it.

579
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:22,913
But I'm serious.

580
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,084
The feelings I have
for Veronica Park are real.

581
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,753
And whenever I see Ms. Jeong,

582
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,756
my heart flutters.

583
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,259
It's all real.

584
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,462
Listen, Do Min-ik.

585
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,131
I can't tell you whom to give up.

586
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,433
Actually, I wish

587
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,703
I could tell you whom you should let go.

588
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,072
But it's your choice.

589
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,875
I won't tell you what to do. But...

590
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,644
you have to give up one of them.

591
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,280
I'll see you at That Place
at this time tomorrow.

592
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,282
Make up your mind until then.

593
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,318
Then I will find my own answer.

594
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,854
"Go down. Go down."

595
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,558
"It shall go down as if there's
sesame oil in your stomach."

596
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,328
So please don't give up.
Fight your way to the CEO position.

597
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,096
I'll help you.

598
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,712
Goodnight

599
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,281
My baby

600
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,220
My sweet baby

601
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,806
Hello, Mr. Do.

602
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,179
You have to give up one of them.

603
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,682
I'll see you at That Place
at this time tomorrow.

604
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,450
Make up your mind until then.

605
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:18,222
Why are you staring at me like that?

606
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:20,624
What are you doing?

607
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,162
You got me the pebbles the other day,
but I didn't clean the tank yet.

608
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:29,800
I think I should do something like this
to feel better.

609
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,878
Don't do it.
Call someone in to clean the tank.

610
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:46,316
Why? This is your favorite fish.

611
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:47,518
Well...

612
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,986
Why...

613
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:53,357
Why would you do something
I didn't even ask for?

614
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,628
The other day, you said

615
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,398
a secretary is supposed to do things
before you ask.

616
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,501
Just forget all about what I said before.

617
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:09,239
If you have nothing to do,
just go and have some coffee.

618
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,077
You should have your laptop fixed.
Go take it to repair.

619
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,212
I did it in the morning.

620
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,720
Give me that. Let me finish this.

621
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,191
What's wrong with it?

622
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:30,794
Mr. Do, it doesn't seem well.

623
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,444
Gal-hee, where are you going?

624
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,280
Ms. Lee. The fish is a little sick.

625
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,416
Ms. Jeong, hurry.

626
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,385
I'm sorry. I should get going.

627
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,025
Gal-hee, you are finally

628
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,062
unlatching the door.

629
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,234
Please save it, sir.

630
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:14,138
My boss treasures the fish
like his own life.

631
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,308
It's about to leave.

632
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,043
Rest in peace.

633
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,411
"Leave"?

634
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,748
The 100 million won's worth fish
is dying just like that?

635
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,518
Who said it's worth 100 million won?

636
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:31,188
This is a platinum arowana.

637
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,724
I heard this is
the most expensive arowana.

638
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,959
This isn't a platinum arowana.

639
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,461
-It's a golden arowana.
-What?

640
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,129
Well...

641
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,564
That can't be right.

642
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,868
A golden arowana
is only about 10 million won.

643
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,127
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

644
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,497
I should've taken better care of it.

645
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,836
Why do you keep saying sorry these days?

646
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,272
Did you not hear that it died of old age?

647
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,243
But what do you think happened?

648
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,646
Chairman Do wouldn't have treasured it
without knowing what it is.

649
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,083
-How did you know?
-What?

650
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,154
I've never told you about my dad.

651
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,159
Eulwangni... Well...

652
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,094
It was Ms. Lee.

653
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,197
I think I heard her talking about it.

654
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,567
She used to work for Chairman Do.

655
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,578
You may go home.

656
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,715
Call someone in
to get rid of the tank tomorrow.

657
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,984
Okay.

658
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,441
The motherboard is broken,
so I replaced it.

659
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,043
What about the data?

660
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,745
You can check the files.
They are in there.

661
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,980
Okay. Thank you.

662
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,448
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

663
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,228
Mr. Do.

664
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,536
Why did you come back?

665
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,115
Ta-da.

666
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,418
What are these?

667
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,620
They are moss balls.

668
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,256
-What did you say?
-Moss balls.

669
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,425
If the tank is gone,

670
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,962
I think you will feel more empty.

671
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:04,067
But the empty tank will make you
miss the fish even more.

672
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:09,706
I heard they live
for more than a hundred years.

673
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,043
Are they some kind of moss?

674
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,611
Yes.

675
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,948
They are sitting on the bottom now,

676
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,985
but when they feel good,
they float to the surface.

677
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,089
-Moss can't have feelings.
-I'm serious.

678
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,159
I hope they will float soon.

679
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,796
It was Aromi.

680
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,766
What?

681
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,634
The name of the fish.

682
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:41,838
"It's an arowana, so I named it Aromi."

683
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,542
Dad said that with a smile.

684
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:54,885
Then we should call them Aromi now.

685
00:50:56,253 --> 00:51:00,190
Aromi Number One, Number Two,
and Number Three.

686
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,600
Why don't you go home now?

687
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,771
I'll watch them a little more
to see if they float or not.

688
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,940
No. I want to wait

689
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,944
and see if they float or not.

690
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:38,128
You miss Ms. Park, don't you?

691
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:40,597
What?

692
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:46,169
When you miss Ms. Park,

693
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,772
you want to be with me.

694
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,641
No, that's not true.

695
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,179
It's you I want to be with.

696
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,248
What?

697
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:15,031
Well... I mean...

698
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:21,037
I guess that's not necessarily the case.

699
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,041
It's just

700
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,178
I want to be with you.

701
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,885
I guess that's probably why. Or maybe not.

702
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,087
What?

703
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,325
Then...

704
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,594
you can stay.

705
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:45,996
I would be

706
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,666
happy to be with you

707
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,702
even if I have to stay up all night.

708
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,007
What?

709
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,347
Well, I mean...

710
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,485
Since you can't see people's faces,

711
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,153
I should stay with you.

712
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,156
That's why. But...

713
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,761
I guess that's not the only reason.

714
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,729
I just think

715
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,400
it'd be nice to see them float together.

716
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,404
They are floating.

717
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,805
What?

718
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:31,341
They really are.

719
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,210
See? I told you so.

720
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:36,680
They're pretty, aren't they?

721
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:43,887
They are pretty.

722
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,894
What's wrong, Number Two?
Aren't you feeling well?

723
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,098
It's moving.

724
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,001
I think it's about to float.

725
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,370
Right. It's floating.

726
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,105
It's going up.

727
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,207
Look.

728
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,243
It's going up.

729
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,812
-It's floating.
-It's...

730
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,590
So this is

731
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,326
your eyebrow.

732
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,329
And this is

733
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,264
your eye.

734
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,104
These are

735
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,540
lips.

736
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,669
Well...

737
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:49,346
-Well... It's...
-Well...

738
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:52,749
I'll see you tomorrow.

739
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:16,373
Hello, Dae-ju.

740
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:18,508
I'll be right there.

741
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,211
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

742
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,484
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE
THE FOLDER COMPLETELY?

743
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,065
It's done, Boss.

744
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,436
The file is gone,

745
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,771
but Mr. Do is suspecting me,

746
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,241
so I think I'd better disappear
from the company.

747
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,679
I'll never forget

748
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,183
all that you've done for me.

749
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,460
I'm so tired.

750
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,339
You...

751
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:09,118
THAT PLACE

752
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,168
Did you decide

753
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,470
who it is you like?

754
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,008
All right.

755
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,744
Who is it?

756
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:36,646
Before I tell you...

757
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:43,720
Punch me once, Dae-ju.

758
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,255
Why?

759
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,697
Is the person you like

760
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,002
Veronica Park?

761
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:02,772
Is it Ms. Jeong?

762
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,244
Who is it you love?

763
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,442
Don't come within a one-meter radius.
No physical contact is allowed.

764
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,612
-Do you think what you did is a mistake?
-It was not a mistake.

765
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,149
Ms. Park. My family wishes
to push ahead with our marriage.

766
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,818
So are we officially dating now?

767
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:51,454
You're crazy. You're still thinking
about Ms. Jeong.

768
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:54,424
I can't do this. So please let me
tell him the truth.

769
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,926
I like you, Mr. Do.

770
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,995
