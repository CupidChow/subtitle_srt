1
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:43,410
ONE DAY BEFORE T&T MOBILE
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

2
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,447
Dear brother.

3
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,584
How should I describe what it's like
to live in the suite room here?

4
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,989
Do people's faces change when they live
in comfortable circumstances?

5
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,558
My eyes are shining

6
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,928
and my skin is glowing.

7
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,436
I'm doing great,
so take good care of yourself.

8
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,541
Living in a suite room is
beyond my imagination.

9
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,154
Who is it?

10
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,271
This is strange.
Whenever I come back home,

11
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,940
there's something on the floor.

12
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,410
Is it a thief?

13
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,646
No way.

14
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,882
If thieves have eyes,

15
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,284
they can see what this place looks like.

16
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,734
Gosh, it hurts.

17
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,783
Gosh, you startled me!

18
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,220
I said I'd be back
after swimming for 30 minutes.

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,557
I found something amazing,
so I couldn't wait.

20
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,260
Did you stay up all night looking for it?

21
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,929
There are five of them including this one.

22
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,032
Are you sure it will work?

23
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,902
Let me see.

24
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,970
What are you doing?

25
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,341
Well... I think your swimming suit
is too tight.

26
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,210
Of course swimming suits are tight.

27
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,813
Wait. At least put this on.

28
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,390
Get away from my son right now.

29
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,430
Ma'am.

30
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,333
What you just said and did

31
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,936
might be misleading in many ways.

32
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,504
Are you saying you can't?

33
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:29,209
And what I'm about to say
can be misleading,

34
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,211
but our relationship

35
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,847
is not something that's damaged
by a single word you say.

36
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,549
When you guys were seven,

37
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,652
you started to frequent my place
with Ms. Choe.

38
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,088
I should've separated you two back then.

39
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,959
Then I wouldn't have seen you
raise your hand at the meeting like that.

40
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,263
I thought this situation felt
somewhat familiar.

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,865
I remember something similar happened
when I was seven.

42
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,368
That's why I want to handle it
properly this time.

43
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,437
If water doesn't work...

44
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,441
Nothing works better than this.

45
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,414
This might cause a real misunderstanding.

46
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,718
Take this as your severance pay.

47
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,653
Once the stockholder's meeting is over,

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,755
resign your position
and leave the company.

49
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,993
You have no sense of shame, but do have
a brain. I believe you know what I mean.

50
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,328
I should get going.

51
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,972
Who is it?

52
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,976
Mr. Gi.

53
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,111
Ms. Jeong.

54
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,314
What happened to your face?

55
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,516
Please come in.

56
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,759
You didn't have coffee, did you?

57
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,029
I think I had a cup here.

58
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,797
Why is the room so messy?

59
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,532
Are you all right?

60
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,905
I don't need to drink coffee.

61
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,206
Where's Min-ik?

62
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:11,077
He went for a swim,
but he'll be back soon.

63
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,413
Oh, that...

64
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,382
Is it the list of people
who signed a power of attorney?

65
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,424
Park Ok-sun?

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,992
Why hasn't she signed it yet?

67
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,594
You said she'd sign it.

68
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,896
She's signing it today.

69
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,665
Really? Are you sure?

70
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,735
She will sign the power of attorney
and not attend the stockholders' meeting.

71
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,337
Right.

72
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,239
By the way, does
Ms. Park Ok-sun's signature matter?

73
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,209
I remember you say that many times.

74
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,185
Park Ok-sun is Veronica Park's real name.

75
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,520
-Really?
-Who?

76
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,156
My goodness.

77
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,726
What were you whispering about?

78
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,994
Is it a secret?

79
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:03,896
A conspiracy?

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,598
Love?

81
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,434
Coffee.

82
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,473
Mr. Gi wants to drink some coffee, so...

83
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,511
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,413
Are you here to tell me that you'll quit?

85
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,982
I'm here to see
if you're doing a good job.

86
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,284
What did you make her do
for the past two weeks?

87
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,719
Her face is a mess.

88
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,723
What about her face?

89
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,492
Can't you see?

90
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,295
It's like you put a straw on her face

91
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,164
and sucked her soul out of it.

92
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,709
An imprint.

93
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,011
It's not your eyes that see her face.

94
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,047
It's your brain that's imprinted with her.

95
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,684
I can recognize her face,

96
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,254
but it's not like
I can see her facial expression.

97
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,590
Mr. Do, why...

98
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,897
-Go.
-What? All of a sudden...

99
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,565
Did I do something wrong?

100
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,802
You've been staying
in this suite room the whole time.

101
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,770
Can't you let me use it
at least one night?

102
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,573
The meeting will be held in this hotel
tomorrow anyway.

103
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,944
I think I will feel better
if I stay here tonight.

104
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,879
I guess you're right,

105
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,548
but we still need to practice...

106
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,325
These are the slippers and shampoos
you've been collecting.

107
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,763
Take them all and get some sleep.

108
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,266
I heard they are not free.

109
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,303
If I don't use the minibar in a suite,

110
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,038
it will be embarrassing when I check out.

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,743
I can't eat this anyway
because it has peanuts in it.

112
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,446
No, it doesn't.

113
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,083
"This product was produced in the factory

114
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,718
that produces peanuts."

115
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,891
Take the hotel limousine.

116
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,227
-I can take a bus.
-Just do as I say.

117
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,096
You're a guest in a suite.
Don't embarrass me.

118
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,199
Don't walk to the bus stop
carrying a bag full of slippers.

119
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,503
Call me when you get home.

120
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,938
Okay.

121
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,441
Go.

122
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,576
I'm going.

123
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,979
Just go. Go home.

124
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,593
Why?

125
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,530
Why don't you drive her home?

126
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,734
What kind of boss
drives his secretary home?

127
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,315
"I should be sorry

128
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,585
to have that voice fall silent

129
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,721
and pass out of my life."

130
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,189
Do you remember?

131
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,525
It's Mark Twain.
We wrote an essay about it in college.

132
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,160
The diaries of Adam and Eve.

133
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,195
What kind of poetic nonsense is that?

134
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,997
Looking at you being like that,

135
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,099
I just remembered this quote.

136
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,436
Watching Ms. Jeong leave,

137
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,472
you seemed really sad.

138
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,576
You're crazy.

139
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,946
We've been through a lot together
for the past two weeks.

140
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,648
It's my camaraderie toward my secretary.

141
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,450
She stayed in a suite for the first time.

142
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,751
It's my love for humanity.

143
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,454
And it's philanthropy of Do Min-ik

144
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,689
who loves all human beings.

145
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,493
Are you sure it's not dating?

146
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,663
There's someone else I'd like to date.

147
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,998
Is there?

148
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,600
Who is it?

149
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,905
The thing is...

150
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,009
I didn't even know

151
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,912
I'd grow to like her this much.

152
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,414
When I think of you,

153
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,418
my stomach feels somewhat heavy.

154
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,289
I think I have indigestion.

155
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,393
Every time I look at her,
my heart starts pounding.

156
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,563
It feels like my blood pressure goes up.

157
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,398
Is she pretty?

158
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,037
She's pretty.

159
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,972
It's a little strange though.

160
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,808
Her voice sounds familiar.

161
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,011
Even when I first met her,

162
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:49,715
it felt like she knew me.

163
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,018
You totally fell for her.

164
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,352
Hey.

165
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,456
You should call her.

166
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,592
Let me hear her voice.

167
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,028
The stockholders' meeting is tomorrow.

168
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,462
I don't have time for this.

169
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,064
Just go.

170
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,366
I know you want to tell me
that you're going to quit.

171
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,802
You can just at least call her.

172
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,506
Here.

173
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,242
Did I borrow money from you?

174
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,444
I did, from your mom.

175
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,147
She lent me this
knowing I was in need of money.

176
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,817
Give my thanks to your mom.

177
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,857
And make sure to be well prepared.

178
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,930
Even if I quit, you will still be...

179
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,067
You know Cho PD's song.

180
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,502
"Friend."

181
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,577
Hurray!

182
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,718
Isn't this a perfect place for a date?

183
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,288
It's a perfect place to sign.

184
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,426
If I sign this document,

185
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:11,163
I wonder what I can get from you.

186
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,865
Even if I don't get you anything.

187
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,034
you already have everything you need.

188
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,336
Even though I have everything I need,

189
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:21,073
I don't have anything that came from you.
That's why I'm asking.

190
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,844
I can buy you a meal if you don't mind.

191
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,515
A meal for 100,000 shares?

192
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,252
I guess that's not bad.

193
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,955
As you already know,

194
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,390
I like stuff with rip-off prices.

195
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,265
By the way,

196
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,635
am I signing the power of attorney

197
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,570
to oppose

198
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,307
the dismissal of Director Do Min-ik?

199
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,743
Are you saying you can't trust me?

200
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,412
I mean I can't trust myself.

201
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,883
There have been like 12 times
when I made wrong choices

202
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,119
because of men.

203
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,455
If that's the case,
you don't have to worry.

204
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,590
I've never lost my reason

205
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,125
because of women.

206
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,161
Too bad.

207
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:21,667
I just forgot how to sign.

208
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,210
This is how.

209
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,750
When are you buying me a meal?

210
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,120
I don't like to pay in advance.

211
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,761
I hope you will spare the time
to meet me tomorrow.

212
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,097
I'll treat you to a meal
after the stockholders' meeting.

213
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,166
Yes.

214
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,036
I checked the file, and nothing's wrong.

215
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,972
No. You don't have to come.

216
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,974
I'll bring it there.

217
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,215
MEDIA TEAM 2
DIRECTOR GI DAE-JU

218
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,016
You are

219
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:15,521
feeling sleepy now.

220
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,491
You are

221
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,095
sleeping now.

222
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,235
You're asleep.

223
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,808
You're asleep.

224
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,913
Gosh, I just can't fall asleep.

225
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,599
Mr. Do.

226
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,670
We get two new pairs
of slippers every day.

227
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,941
I need new ones every other day,

228
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,876
so can I take the rest?

229
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,444
Thank you.

230
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,001
We spent way too much time together.

231
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,352
Of course I love the hotel buffet
even more than myself.

232
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,287
But it's not like

233
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,856
I can't let you eat there
every single day.

234
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,825
I'll cook

235
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,261
at least one meal a day for you.

236
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,564
"At first,

237
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,468
I thought she talked too much."

238
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,583
BOSS

239
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,729
Hello.

240
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,731
Are you sleeping?

241
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,266
Yes.

242
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,936
I'm sleeping.

243
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,071
After spending two weeks together,

244
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,940
you feel like your boss is your friend.

245
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,011
I told you to call me when you get home.
Did you forget it?

246
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,813
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:58,617
I got home safely.

248
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:00,719
All right then.

249
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,622
I can't sleep
because of the stockholders' meeting.

250
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,358
And my secretary is sleeping just fine?

251
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,360
Is it what a secretary would do

252
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,995
to help her boss become the CEO?

253
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,197
I must say

254
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,500
you have no respect for your boss.

255
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,435
It's like the tail wagging the dog.

256
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,337
What did you say?

257
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,075
You're the one who sent me home.

258
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,678
And it's not my fault
that you can't fall asleep.

259
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,813
Why don't you

260
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,049
blame me for your constipation?

261
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,018
I don't have constipation.
That's disgusting.

262
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,789
I could tell
while we spent a few days together.

263
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,259
You flushed the toilet
three times at once.

264
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,360
And you stayed in there

265
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,062
for at least 30 minutes with your phone.

266
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,197
Do you even know

267
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,033
that I look haggard
because of bad smell, not overwork?

268
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,635
The bad smell

269
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,904
didn't come from me.

270
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,874
It's the hotel pipes.

271
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,711
I do feel like I owe

272
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,415
a debt of gratitude to you.

273
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,151
I wasn't going to say this,

274
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,120
but you can't call me at this hour.

275
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,590
Obviously, this is a breach of contract.

276
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,992
Once the stockholders' meeting is over,

277
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,028
I'll take a few days off
and turn my phone off.

278
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:20,265
I'll go someplace with a fine view
and have some soju with grilled clams.

279
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,134
"But now

280
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,037
I should be sorry

281
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,674
-to have that voice fall silent"
-Mr. Do?

282
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,510
-"and pass out of my life."
-Hello?

283
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,979
-"Wheresoever she was,"
-Hello?

284
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,948
-"there was"
-Hey!

285
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,017
-"Eden."
-Mr. Do?

286
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:46,825
THE DAY OF T&T MOBILE
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

287
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,031
Will you say something?

288
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,767
Did you eat?

289
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,204
Yes. I ate what you cooked.

290
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,640
Good.

291
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,548
You should put something on your face.

292
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,682
What?

293
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,091
Your skin is all flaky.

294
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,403
Don't be nervous.

295
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,908
You know what your boss is like.

296
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,177
I'm perfect except that
I can't recognize people's faces.

297
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,217
So you don't have to worry.

298
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,297
What are you talking about?

299
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,199
You heard me.

300
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,101
I'm withdrawing the power of attorney.

301
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,306
It hasn't even been 24 hours.
What made you change your mind?

302
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,350
Did I tell you that?

303
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,688
I'm more ambitious than you think.

304
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,442
Please go ahead first.

305
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,314
I was hoping not to see you here.

306
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,884
Don't say anything sweet like that.

307
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,088
I'm a very optimistic person,

308
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,324
so I'll think it means that you want
to see me somewhere else.

309
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,494
If you are here to see me,
we can go somewhere else.

310
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,798
Not you. I'm here to see
your so-called wifey.

311
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,701
As you might know, I'm not naive enough

312
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,169
to ditch my work

313
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,138
just for some romance.

314
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,042
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

315
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,150
Who are these humble guys?

316
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,689
I asked you not to come to the company.

317
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,725
It's not like we wanted to come here.

318
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,028
We just checked some data

319
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,631
and perceived you to be

320
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,300
a flight risk.

321
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,335
Did you borrow money from a loan shark?

322
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,938
I'm sorry, but please go inside first.

323
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,375
Call me anytime if you have a problem.

324
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,011
A kind loan for the commoners.

325
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,657
Gosh, she's tiring.

326
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,428
Do you want to talk here
or go to the police station?

327
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,832
The T&T Mobile stockholders' meeting
will begin soon.

328
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll go to the police station
after the meeting.

329
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,738
I have to finish this no matter what.

330
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,907
We will wait outside.

331
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,545
If the board irresponsibly ignores
workplace violence,

332
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,581
it will encourage power abuse
within the company

333
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,216
and demoralize the employees.

334
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,818
Therefore, the board has decided

335
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,753
-to discuss the dismissal
-Don't get nervous, Gal-hee.

336
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,688
-of Director
-Mr. Do says he can do a good job.

337
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,423
Do Min-ik at today's meeting.

338
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,292
Sir.

339
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,463
Yes. Please go ahead.

340
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,569
I'd like to hear Mr. Do's opinion
regarding the matter.

341
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,876
I second the motion.

342
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,623
What is she doing here?

343
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,959
Ms. Park.

344
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:15,627
It's nice to see you here.

345
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,696
What are you doing here?

346
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,398
I heard Park Ok-sun...

347
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,133
Don't you dare call me by my real name.

348
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,368
I'm going to change my name.

349
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,140
This is not good.

350
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,810
What if they run into each other here?

351
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,546
Run into whom?

352
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,848
What?

353
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:43,221
This may sound strange,

354
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,257
but if you're only here
to see what's going on,

355
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,392
can you please leave?

356
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,262
You might think this is fun,

357
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,297
but to me, this is
a matter of life and death.

358
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,899
Yes, it does sound strange,

359
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,767
and no, I'm not leaving.

360
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,671
I don't know how many stocks you own

361
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,907
or whether you want to attack your boss

362
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,242
or you want to help him.

363
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,846
But whatever it is you want,
can you get it with the means you have?

364
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,282
I, on the other hand,

365
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:14,152
only need to make one gesture

366
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,022
to destroy or save your boss's life.

367
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,258
I can do anything I want with it.

368
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,660
No problem.

369
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,197
What do you say?

370
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,932
Do you still want me to leave?

371
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:29,701
As requested, let's hear Mr. Do's position

372
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:33,205
before we decide
whether he should be dismissed.

373
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,147
Should I leave or not?

374
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,106
Please don't resign, Mr. Do.

375
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,910
So please don't give up.
Fight your way to the CEO position.

376
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,678
I'll help you.

377
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,891
No. Please stay.

378
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,826
Please stay.

379
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,729
I almost missed something fun.

380
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,366
It's okay, Jeong Gal-hee.

381
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,402
Just trust him and focus on him.

382
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,373
Even if they run into each other,
nothing will happen.

383
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,241
He can't see her face anyway.

384
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,655
GOOD LUCK

385
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,338
I can see them.

386
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,482
Mom.

387
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:26,585
Dae-ju.

388
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,188
Uncle.

389
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,625
Ms. Jeong.

390
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,304
Who is that woman?

391
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,174
What are you doing?

392
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,576
If you have nothing to say,
go back to your seat.

393
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:54,579
Oh, okay.

394
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,781
T&T MOBILE EXTRAORDINARY
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

395
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,441
You're the best. Good luck.

396
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,750
First, I'd like to apologize

397
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,887
for having caused
the stockholders so much anxiety.

398
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,958
I believe I deserve to be criticized
for such an inconsiderate behavior

399
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,093
as a company executive.

400
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,997
But there's one thing
I can tell you without shame.

401
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,968
I swear I never assaulted anyone
in the manner of power abuse.

402
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,170
And I, Do Min-ik, was
never legally punished

403
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,905
in any way

404
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,707
for this matter.

405
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,176
What kind of crap is that?

406
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,883
Who is she? Isn't she Mr. Do's secretary?

407
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,118
Why is she attacking her boss?

408
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,987
Let me attack you.

409
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,257
Are you crazy?
You're supposed to protect me.

410
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:13,892
Why would you attack me?

411
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,894
I should attack you to protect you.

412
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,330
Crows are painted in white

413
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,399
and calling egrets crows.

414
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,035
What do you think we should do
to reverse the situation?

415
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,738
What should we do?

416
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,640
We should go to the crows

417
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,376
and pretend we are crows too.

418
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,045
Then we can wash off their white paint.

419
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,881
And we will see who are real crows.

420
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,185
Why do you keep talking about punishment?

421
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,288
It's not like
you have to be legally punished

422
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,990
to sully the company's dignity.

423
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,960
There have been numerous articles

424
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,463
that claim what you did is power trip.

425
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,800
Don't you think it counts
as sullying the company's dignity?

426
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,938
Oh, is that so?

427
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,177
What do you think, Mr. Lee?

428
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,746
Me?

429
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,584
That would be open to interpretation.

430
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,219
But these days,

431
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:17,388
various incidents and accidents happen.

432
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,992
So I believe maintaining dignity

433
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:26,231
should be interpreted in a broader sense.

434
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,239
Then I'd like to watch this video
with you.

435
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:43,047
The video you are watching is

436
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,951
what Mr. Lee's former secretary
recently posted on her social media.

437
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,990
"I don't want to brag about it,
but I can do it without drugs."

438
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,894
"You are my personal entertainer,
Ms. Lee."

439
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,162
-Darn it.
-"Can you

440
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,430
come over to my hotel room for a moment?"

441
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:00,632
My goodness.

442
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,933
-What is he doing?
-He's crazy.

443
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,968
-Is that real?
-Gosh.

444
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,538
Let's watch the next video.

445
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,775
This is a video about a case of serious
power abuse in a parking lot

446
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,544
that was reported on the news recently.

447
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:17,749
The man threw trash to the security guard
just because he opened the gate late.

448
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,317
Why would he have
so much trash in his car?

449
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,418
Let's zoom in.

450
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,021
Oh, no.

451
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:25,824
It's Mr. Woo.

452
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,128
-Gosh, that's incredible.
-Seriously?

453
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,163
This video is so famous

454
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,199
that all of you have already
must've watched it.

455
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,367
The PR department had to spend

456
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,469
more than ten million won
to have this video deleted,

457
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,339
but it's still going viral online.

458
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,941
It's so-called...

459
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,345
"the video of a crazy guy
from T&T Mobile."

460
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,747
I'm the director of this company!

461
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:55,653
My goodness. Just turn it off!

462
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,188
I can't believe this.

463
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,698
This is so embarrassing.

464
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,501
I have two more videos
about other directors.

465
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,607
Due to an interruption
to the power supply,

466
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,809
I'm afraid I should wrap it up.

467
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,311
Darn it. I was having fun.

468
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,646
He's good.

469
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,883
You just said maintaining dignity
should be interpreted

470
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,952
in a broader sense these days.

471
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,624
I agree

472
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,726
-with Mr. Lee.
-I agree.

473
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,796
A stockholders' meeting is so fun
when things are ugly.

474
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,832
Who wrote the scenario? Did you?

475
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,602
Quiet. We still have one more left.

476
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,072
Even though they have seriously
sullied the company's dignity,

477
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,175
the directors didn't even
offer stockholders

478
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,744
a word of apology.

479
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,579
I'd like to take this chance

480
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,950
to offer my sincere apologies to everyone

481
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,220
on behalf of the directors here.

482
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,096
Are the other directors
not going to apologize?

483
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,400
-Apologize.
-What are you waiting for?

484
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,468
Go ahead and apologize.

485
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:20,405
You should apologize immediately.

486
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,006
Aren't you going to apologize?

487
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,574
Apologize now.

488
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:28,112
-This is ridiculous.
-What are you doing now?

489
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,087
-I can't believe this is happening.
-Goodness.

490
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,722
Let's wrap things up

491
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,824
-and put the matter to the vote.
-Sir.

492
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,566
What is she trying to do?

493
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,504
Ms. Park, the next line is very important.

494
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,541
Director Do needs me
to read the next line.

495
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,977
A scenario doesn't always go
as the writer planned.

496
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,279
Viewers' opinions
should be reflected as well.

497
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,847
Gosh, you can't do that.

498
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,249
Put your hand down now.

499
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,354
Yes, you may make a comment.

500
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,626
All stockholders' meetings
are always messy.

501
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,529
And I'm well aware
that there are directors here

502
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,631
who are even worse than you.

503
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,569
So what are you trying to say?

504
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,038
You don't want to go down alone,

505
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,307
so you're dragging them down with you?

506
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,748
I'm trying

507
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,183
to save all of us.

508
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:42,353
I think I should be punished

509
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,455
for having caused trouble for the company.

510
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,392
But can't you punish me in a different way

511
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,595
other than dismissal?

512
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,398
After Chairman Do Wan-bae's

513
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,434
sudden death in 2016,

514
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,071
the stock price of T&T Mobile
plummeted by 21 percent.

515
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,607
But last year, the IPTV service

516
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,376
that Director Gi Dae-ju
and I are in charge of

517
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,578
has successfully attracted new customers,

518
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,247
and the stock price climbed to 40,000.

519
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,748
And we could

520
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,751
see hope.

521
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,888
If you want to punish me,

522
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,424
please do so by letting me work.

523
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,028
I'll make up for the trouble I've caused
with the stock price.

524
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:26,764
Getting you more money

525
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,567
is the punishment

526
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,003
I should be getting

527
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,705
as well as my duty.

528
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,323
You will save him, right?

529
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,496
My boss will make things happen
once he makes up his mind.

530
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,700
He will never let you lose your money.

531
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,169
Please trust me.

532
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,838
Since when did you like him?

533
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:09,006
What?

534
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,576
You like your boss.

535
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,179
What do you mean?

536
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:20,017
Your eyes are not asking me
to save your boss.

537
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,887
It's more like they are asking me
to save your man.

538
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,224
Well... It's not like that.

539
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,093
We've been working together,

540
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,062
so I respect him as my boss--

541
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,832
If that's how you look
when you admire someone,

542
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,902
I guess you will just melt the statue
of Admiral Yi Sun-sin in Gwanghwamun.

543
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,573
You never know how you look
by looking into a mirror.

544
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,909
Only people around you can see it right.

545
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,379
Hey, I wish I could bring some lame actor

546
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,415
and let him see how your eyes look now.

547
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:56,420
To tell him that this is exactly
how you look when you are in love.

548
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,892
Who's that bitch?

549
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,728
It's Park Seok-ja, your mom.

550
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,131
Chairwoman Park, hello.

551
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,234
Is this a school reunion or what?
Why are you chatting away here?

552
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:11,736
Just stand up.

553
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,339
We should go and say hello
to Chairwoman Sim and Mr. Do.

554
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,608
Let me see.

555
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:22,713
I think I saw Mr. Do somewhere here.

556
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:26,784
Mr. Do.

557
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,452
Who was the woman sitting next to you?

558
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,488
Why did she ask questions?

559
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,123
Just get in there.

560
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,791
VOTING BOOTH

561
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,730
Jeong Gal-hee, what are you doing now?

562
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,500
-What are you doing?
-I'm not sure.

563
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,236
What am I doing now?

564
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,605
We spent two weeks together,

565
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,508
so now you want to vote together?

566
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,077
Do we have to do that in this small booth?

567
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,179
Just go ahead and do it.

568
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,817
Actually, I have a place to go.

569
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,319
A place to go?

570
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,092
Here. Let's go.

571
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,660
Wait.

572
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,206
Now. We should go. Please hurry.

573
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,344
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

574
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,551
Please excuse her.

575
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,353
I should've

576
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,922
taught her some manners
when she was young.

577
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,957
You know it, right?

578
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,827
I was so busy working for T&T Mobile

579
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,428
that I didn't have time

580
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,364
to take care of my daughter.

581
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,435
And your daughter made Seokja Corporation

582
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,705
into the biggest
cultural company in the company.

583
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,278
Nice to meet you. I'm Sim Hae-ra.

584
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,716
I heard you are getting along with my son.

585
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,152
I am?

586
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:14,091
So did he tell his mother
that I was actually there?

587
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,359
Yes.

588
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,063
As if you two actually met last night.

589
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,534
Well... Yes.

590
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,605
My daughter doesn't usually attend
meetings like this.

591
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,242
But she came here to meet your son today.

592
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,011
Oh, is that so?

593
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,014
Then you should say hello to him.

594
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,949
Where did he go?

595
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,121
Where are you going?

596
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,559
-Give me your phone.
-What?

597
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,027
Just give it to me.

598
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,632
Mr. Do...

599
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,141
Get in.

600
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,177
Where are we going?

601
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,578
It's still working hours.

602
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,780
Are you refusing to come with me?

603
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,116
Get in.

604
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,489
How are the stockholders?

605
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,057
Is everything all right?

606
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,160
I guess a few of them are shaken.

607
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,496
But they are just small investors.

608
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,866
The major stockholders have already
made up their minds.

609
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,268
We're already done calculating
the votes in favor.

610
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,703
You don't have to worry.

611
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,173
The problem is

612
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,310
that we don't know
what the lady would vote for.

613
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,446
Let me get this straight.

614
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,282
If I go to your stockholders' meeting

615
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,018
and vote for you,

616
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,287
you will come to our stockholders' meeting

617
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,757
and vote for my consecutive appointment?

618
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,459
So it's like I scratch your back
and you'll scratch mine.

619
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,827
Let's say it's a friendship.

620
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,129
I should never be inhospitable

621
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,031
to someone to whom I'm indebted.

622
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,666
Do you know

623
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,369
I recently purchased
another 80,000 stocks of Cinepark?

624
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,242
Ms. Park.

625
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,311
Gosh, Mr. Sim.

626
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
Make sure to do your math right.

627
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,117
Don't get swayed by something useless
and lose your money.

628
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,519
Of course.

629
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,456
I don't want to make a wrong choice

630
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,426
because of a guy 13 times.

631
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,207
Your destination is 2km away.

632
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,943
Where are we going now?

633
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,347
Will you at least give me back my phone?

634
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,216
How dare you touch me?
Keep your hands off me.

635
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,151
Are you kidnapping me?

636
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:57,455
Your wish is to have some soju
with grilled clams

637
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,957
after the stockholder's meeting.

638
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,361
Listen, Mr. Do. I'm the one

639
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:06,764
who feels extremely nervous and afraid

640
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,799
to be at the meeting.

641
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,802
But I don't think we should be doing this.

642
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:12,903
Just turn the car around.

643
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,539
Would this help you relax?

644
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,543
We have another good reason
to have a celebration party

645
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,078
besides the stockholders' meeting.

646
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,314
What is it?

647
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,490
I can see them.

648
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,836
T&T MOBILE EXTRAORDINARY
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

649
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,377
I will announce the results of the vote.

650
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:59,750
A total of 125,116,807 stocks
participated in the vote.

651
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,420
And a total of five thousand...

652
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:16,467
Here.

653
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,569
Do you want me to grill them?

654
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,271
Sure. Do you want me to do it?

655
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,540
Your boss just drove you all the way here.

656
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,675
You should be grateful.

657
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,778
I guess you are mistaken about something.

658
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,381
When I said I wanted to eat grilled clams,

659
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,016
I meant I wanted to do it

660
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,585
with someone I like
listening to the sound of waves.

661
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,287
I didn't want to put on these gloves

662
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,156
and grill clams for my boss.

663
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,797
Here. Would this work?

664
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,944
You know the flash drive I told you about?

665
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,646
I looked for it everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

666
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,548
-You couldn't?
-No.

667
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,351
I'm sure I put it in my drawer,
but it's not there.

668
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,588
I have the copy
of the file in my laptop though.

669
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,091
It was in the suit you wore
on the day of the accident.

670
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:16,093
I was afraid it might be broken.

671
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,237
The result should be out by now.

672
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,313
If you won, this is a celebratory drink.

673
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,950
If you didn't,
it should be a consolation drink.

674
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,425
Therefore, dismissal
of Director Do Min-ik...

675
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,161
RESULTS OF THE VOTE

676
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,504
MISTER'S GRILLED CLAMS

677
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,039
What are you thinking about?

678
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,276
Even in this peaceful scenery,

679
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,580
a human's mind can be so complicated.

680
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,415
What about you?

681
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,486
I'm glad that I came here with you.

682
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:26,163
Grilled clams taste great
when my secretary cooks them.

683
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,271
They look so happy.

684
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,073
Aren't they fighting?

685
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,408
They are having fun.

686
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,143
The face of the woman says...

687
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:47,317
You never know how you look
by looking into a mirror.

688
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,787
Only people around you can see it right.

689
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,589
She's right.

690
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,062
Now I can see what she looks like.

691
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,231
See what?

692
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,701
Nothing.

693
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,371
What is it you were trying to say earlier?

694
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,872
Besides the meeting,

695
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,642
we have something else to celebrate.

696
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,447
The thing is,

697
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:20,484
on the stage, even though
it was only for a short period of time...

698
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,986
Hang on.

699
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,521
GI DAE-JU

700
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,525
The result must be out.

701
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,594
Answer it.

702
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,697
Just answer the phone.

703
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,304
Where are you?

704
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,572
Yes.

705
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,607
Okay.

706
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,843
Okay. Bye.

707
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,650
What did he say?

708
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,319
Ms. Jeong.

709
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,290
Is the bird flying over there
is a seagull or a wild goose?

710
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,359
Gosh, Mr. Do.

711
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,228
What is it?

712
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,864
Was the drink we had earlier

713
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:08,999
a celebratory drink?

714
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,969
Or a consolation drink?

715
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,879
A celebratory drink.

716
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,550
"A celebratory drink"?

717
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,720
Congratulations, Mr. Do.

718
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,321
I'm so happy for you.

719
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,305
You did a great job, Ms. Jeong.

720
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,927
I have a gift for you.

721
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,698
I was going to give it to you
before the result came out.

722
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,101
Here.

723
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,038
Open the trunk.

724
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:56,273
The trunk?

725
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,443
Why did you keep a gift in the trunk?

726
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:10,053
MISTER'S GRILLED CLAMS

727
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,655
Gosh.

728
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:16,260
Are there a thousand roses
and a thousand balloons in the trunk?

729
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,030
I don't like a surprise like that.

730
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,604
What? There's nothing.

731
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,407
There is something. Look carefully.

732
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,677
What's in there?

733
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:40,617
Is this it?

734
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,260
T&T MOBILE STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

735
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,962
Min-ik gets to stay.

736
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,968
Well done, Min-ik.

737
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,073
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

738
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,584
Mr. Gi Dae-ju?

739
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,854
Where are we having dinner tonight?

740
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,458
I think I deserve something
for my 100,000 stocks.

741
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:24,261
-But...
-But?

742
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,900
Did I tell you this?

743
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,269
I'm a jerk.

744
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,205
Even worse than you think.

745
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,845
I'm sorry, but I can't have
dinner with you tonight.

746
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,421
He's so attractive.

747
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:05,235
Well... I'm really nervous.

748
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,738
Can I just open it here?

749
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,874
I told you to open it when you get home.

750
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,744
Gosh, I'm so curious.

751
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,278
How much would it be?

752
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,813
How much?

753
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,583
Isn't this money?

754
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,621
In your common sense,
the only thing that can be in an envelope

755
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,456
is money?

756
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,059
Can't you expand your mind?

757
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,963
No way.

758
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:35,432
Is it a handwritten letter?

759
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,870
It's the most useless thing.

760
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:45,142
If you had something to tell me,
you could've texted me.

761
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,879
Gosh, just open it.

762
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,281
Gosh.

763
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,455
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

764
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,157
A contract?

765
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,997
I'm going to say this only once,
so listen carefully.

766
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,499
I had a secretary.

767
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,468
Three years ago.

768
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,507
I trusted and relied on my secretary.

769
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,177
But at the most important moment,

770
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,914
she deceived and betrayed me.

771
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,351
That's when I started trying my best.

772
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:30,153
I decided

773
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,689
not to trust my secretary anymore.

774
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,060
I know

775
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,864
I tried to fire you, hated you,

776
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,400
bullied you, and gave you a hard time.

777
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,837
But it's not like I hated you.

778
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:50,273
I hated that secretary.

779
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,145
It's her who deceived me.

780
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,381
It wasn't even your fault.

781
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,720
Still,

782
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:07,124
I was afraid you'd be like her.

783
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,328
I just did it because I was worried.

784
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,534
If I did anything to upset you,
please try to understand me.

785
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,706
And if you are interested,

786
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,209
I'd like to renew our contract.

787
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,946
What do I do?

788
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:32,983
I'm deceiving you too.

789
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,154
You'll see once you read it.

790
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,991
"As soon as my disease
is cured, the contract

791
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:42,993
between you and me will be terminated."

792
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:48,331
I changed this article
into something better.

793
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,270
THE CONTRACT WILL BE TERMINATED
WHEN THE EMPLOYEE ASKS

794
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,540
"The contract will be terminated

795
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,376
when the employee asks."

796
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,615
Mr. Do.

797
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,586
What do you think? You feel thrilled,
and your heart is pounding, right?

798
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,959
Why? It's the only thing
you wanted from me.

799
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,395
Stable employment.

800
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,165
I can imagine

801
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,501
what your face looks like now.

802
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,439
For your boss
who can't read your expression,

803
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,777
can you explain to me
about the look on your face

804
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,178
in details?

805
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,314
Well...

806
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,351
The thing is...

807
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,922
I'm smiling.

808
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:50,227
With a beam of satisfaction.

809
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,567
I have a wide grin on my face.

810
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,872
The middle of my forehead is smoothed.

811
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:10,046
And I got wrinkles around my eyes.

812
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,415
Because I smiled so much.

813
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,094
If...

814
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,097
What if...

815
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,603
What if I'm deceiving you too?

816
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:36,740
What?

817
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,375
What if

818
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,712
there's something I'm lying to you about?

819
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,858
Then...

820
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,361
I will never

821
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,866
be able to trust others
for the rest of my life.

822
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:08,972
Hang on.

823
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,841
Hello?

824
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,844
You did a good job. Where are you?

825
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,213
I stepped outside for a bit.

826
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,950
We're going to have dinner.
I want you to come.

827
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,919
"We"? Who are you with?

828
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,621
Did you not see her earlier?

829
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:28,625
Veronica says she came here to see you.

830
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,162
Veronica came to see me?

831
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,765
Yes. Okay. Bye.

832
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,535
What do I do?

833
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,072
Are you going?

834
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,808
How long does it take
to get to Seoul from here?

835
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,109
Is there heavy traffic?

836
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:50,980
Please don't go.

837
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,616
What?

838
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,152
I don't want you to go.

839
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,088
Why?

840
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:04,661
I don't know where I should begin.

841
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,097
Whether it's an excuse or explanation,
I'll hear it later.

842
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,633
Shall we just go now?

843
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,672
Do you want to see her that badly?

844
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,140
Did you not hear me?

845
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,943
Veronica came to see me.

846
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,248
I want to go. I want to see her.

847
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,958
Okay.

848
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,494
You should go.

849
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,931
Instead of hearing it from me here,

850
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,002
you should go and see it yourself.

851
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,671
That's right.

852
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,853
Hurry.

853
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,004
What? Aren't you getting in?

854
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,040
I'm not going.

855
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,575
What?

856
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,945
I'll stay here and sober up.

857
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,547
You go first.

858
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,788
The sun is setting soon.

859
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,924
How would you go home by yourself?

860
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,295
I put a bottle of water
on the passenger seat.

861
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,297
Drink it when you're thirsty.

862
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,366
You're almost running out of gas.

863
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,236
Make sure to fill it up
before getting on the expressway.

864
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,739
Don't drive too fast
because you're in a rush.

865
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,441
And...

866
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,480
Well...

867
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:09,419
When you're talking to Veronica Park,

868
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,557
you might want to hear something from me.

869
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,995
Then feel free to call me anytime.

870
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,899
I'll tell you everything.

871
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,069
Do you know that you're being
really strange now?

872
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,607
You said a bottle of soju
isn't enough to get you drunk.

873
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,980
You should go
before the traffic jam becomes worse.

874
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,149
Did you meet Veronica Park?

875
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,083
Let's end it.

876
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,252
The relationship between your boss and me.

877
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,722
Does this mean you don't want to work
for me

878
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,023
-anymore?
-Yes.

879
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,258
"Yes"?

880
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,260
Ms. Jeong.

881
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:01,364
Can you stay by my side?

882
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,268
