1
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,542
Don't you know how guys talk?

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,310
Don't you know what they really mean?

3
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,780
Do you think I actually asked you to come
because of indigestion?

4
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,733
"I was passing by" means,

5
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,768
"I missed you."

6
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,904
"I'm wondering what you're up to" means,

7
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:12,605
"I'm dying to know."

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,375
Wouldn't indigestion be along the lines

9
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,510
of those?

10
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,913
Haven't you heard the rumors?

11
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,083
They say I'm a slutty party girl.

12
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,884
I don't believe rumors.

13
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,052
I'm horrible when I'm angry.

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,187
Same here.

15
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,589
I go all the way with every guy I see.

16
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,559
That must mean I have a chance too.

17
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,793
Goodness.

18
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,032
No.

19
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,702
I might give all the other guys
in the world a chance,

20
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,204
but not you.

21
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't like you.

22
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,644
You like every guy but me?

23
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,647
Yes, every guy but you.

24
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,155
I hope I've made myself clear.

25
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,057
Bye.

26
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,807
GI DAE-JU

27
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,346
If you called to say
you're quitting, hang up.

28
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,915
Letting two people go in one day...

29
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,985
What?

30
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,221
I hit a person?
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,757
What? The message board?

32
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,228
-"The message board"?
-Okay. Bye.

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,470
I saw Mr. Do Min-ik assaulting his driver.

34
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,405
What? Someone saw that?

35
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,377
The board meeting is tomorrow.
This has to be stopped.

36
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,247
I SAW MR. DO MIN-IK ASSAULTING HIS DRIVER

37
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,386
Why is he just standing there?

38
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,157
Gosh.

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,776
Well...

40
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,380
I'll help you.

41
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,549
Pardon?

42
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,821
Is this really the right thing to do?

43
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,959
I'm the CEO of the company that
controls this country's movie industry.

44
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,661
Do you think I've never experienced
a problem like this?

45
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,598
You have to find the person
who posted it as quickly as possible.

46
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,867
And then explain what happened
and ask him to delete it.

47
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,904
Before everyone comes to work
and sees it tomorrow morning.

48
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,672
What if

49
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,177
I did hit the person?

50
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,379
But you didn't.

51
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,315
You trust me?

52
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,420
What should I do?

53
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,958
I keep thinking

54
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,162
you might not dislike me
so much after all.

55
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,006
I think we've found the place.

56
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,712
Yes, we have.

57
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,760
Who is it?

58
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,377
Is he coming back at all?

59
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,012
Yes, he is.

60
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,749
He's been at a relative's funeral,

61
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,686
but he should be back soon.

62
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,026
I can't decide.

63
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,230
Part of me wants you to go home
because it's cold,

64
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:35,535
and part of me wants you to stay with me.

65
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:46,212
If I go home, you'll call your secretary.

66
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,082
It makes absolutely no difference to me.

67
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,650
My secretary?

68
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,453
Bosses in this country

69
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,557
call up their secretaries
whenever the slightest problem arises.

70
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,525
They should stop being so weak.

71
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,428
I wasn't going to call my secretary.

72
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,863
Why not?

73
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,231
Well...

74
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,167
I want her to rest.

75
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,905
She took the afternoon off today.

76
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,074
She was going to meet someone

77
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,043
and looked all excited about it.

78
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,478
I was meeting you, idiot.

79
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,646
If she comes here,

80
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,149
she'll have to beg the man to save me.

81
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,719
I'm a bit different

82
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:29,856
from other bosses to begin with.

83
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,024
She has

84
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,328
a lot to deal with at work as it is.

85
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,298
I don't want to ask her to come here
at this hour on top of everything else.

86
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,768
I'm not going to call her.

87
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,312
It is a bit cold.

88
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:05,525
Mother birds protect their babies

89
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,529
under their wings when it's cold.

90
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:13,800
No way.

91
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,207
Meanwhile, penguins in Antarctica

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,143
huddle together like this

93
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,879
to keep warm.

94
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,683
That's what animals do.

95
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,785
What do humans do then?

96
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,888
What about this?

97
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,234
When your fingers warm up,

98
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,137
your capillaries expand,

99
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,806
and it helps blood circulation.

100
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,710
If you ever get lost in the mountains,

101
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,513
this is what you're supposed to do.

102
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,282
What do you think?

103
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,153
I think I'm getting warm.

104
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,364
Why isn't he here yet?

105
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,813
He's the person I saw

106
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,482
on the intranet earlier.

107
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,392
Do you think you can handle it alone?

108
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,362
I'm afraid I have to go.

109
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,164
Of course. Don't worry.

110
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,669
Thank you so much for today.

111
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,707
Can we meet again--

112
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,009
No.

113
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,846
-We can't?
-No.

114
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,949
Okay.

115
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,997
Is that true?

116
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,666
It's absolutely true.

117
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,968
"Did you meet a girl?" "Yes."

118
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,269
"Did you meet Veronica?"

119
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,672
"Yes." He said that.

120
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,442
He did look a bit tired,

121
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,378
but that's probably because
he's so energetic...

122
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,084
Are you saying
your son and my daughter are

123
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,787
in love?

124
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,056
Oh, my.

125
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,357
What's wrong?

126
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,560
Are you sure it's going well between them?

127
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,463
Good morning, Mom.

128
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,636
Just a second.

129
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:09,175
It looks like you didn't sleep well.

130
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,546
The dark circles under your eyes
are reaching

131
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,481
all the way down to your stomach.

132
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,383
On that note,

133
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,585
if you're not busy,

134
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,488
can you tie my hands?

135
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,557
My hands keep trying to

136
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,326
call the guy.

137
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,096
It's best to tie them up.

138
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,931
That punk.

139
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,969
He sure knows how to control a woman.

140
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,372
Hello.

141
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,240
-Mom!
-What is it?

142
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,609
Can you scoop my eyes out too?

143
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,246
They can't stop staring at my phone.

144
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,082
Can you please take them away?

145
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,285
Easy, easy.

146
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,621
Mom!

147
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,758
No.

148
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,526
Stop.

149
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,895
Wait.

150
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,731
Listen carefully.

151
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,136
Your son should stop calling my daughter
altogether for the time being.

152
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,104
He should be

153
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,874
sweet like candy for a little while

154
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,476
only to push her away coldly.

155
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,079
It'll practically make her go crazy

156
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,315
to the point where she feels sick.

157
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,119
As if there were mushrooms

158
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,289
growing in her heart.

159
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,758
Okay, I got it.

160
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,308
See you at the board meeting.

161
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,046
Remember to put work
before dating for now.

162
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,282
Yes, Mom. See you later.

163
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,322
The baby cuckoo that used to be this tiny

164
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,990
has become so big now.

165
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,060
It can even ruin the most perfect plans.

166
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,831
What do you mean?

167
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,904
You waited for me until so late
because of that?

168
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,742
I'm afraid you got the wrong idea.

169
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,744
If you can't trust me,

170
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,012
I'll give you my driver's phone number.

171
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,215
You can ask him directly.

172
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,917
That's okay. I'll delete it.

173
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,053
Will you?

174
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,521
The thing is,

175
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,424
as soon as I posted that,

176
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,228
I got a call that my uncle passed away.

177
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,563
It made me feel so guilty.

178
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,833
This is why you should never do
a wrong thing.

179
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,271
Was it you?

180
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,040
I want some more soup!

181
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,509
Okay.

182
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,798
You pervert!

183
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,736
Oh, no!

184
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,704
Shame on you.

185
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,107
Get your dirty hands off my armpits!

186
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,310
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

187
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,145
I didn't get much sleep last night.

188
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,182
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

189
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,084
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

190
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,654
Excuse me. Coming through.

191
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,590
I didn't get enough sleep, that's why.

192
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,295
Darn it.

193
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,765
What on earth did he do to his armpits?

194
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,502
I can't seem to remove
the smell of whelks.

195
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,137
My hands feel rotten.

196
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,408
Your skin is glowing.

197
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,810
Good morning, Mr. Do.

198
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,913
It's what a good night's sleep
can do to you.

199
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,249
I know you can't see it.

200
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:13,452
Do you have any idea

201
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,588
what it was like for me last night?

202
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,823
It was cold and dark.

203
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,525
The morning dew--

204
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,527
So what happened?

205
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,761
Forget it.

206
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,364
I'm glad at least you slept well.

207
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,635
You know what today is, right?

208
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,307
-Let's get going.
-Okay.

209
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:00,432
Curly hair, taller than 170cm...

210
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,767
He must be Mr. Lee.

211
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,602
-Good job.
-Nice.

212
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:10,476
Hair pushed back, 176 to 177cm tall...

213
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,288
Hello, Mr. Kim.

214
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,123
You didn't have to meet me here.

215
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,592
You always support me.

216
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,994
This is the least I can do for you.

217
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,736
Mr. Park. Mr. Woo.

218
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,607
No one would guess
you'd have prosopagnosia.

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,109
But it's not enough
to be able to tell them apart.

220
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,412
-The problem is facial expressions.
-"Facial expressions"?

221
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,714
At a board meeting,
you have to read people's minds.

222
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,249
Speaking of which,

223
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,619
both Mr. Kim and Mr. Park look

224
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,321
a bit tense.

225
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,924
Mr. Park.

226
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,427
Why do you look so concerned?

227
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,429
Is it because your mother
is in the hospital?

228
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,763
Is her condition very bad?

229
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,533
That's Mr. Mind Reader talking.

230
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,637
Let's talk inside.

231
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,013
By eight votes to three in favor,

232
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,450
the motion for a patent license contract
with YK Ventures

233
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,684
passed.

234
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,387
Now that we've discussed all the items,

235
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,789
why don't we go for lunch?

236
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,124
Wait a second.

237
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,226
Sit back down.

238
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,294
Why?

239
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,662
Are we being thrifty

240
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,464
and getting lunchboxes instead?

241
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,233
Well, the thing is,

242
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,269
a video was sent to me this morning.

243
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:46,839
I got one too.

244
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,907
Me too.

245
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,142
-Me too.
-Me too.

246
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,677
I got one too.

247
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,680
What video are you talking about?

248
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,098
What is this?

249
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,300
Min-ik.

250
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,404
What's going on here?

251
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,774
Mr. Do must have had his reasons.

252
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,675
Right?

253
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:28,414
Yes. There's been a misunderstanding.

254
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,649
Of course.

255
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,452
It could have been alcohol or drugs.
There must have been a reason.

256
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,753
Mr. Park.

257
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,556
In any case, it's true
that Mr. Do hit his driver.

258
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,059
Now that the video has been sent
to all the directors,

259
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,428
it's a matter of time
before the press finds out.

260
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,732
Why did you have to hit your driver,
of all people?

261
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,700
These days, power abuse is
a very sensitive issue.

262
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,736
It can even lead to a boycott.

263
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,771
Please, Mr. Kim.

264
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,606
In the case of assault,

265
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,974
the offender isn't prosecuted

266
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,476
against the victim's objection.

267
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,078
Right, Mr. Lee? You're an ex-prosecutor.

268
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,747
What? I mean...

269
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,883
This isn't about whether
Mr. Do will be punished or not.

270
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,986
The image of our company is on the line.

271
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,490
To smooth things over,
I think you should step down.

272
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,791
Step down?

273
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:17,496
You all cover up your wrongdoings
all the time.

274
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,299
Who gives you the right
to tell me to step down

275
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,867
to protect the company image?

276
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,102
If you don't,

277
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,137
we'll have to take it
to the stockholders' meeting.

278
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,306
What is this all about?

279
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,075
Just because you managed
to drag him down three years ago,

280
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,443
do you think you can this time too?

281
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,179
It's best to keep things quiet.

282
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,614
Do the rest of you

283
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,617
agree with Mr. Park?

284
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,030
Do you

285
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,033
agree with him?

286
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,344
I can't see

287
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:10,215
who's trying to help me
nor how many are on my side.

288
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,018
I can't see anything.

289
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,092
What's taking so long?

290
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,427
Let's take a vote then.

291
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,631
A vote?

292
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,169
That'll settle the matter, Mr. Chairman.

293
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,437
Goodness.

294
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,875
Do we really have to go that far?

295
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,977
I can't believe these people.

296
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,014
Are we electing a block captain here?

297
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,184
Six. I need at least six votes.

298
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,486
I know Mom has no choice
but to be on my side.

299
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,421
So are those two.

300
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,025
Mr. Lee might change his mind
and decide to support me.

301
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,894
Anyway, either Mr. Lee or Mr. Kim
will vote for me.

302
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,298
Dae-ju is definitely on my side,
so I'll get at least five votes.

303
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,934
Six isn't impossible.

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,470
If you're against the idea,
you can always step down.

305
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,005
No. Let's take a vote.

306
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,473
Min-ik.

307
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,177
Mr. Chairman, please go on.

308
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,181
All right.
The situation is very unfortunate,

309
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,150
but we'll have to take a vote.

310
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,688
Out of 11 directors,
more than 6 have to be in favor

311
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,556
for the motion to pass.

312
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,994
Let's start with Mr. Woo over there.

313
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,387
Mr. Lee.

314
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,170
Only five are in favor.

315
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,439
That means it's rejected, right?

316
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,607
Hold on.

317
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,776
There's one person left.

318
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,716
Are you for his resignation

319
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,852
or against it?

320
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,260
Mr. Gi.

321
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,537
I'm in favor.

322
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,819
Ms. Jeong, can you excuse us?

323
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:04,156
Sure, Mr. Gi.

324
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,877
What is going on?

325
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,246
Many unbelievable things
have been happening lately,

326
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,683
but this just doesn't make any damn sense.

327
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,186
A few days ago, you were quitting.

328
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,022
And today you kicked me out of the board.

329
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,423
Take it to the stockholders' meeting.

330
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,791
What?

331
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,027
Even if you don't step down, those people

332
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,197
will find something on you
before the CEO election

333
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,733
and drag you down. Don't you know that?

334
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,905
What if I lose then too?

335
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,173
What makes you think you will?

336
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,342
It's not like you're sick or anything.

337
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,246
Three years ago, they could use
your illness as an excuse.

338
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,848
But you're fine now.

339
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,451
The meeting has to be attended
by a third of the stockholders.

340
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:08,487
There's a chance it'll be canceled.

341
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,956
Then there's only two months left
until the CEO election.

342
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,291
It's not likely
another meeting will be held.

343
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,761
Even if a meeting is held,

344
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,498
if the motion is rejected there,
the board can't do anything about it.

345
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,539
If you care about me so much,
let me ask you something.

346
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,478
Why are you quitting?

347
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,485
Tell me.

348
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,503
Well...

349
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,041
I went to the police station yesterday.

350
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,179
You did after all.

351
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,782
What did you tell them?

352
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,251
I told them the truth.

353
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,953
Yes, Mr. Gi.

354
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,558
-I'll come a bit late tomorrow.
-Hwangcheon Intersection, 500m ahead.

355
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,426
Turn left at Hwangcheon Intersection...

356
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,596
That I had to visit my mother
urgently that day...

357
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,805
and I never met you.

358
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,644
I heard, Boss.

359
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,448
I'm sorry. I'll look for it again.

360
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,620
So they took a vote,

361
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,122
and no less than six directors
voted in favor.

362
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,024
So what will happen?

363
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,392
What else?

364
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,061
If the stockholders decide
to dismiss Mr. Do,

365
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,629
he'll have to forget about
the CEO position

366
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,364
and leave.

367
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,968
In most cases,
they step down voluntarily though.

368
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,004
Ms. Lee.

369
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,307
-Hello.
-Hello.

370
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,511
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry,

371
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,080
but I have to go now. I'm sorry.

372
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,020
Where is she going in such a hurry?

373
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,555
You haven't heard?

374
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,724
A video of Mr. Do beating up his driver
was revealed

375
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,058
at the board meeting.

376
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,963
There's a video?

377
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,533
-Kick him out right now.
-Mom.

378
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,803
Didn't you see Dae-ju
raise his hand at the meeting?

379
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,641
You tend to trust people blindly.

380
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,011
Do you still trust people
after what happened three years ago?

381
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,748
3 YEARS AGO

382
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,249
Gloripen Capsule.

383
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,653
Mr. Park, how did my prescription
get into your hands?

384
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,089
Do you know
what this medicine is used for?

385
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,959
It treats secondary symptoms
of cerebrovascular diseases

386
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,727
and degenerative mental disorders,

387
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,630
which include Alzheimer's

388
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,532
and the after-effects of brain diseases.

389
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,335
Is he still mentally unstable?

390
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
He isn't fully recovered?

391
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,171
An Alzheimer's patient
can't run a company.

392
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,007
-This is not okay.
-His brain is not normal?

393
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:18,643
I said, you're fine.
Why do you keep coming here?

394
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,881
Take a closer look and make sure
I'm perfectly normal. Please.

395
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,850
Like I said,
the CEO election is coming up.

396
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,485
If you're so concerned,

397
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,754
you could try taking this.

398
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:30,922
What is it?

399
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,992
It's supposed to improve brain functions.
Consider a health supplement.

400
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,761
It's usually what test-takers
come and ask for.

401
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,265
I knew you'd give me something.

402
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:45,470
PRESCRIPTION

403
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,007
Ms. Kim.

404
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,211
I fully recovered more than ten years ago.

405
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,047
That medicine was prescribed to prevent--

406
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,716
"A person whose

407
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,218
physical or mental condition is
not fit for the task

408
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,487
cannot be elected the CEO."

409
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:05,991
That's our policy, as you probably know.

410
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,629
You had no idea your secretary
was going behind your back.

411
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,297
You were so blind

412
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,366
that you even wanted to give her
permanent employment.

413
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,502
Poor people sell you out for chump change.

414
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,011
Meanwhile,

415
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,948
rich people take advantage of you
to get even richer.

416
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,153
Ma'am, I don't need dinner.

417
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,058
I didn't eat,

418
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,027
but I'm full.

419
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:50,035
Cuckoo, cuckoo in the mountain

420
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,803
The mountain in the back...

421
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,972
Resign before the stockholders' meeting.

422
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,674
I'll think about it.

423
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,809
Step down.

424
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,712
Before that damn video humiliates you
in front of everyone.

425
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:03,348
Gi Dae-ju, your driver, your secretary...

426
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,483
Replace everyone around you too.

427
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,322
Since when does a secretary

428
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,325
show up at her boss's place
and tell him to come out?

429
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,995
Are you going to step down?

430
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:55,834
Don't.

431
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,137
Does a secretary

432
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,208
usually give her boss an order?

433
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,811
Not the other way around?

434
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:10,215
Let's switch just today.

435
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,017
I'd like to give you an order.

436
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,787
Please don't resign, Mr. Do.

437
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,622
If I step down as a director,

438
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,792
it's true that I can't be the new CEO.

439
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:23,094
However, I'll still keep a position
in the company,

440
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,864
so you don't have to worry
about losing your job.

441
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,933
Do you think that's what this is about?

442
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,101
What is it about then?

443
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,008
You were amazing.

444
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,881
You swallowed your pride and came to me.

445
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,151
And you asked me to come back.

446
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,955
You said you wouldn't let your illness
drag you down

447
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,958
and would push through it.

448
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:59,664
You memorized all the employees'
heights and hairstyles all night.

449
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,334
In the end, you made no mistakes
in front of the other directors today.

450
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,911
What's with you? I'm flattered.

451
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,549
When you're flattered, I'm flattered too.

452
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,185
When you get depressed,

453
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:23,855
I get depressed too. That's my job.

454
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,592
So please don't give up.

455
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,328
Fight your way to the CEO position.

456
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,497
I'll help you.

457
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,302
If my boss is amazing,

458
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,538
I can be amazing too.

459
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,613
Let him take his time.

460
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,281
It's not an easy announcement to make.

461
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,551
I'm hungry. I'm starving.

462
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,019
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

463
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,277
About my resignation...

464
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,447
Yes, it's best to do it now.

465
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,082
You made the right choice.

466
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,417
Let's wrap things up here

467
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,721
go for some ox bone soup around here.

468
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:30,922
I'm not resigning.

469
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,257
What?

470
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,094
Min-ik. What are you talking about?

471
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,530
My uncle, who is also my lifelong mentor,

472
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,332
did not give up three years ago

473
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,169
and is still as tenacious as ever.

474
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,040
I, being much younger than him,
shouldn't give up so easily.

475
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,010
In addition, I have a new supporter now,

476
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:53,945
who is determined to make me the CEO.

477
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,549
From now on, I'll fight as hard as I can.

478
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,818
Let's wait and see

479
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,921
who wins.

480
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,074
I did it.

481
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:24,575
That's great.

482
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,545
So what do we do now?

483
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,014
First of all, let's move our office.

484
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,718
We never know if we're being spied again.

485
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,755
Jung-hee, I'm home!

486
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,992
You came home
while the sun is still up, ma'am.

487
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,696
What are you doing?

488
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,197
It's for me, right?

489
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,033
The sleeves are a bit too long though.

490
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,972
Hey, did you hurt yourself?

491
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,216
Was it in this bag?

492
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,456
It's my boss's.

493
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,959
I knew it. The fabric felt
absolutely gorgeous.

494
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,761
Take it off right now!

495
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,098
How could you put this on?

496
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,770
The shirt... Didn't you think
the shirt smelled like blood?

497
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,275
I should've taken it to the dry cleaner's.

498
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,411
Why did I forget it?

499
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,714
What's that sound?

500
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,455
Is this Mr. Do's?

501
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,823
Gyeon-u!

502
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,793
I'm a girl after all, I guess!

503
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,896
Gyeon-u!

504
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,565
I'm sorry!

505
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:01,539
AUDITION FOR MY SASSY COURT LADY

506
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,714
Ms. Park.

507
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:15,920
Your mom tells you
you're pretty, doesn't she?

508
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,556
She tells you
you're prettier than Jun Ji-hyun

509
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,125
and could become an actress
even more popular than her.

510
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,728
Why don't you just tell me I suck
straightforwardly?

511
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,997
Bringing up my mom is too low.

512
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,366
Yes, you suck. Next!

513
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,835
-Is that it?
-That's it.

514
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,138
Not only did you mess up
but you also lost your temper.

515
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:35,640
What did you expect?

516
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,376
That's because you attacked
my weak spot, old lady.

517
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,211
"Old lady"?

518
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:41,479
Calm down, Ms. Park.

519
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,048
You need to calm down, Ms. Park.

520
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,752
You just attacked my weak spot!

521
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:51,589
Am I neither a person nor a woman?

522
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,458
You can't discriminate
against me like this!

523
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,359
I'm the one who got discriminated against.

524
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,395
You didn't look at me once the whole time.

525
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,629
Your eyes were on your phones!

526
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,299
Are you saying that's my fault?

527
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:06,137
Blame yourself for failing
to win my attention.

528
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,639
Do you know how humiliating it is
to mess up

529
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,274
at a big audition like this?

530
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,910
Hoping I'll be a star one day,
I lied to my big sister

531
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,745
and ran away from home

532
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,114
only to blow the audition.

533
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,583
And why would you bring up my mom
when she's dead?

534
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,518
Did you have to make me feel so miserable?

535
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,088
I do appreciate your audacity.

536
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,193
Is that what you wanted to hear?

537
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,963
Hey, you're here to audition,

538
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,731
to show your acting skills.

539
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,067
This is no place to get emotional
to win pity.

540
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,370
Also, did you run away from home
believing you were talented?

541
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,874
Was that really a smart choice?

542
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,879
Well, I'm sorry I brought up your mom.

543
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,848
Now it's your turn to apologize.

544
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,784
I'm sorry, old lady.

545
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,587
What am I supposed to call you then?

546
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,190
Just call me "woman."

547
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,760
"I'm sorry, woman."

548
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,731
I'm sorry, woman.

549
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:07,865
Next!

550
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,273
Is this it?

551
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,942
Is it 010-6421?

552
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,345
I deleted his number,

553
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,514
but my brilliant brain still remembers it.

554
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,584
It's phone number one, right?

555
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,953
The VIP phone.

556
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,488
It's phone number ten.

557
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,390
The phone for blocked numbers and spam.

558
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,825
So who is it?

559
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,460
It's Mr. Sim Hae-yong.

560
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,971
You'll be informed about
the stockholders' meeting in a few days.

561
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,741
Please do attend it this time.

562
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,377
I'm not coming.

563
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,448
If I attended
every single stockholders' meeting,

564
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,518
would I have time to date and drink?

565
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,821
What if Mr. Gi will be there?

566
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,424
I hear things are going well
between you two.

567
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,527
Did he say that?

568
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,997
Did he say things are going well
between us?

569
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,233
Yes, he did.

570
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,801
What will he do at the meeting?

571
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:20,471
So why don't you stop by
and say hi to Mr. Gi?

572
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,174
What's even better would be
writing a power of attorney.

573
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,178
Ms. Park, it's that number! 6421!

574
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,213
Bye.

575
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,124
I don't recognize the number. Who is this?

576
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,727
It's me, Gi Dae-ju.

577
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,829
Can I see you for a moment today?

578
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,768
This is the first time
I've ever been in a hotel suite.

579
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,171
Did you have to ruin
the aesthetics of your first

580
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,906
six-star hotel suite in your life

581
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,608
with that rice cooker?

582
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,646
You could've enjoyed a hotel buffet,
which you love more than yourself.

583
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,016
I did pack elastic waist pants
for the buffet.

584
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,817
Still, we couldn't eat
at the buffet every day

585
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,352
until the stockholders' meeting.

586
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,787
It'd cost too much.

587
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,025
I forgot the flash drive.

588
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,027
The flash drive?

589
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,696
The suit you were wearing
on the day of your accident

590
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,331
had a flash drive in it.

591
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,434
What are you talking about?
I took it from Dae-ju's place.

592
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,870
That can't be.

593
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,373
I swear it was in that paper bag.

594
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,345
Your room is here.

595
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,494
Well, what should I do with the car?

596
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,098
You don't have to come to work
for the time being.

597
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,233
Mr. Do will stay here for a few days.

598
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,570
Then I'll drive you home.

599
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:01,972
No. That's okay.

600
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:03,808
Well...

601
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,078
You two are working so hard.
I'd like to help.

602
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,349
Please let me drive you home.

603
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,858
What should I say first?

604
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:24,128
If I start with my performance,
I might come across as cocky.

605
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,231
But starting with an apology
would be too boring, right?

606
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,335
What would she do in this situation?

607
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,205
Who?

608
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,977
Do you mean Veronica Park?

609
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,316
It's just that she's
more experienced than I am.

610
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,858
Why do you like her?

611
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,726
What do you mean, I like her?

612
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,097
What makes you think I do?

613
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:04,902
Do you think
your boss would fall for a woman

614
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:09,140
he only just met?

615
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,147
I mean, this is the first time

616
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,250
you've asked for a woman's phone number
after a blind date.

617
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,556
Come on, she has more money than I do,

618
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,793
she has a more powerful family than I do,
and she's more competent than I am.

619
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,861
What's the surprise?

620
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,732
My dating life is none of your business.

621
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,537
Wake me when the rice is ready.

622
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,106
I haven't been sleeping enough lately.
I'm so tired.

623
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,621
What if...

624
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,192
she has

625
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,461
no money,

626
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,664
her family is a burden,

627
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,667
and she's incompetent.

628
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,604
Then you would never have
fallen for her, right?

629
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:18,108
Mr. Do?

630
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,046
Hello?

631
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,682
All the things I've done wrong

632
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,618
and everything I owe you...

633
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,888
I'll make it up to you by working hard.

634
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,626
So please stop liking her.

635
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:15,132
If you like her and suffer because of her,

636
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,768
it hurts me.

637
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,407
Gosh.

638
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,178
I'm not asleep.

639
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,482
Did you hear what I said?

640
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,855
Why are you so simple?

641
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,458
I couldn't possibly fall asleep so fast.

642
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:43,494
I mean...

643
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,764
If you weren't asleep,
why didn't you say anything?

644
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,867
I was half-asleep. Almost asleep.

645
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,638
Oh, are you hurt?

646
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,174
Didn't you say,

647
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,311
"It hurts me" or something?

648
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:06,150
I mean my wrist. It hurts so much.

649
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,787
After washing up all the dishes,
my wrist is killing me.

650
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,790
I should probably soak it
in warm water for a minute.

651
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,734
You know how Veronica Park looks, right?

652
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:27,905
Don't you?

653
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,542
Well, I do.

654
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,215
Is she pretty?

655
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,619
Why do you ask?

656
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,187
Is she pretty or not?

657
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,559
If I say she's pretty,
you'll like her even more.

658
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,027
Can you

659
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,463
describe her face in detail?

660
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,232
How do her eyes look?

661
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,868
Her nose?

662
00:43:58,569 --> 00:43:59,903
And what about

663
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,072
her lips?

664
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,309
Can you?

665
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:10,914
Her eyes look...

666
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,451
ordinary.

667
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,188
Her nose

668
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,724
is quite ordinary too.

669
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,427
There's nothing special about it.

670
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,097
Her lips...

671
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,806
I'd say her lips look best.

672
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,843
In any case, she's pretty.

673
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,180
There are many people

674
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,283
whose job is to make her look pretty.

675
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:49,753
Clothes designed only for her

676
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,455
let her flaunt her body.

677
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,091
Shoes made not for walking in

678
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,060
but for looking at

679
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,562
give her a flawless silhouette.

680
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,664
More than anything,

681
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,833
she owns a coat

682
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,302
not everyone gets to have.

683
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,206
It's woven with money,

684
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,974
sewn with rich parents,

685
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:14,945
and coated with competence.
It's called "confidence."

686
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,815
It's invisible,

687
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,051
but everyone can see it.

688
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:26,423
That's why she can exude
self-assurance and beauty at all times.

689
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,331
I'm a mess, aren't I?

690
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,867
I auditioned some people today

691
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,336
and had to deal with this annoying brat.

692
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,739
I didn't even have time
to put on lipstick.

693
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,009
But you somehow managed
to get some lipstick

694
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,345
on your teeth.

695
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,917
I'm suddenly so hungry.

696
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:04,995
Sim Hae-yong tells me to come
while Gi Dae-ju tells me not to.

697
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,198
What is really going on in that company?

698
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:12,469
I wonder who's on whose side.

699
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,372
Please, I beg you.

700
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,208
It's for a friend who's like a wife to me.

701
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,746
Are you asking me to help your wife
or something?

702
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,414
Isn't that so shameless?

703
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,650
Are you going to do it
only if I keep seeing you?

704
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,418
Are you going to be mean again?

705
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,188
You only want to see me
when you have a favor to ask.

706
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,990
Don't you think that's even meaner?

707
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,726
What if I'm only using this
as an excuse to see you?

708
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,929
Gosh, whenever I'm with you,

709
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,431
I get so stupid. Isn't that strange?

710
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,502
-Six o'clock.
-Six o'clock.

711
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:48,572
The alarm has gone off.

712
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,208
How about we start
getting a little romantic?

713
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,343
Ms. Park!

714
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:56,914
Good evening, ma'am.

715
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:02,519
No way. Is this restaurant yours too?

716
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,721
Really? That's what you think?

717
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,959
This whole building is mine.

718
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,329
Then let's eat somewhere else.

719
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,666
It'll cause the staff unnecessary trouble
if the owner of the building eats here.

720
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,203
But if we eat somewhere else,
it'll cause me unnecessary trouble.

721
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,572
I know a nice sushi place near here.

722
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,674
I could even pay
with my personal credit card

723
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,676
since they have reasonable prices.

724
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,947
Is that your way of saying
their food is not that good?

725
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:33,550
I think anything tastes good
if I'm with a person I like.

726
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,255
Is that your way of saying

727
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,324
I'm a person you like?

728
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,292
It's a hypothesis.

729
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:47,064
It's only an "if."
If I'm with a person I like.

730
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:51,034
You know what? I'll turn that hypothesis

731
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:53,470
into a reality.

732
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,405
Let's go.

733
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,349
Mr. Do.

734
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,719
There are hair ties and a sewing kit
in the bathroom.

735
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,289
I'll take them home
since you probably won't need them.

736
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,658
Thank you.

737
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,164
Gosh, I got wet.

738
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,337
Are you asleep?

739
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,707
Or are you half-asleep again?

740
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,983
You should sleep in your room.

741
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,222
It looks like you really are asleep.

742
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,260
Your head is drooping.

743
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,354
I can see you.

744
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,589
Pardon?

745
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,958
In my dream,

746
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,594
I can see you.

747
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,464
But you're not...

748
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,202
You're pretty.

749
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:37,841
Do I look pretty to you?

750
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,878
Yes, you do look pretty.

751
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,483
Even without money?

752
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,688
Even without buildings?

753
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:01,365
Even without parents?

754
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,107
I hope this isn't a dream.

755
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,750
Wait.

756
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,651
This isn't a dream?

757
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,788
No, it isn't.

758
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,991
Why are you so simple?

759
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,927
You couldn't possibly
start dreaming so fast.

760
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,463
The thing is,

761
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,699
for a second,

762
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,769
I thought you were Veronica.

763
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,805
I'm your secretary, Ms. Jeong.

764
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,242
You don't even know how Veronica looks.

765
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,745
Exactly. It's just...

766
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:54,818
I had this weird feeling for a second.

767
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,722
I'll be here at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

768
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,323
See you.

769
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,127
Stay.

770
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,004
Sleep over.

771
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:25,348
I'll go home. You can sleep here.

772
00:51:28,785 --> 00:51:31,421
No way. You don't have to be
so nice to me.

773
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,990
Am I being nice to you? Do you think so?

774
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:38,428
This is all about the marginal utility.

775
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,598
I sleep here all the time,
but you've never done it before.

776
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,768
It'd give you a lot more satisfaction
than it'd give me,

777
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,036
economically speaking.

778
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:53,810
Stand up.

779
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,219
Where is it?

780
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,065
What are you doing?

781
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,301
It's the thing you talked about earlier.

782
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,403
The coat of confidence

783
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,105
or whatever it's called.

784
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,710
While you stay here for a few days,

785
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,011
keep that coat on.

786
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,182
To be clear, I'm not trying
to be nice to you here.

787
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,417
I'm doing this for my own good.

788
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,487
Keep your confidence up
until the stockholders' meeting

789
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,323
so it can rub off on me.

790
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,995
The spa opens at 10 a.m.

791
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,097
The breakfast buffet is from 6 a.m.

792
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,336
Don't forget to lock the door.

793
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,622
I was expecting Ms. Jeong.

794
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:15,425
She'll stay here for the time being.

795
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,295
Can you take me home?

796
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,796
Yes, sir.

797
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,552
I'm Jeong Gal-hee in the suite.

798
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,389
Yes, you do look pretty.

799
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,198
I do look kind of pretty.

800
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,601
It's as if I'm really her.

801
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,137
For a second,

802
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,008
I thought you were Veronica.

803
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,011
What if...

804
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:10,814
No way. I hope not.

805
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,923
So this is how it feels

806
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,891
to be looking down from high up.

807
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,195
It's nice.

808
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,273
2 WEEKS LATER, THE DAY OF
T&T MOBILE STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

809
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,441
Maybe we picked the wrong day.

810
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,543
You never know.

811
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,886
Why do you look so nervous?

812
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:51,688
Who says I do?

813
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,558
I'm just hoping
the meeting will be canceled.

814
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:57,994
Don't count on that.

815
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,364
If not enough people were coming,
they wouldn't have even started.

816
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,809
-What are you doing?
-It's just

817
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,412
that your heart is beating so fast.

818
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,381
Maybe you should've taken your medication.

819
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,650
What are you talking about?

820
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:21,751
I'm just worried

821
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,921
there will be more faceless people
than I've ever seen in one place.

822
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,157
It's just a little flinch, that's all.

823
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,026
It's a good thing.

824
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,528
What do you mean?

825
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,997
Some people get so scared
in front of a big audience

826
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,732
they have to close their eyes.

827
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,468
But you don't see anyone's face anyway.

828
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,972
So on stage, fix your eyes on me.

829
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,240
In fact,

830
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,444
I do hold ten stocks myself.

831
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,612
Is that it?

832
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,748
Shall we?

833
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,116
Just a second.

834
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,095
I'm lending you my coat.

835
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,763
Please return it in a clean state.

836
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,540
Oh, there you are.

837
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,177
Not many people have shown up yet.

838
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,213
The meeting starts at 2 p.m.

839
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,182
Unless someone holding
over 100,000 stocks shows up,

840
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,751
the meeting might be canceled.

841
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:34,357
I hope she shows up.

842
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,528
If the board irresponsibly ignores
workplace violence,

843
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,698
it will encourage power abuse
within the company

844
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,666
and demoralize the employees.

845
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,802
Therefore, the board has decided

846
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,171
to discuss the dismissal
of Director Do Min-ik

847
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,074
at today's meeting.

848
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,109
Sir.

849
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:55,478
T&T MOBILE EXTRAORDINARY
STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING

850
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,415
Yes, please go ahead.

851
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,988
I'd like to hear Mr. Do's opinion
regarding the matter.

852
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,058
She's his secretary.

853
00:57:14,664 --> 00:57:16,166
I can't believe these people.

854
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,835
I second the motion.

855
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:32,715
Ms. Park.

856
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,250
It's nice to see you here.

857
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:36,686
What are you doing here?

858
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,422
It seemed like something interesting
was going on in this company.

859
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,424
I wanted to come and see it myself.

860
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,259
This is not good.

861
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:46,729
What if they run into each other here?

862
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,399
Run into whom?

863
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,901
What?

864
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,308
This may sound strange,

865
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,176
but if you're only here
to see what's going on,

866
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:02,312
can you please leave?

867
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,215
You might think this is fun,

868
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,484
but to me, this is
a matter of life and death.

869
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,152
Yes, it does sound strange,

870
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,987
and no, I'm not leaving.

871
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:13,490
Also, don't you remember?

872
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,160
I always say, everyone should be
taken advantage of.

873
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,096
I don't know how many stocks you own

874
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,499
or whether you want to attack your boss

875
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,968
or you want to help him.

876
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:28,738
But whatever it is you want,
can you get it with the means you have?

877
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,140
I, on the other hand,

878
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,944
only need to make one gesture

879
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,747
to destroy or save your boss's life.

880
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,150
I can do anything I want with it.

881
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,352
No problem.

882
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,855
What do you say?

883
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,690
Do you still want me to leave?

884
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,460
As requested, let's hear Mr. Do's position

885
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,897
before we decide
whether he should be dismissed.

886
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,907
Should I leave or not?

887
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,113
I can see them.

888
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,802
