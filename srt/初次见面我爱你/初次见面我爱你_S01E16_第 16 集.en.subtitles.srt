1
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,481
-Is it good?
-Yes.

2
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,384
This is even better than the amuse-bouche

3
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,952
I had before.

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,456
My tongue is melting,
and my throat is so excited.

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,258
And my stomach is thrilled.

6
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,094
Then have some more.

7
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,701
By the way, how did you convince Mr. Sim?

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,805
He wouldn't budge
even when we starved for days.

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,041
Let's finish this first.

10
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,749
You got porridge.

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,619
Hello, Mr. Sim.

12
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,390
I talked to Lee Eul-wang on the phone.

13
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,158
And I just met Gi Dae-ju.

14
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,061
As you asked me,
I rejected his resignation.

15
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,497
Thank you, Uncle.

16
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,199
I'm the one who should thank you.

17
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,968
Since you gave up on the CEO position,

18
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,338
things will be easy for me from now on.

19
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,685
What does that mean?

20
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,688
You gave up on the CEO position?

21
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,895
That crazy jerk.

22
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,432
So...

23
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,002
Did you give up on becoming the CEO
just to let me eat?

24
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,105
Let's just finish this first.

25
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,076
No. Forget it. I'm not eating!

26
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,713
Who told you to give up?

27
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,349
Why would you give it away?

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,317
Before you yell at me,

29
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:34,154
just have one more bite.

30
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,209
Mr. Sim.

31
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,611
Mr. Do is not going to give up
on the CEO position.

32
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,079
Please forget the whole thing.

33
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,448
-Stop it.
-I won't.

34
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,084
I don't care if I pass out or die.

35
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,120
I'll go on a hunger strike again,
so please forget it.

36
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,321
Ms. Jeong.

37
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,791
What a romantic melodrama at work.

38
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,593
Too bad.

39
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,762
I prefer a thriller with dramatic twists

40
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,430
that has betrayal and conspiracy.

41
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,838
I've suffered from indigestion
because of a cuckoo chick for 30 years.

42
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,307
And now the whole thing is...

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,075
Going down.

44
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,250
Why did you do that?

45
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,986
Who told you to do this?

46
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,488
I wouldn't have come this far

47
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,390
without your help anyway.

48
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,925
What kind of a boss are you?

49
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,597
You should be trying to become the CEO
using your secretary.

50
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,532
What kind of boss

51
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,301
would give up on becoming the CEO
for his secretary?

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,205
I didn't give up for my secretary.

53
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,442
I just did it for you.

54
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,211
I'm not happy to be loved this way.

55
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,216
It doesn't feel good at all.
It's just frustrating.

56
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,187
Mr. Sim is the one
who did the whole thing to Mr. Eun

57
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,557
and forced the secretaries
to sign illegal contracts.

58
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,560
How could you let him be the CEO again?

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,567
Do you think I just gave up
without thinking that through?

60
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,245
Hey, Mr. Sim. Did you hear that?

61
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,614
I'm on my way from the board office.

62
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,584
My gosh, thank you
for congratulating me in advance.

63
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,719
I guess you heard Mr. Do gave up.

64
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,222
It's true that he gave up.

65
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,858
But a new candidate just applied
before the deadline.

66
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,993
What do you mean?

67
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,279
T&T MOBILE CEO APPLICATION LETTER

68
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,751
CEO application letter?

69
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,655
You should do it.

70
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,391
What? I already handed in my resignation.

71
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,060
I'm referred
to the disciplinary committee.

72
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,462
You wouldn't have quit
if it weren't for me.

73
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,596
And I'll make sure

74
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,766
you won't be disciplined.

75
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,971
Here. This is the exclusive contract
you gave me.

76
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,606
I didn't use this card yet, so--

77
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,408
-Min-ik.
-Dae-ju.

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,211
You need only six votes.

79
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,382
You've already got two votes
which are from you and me.

80
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,253
If Mr. Do gets five votes,
it's a tie with Mr. Sim.

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,856
And the board should take a vote again
in two weeks.

82
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,992
-Mom wouldn't take your side,
-Is that right?

83
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,861
but she wouldn't vote for Uncle either.

84
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,596
So she might abstain.

85
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,700
Those who want Mr. Do
to be the nominee for CEO,

86
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,302
please raise your hand.

87
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,805
Ms. Kim and Mr. Yang

88
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,274
would never vote for Uncle.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,444
They've always supported my family
since my dad was alive.

90
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,514
I'd like to abstain.

91
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,682
Mr. Choe.

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,885
Mr. Choe abstained because of my illness.

93
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,720
But there wasn't a time
he didn't take my side.

94
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,656
So he will be persuaded for sure
if I support you.

95
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,058
It makes up five votes.

96
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,860
The variables are

97
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,729
Mr. Kwak and Mr. Woo who are being fickle.

98
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,998
But they support anything
that brings them money.

99
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,000
At least one of them

100
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,137
will be swayed by this contract.

101
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,839
What is going on?

102
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,842
Why are you trying so hard
to make me become the CEO?

103
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,046
I want to clear off my debt
about your mom's death.

104
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,815
That's one good reason.

105
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,653
And you might be able
to make a better CEO than me.

106
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,155
That's my hidden intention.

107
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,794
So, Mr. Sim,

108
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,130
did you keep him alive again?

109
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,001
That damn cuckoo chick.

110
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,410
Gosh, I guess you guys are going
to eat some gukbab again.

111
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,846
We already had brunch

112
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,748
with Mr. Kwak.

113
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,616
-We did, didn't we?
-We did.

114
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,052
He seemed

115
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,855
very interested in what we have.

116
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,359
Oh, right. We're meeting
with Mr. Woo tomorrow, right?

117
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,661
Yes, we are.

118
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,531
Please take good care of Mr. Gi then.

119
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,899
I'll see you at the board meeting.

120
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,670
Actually, it's very hot today.
Instead of gukbab,

121
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,905
I guess they should eat naengmyeon.

122
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,510
Please enjoy your meal then.

123
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,182
My goodness.

124
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,668
You're here.

125
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,938
What's with your attitude?

126
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,641
I don't know.

127
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,145
Maybe I'm upset
that someone else is becoming the CEO.

128
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,917
Dae-ju will do a good job.

129
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,020
Like what the secretaries said,

130
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,322
it's not like only the owner's family
member can become the CEO.

131
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,327
Dae-ju isn't one of the high-ups
like the other company owners.

132
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,497
He started from the bottom working hard.

133
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:55,801
So he will understand employees
better than anyone else.

134
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,103
Okay?

135
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,204
Still...

136
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:03,209
You could've consulted me at least once.

137
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,119
Did you see that?

138
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,921
What?

139
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,890
When did it come back?

140
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,592
It was amazing.

141
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,929
It really got better as I kept patting it.

142
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,931
To be honest,

143
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:28,501
I feel a bit bad myself about someone else
becoming the CEO.

144
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,470
So will you pat me a little?

145
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,241
I think I'll feel better then.

146
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,670
This is strange.

147
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,142
I'm getting better.

148
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:14,847
I'm fine now.

149
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,830
What do you think? How do I look?

150
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,298
Look, lady.

151
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,967
You should show it
to your boyfriend, not me.

152
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,670
Before I show it to my boyfriend,

153
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,106
I wanted you to see it.

154
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,009
I'm Veronica Park.

155
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,878
I don't want my boyfriend

156
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,648
to find out that I want to marry him.

157
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,583
Hey. By the way,

158
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,219
I look too sexy, don't I?

159
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,423
Dae-ju wouldn't need someone
who's too sexy like this.

160
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,825
Maybe I should
look more modest and innocent.

161
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,766
My sister would look great in this dress.

162
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,334
Can I take one of these with me?

163
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,803
-Is your sister getting married?
-Maybe she will.

164
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,171
With Mr. Do Min-ik?

165
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,241
He recently went on a trip with our family
and even slept together with us.

166
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,312
What's so great about her?
She always goes a step ahead of me.

167
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,982
I'll take this one.

168
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,151
Hey, do you even know how much it is?

169
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,587
It's the only Vera Wang's dress
in this country.

170
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,956
Then you can buy one more
from another country.

171
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,492
Can't you afford it?

172
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,194
I can.

173
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,797
There's nothing I,
Veronica Park, can't do.

174
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,069
Here. Take these.

175
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,906
There is only one pair of them
in this country too.

176
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,609
I can go abroad and buy them again.

177
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,817
You gave up getting married
and becoming the CEO.

178
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,319
How much do I have to put up with you?

179
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:03,989
It's not like I don't want
to become the CEO.

180
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,393
Going through the whole thing
about the secretaries,

181
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,696
I realized that I didn't know
enough about management.

182
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,232
When I feel like I'm qualified,

183
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,501
I will try again.

184
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,636
This isn't how you play house.

185
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,772
It's over if one quits.

186
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,778
I'm telling you to move out.

187
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,650
Can't I...

188
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,020
stay?

189
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,356
What?

190
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,258
If you don't let me,
I won't have a choice.

191
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,662
But I want to beg you one last time.

192
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,767
I've never done it for the past 27 years.

193
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,536
I was wondering
if you'd listen to me at least once.

194
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,138
Gosh.

195
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,709
I...

196
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,212
want to stay here.

197
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,283
As long as you're okay with it.

198
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,499
How does she look? Is she pretty?

199
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,134
How pretty is she?

200
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,571
Maybe it's because
I was on a hunger strike.

201
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,107
I guess I lost some weight.

202
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,811
I don't think I look bad.

203
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,380
Are you sure this is
one of the stage props?

204
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,649
It looks very expensive.

205
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:40,085
Actually, I got it
from Veronica Park's office.

206
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,787
-Hey!
-My goodness.

207
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,088
Why?

208
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,457
Let me take this off. Now!

209
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,060
Gosh.

210
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,231
Ms. Jeong?

211
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,935
Oh, dear.

212
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,672
Ms. Jeong, is it you?

213
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,377
Jung-hee, I told you
to keep the door closed.

214
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,783
Well... Mr. Do.

215
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,052
Hello, my brother-in-law.

216
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,788
Who's your brother-in-law?

217
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,157
If someone who buys me beef
isn't my brother-in-law,

218
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,859
who else would be?

219
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,896
By the way,

220
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,367
what are you doing here?

221
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,602
Well, the thing is...

222
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,938
I think my mom wants to be alone tonight.

223
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:34,974
So I got out.

224
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,141
You can stay over.

225
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,178
I'll go and get changed then.

226
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,512
Don't take it off.

227
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,049
Please take a picture of us.

228
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,452
We can do it later.

229
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,573
Please make sure our mom, dad,
and the family motto

230
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,908
are shown in the photo.

231
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,977
Okay.

232
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:20,319
One, two, and three.

233
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,459
I'll go and get changed now.

234
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:28,827
Wait.

235
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,963
Could you also

236
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,234
take a picture of us please?

237
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,871
Okay.

238
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,257
All right. Get ready.

239
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,527
One, two, and three.

240
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,465
One more time.

241
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,569
One, two, and three.

242
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,509
Ms. Jeong.

243
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,282
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

244
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,085
This dress.

245
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,422
Did you get it
because you want to marry me?

246
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,025
No, Mr. Do. It's nothing like that.

247
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,426
It's Nam-hee.

248
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,529
What? Are you saying
you don't want to marry me?

249
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,132
No, that's not what I meant.

250
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,867
Then it means you want to marry me.

251
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,804
Well... That's not it though.

252
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:53,178
I want to be alone tonight.
Will you get out of my room?

253
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:57,349
What? Don't be like that.

254
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,085
Say something, okay?

255
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,289
I'm asleep now.

256
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,468
Goodnight.

257
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,121
Mr. Do.

258
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,424
Do you mind

259
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,194
if Gal-hee walks down the aisle on my arm?

260
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,363
Pardon?

261
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,964
She grew up without parents.

262
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,470
I want her to look happy at the wedding.

263
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,447
Of course I want you to do that.

264
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,715
But...

265
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,322
I'm not sure if I deserve
to want things like that.

266
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,293
What do you mean?

267
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,931
Even though you are blind,

268
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,432
you seem confident all the time.

269
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,302
I've always been curious.

270
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,338
How could you be like that?

271
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,442
My mom told me two things
before she passed away.

272
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,678
"Patience is

273
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,781
a murder." And...

274
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,717
Make sure not to get distracted
by what you have lost

275
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,453
and always remember

276
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,889
what you're given.

277
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,774
Mom.

278
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,742
ONE MONTH LATER

279
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,612
We have a place to go to. Will you hurry?

280
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,614
My goodness.

281
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,483
Where on earth are we going?

282
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,720
Are we going
to an amusement park or something?

283
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,695
It's something more thrilling.

284
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,932
What do you mean?

285
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,737
Hello. I'm the 15th CEO,

286
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,071
Gi Dae-ju.

287
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,311
THE 15TH T&T MOBILE CEO
INAUGURATION CEREMONY

288
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,033
With the continual increase
in T&T Mobile's

289
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,069
IPTV subscribers, we will make sure
to develop our own contents

290
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,038
and see an increase
in the value of our stocks

291
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,307
through collaboration with companies
both at home and abroad.

292
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,643
And with the revised direction
for the integrated broadcasting act,

293
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,779
we will develop contents competitiveness

294
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,315
and become the country's best
contents mobile company.

295
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,482
Mr. Park.

296
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,585
Do you want to go to Cuba with me?

297
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,686
Cuba?

298
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,888
We can get an old car in Havana

299
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,692
and drive along the Malecon Beach.

300
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,562
And we can have some mojitos there.

301
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,464
Mojitos?

302
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,002
Gosh, I've been feeling
under the weather lately.

303
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,072
Shall I go there
and learn how to dance salsa?

304
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,975
"People before performance.
Love before competition."

305
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,644
With the new slogan of T&T Mobile,

306
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,281
we will make a company
that everyone wants to work for.

307
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,549
Thank you.

308
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,585
Please give CEO Gi Dae-ju
a round of applause.

309
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,993
This is the end of the 15th T&T Mobile
CEO Inauguration Ceremony.

310
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,464
-What should I do?
-Why?

311
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,400
I was going to turn the position
over to you in three years.

312
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,402
But standing on the stage,

313
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,138
I felt really great.

314
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,439
Don't be silly.

315
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,042
I'll drag you down in three years
no matter what.

316
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,344
Just make sure to pave
the way for me until then.

317
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,346
So everything will go smoothly

318
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,682
when I become the CEO.

319
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,329
Mr. Gi Dae-ju.

320
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,938
Do you see him, Mom?

321
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,176
That guy is my boyfriend.

322
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:55,447
He looks pretty good in the suit.

323
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,817
Are you going to approve of him?

324
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,687
He's just a puppet
who'll serve only for three years.

325
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,991
Hello, Ms. Park.

326
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,428
You listen to me.

327
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,964
You should let a boss
match with another boss.

328
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:17,436
You don't want to ruin the pure blood
by dating some hybrid.

329
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,245
What do we do?

330
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,448
It won't be easy to convince her.

331
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,719
I have a good idea.

332
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,887
We should

333
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,056
get old.

334
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,792
"Get old?"

335
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,595
Do you know
what frightens rich families most?

336
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,965
Having no descendants.

337
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:51,503
If we hold out until the last moment,

338
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,739
even Ms. Park Seok-ja will
have no other choice.

339
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,208
She will just want to marry me to anyone

340
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,243
no matter what his background is like.

341
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,480
That's not a bad idea.

342
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,052
-Mr. Gi.
-Yes?

343
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,388
This is from Ms. Lee Eul-wang.

344
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,690
Lee Eul-wang?

345
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,429
Who is she?

346
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:26,405
Thank you for letting me keep my promise

347
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,240
with your mom, Dae-ju.

348
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:33,445
And please make
a good company for us, Mr. Gi.

349
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,219
You didn't have to come all the way here.

350
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,756
I feel bad that I'm living at ease alone.

351
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,759
I'm sorry, Mr. Eun.

352
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,796
I heard from other drivers.

353
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,164
That you went through

354
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,067
a lot of hard times.

355
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,072
How are you doing?

356
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:05,644
I'm just thinking about many things.

357
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,481
I'm thinking of starting
project funding using stories.

358
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,986
I want to introduce the stories
of workers like you

359
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:19,257
who don't get any compensation
when their livelihood is being threatened.

360
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,627
I can collect donations to help them.

361
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,898
I was going to send
some money to your account,

362
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,900
but it was full already.

363
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:30,936
Well...

364
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,774
I guess Mr. Do sent me some money.

365
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,581
If you ever get to see him,
please tell him this.

366
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,351
If he doesn't mind,

367
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,387
I'd like to visit him
as soon as I'm released

368
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,824
and thank him.

369
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,034
So this is the sushi.

370
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,937
With a very reasonable price.

371
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:09,407
I bought it to celebrate my inauguration.
Please enjoy it.

372
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,876
Thank you.

373
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,114
Why are you doing that?

374
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,949
You should break the habit first.

375
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,051
It's a bad habit
that you always take care of others first.

376
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,521
Whose fault do you think it is?

377
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,489
Give me that. I'll do it.

378
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,924
Why are you doing that?

379
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,627
Give me. Let me do it.

380
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,794
What?

381
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,731
Why would you let
Mr. Gi do chores like this?

382
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,800
Give me that.

383
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,502
I'll do it.

384
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,679
And I have something for Mr. Gi.

385
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,048
I prepared this.

386
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,083
Ta-da.

387
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:58,723
Oh, right.

388
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,726
I have a bottle of champagne chilling
on the first floor. Ms. Kim...

389
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,830
My secretary quit again.

390
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,098
I'll go and get it.

391
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,001
Stay seated and don't do anything.

392
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,169
I'll go.

393
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,004
Why would you run an errand?

394
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,906
Stay here. I'll go.

395
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,378
I hate it when you waste

396
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:23,281
your thighs on something else.

397
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,850
Save them for me.

398
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,387
You guys stay here.

399
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,357
I, Veronica Park,

400
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,860
will go get it myself.

401
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,966
My gosh.

402
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,134
Ms. Jeong.

403
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,650
Do you really want to stitch it up?

404
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,185
What should I do then?

405
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,988
Without this, you can't recognize my face.

406
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,691
Let's just throw it away.

407
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,193
What are you talking about?

408
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,294
It's hot these days.

409
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,496
You can't be wearing the cardigan forever.

410
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,567
Just throw it away.

411
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,337
Gosh, no.

412
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,083
What do you think?

413
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,852
Can you see my face?

414
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,430
What about this one?

415
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,536
What do I do?

416
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,172
I tried them all, but none of them works.

417
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,476
Ms. Jeong. Calm down.

418
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,145
You can put on something

419
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,280
that helps me recognize you
for the time being.

420
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,582
Well...

421
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,619
Oh, right. What about earrings?

422
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,790
The one you used to wear
when you impersonated Veronica Park.

423
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,825
Oh, that one.

424
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,960
I threw them away this morning

425
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:18,463
You did?

426
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,664
Whenever I saw them,

427
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,067
they reminded me of the time
I deceived you.

428
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,469
They were fake anyway.

429
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,372
They were not fake.

430
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,874
I know they looked genuine,
but they cost only 5,000 won.

431
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,310
They were not 5,000 won.

432
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,612
I'm sure they were 5,000 won.

433
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,850
They were genuine.

434
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,686
They cost 5 million won, not 5,000 won.

435
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,122
What?

436
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,293
Five million?

437
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,772
You should've told me
that they cost five million won.

438
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,708
Why do you have to be so reticent?

439
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,377
This isn't from my house.

440
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,514
Not this one either.

441
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:13,785
Why is the garbage collector so diligent?

442
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,991
I'll buy you a new pair. Stop it.

443
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,793
It's not the same thing.

444
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,230
It means you already liked me
when you bought the earrings.

445
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,232
I had no idea.

446
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,268
I ruined the cardigan
and lost the earrings.

447
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,737
What do we do now?

448
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,485
Number 245, Ms. Jeong Nam-hee.

449
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,988
-Yes.
-Please come on in.

450
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,796
Gal-hee, I'll make it this time

451
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,198
and let you live in comfort.

452
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:06,538
What do I do now?

453
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,706
You're the one who ruined the cardigan.

454
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,408
Why are you doing this to me?

455
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:13,745
Without the cardigan, there's no way
I can recognize her.

456
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,181
Then you should come up
with something new as an indicator.

457
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,917
"An indicator"?

458
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,152
It's not like you recognized her

459
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,954
with the red cardigan from the beginning.

460
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,122
Watching her for a year,

461
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:27,625
you got the imprint of her
with the red cardigan.

462
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,894
So you need something new
that will imprint her in your brain.

463
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,230
You might not recognize her at first

464
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,299
but you will start to see her face
over time.

465
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,804
I should go. I have a meeting to attend.

466
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,005
What?

467
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,743
-Don't call me.
-Gosh, wait.

468
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:49,747
Before you leave, tell me
about Dr. Park's patient.

469
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,015
Did he see people's faces?

470
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,986
Gosh, you seemed very doubtful
about modern medical science.

471
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,655
What now? Now that
your girlfriend started eating,

472
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:58,857
you're getting curious again?

473
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,493
So what is it? Did he see?

474
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,197
Recently,

475
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,466
he was able to see faces twice
for quite long.

476
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,701
When?

477
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,905
The first time was
when he burned his steak.

478
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,474
What? Is that it?

479
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,643
Should I cook steak to see people's faces?

480
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,646
No. That's just how blood pressure works.

481
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,848
It doesn't go up just because you try.

482
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,583
It's not something you can practice.

483
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,052
He didn't see faces
even when he was going on rides

484
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,021
or having a car accident.

485
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,924
But strangely, he saw faces
when he burnt his steak.

486
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,127
-What?
-So you should wait.

487
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,428
You might also

488
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,898
get lucky and see faces like he did.

489
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,335
And the second time was...

490
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,507
I guess it could probably work with you.

491
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,975
What is it?

492
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,610
Think about it.

493
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,780
When a man and a woman are together,

494
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,884
what do you think makes
their blood pressure go up

495
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:01,853
and get excited?

496
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,422
"Get excited"?

497
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,831
Gosh, Dr. Gu. Why would you say that
at a hospital in broad daylight?

498
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,935
So have you guys not done it yet?

499
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,471
Did you not even talk deeply about it

500
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,440
with your girlfriend?

501
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,344
Deeply?

502
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:28,479
Deeply.

503
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,481
About what?

504
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,917
What are you talking about?

505
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:37,055
-Dr. Gu.
-Yes.

506
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,991
Well... I should get going.

507
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,695
Gosh, he's just leaving like that again.

508
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,496
What? Why?

509
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,832
I was just telling him

510
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,468
that the other patient saw faces
as he proposed to his girlfriend.

511
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,370
Forget about it.

512
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,572
He'll come again
if things don't work out. Let's go.

513
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:55,740
Okay.

514
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,219
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

515
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,289
Mr. Do, here's your coffee.

516
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,996
So have you guys not done it yet?

517
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,333
Thank you.

518
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,005
Why are you staring at me like that?

519
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,041
I'm not staring at you.

520
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,310
I can't even see your face. How can I?

521
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,446
It's hot.

522
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,783
You should be careful. It's hot.

523
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,267
Are you okay now?

524
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,070
Go. Stay away from me.

525
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,005
Why?

526
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,673
It didn't work?

527
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,342
Then...

528
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,344
Do you want me to stroke your hair?

529
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,589
Gosh, I don't need it.

530
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,492
Don't blow on my lips or stroke my hair.

531
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,996
Gosh, why is it so hot in here?

532
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,632
The air conditioner is on.

533
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:29,901
I'm okay now.

534
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,404
Let's get off work. I'll take you home.

535
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,956
Dinner will be ready soon.
Please wait a little more.

536
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,758
Forget about dinner.

537
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,960
Get me some water.

538
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,429
Why am I feeling so thirsty?

539
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,065
Okay. I'll be right there.

540
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,316
I'm sorry.

541
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,319
No, it's okay.

542
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:24,155
You're all wet. Take off your pants.

543
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,331
-Take them off?
-Take them off.

544
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,768
Now. Take off your pants.

545
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,105
I'll dry them right away.

546
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,053
You're the one

547
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,757
who told me to take them off.

548
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,926
What?

549
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,434
I've been

550
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,771
trying to hold back.

551
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,144
But you told me to take off my pants.

552
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:27,351
Mr. Do, I didn't mean that. It's...

553
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,920
Seriously,

554
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,789
I was...

555
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,458
I really...

556
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,229
didn't mean to...

557
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,332
Hey, what time is it?

558
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,606
Guys!

559
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,347
Jeong Gal-hee!

560
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,423
How have you guys been doing?

561
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,825
I'm unemployed.

562
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,628
I've just been staying at home
watching TV.

563
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,631
But we might get a job soon.

564
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,934
If we're hired, we will get
vacation bonuses and special bonuses.

565
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,870
We will even get paid
for traditional holidays.

566
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,239
On top of that, they will give priority

567
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,908
to dispatched workers of T&T Mobile.

568
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,310
I got

569
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,480
really emotional
as I walked into the building.

570
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,350
I'm back for a job interview
after I got fired.

571
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,221
I hope the four of us will get hired.

572
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,890
Everyone.

573
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,593
Permanent employment.

574
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,130
Who do you think made it happen?

575
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:23,434
It's my boss, Director Do Min-ik.

576
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,004
Are you taking his side
because you're dating him?

577
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,341
It's not your boss who did it.
Mr. Gi is the one who made it happen.

578
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,611
Gosh, I wasn't
going to tell you this, but...

579
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,047
-Number 248, Ms. Gu Myeong-jeong.
-Yes.

580
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,315
Please come in.

581
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,652
See you.

582
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,789
-Good luck.
-You can do this.

583
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,624
Good luck. Go get them!

584
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,749
I'm back from my interview.

585
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,117
Did it go well?

586
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:18,322
You could've told Mr. Gi
to use his old office.

587
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,758
Why do you have to give him yours?

588
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,794
Didn't the interview go well?

589
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,499
Do you think your secretary can't
do the interview well?

590
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:30,768
Then why do you seem so upset?

591
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,937
The secretaries think

592
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:36,073
they are getting hired as permanent
employees thanks to Mr. Gi.

593
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,476
It doesn't matter.

594
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,078
Here. Take this.

595
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,582
Don't throw things at me.

596
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,717
I'm pretty upset already.

597
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,388
And this.

598
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,858
I told you not to throw things.

599
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,429
And this.

600
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,664
Stop throwing things at me!

601
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,439
What is this?

602
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:11,575
Open it.

603
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,656
Mr. Do.

604
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,406
Dr. Gu told me to make our new indicator.

605
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,842
And I think

606
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,279
this would work.

607
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,249
By any chance, are you

608
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,852
proposing to me now?

609
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,658
I would

610
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,564
like to be your coat of confidence.

611
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,970
No matter what happens in life,

612
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,740
you won't get discouraged
having me around.

613
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,085
I'd like to put this on your finger now,

614
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,120
but you can take your time.

615
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,423
One day,

616
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,060
when I see this ring on your finger,

617
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,129
I'll take

618
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,101
your answer as a yes.

619
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,183
It's so pretty.

620
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,218
Are you happy?

621
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,153
Of course.

622
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,657
When are you going to put it on?

623
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,261
It's a secret.

624
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,332
I'm here to say goodbye.

625
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,739
What?

626
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,746
I should stop coming to see you.

627
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,616
Why?

628
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,620
Why?

629
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,060
Now you have someone

630
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,596
to rely on besides me.

631
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,901
So stop missing your dead mother
and live with someone alive.

632
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,941
That's how people live.

633
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,312
Mom.

634
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,883
I want to leave at ease

635
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,285
looking at your smile.

636
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,222
You should be happy.

637
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,259
Okay?

638
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:36,914
The laundry room is in the basement.

639
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,884
I'm thinking about having breakfast
30 minutes earlier.

640
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,127
Did you not say you have
only two residents including yourself?

641
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,030
Your younger brother who's in Cuba.

642
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,508
He's my son.

643
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,018
What are you doing? Say hello to her.

644
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,492
Hello. I'm Do Min-ik.

645
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,196
My son is allergic to peanuts.

646
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,234
He will be the CEO soon. Please pay
extra attention to what he eats.

647
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,669
Yes, ma'am.

648
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,637
-You haven't seen the library yet.
-No.

649
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,638
This way.

650
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,132
Is she wearing it?

651
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:04,802
I bet she is.

652
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:07,838
She must be wearing it.

653
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,548
Mr. Do, you're here.

654
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,352
I'm moving out of this office anyway.

655
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,021
Why are you cleaning it up?

656
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,891
You're right. I'm already upset about it.

657
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,493
What was I thinking?

658
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,066
-It's not there.
-Pardon?

659
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,168
What? Nothing.

660
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,274
This one has a hole,
so my hand is all wet.

661
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,510
I'll go and wash my hands.

662
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,059
Why didn't she take both
of the gloves off?

663
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:12,302
She's here.

664
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:17,775
What are you doing?

665
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,144
Hey.

666
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,279
I almost saw it.

667
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,683
You didn't forget about the meeting
with SBC at five, right?

668
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,851
I know.

669
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,660
What do you want to eat?
Sushi or naengmyeon?

670
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,031
You didn't forget

671
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,901
we are having dinner together
later tonight, right?

672
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,770
You know what?

673
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,673
You've been keeping
your hand in your pocket all day.

674
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,443
You're not supposed
to do that around your boss.

675
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,445
Don't you think so?

676
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,051
Happy now?

677
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,357
Well...

678
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,793
I'm asking just in case.

679
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,164
If you are hesitating

680
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,100
because I can't see your face...

681
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,270
Hesitate? Me?

682
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,812
Look at the woman over there.

683
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,183
She has beautiful eyes
and a prominent nose.

684
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,587
Her skin is like a gift from up above.

685
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,789
You know I can't see that.

686
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,658
I know. Isn't it great?

687
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,527
My boyfriend can't see women like her.

688
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,236
You know what? Here and here.

689
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,206
I got some wrinkles since I first met you.

690
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,041
I even have some freckles.

691
00:47:58,742 --> 00:47:59,943
I can't see them either.

692
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,281
So you will remember

693
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,150
only my prettiest face.

694
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:11,655
But I can see you grow old.

695
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,129
The restaurant at the intersection
at 6 p.m.

696
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,933
I should go to the broadcasting company
to finish the contract.

697
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,468
-I'll see you there.
-Okay.

698
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,941
We should have dinner together
at our place sometime.

699
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,676
We'd appreciate it if you invite us.

700
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,544
Shall we go have some tea?

701
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,079
Okay.

702
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:37,681
Wait.

703
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,784
Ms. Jeong is waiting.
And I should stop by at my office.

704
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,353
Okay. You go first.

705
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:44,688
Good luck.

706
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,344
What?

707
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,617
Did it stop?

708
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:26,563
This is the control room.

709
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,467
The elevator just stopped.

710
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:35,172
All right.

711
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,546
Once Mr. Do arrives,
I'll give this to him.

712
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,383
I'll propose to him with these flowers.

713
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,055
And...

714
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:57,928
I'll ask him to put this on my finger.

715
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,867
No.

716
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:10,173
I should be wearing this when he arrives.

717
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,709
Would it make him feel better?

718
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,891
Gosh.

719
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,928
Damn it.

720
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,932
The phone is not working. Why today?

721
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,136
Excuse me.

722
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,807
I'm sorry,

723
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,277
but can you please hurry?

724
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,147
It's almost done.
Please wait a little more.

725
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,222
Why isn't he coming?

726
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,931
Awesome.

727
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,537
Long time no see, Gal-hee.

728
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,706
Is the meeting over already, Mr. Gi?

729
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,608
Where's Mr. Do?

730
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,110
Did you not see him yet?

731
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,746
He left early to see you.

732
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,783
Oh, right. He said
he'd stop by at his office.

733
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,224
The number you have called
cannot be reached...

734
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,493
Did something happen?

735
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,163
Mr. Gi, I'm sorry,

736
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,300
but could you please watch this
while I go to the office?

737
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:48,872
Hey!

738
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,575
You're treating me like your minion again.

739
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,320
Why are you doing this to me?

740
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,657
Ms. Jeong is waiting.

741
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,560
My gosh.

742
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,173
Are you all right?

743
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,441
Yes.

744
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,884
What?

745
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,491
I can see.

746
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,527
Pardon?

747
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,897
Are you sure you're okay?

748
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,338
Are you all right?

749
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,975
Well...

750
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:07,784
What's happening all of a sudden?

751
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,788
No. That's just how blood pressure works.

752
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,990
So you should wait.

753
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,594
You might also get lucky
and see faces like he did.

754
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:24,868
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

755
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,737
Gosh, thank you so much.

756
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,906
Thank you.

757
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,168
What? It's Mr. Do.

758
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,537
Hello, Mr. Do.

759
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,506
Hey, where are you now?

760
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,977
I couldn't reach you,
so I came back to the office.

761
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:08,478
Is something wrong?

762
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,214
Really? Then...

763
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,417
I'll go back to the office now.

764
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,754
I'm on my way out.

765
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,992
No, I'll be there soon.

766
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,493
Stay right there.

767
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,896
But I left something at the restaurant.

768
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,164
Ms. Jeong.

769
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,201
I don't know how much time I have left.

770
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,671
And I'm not even sure
when this will happen again.

771
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,774
I'll regret it for the rest of my life
if I don't see you now.

772
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,442
So please come back to the office.

773
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,678
I don't have time to explain.

774
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,852
I'll be right back.

775
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,688
Where are you?

776
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,691
I'm in front of the elevator.

777
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:58,862
You're not here.

778
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,831
I'm on the first floor.

779
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,566
Shall I go back to the office?

780
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,634
No.

781
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:07,170
Then...

782
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,041
Come to the rooftop.

783
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,644
Okay.

784
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,538
Mr. Do.

785
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,643
Why did you want to see me here?

786
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,573
Do you see my face now?

787
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,679
You're pretty.

788
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:31,881
Am I pretty?

789
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,184
Yes.

790
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,353
Your eyes are pretty,

791
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,190
and your nose is pretty too.

792
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:43,993
And your lips

793
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,329
are so pretty.

794
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,832
Everything is pretty.

795
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:55,939
This is nice.

796
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,109
It's nice that you're seeing my face.

797
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,512
There's something

798
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:05,248
I'm desperate to do

799
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,351
when I can see your face.

800
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:55,698
Like a miracle, there were moments
like this every once in a while.

801
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,867
Whenever it happened,

802
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,738
the man went to see her
no matter where she was,

803
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,974
looked at her face for a long time,

804
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,912
and kissed her for a long time.

805
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,918
Feeling grateful for the moments
when he could see her.

806
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,855
So he could remember her face

807
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,859
until when he can see her again.

808
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:58,294
One, two, and three.

809
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,330
-Thank you for watching
-Thank you for watching

810
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,765
-The Secret Life of My Secretary.
-The Secret Life of My Secretary.

811
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,133
This is a mess!

812
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,604
