1
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,375
What did she look like?

2
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,847
Did she look like this?

3
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,785
Or like this?

4
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,821
Or...

5
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:56,923
was it like this?

6
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:20,313
I wonder what she looks like.

7
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:27,454
I tried to draw a face,
but I ended up drawing a circle.

8
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,889
Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,024
Nice to meet you.

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,492
I'm Veronica...

11
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,860
I'm Veronica...

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,028
-Park.
-Park.

13
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,787
Does she not like the food?

14
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,223
I don't want to get
on the wrong side of her already.

15
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,557
Oh, shit.

16
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,427
Do you not like the food?

17
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,463
What are you talking about?
My stomach is so excited...

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,998
Pardon?

19
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,238
I mean, my stomach feels very comfortable.

20
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,073
This is what I eat all the time.

21
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,808
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,045
I didn't know what kind
of wine you'd like, so...

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,048
I just picked what I like.

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,718
Armand de Brignac Blanc de Blancs.

25
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,253
You know it.

26
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,855
How would I not know that?
I'm the one who ordered it.

27
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,057
The price is reasonable.

28
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,659
I mean, it costs 1.5 million won.

29
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,895
And it has a clean aftertaste.

30
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:42,962
I hope that's true.

31
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,398
So I enjoy drinking it.

32
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,434
I actually enjoyed ordering it.

33
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,203
For you to drink it.

34
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,573
I see.

35
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,789
Shall we make a toast first?

36
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,292
For what?

37
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:16,062
For our first meeting.

38
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,432
For our first meeting?

39
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,310
She should've become a girl group member,

40
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,811
but she's just stuck in an office.

41
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,047
Leave her be.

42
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,049
I feel bad she always stays quiet

43
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,618
walking on eggshells around her boss.

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,332
Listen, Ha-ni.

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,068
I don't want to drag you into this.

46
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,737
So don't ever talk to me again
even if you see me.

47
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,472
No matter what I do,

48
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,208
you must pretend not to know anything.

49
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,178
Even if someone in this company
ends up dying.

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,551
No.

51
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,620
Guys!

52
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,758
Hey!

53
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,628
You said you'd be here in 15 minutes,
but it took you 2 hours.

54
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,063
I'm so sorry. It's my fault.

55
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,798
I had something to take care of.

56
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,568
By the way, where's Gal-hee?

57
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,070
She went out after getting a phone call,
and now she's out of contact.

58
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm worried if she might have left
without paying her dues.

59
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,341
You guys should understand her.

60
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,844
It's obvious that she's busy
looking after her boss now.

61
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,512
Don't you feel bad for her?

62
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,218
I'm sorry, but could you please
pick that up for me?

63
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,454
As you might know,

64
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,191
I've never bent down
in front of others my whole life.

65
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,896
She's really condescending,
just as I heard.

66
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,200
Sure. I'll pick it up for you.

67
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,169
Excuse me.

68
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,540
Thank you.

69
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,182
Gosh.

70
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,953
Would you wipe this off for me too?

71
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,325
As you know, I've never done

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,261
anything myself before.

73
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,519
Is it done?

74
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,944
No way. Is this peanut?

75
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,347
Spit it out.

76
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,049
Did you spit it all out?

77
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,351
Rinse your mouth with this. Hurry.

78
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,486
Okay.

79
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,991
What's wrong?

80
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,259
Peanut.

81
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,797
They said it's garlic sauce.
Why did they change it?

82
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,068
Is it still on your mouth?

83
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,971
Are you breaking out in a rash?
Is it burning?

84
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,172
I'm okay, but...

85
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,475
you got it on your hand.

86
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,985
Jeong Gal-hee, you idiot.

87
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,920
You're just a subordinate

88
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,022
to the very core.

89
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,328
I mean, why did I catch the food
from his mouth with my hand?

90
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,966
What kind of rich heiress
would do such a thing?

91
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,472
Listen, Ms. Jeong.

92
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,241
You just had a meal
you'd never be able to afford.

93
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,178
You should hurry and call it a night then.

94
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,648
Before you act like a subordinate again
and make your boss gets suspicious.

95
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,526
What was that?
Was she just pretending to be picky?

96
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,830
Why would he catch it with her hand?

97
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,917
Are you all right?

98
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,890
By the way, how did you know

99
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,658
I'm allergic to peanuts?

100
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,960
What?

101
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,831
Your secretary.

102
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,802
Your secretary told me.

103
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,872
When she called me to set a date.

104
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,875
-I see. Did Ms. Jeong do it?
-Yes.

105
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,477
Shall we go home now?

106
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,547
Wait. I'll ask them
to have your car ready.

107
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,282
-What's your plate number?
-What?

108
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,019
My car...

109
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,422
Of course I have a car.

110
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,993
I thought I'd be drinking tonight,

111
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,528
so I didn't drive here.

112
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,531
Don't you have a driver?

113
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,165
What? A driver?

114
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,034
Sure.

115
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,103
I do have one.

116
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,405
I gave him some days off.

117
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,641
He's been too busy these days.

118
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,177
I shouldn't have sent my car back then.

119
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:09,749
Actually this hotel offers
a limousine service.

120
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:10,883
No.

121
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,985
I can't afford it.

122
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,555
I'll just walk home.

123
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,356
-Walk?
-Yes.

124
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,825
I heard it's going to rain tonight.

125
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,229
Well... I guess I ate way too fast.

126
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,132
I have indigestion.

127
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,168
If I don't take a walk on a day like this,

128
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,837
when would I ever have
a chance to do that again?

129
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,241
-Then I'll walk you home.
-What?

130
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,711
I also have indigestion. That's good.

131
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,413
Let's go.

132
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,201
Why would I need something like this?

133
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,670
For people like us, our parents are
like our business cards.

134
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,239
-Who is your father?
-I don't know.

135
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,609
I haven't had a father since I was born.

136
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,544
My mom raised me all by herself.

137
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,446
Then who is your mother?

138
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,115
She worked as Chairman Do Wan-bae's
secretary at T&T Mobile

139
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,583
when she was alive.

140
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,452
She passed away
when I was a senior in high school.

141
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,956
Then your grandfather must be a big shot.

142
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,659
Right. He was a great man.

143
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,829
He raised all his six children
and sent them to college

144
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,931
by growing chili peppers.

145
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,299
Growing chili peppers?

146
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,634
Why?

147
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,869
Don't you like my business card?

148
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,304
Don't worry.

149
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,539
If your business card is lousy,
I see your face.

150
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,942
If I don't like your face,
I see your body.

151
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,411
I just manage to find your charm somehow.

152
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,114
That's the amazing talent I've got.

153
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,616
I still want you to like me
for my business card.

154
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,952
Look how great I turned out
without a father.

155
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,122
And I lived on tenaciously
even after my mom passed away.

156
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,090
In the times of household debt
of 1,400 trillion won,

157
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,792
I'm free from debts,
and I have a stable job.

158
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,928
I guess my business card
sounds pretty good.

159
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,233
And you should have a room
for CEO Sim Hae-yong

160
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,068
on your business card.

161
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,738
He set me up with you
instead of his own nephew.

162
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,541
It's like you're wearing
a designer bag or something.

163
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,849
IS YK MOBILE GETTING THE EXCLUSIVE
SCREENING RIGHTS OF CINEPARK?

164
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,018
I want you to get those screening rights.

165
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,354
Me?

166
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,823
If you want me to consolidate
the media teams and give them to you,

167
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,595
you should at least
make some contribution.

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,302
This is the project proposal
for Cinepark's exclusive screening rights.

169
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,005
That's too bad.

170
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,874
I don't meet people for work after six.

171
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,609
I only meet guys.

172
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,645
Then I'll visit your office before six.

173
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:53,813
As a person.

174
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,248
Why don't we just go for a drink now?

175
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,483
As a guy?

176
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,385
-I can't.
-Why not?

177
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,888
I'm paying for this meal
with the company credit card.

178
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,058
I can have a meal, but can't drink
with the company card.

179
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,530
Then I'll buy, sweetheart.

180
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,466
Water is fine.

181
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:21,040
Don't you think
I'm doing this for a reason?

182
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,075
Can't you see

183
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,046
that you might ruin things
being so stubborn?

184
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,215
-I can't.
-Why not?

185
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,983
I heard you're quite peculiar,

186
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,652
but I believe you have your own criteria.

187
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,923
Even in a movie
made with a lot of money and great actors,

188
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,159
you can find out flaws.

189
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,695
And even in a low-budget film
by an unknown director,

190
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,165
you can find out merits.
It's you, the Box Office Master.

191
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,334
I believe you got the nickname
for a reason.

192
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,104
Gosh, I almost grinned.

193
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,741
-Pardon?
-I don't believe in papers.

194
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,143
I only believe in money.

195
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,614
I'll read it.
If it's trash, I'll throw it away.

196
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,916
If I find it lucrative,
I'll give you a call.

197
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,518
All right then.

198
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,640
What? How long do I have to walk with him?

199
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,343
What if he ends up walking me home?

200
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,323
It's raining.

201
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,371
Why are you...

202
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,307
Pardon?

203
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:12,051
Let me hold it.
A man is supposed to do this.

204
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,658
How's your stomach?

205
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,462
You had indigestion.
Are you feeling better now?

206
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,732
Is it because I skipped lunch?

207
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,135
I often get indigestion
after dinner these days.

208
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,906
Did you skip lunch? Why?

209
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,776
My secretary usually buys me lunch,

210
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,178
and I eat it in my office.

211
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,549
But she was out
during the lunch hour today.

212
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,886
I mean,

213
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,822
can't you eat lunch
without your secretary?

214
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,760
You could go to a cafeteria
or other restaurants in the vicinity.

215
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,496
I know. But...

216
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,601
I don't feel like looking
at people's faces while eating these days.

217
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,705
I'm tired of it.

218
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh, I see.

219
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,281
You should try pressing here.

220
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,052
When I was young,
my mom used to do it for digestion.

221
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,855
Chairwoman Park Seok-ja did that for you?

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,729
Right, my mom is a chairwoman.

223
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,301
So is this how you do it?

224
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,739
Let me show you.

225
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,841
Press it hard from inside.

226
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,747
My mom would chant some weird spell

227
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,983
doing this.

228
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,755
"Go down. Go down.

229
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,891
It shall go down as if there's
sesame oil in your stomach.

230
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,294
Stop bothering my girl

231
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,097
and go down immediately."

232
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,134
It worked!

233
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,536
Excuse me.

234
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,240
I think it's working. Let me do it again.

235
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,654
What does...

236
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,524
she look like?

237
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,935
Why are you staring at me like that?

238
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,105
Well... Nothing.

239
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:24,043
It's just that you're quite different
from what I expected.

240
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,150
So... It's raining.

241
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,118
Shall we go now?

242
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,859
I'll take you home.

243
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,266
I hate to owe others something.

244
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,479
Mr. Do Min-ik.

245
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,181
Yes?

246
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,949
It was...

247
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,685
nice meeting you.

248
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,656
And I'm sorry.

249
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,692
I'm the one who should apologize.

250
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,357
What did he say?

251
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,228
Gosh, Chairwoman Park.

252
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,231
You can't get to the climax
without an introduction.

253
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:55,767
We're supposed to greet each other
before start talking.

254
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,804
I'm in such a big rush,
so I don't care about introductions.

255
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,539
Forget about greetings.

256
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,145
Did you hear that they met last night?

257
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,981
What did your daughter say?

258
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:13,385
Why would you even care
what that Manizer says?

259
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,288
What matters is how your son feels.

260
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,728
The thing is, your daughter was...

261
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,732
She was nice.

262
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,505
What?

263
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,558
It's okay, Jeong Gal-hee.

264
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,761
Let's just think that I wrote
a novel and move on.

265
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,763
Think that it was a dream.

266
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,499
Just forget about it.

267
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,067
Gosh, no.

268
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,773
What have I done? I must've been crazy.

269
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,041
What do I do now?

270
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,578
What am I going to do now?
How can I even forget it?

271
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,480
My gosh, I can't believe what I did.

272
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,251
What do you want to forget?

273
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,853
Did you have a nightmare or something?

274
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,823
Why are you here so early?

275
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,992
You didn't have coffee, right? I'll go...

276
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:30,896
I did.

277
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,599
You don't get me coffee
before the office hours.

278
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,568
-What about your shoes?
-I polished them already.

279
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,939
You said you don't do anything
that's not related to work.

280
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,809
What about feeding the fish?
Did you water the plants?

281
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,612
Please. Please let me do something.

282
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:50,916
Well...

283
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,619
Something's wrong with the lights
in my office.

284
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,489
Oh, okay. I'm going
to the facility team now.

285
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,363
Ms. Jeong.

286
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,565
Yes?

287
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,402
I'm well aware
that you don't like to see me.

288
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:14,706
But you should at least
look at my face when you work.

289
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,074
Okay.

290
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,943
Unfortunately, you're...

291
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,113
the only person I can see.

292
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,383
Okay. All right.

293
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,221
VERONICA PARK

294
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,390
I'll be right back.

295
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,600
Hello?

296
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,506
This reminds me of the old days.

297
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,509
Now that we had fun last night,

298
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,711
we should coordinate our stories.

299
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,782
Are you sure you took care
of things with no problem?

300
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,283
That's your strong suit.

301
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,319
Well...

302
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,257
Apparently, the appointment was
arranged by the two mothers.

303
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,627
If you didn't even show up,

304
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,228
Chairwoman Park would've been furious.

305
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,198
And my boss couldn't tell

306
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,934
his mother that he got stood up.

307
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,470
So?

308
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,040
So I asked my boss

309
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,977
to be understanding and tell his mother

310
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,448
that you two had a good time.

311
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,089
So did he tell his mother
that I was actually there?

312
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,290
Yes.

313
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:42,227
As if you two actually met last night.

314
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,034
Hello?

315
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,839
I guess you handled it nicely.

316
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,375
Then I should tell my mom the same thing.

317
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,743
So give me

318
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:01,079
that guy's phone number.

319
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,214
What?

320
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,318
Why would you need my boss' phone number?

321
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,653
I don't mean your boss.

322
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,192
PROJECT PROPOSAL

323
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,530
This place reminds you
of the old days, doesn't it?

324
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,300
I used to come here on my payday.

325
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,704
When your mom and I worked
for Chairman Do Wan-bae.

326
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,573
Those days...

327
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,877
After my mom passed away,
I had no money to study abroad.

328
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,613
But Chairman Do paid my tuition.

329
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,682
So we ordered a lot of pork cutlets
and celebrated it here .

330
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,284
How would I forget that day?

331
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,619
Because of you...

332
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,222
Because of me what?

333
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,325
I was really happy for you.

334
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,865
-Dae-ju.
-Yes, Eul-wang.

335
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,534
You know it, right?

336
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,770
I'm always on your side no matter what.

337
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,673
And no matter what happens,
you're on my side.

338
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,520
Why is this here?

339
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,893
Gosh.

340
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,233
I thought I lost it that day. Didn't I?

341
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,205
ROMI'S LICKING

342
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,243
It is the same flash drive.

343
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,014
Why...

344
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,887
You're early.

345
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,822
Yes. Hey.

346
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,191
Why is this here?

347
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,826
What? The flash drive?

348
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,928
You gave it to me so I can watch it.

349
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,064
You said it looks
like the dog we had before.

350
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,467
Why?

351
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,735
Nothing.

352
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,005
Hey, we shouldn't be talking
about something else tonight.

353
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,610
Just tell me the secret
you didn't tell me before.

354
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,820
-Min-ik.
-Yes?

355
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,056
I'm quitting my job.

356
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,260
Why are you saying nonsense so seriously?

357
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,332
Before I hand in my resignation,
I wanted to tell you first.

358
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,771
I'm working only until next month.

359
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,140
Why?

360
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,010
Why?

361
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,712
It's a big world.

362
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,549
I'd like to go to the Maldives
and have some mojito.

363
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:53,952
I could film a road movie
with a strange woman.

364
00:25:56,454 --> 00:25:57,522
No.

365
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,695
Min-ik.

366
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,998
You've been with me for over 20 years
since you were 7 years old.

367
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,401
You can't quit the company
without discussing it with me.

368
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,602
No.

369
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:14,239
I've been with you for 27 years
since I was 7.

370
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,107
It's time for us to go separate ways.

371
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,511
No. I just can't do anything without you.

372
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,580
End of conversation. I should get going.

373
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,416
How long do I have to live as your minion?

374
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,490
What did you say?

375
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,826
Let me go, Min-ik.

376
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,830
Only then you can live on.

377
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,400
Damn it.

378
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,837
She said she would get it fixed.

379
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,722
Yes, come in.

380
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,029
What's the matter?

381
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,631
You left this in the car.

382
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,733
Oh, right. Thank you.

383
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,707
What were you doing with the lights off?

384
00:27:56,908 --> 00:28:00,145
I guess the lights went off.
It won't turn on.

385
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,548
You may get off work.

386
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,183
I'll go home myself.

387
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,487
Okay, then.

388
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,058
Thank you.

389
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,595
A hundred thousand,
a hundred and ten thousand,

390
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,464
a hundred and twenty thousand...

391
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,901
Gal-hee, here's more.

392
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,974
I guess I should pay
the parking fee as well.

393
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,611
You should be grateful
that we're not charging you

394
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:35,246
for the clothes and hairdo.

395
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,218
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

396
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,928
Let's go and eat some trotter
with this money.

397
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,998
You guys go ahead. I'll be there
after picking up my bag at the office.

398
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,447
Gosh, my car key.

399
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,504
Who are you?

400
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,293
No way.

401
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:30,695
It's you, right?

402
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,098
Is it you?

403
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,868
How did you get in here?

404
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,150
-Who are you?
-No!

405
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,655
Ms. Jeong, it's him.

406
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,758
This is the man who tried to kill me.

407
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,227
Let him go, Mr. Do.

408
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,429
He's your driver.

409
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,997
What?

410
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,104
I mean, what...

411
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,073
This cap...

412
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,841
And the box cutter...

413
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,076
It's a common box cutter.

414
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,446
It's a common box cutter
anyone would keep in a desk drawer.

415
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,449
This guy...

416
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,996
Are you all right?

417
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:41,866
I'm okay.

418
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,568
Did you get hurt?

419
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:44,802
But...

420
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:46,771
What are you

421
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,874
doing in my office?

422
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,978
I think I told you to get off work.

423
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,414
The light.

424
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,751
I thought you were feeling uncomfortable
because of the lights.

425
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,820
I know how to fix them,

426
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,756
so I was going to do it.

427
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,926
Why did you not answer me earlier then?

428
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,666
Mr. Do, you're bleeding.

429
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,134
It's blood.

430
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,383
-Nine times nine.
-Eighty-one.

431
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,352
-Two times nine.
-Eighteen.

432
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,387
Aren't you going to the CT scan?

433
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,091
You don't need a CT scan
just for a small cut.

434
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,893
You're lucky that we have
an extra hospital room.

435
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,495
Then get me some medication and fix it.

436
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,033
I almost killed my driver.

437
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,936
If I end up in jail instead of a hospital,

438
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,504
will you send me some tofu?

439
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,673
Do you still not see any face?

440
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,078
I still don't.

441
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,714
But I can see

442
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,917
only one person.

443
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,653
You should get some rest today.

444
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,356
Dr. Park whom you've
been waiting for has arrived.

445
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,124
You will see her tomorrow.

446
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,826
And call someone to take care of you.

447
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,097
She's coming.

448
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,264
Hello.

449
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,633
She's the one who will take care of me.

450
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,605
We should ask the police for help again.

451
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,640
Since the criminal hasn't been caught,

452
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,509
you're being too sensitive.

453
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,910
I know.

454
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,580
Excuse me.

455
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,349
Mr. Eun.

456
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,154
Are you feeling better?

457
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,232
Well...

458
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,771
I'm sorry about earlier.

459
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,744
It's okay. I also didn't recognize you

460
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,646
because it was too dark.

461
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,451
Thank you for your understanding.

462
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,323
Have some rest then.

463
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,826
Please call me whenever you need me.

464
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,691
I found it, Boss.

465
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,931
Is everything okay?

466
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,399
Yes.

467
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,270
There's an extra blanket.

468
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,506
-You can go there and...
-My gosh.

469
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,609
It's too late. I should get going then.

470
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,178
Are you...

471
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,081
Are you leaving?

472
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,520
Of course you should go home.

473
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,657
It's way past your work hours.

474
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,193
I know you should go.

475
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,266
Ms. Jeong.

476
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,103
Yes?

477
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,807
It's late. Take a taxi on your way home.

478
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,977
It's okay. I live quite far away.

479
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,411
Just do as I say.

480
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,948
-You don't have to worry about--
-Why wouldn't I worry about you?

481
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,917
Can't you see what I'm like now?

482
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,320
Without you, I can't even tell
if someone in front of me is

483
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,523
a human, a monkey, a goblin, or a ghost.

484
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,197
Take a taxi.

485
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:10,101
If something happens to you,

486
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,604
I will have no one

487
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,841
by my side.

488
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,020
Jeong Jung-hee, Jeong Nam-hee.

489
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,957
I'm sorry.

490
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,091
I'm late because...

491
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:35,560
Something must've happened to your boss.

492
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:38,262
And you lost track of time
taking care of it.

493
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,431
Thank you.

494
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,934
Thanks to you, but my mouth gets to rest

495
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,202
even when my legs are busy.

496
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,341
Here.

497
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,543
What is this?

498
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,514
It's a gift for you.
With a sim card or something,

499
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,616
I heard you can use the phone
in other countries.

500
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,419
Give me that old phone of yours
and take this.

501
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,687
That's great.

502
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,001
Jeong Gal-hee, don't you
shed a tear in front of me.

503
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,270
Don't cry in an airport.

504
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,272
Only those who haven't been abroad
do such things.

505
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,707
Nam-hee!

506
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,878
Go out and see the big world
that I've never seen.

507
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,247
Forget about your lowly life

508
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:30,681
and become a noblewoman.

509
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,950
You have to return home in glory.

510
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,521
Say bye to Mom.

511
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,323
It's a delusional disorder.

512
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,858
Mom isn't here.

513
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,627
Don't say that
just because you can't see her.

514
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,095
What about him?

515
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:47,031
It's not like nothing exists for him.

516
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,905
Mom is everywhere,
and she's always watching us.

517
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,876
Before you go a long way, say bye to Mom.

518
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:15,092
I'm not so good at saying goodbye.

519
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,561
You should go now.

520
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,132
Gal-hee, listen carefully to me.

521
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,334
Those who looked down on you

522
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,169
and bullied you.

523
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:29,240
I'm going to make them kneel
in front of you no matter what.

524
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,010
So even if I do something

525
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:36,080
to disappoint you someday,

526
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,949
please just understand me.

527
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,985
Remember that it's just
for everyone's sake.

528
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:44,889
Don't be silly.

529
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,757
Just get in there.

530
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,260
Go.

531
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,213
-Nam-hee...
-She's over there.

532
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,548
Okay. There.

533
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,759
Is everything all right?

534
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,328
Maybe I have indigestion.

535
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,197
Do you have some digestive medicine?

536
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,798
I'll go and ask the doctor.

537
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,867
When is your guardian coming?

538
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,769
I should give this to her.

539
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,975
-I'll give it to her when she comes.
-Okay.

540
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,711
GUARDIAN PASS

541
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,049
Guardian?

542
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,219
If I do as you say,

543
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,123
will you accept me as your family?

544
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,291
You'll be accepted as her family at least.

545
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,827
How long do I have to live as your minion?

546
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,668
GUARDIAN PASS

547
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,939
"Go down. Go down.

548
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,509
It shall go down as if there's
sesame oil in your stomach.

549
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,778
Stop bothering my girl

550
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,514
and go down immediately."

551
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,605
I wonder what she looks like.

552
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,224
Why is this so old?

553
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,495
I should've gotten her a new one sooner.

554
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,181
Let me hold it.
A man is supposed to do this.

555
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,155
So that's how it works.

556
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,192
I always thought I was the one
who should do it.

557
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,539
It's raining.

558
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:59,843
I wonder if Mr. Do is doing all right.

559
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,262
Do you think the PCA is the problem?

560
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,199
We can barely find
a patient with prosopagnosia

561
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,301
with such serious symptoms in the country.

562
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,704
Yes. I think you are right.

563
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,139
I saw one patient

564
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,875
with similar symptoms in the States.

565
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:35,346
What happened to the patient?

566
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,715
Nothing has really changed
since the accident.

567
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,751
Then...

568
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,954
Is there a chance I can get better?

569
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,490
We could try removing the clip.

570
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:49,026
If we get rid of the clip
and connect the bypass,

571
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,662
your prosopagnosia
might get better, but...

572
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,230
But?

573
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,667
But it might cause other aftereffects.

574
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,968
Even if we get rid of it,

575
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,871
we can't be sure if you will return
to being 100 percent normal.

576
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,509
You know better than anyone

577
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,678
what brain surgeries are like.

578
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,115
Opening your brain again
just to be able to see people's faces?

579
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,017
I don't think it's worth it.

580
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,919
I wouldn't recommend it.

581
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,328
I might

582
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,366
end up forgetting my own face.

583
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,928
I'd like to cancel a phone contract.

584
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,097
Well...

585
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:37,134
I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

586
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:46,744
Yes?

587
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,816
You're here, Mr. Do.

588
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,119
Yes. I'm back.

589
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,193
Were you all right last night?

590
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,896
Was Chairwoman Sim
with you during the night?

591
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,799
Oh, right. Can you find out

592
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,768
what kind of bed they have
in the hospital?

593
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,237
I slept so well last night.

594
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,939
I don't even know
if anyone visited me or not.

595
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,410
I guess I worried for nothing.

596
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:27,284
Give me Veronica Park's number.

597
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,456
Why are you being quiet?

598
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,691
Why would you need her number?

599
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,361
You said you'd never see her again.

600
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:43,200
Did you just yell at me?

601
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,836
No. I think I heard a rumor

602
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,971
that Veronica Park has ten cell phones.

603
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,374
It's really hard
to get her personal number.

604
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,342
So you should contact her secretary...

605
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,878
Call her secretary. I'll ask her myself.

606
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,116
It's 0108246...

607
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,618
What? You just said you don't know it.

608
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,323
I said it's hard.
I didn't exactly say I don't know it.

609
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,058
Here.

610
00:47:11,795 --> 00:47:14,865
Even if you call her,
I'm sure she won't answer it.

611
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:17,401
Okay.

612
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,170
All right.

613
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,244
No. It's impossible.

614
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,179
I know Mr. Do.

615
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,049
He wouldn't call a woman first.

616
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,085
He wouldn't.

617
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:45,796
I need to stay calm.
Calm yourself down, Jeong Gal-hee.

618
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,731
It's okay.

619
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,836
I don't have to answer it. I won't.

620
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,042
1 MISSED CALL

621
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,483
I don't think he'd call her again.

622
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,485
Oh, right. Text message.

623
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,855
I should send him a text message.

624
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,028
"Because of my busy schedule,

625
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,431
I won't be able..." Gosh.

626
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,699
Hello?

627
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,771
Is this Veronica Park's number?

628
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,007
-Hello?
-Did I just answer it?

629
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,780
All right.

630
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,051
Who is this?

631
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,452
Hello.

632
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:46,356
I'm Do Min-ik of T&T Mobile.
We met the other day.

633
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,959
Oh, Mr. Do Min-ik.

634
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:53,096
Yes. I hope I'm not interrupting you.

635
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:54,998
I was wondering

636
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,268
if you have any plans tonight.

637
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,306
I have something very important
to take care of,

638
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,975
so I'll be working until late at night.

639
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,476
What's the matter?

640
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,611
Well...

641
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,813
I want to give your umbrella back.

642
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,083
The yellow umbrella you got me last time.

643
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,385
The umbrella.

644
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,290
I thought umbrellas are disposable.

645
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,559
Just throw it away.

646
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,361
Even if that's what you do,

647
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,196
I can't throw yours away.

648
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,133
If you're in the office,
I can drop by and give it back to you.

649
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,939
No. You can't come to my office.

650
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,275
Then...

651
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:39,943
Can I go to your place?

652
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,144
No.

653
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,246
You can't.

654
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,116
Then how about we meet
at the Kingdom Hotel at around six?

655
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,357
Hello?

656
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:59,129
Okay. I'll see you there then...

657
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,798
Was she cut off?

658
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,772
How may I help you, Mr. Do?

659
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,741
Do you need anything?

660
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,713
Why were you sitting
with your back against me?

661
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,516
Were you being like that on purpose

662
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,084
because you don't want to see my face?

663
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:24,388
Why would I do that on purpose?

664
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,623
I guess the chair is broken.

665
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,225
I can barely move it.

666
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,395
This is a contract from SBC.

667
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,230
Ask the legal team to review it.

668
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,365
Okay.

669
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,939
Why? Do you have anything to tell me?

670
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,708
I didn't,

671
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,844
but I just got one.

672
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,880
I think

673
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,249
I should take this afternoon off.

674
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:53,884
Dr. Park.

675
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:57,521
About the patient
with prosopagnosia in the States.

676
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,289
I heard he once saw faces.

677
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,490
That's right.

678
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,994
The patient's problem is
that the clip in his brain slipped

679
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,129
and it reduced blood flow

680
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,764
to the fusiform gyrus

681
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,599
that recognizes faces.

682
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,002
But when his blood pressure goes up,

683
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,005
blood flows normally again.

684
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,274
So I guess the function returned

685
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,309
for a short period of time.

686
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,477
Hang on.

687
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,813
Does that mean he can see faces

688
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,147
when his blood pressure goes up?

689
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,515
Yes.

690
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,584
When did it happen?

691
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,020
When was the time
he recognized people's faces?

692
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,622
I heard it happened three times.

693
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:36,093
The first time was
during his graduation speech.

694
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,261
When someone feels nervous or excited,

695
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,796
his blood pressure goes up.

696
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,631
The second time was

697
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,501
when he stayed up
for three nights working.

698
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,069
The last one was...

699
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:47,838
My gosh.

700
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,306
When was that?

701
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:52,142
Why does this dress have holes in it?

702
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,844
Gosh, what do I do?

703
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,919
She seems somewhat busy and frustrated.

704
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,122
Why is she making a fuss?

705
00:52:05,188 --> 00:52:07,557
You're lucky that you can't see.

706
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,627
Your sister is being really silly.

707
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,766
Hey.

708
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,603
I'm sorry.

709
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,140
What did you do?
Why is your skin so moist?

710
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,208
It's refreshing, isn't it?

711
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,280
Is it Nam-hee?

712
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:33,650
Hello, Nam-hee. Did you get there safely?

713
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,819
Of course I did.

714
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:37,654
The air in Pennsylvania is...

715
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:39,623
Nam-hee, I'm sorry,

716
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,424
but I should be going out soon.

717
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,426
-Okay.
-Tomorrow,

718
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,761
-I'll call you back.
-Call me.

719
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,062
Bye.

720
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,595
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

721
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,274
Hello, Director Park.

722
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,476
What?

723
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,412
Did it really happen?

724
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,216
No, I've never heard of it.

725
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,752
I saw Mr. Do Min-ik assaulting his driver.

726
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,922
Yes. I'll look into it
and get back to you.

727
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:01,738
I'm glad you're here.

728
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,041
I had you arrive at 6:05 p.m. on purpose.

729
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,644
I didn't want you to arrive sooner
and talk about work.

730
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,316
You don't have to get me a ride.

731
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,720
My grandfather got me strong legs.

732
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,356
It's not just I only got you a ride.

733
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,292
I ordered some food and drinks.
Everything's ready.

734
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,427
So you can't make an excuse

735
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,664
that you can't buy me a drink today.

736
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,768
By the way, what's that?

737
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,838
A famous director filmed it,
so it looks amazing, right?

738
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,973
That's what I often do.

739
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:41,077
The more you see it,
the more you'll get attached.

740
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:46,116
People in this country are
familiar with cramming education.

741
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,120
I didn't tell you
that I went to college in the States.

742
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,394
Did you read it?

743
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,596
I just opened the envelope.

744
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,067
I just open an envelope
after our first meeting.

745
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,070
I read the first page
after the next meeting.

746
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,938
And the second page after that.

747
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,374
-In total...
-There are 30 pages.

748
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:16,813
It means we should meet at least 30 times.

749
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,382
What do you think of my offer?

750
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,951
Let's do that.

751
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,189
What? Why are you being so easy?
I'm losing my interest.

752
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,459
Because I know we're not
going to meet 30 times.

753
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:33,163
Once you read the first page,
you won't be able to stop.

754
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,664
You'll get curious.

755
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,302
I guess your grandfather
who grew chili peppers

756
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:42,772
gave you a lot of confidence as well.

757
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,643
Once I read the first page,

758
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,912
we will see if I'm curious or bored.

759
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,815
Watch carefully.

760
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,918
I deleted

761
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:58,722
your number.

762
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,091
So if you want to send me your proposal,

763
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,093
you will have to call me yourself.

764
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,030
I guess I was caught off guard
during our first meeting.

765
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,366
But I'm Veronica Park,
the Box Office Master.

766
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,870
I'm not that kind of woman
who calls a guy first.

767
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,941
If you want,

768
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:22,112
we can move onto the first page
right away tonight.

769
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,747
What do you think?

770
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,148
I don't think so.

771
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,916
Why not?

772
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,622
Ms. Lee, did you check the message board?

773
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:33,857
Mr. Gi.

774
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:37,160
I'm sorry,
but I can't talk to you right now.

775
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,129
Yes.

776
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:45,668
Why? Did your boss call you
to get your stories straight?

777
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,037
It was about work.

778
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,275
On May 6, Monday, where were you?

779
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,411
I went home.

780
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,746
My parent's house in Hwangcheon.

781
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,717
Did you meet Director Gi Dae-ju

782
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:02,952
that night?

783
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,257
Did you?

784
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,401
I can do this. I'll just get the umbrella

785
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,136
and come back home.

786
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,281
So, Mom,

787
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:35,185
please let it slide this once.

788
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,222
Tonight will be

789
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,324
the last time.

790
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,964
Oh, right.

791
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,935
The last time the patient saw
people's faces.

792
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,704
When was it?

793
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:02,779
Mr. Do Min-ik.

794
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,851
Veronica Park?

795
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:09,986
Yes.

796
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:12,755
But...

797
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,191
Where's the umbrella?

798
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,328
I didn't bring it.

799
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,264
I wasn't going to bring it
in the first place.

800
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,872
Then why did you want to see me?

801
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:37,647
Because I have indigestion.

802
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,250
What?

803
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,388
When I think of you,

804
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,026
my stomach

805
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,163
feels somewhat heavy.

806
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,103
I think I have indigestion.

807
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:10,246
When he met someone he loved.

808
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,851
He said he saw the woman's face clearly.

809
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,494
He said it was strangely clear.

810
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,004
SPECIAL THANKS TO BAE HAE-SEON

811
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,917
What is going on?

812
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,520
Do you still trust people?
Resign before the stockholders' meeting.

813
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,922
I can't see who's trying to help me.

814
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,524
-Min-ik.
-If there's anyone who saw it,

815
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,725
I'll get rid of them.

816
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,026
Can I see you for a moment today?

817
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:58,828
Bye.

818
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:00,463
Do I look pretty to you?

819
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,364
I can see you.

820
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:03,566
