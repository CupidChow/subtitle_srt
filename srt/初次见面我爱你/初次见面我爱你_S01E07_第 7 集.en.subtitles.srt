1
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,212
She should have just come with me.

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,115
The buses will stop running soon too.

3
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,830
Mom.

4
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,366
You know this, right?

5
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,769
I didn't mean to lie to him.

6
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,809
I know that.

7
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,414
If I were alive, on a day like this,

8
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,118
I would've poured soju for you

9
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,655
and played the tambourine
at the karaoke bar for you.

10
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,893
I feel bad that I had to die so early.

11
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,230
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,166
I'm making you worry even after you died.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,302
That's what moms do.

14
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,370
They worry about their kids
even after they die.

15
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,412
But the thing is,

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,583
maybe I really am a bad person.

17
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,854
I thought I didn't mean to lie to him,

18
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,792
but maybe I did.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,962
What do you mean?

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,068
I actually

21
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,470
quite enjoyed it.

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,777
When he let me under his umbrella

23
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,680
and followed me around.

24
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,719
I knew that he did those things

25
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,756
not because I was Jeong Minion

26
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,094
but because I was

27
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,999
Veronica Park, the heiress to Park Group.

28
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,869
But I still enjoyed it.

29
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,908
Those things might seem really trivial.

30
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,111
But he would never have

31
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,782
treated his secretary

32
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,952
that way.

33
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,558
Go inside now.

34
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,893
You'll catch a cold.

35
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,949
You said

36
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,285
you met your secretary
on the day of the accident.

37
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,056
But your secretary said she was visiting
her mother, who lives an hour away.

38
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,657
So when did you meet her?

39
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,162
Actually, we found
some surveillance camera footage

40
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,264
that's very interesting.

41
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,932
Look.

42
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,137
She was at Hwangcheon Villa at 12:10 a.m.

43
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,073
while you were at the Han River
17 minutes earlier.

44
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,076
Your secretary, Ms. Lee Eul-wang, was
caught on surveillance cameras

45
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,944
visiting her mother.

46
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,380
Even the janitor testified

47
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,249
that he saw Ms. Lee that day.

48
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:10,950
So how did you meet her?

49
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,186
I never said I met her.

50
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,921
I said I went to meet her.

51
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,425
-On the phone, Eul-wang's voice--
-Hold on.

52
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,194
"Eul-wang"?

53
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,596
Do I need to explain
my private life to you?

54
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,231
Okay, go on.

55
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,135
Hello, Ms. Lee.

56
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,507
-Ms. Lee?
-Go straight for 200m

57
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,810
-and turn left at Hwangcheon Intersection.
-Ms. Lee?

58
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,113
It sounded like
there had been an accident.

59
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,282
I became worried because
she wouldn't pick up.

60
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,685
I grabbed a taxi and went straight
to Hwangcheon Intersection.

61
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,987
But when I got there...

62
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,556
Your secretary wasn't there?

63
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:54,093
-That's right.
-Goodness.

64
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,163
We already checked
the surveillance cameras there too.

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,465
All the footage filmed after 9 p.m.

66
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:03,202
But no taxi was seen on the road

67
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,806
to Hwangcheon Intersection from Seoul.

68
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,608
That makes sense.

69
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,878
The taxi driver took a wrong turn.

70
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,579
What's the name, Owon-ri?

71
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,115
We had to enter Hwangcheon Intersection
from there instead.

72
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:17,850
Owon-ri?

73
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,986
There is an exit before the intersection.

74
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,854
Did you check the cameras there too?

75
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,223
There's never much traffic there,

76
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,658
so there are no surveillance cameras.

77
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,730
Even though I didn't say
what you wanted to hear,

78
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,699
I've told you everything I could.

79
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,168
Can I go now?

80
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,449
Isn't it strange?

81
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,151
When something happens to the boss,

82
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,619
his secretary goes to him.

83
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,054
But the boss went to his secretary

84
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,690
because something happened to her?
At such a late hour?

85
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,392
It was even an hour's drive away.

86
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,961
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

87
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,585
I almost forgot after staying
in a hotel suite for a few days.

88
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,821
Yes.

89
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,191
This is where I belong.

90
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,122
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

91
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,861
"The contract will be terminated
when the employee asks."

92
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,204
It was my dream

93
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,107
to get this.

94
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,750
He must have met her

95
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,119
by now.

96
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:53,973
What happened?

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,142
He hasn't called me yet.

98
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm late!

99
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,625
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

100
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,936
Here she comes! Finally!

101
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,241
The heroine of the stockholders' meeting
is back after two weeks.

102
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,409
The future CEO's secretary.

103
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,411
The rising sun of T&T Mobile.

104
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,947
Jeong Gal-hee

105
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,687
But why does our heroine look
so depressed?

106
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:45,191
She looks a bit too pale
for the rising sun.

107
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,595
MEDIA TEAM 1
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

108
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,779
Good morning, Mr. Do.

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,214
You're late.

110
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:17,523
You have something to tell me, right?

111
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,692
I do.

112
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,930
I don't know where to begin.

113
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,774
When I arrived

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,843
at the restaurant yesterday...

115
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,151
Mr. Do, why are you so late?

116
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,620
She had already left.

117
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,855
So you didn't get to see her?

118
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,024
Something came up,
and she left a minute ago.

119
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,694
She said she'd call you.

120
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,763
It must be her.
Go ahead and answer the phone.

121
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,098
Okay.

122
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,103
Hello.

123
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,607
So did you meet Veronica Park in the end?

124
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:13,079
This is where things get interesting.

125
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,489
You're here.

126
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,758
Hold on.

127
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,427
It was Dr. Gu who was there?

128
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,664
Why did you go and meet Dr. Gu,
all of a sudden?

129
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,333
The viewer is getting so worked up.

130
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,170
It makes me want to tease you.

131
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,507
Can't you just tell me
what happened in the end?

132
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,412
I have to go somewhere.

133
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,714
Think of it as a commercial break.

134
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,517
You'd better grab a blanket
and wait for me.

135
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,754
The upcoming plot twist is so shocking
that it'll give you the chills.

136
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,256
You'll need something to keep you warm.

137
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,834
Did he meet her or not?

138
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,571
He probably didn't.

139
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,741
If he did, there would've been
a ton of things he found strange,

140
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,877
and he wouldn't
beat around the bush like that.

141
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:25,284
Yes, he did.

142
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,757
That's why he says there's a plot twist.

143
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,162
What else could be the twist?

144
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,835
Is it ready? Where is it?

145
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,670
Is this it?

146
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,146
Gosh, I should've listened to Dr. Park.

147
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,549
I shouldn't have told you that
on the phone while drunk.

148
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,150
Don't say that.

149
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,652
"With increased blood pressure,

150
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,921
you're able to see people's faces."

151
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,856
That's the biggest twist

152
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,524
since I got prosopagnosia.

153
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,794
When blood pressure goes up,

154
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,098
more blood is supplied
to the fusiform gyrus than usual,

155
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,733
which raises your chances of seeing faces.

156
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,301
But there's no guarantee.

157
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,336
I'll put in effort on my end too.

158
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,105
From now on,
apart from when I'm sleeping...

159
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,941
No. Even when I'm sleeping,
all my energy will be spent on

160
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,643
raising my blood pressure.

161
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,246
Your blood pressure isn't your grades.

162
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,348
-You can't raise it just by trying.
-What?

163
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,684
In addition, you haven't been able to see

164
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,886
a single person's face since the accident.

165
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,054
That's wrong.

166
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,190
I have.

167
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,794
You have?

168
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,164
Once, it was at the stockholders' meeting.

169
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:52,071
It was as if a camera was focusing
on an object.

170
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
I could see people's faces clearly.

171
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,343
-And then...
-And then?

172
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,678
The other time was...

173
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,018
Did I really

174
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,587
see her face at that moment?

175
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,890
I can see it.

176
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,893
When was it? What were you doing?

177
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,328
I happened to be

178
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,497
doing this.

179
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,200
Like this.

180
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,572
I was holding a girl.

181
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,541
-You have feelings for her, right?
-What?

182
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,776
The prosopagnosia patient Dr. Park treated

183
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,111
could clearly see the face

184
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,013
of the woman he loved too.

185
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,115
Let me explain.

186
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,551
Your heart rate would increase
in front of a woman you love.

187
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:42,054
And that would naturally raise
your blood pressure too.

188
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,791
It was nothing like love!

189
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,028
It must have been a dream.

190
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,040
Where's the medicine?

191
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,775
It's too dangerous to take medicine.

192
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,743
To raise blood supply to the brain,

193
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,278
you have to be given a cardiac stimulant

194
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,814
or four to five liters of fluids.

195
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,950
But it might give you side effects such as

196
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,818
chest pains, headaches, and heart failure.

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,061
What's this?

198
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,097
They're compression stockings
for medical use.

199
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,532
They're used by spinal injury patients

200
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,367
who suffer from orthostatic hypotension.

201
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,538
You expect me to wear these?

202
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,440
You asked me to bring
anything that might help!

203
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,641
So I did!

204
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,945
As you requested,

205
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,448
I wrote down the situations
where your blood pressure might go up.

206
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,616
This is

207
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,684
a portable blood pressure monitor.

208
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,590
By the way, whose face do you want to see

209
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,292
so badly?

210
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,332
There's a face I must see.

211
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,204
I'll find the situation,

212
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,772
place, and behavior

213
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,375
that raise my blood pressure.

214
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,144
And then I'll meet her.

215
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,947
I want to see her face

216
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,084
even just for a few seconds.

217
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,430
Did I tell you this?

218
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,601
I'm a jerk. Even worse than you think.

219
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,371
There's something
I haven't told you, Mr. Gi.

220
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,776
I'm a crazy bitch who goes after bad guys.

221
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,415
How can I help you?

222
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,283
What do you need?

223
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,352
We're very close.

224
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,387
You have to make an appointment first.

225
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,023
Why is it so noisy around here?

226
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,059
You can't...

227
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,695
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:07,032
She kept insisting she has a special
relationship with you and made a scene.

229
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,502
I like your office.

230
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,838
I did some research, Old Lady...

231
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,175
Anyway, it seems like...

232
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,344
you're pretty famous.

233
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,214
Listen. Even the most successful
movie directors

234
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,316
dread entering my office.

235
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,052
They can't even keep their heads up.

236
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,788
How dare you barge in here like this!

237
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,665
What? Did you think I'd get angry?

238
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,202
I can just buy one more.

239
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,505
Really?

240
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,643
That was fine too, right?

241
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,314
Now I just have to buy two.

242
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,715
Ms. Kim!

243
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,920
Replace them with the exact same ones.

244
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,157
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,063
What do you want me to do?
Should I drag her out?

246
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,564
Leave her here.

247
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,035
So I can at least take it out on that kid
when I feel crabby.

248
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,269
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,274
I came here to ask you something.

250
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,881
How do I become a star?

251
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,265
Have you lived in New York?

252
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,766
You have a bit of an East Coast accent.

253
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,068
I've been taking online courses.

254
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,004
I was one of the top students
in my school,

255
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,705
although, sadly,

256
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,974
I didn't get into
the University of Pennsylvania.

257
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,910
Wait.

258
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,746
Then keep doing what you're good at

259
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,282
instead of trying to do what you suck at
and causing trouble.

260
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,018
The only way to go from rags to riches
in this country

261
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,653
is to be a star.

262
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,888
Even if I study hard,

263
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,291
I'll end up cleaning up after
people like you.

264
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,928
Don't you think

265
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,233
I'm the one who's cleaning after you?

266
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,038
I'll become a star by all means.

267
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,775
All the people who have looked down on

268
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,444
and been cruel to my big sister...

269
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,946
I'll make all of them

270
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,148
kneel down in front of her.

271
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,518
So you want revenge?

272
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,158
That sure sounds tempting.

273
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,794
But before that...

274
00:18:57,002 --> 00:19:00,072
Why don't you sit here
and channel your anger

275
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,774
into this?

276
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,410
Think of the jerks who have been
mean to your sister

277
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,246
one by one.

278
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,350
Let your deep-seated
resentment and hostility out.

279
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,820
Let it all out.

280
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,791
NOTARIZED WARNING

281
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,064
Ms. Jeong.

282
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,371
Where did she go?

283
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,706
I told her to wait for me.

284
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,842
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

285
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,781
Has she already signed it?

286
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,553
She must have found the contract
so beautiful

287
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,121
that she signed it right away.

288
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,822
I'M SORRY

289
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:51,790
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,403
You're back.

291
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,545
"I'm sorry"?

292
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,480
Does this mean

293
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:20,319
you don't want to work for me anymore?

294
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,289
I thought I shouldn't.

295
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,128
Why not?

296
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,831
Has someone offered you a higher salary?

297
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,566
-Pardon?
-Or

298
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,737
are you tired of me?

299
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,640
Well... The thing is...

300
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,543
He didn't meet her. He didn't.

301
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,814
That's why he doesn't know
why I should quit.

302
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,316
Gal-hee, open your mouth.

303
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,985
Open it.

304
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,021
Open it and tell him the truth.

305
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,661
What? Can't you bring yourself
to tell me the truth?

306
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:04,563
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

307
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,731
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

308
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,303
I know.

309
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,706
It's too much.

310
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,808
I'm mean

311
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,245
as well as ill.

312
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,017
No wonder you're tired of your boss.

313
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:30,322
I'm the boss, and you're the secretary.

314
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,291
I'm the employer, and you're the employee.

315
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,028
After all, that's the only relationship

316
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,996
you and I have.

317
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,699
If you don't like your employer,

318
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,202
you should quit.

319
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,005
Ms. Jeong.

320
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,209
You're wiser

321
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:52,577
than I thought.

322
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,728
I'M SORRY

323
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,601
Do you remember the last time
we were here?

324
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,805
I sure do.

325
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,407
You said if I kicked Min-ik out
of the board of directors,

326
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,410
you'd consolidate the media teams
and let me take charge.

327
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:34,986
But why did the player

328
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,223
ignore the agreement with the coach
and changed teams?

329
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,292
It wasn't an agreement.

330
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,627
It was a proposal.

331
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,964
I never agreed to it.

332
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,768
Who do you choose?

333
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,772
Who do you work for, Do Min-ik or me?

334
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,676
Do I always have to

335
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,747
work for someone?

336
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,719
You're right.

337
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,258
A competent player like you should
get to play on his own sometimes.

338
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:18,497
Mr. Park tells me
to get a new player right now,

339
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,699
but I'm not sure about that.

340
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,301
Just because the player scored an own goal

341
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,303
doesn't mean he's lost his skills.

342
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,573
In addition, Veronica Park is
a shrewd and calculating woman.

343
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,510
If she has risked even her position as CEO
in order to support you...

344
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,982
I'd better keep the player on the team
even if he scored an own goal.

345
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,917
What are you talking about?

346
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,454
Veronica Park has risked
her position as CEO?

347
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,829
Exercises like running and cycling
effectively raise blood pressure.

348
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,698
Your blood pressure monitor will alert you

349
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,333
when it rises over 140.

350
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,203
Blood pressure is considered high
when it's between 140 and 90.

351
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:12,884
What?

352
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,520
What? Can't you bring yourself
to tell me the truth?

353
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,155
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

354
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,323
-Yes.
-"Yes"?

355
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,960
"Yes"?

356
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,263
Do you think I work with you
because I like you?

357
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,769
Only 100?

358
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,072
But I exercised so hard.

359
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,975
How hard do I have to work out
to make my blood pressure go over 140?

360
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,617
"Drinking right after exercise

361
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,752
activates your sympathetic nervous system

362
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,921
and rapidly increases
your blood pressure."

363
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,824
Drinking?

364
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,906
Why did I say, "Yes" at that moment?

365
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:09,875
Shoot.

366
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,678
I wish he'd met her.

367
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,517
Nothing seems to go my way.

368
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,123
Gosh, seriously?

369
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,125
Who comes to this place
wearing such tight clothes?

370
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,301
Ms. Jeong?

371
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,475
One serving of trotter
and a bottle of soju, please!

372
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,517
If I'm making you uncomfortable,
should I leave?

373
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,920
Why? Does it pain you so much
that you have to put up with me

374
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,055
even outside the workplace?

375
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,557
That's not what I meant.

376
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,792
Then mind your own business

377
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,527
and let me drink my soju.

378
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,897
There's only one reason why I'm here.

379
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,400
It's to drink soju.

380
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,902
Why are you drinking soju,
all of a sudden?

381
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,673
You never drink more than
a glass of champagne.

382
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:16,942
Well...

383
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,712
Come to think of it,
your outfit looks weird too.

384
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,714
Are they giving me my soju or not?

385
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,451
You can drink mine for now.

386
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,131
What's this? A blood pressure monitor?

387
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,733
What are you doing?

388
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,703
Do you have blood pressure problems?

389
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:45,937
That's not it.

390
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,209
As soon as my illness is cured,

391
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,180
the contract between you and me

392
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:58,984
will be terminated immediately.

393
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,988
That means

394
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:07,859
she'll leave me as soon as
I can see people's faces again.

395
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,161
It's nothing serious.

396
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,864
Dr. Gu thinks I should keep an eye on it.

397
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,967
That sounds pretty serious.

398
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,471
Is that the plot twist you talked about?

399
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,376
Why can't you two sit at the same table?

400
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,244
You two are obviously close.

401
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,247
You got the wrong idea!

402
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,249
We're not close at all.

403
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,752
It's just as you see.

404
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,987
As of today,

405
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,858
we've turned against each other.

406
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,760
After drinking two bottles of soju,
it's still only 110.

407
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,131
Is this out of order?

408
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,695
I think it's you that's out of order.

409
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,604
Me?

410
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,607
I'm not drunk.

411
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,610
Goodness.

412
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,534
Where did the kickstand go?

413
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,704
No way.

414
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,778
I was right.

415
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,148
Ms. Jeong.

416
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,084
Call the police right now.

417
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,519
Why?

418
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:50,221
What do you mean? Don't you see?

419
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,325
Someone stole the handlebars of my bike.

420
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,834
Get off.

421
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,971
Get off.

422
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,139
What?

423
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,589
Hold on tight.

424
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,225
You were all wobbly earlier.

425
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,794
What are you talking about?

426
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,629
I'm sober now.

427
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,798
I don't have to hold onto you.

428
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,569
By the way,

429
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,972
there's something
I didn't get to tell you earlier.

430
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,041
It's something
I couldn't say it to your face,

431
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,144
so I'll say it now. Please listen.

432
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,346
What is it?

433
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,750
The thing is...

434
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,675
Are you okay?

435
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,581
Maybe I'm still drunk.

436
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,720
My heart is racing,

437
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,590
and I have butterflies in my stomach.

438
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,092
What's wrong with me?

439
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,871
Oh, my.

440
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,849
Mom, are you attending an event?

441
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:01,486
Yes, I'm attending your wedding.

442
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,158
Mom.

443
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:12,196
I don't even know him very well yet.

444
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,866
You stupid girl!

445
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,435
Meeting a guy once

446
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,238
is enough to figure him out.

447
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,941
You don't get to know a guy better

448
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,476
just because you meet him more!

449
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,614
Listen now.

450
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:35,019
Wearing silk in the summer
gives you sweaty armpits.

451
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,855
You have until the flowers fall

452
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,290
to pick a date.

453
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,901
This is driving me crazy.

454
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,606
Mr. Do is here.

455
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,850
I'll go home now.

456
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,685
Goodnight.

457
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:09,988
Wait.

458
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,291
Didn't you say
you had something to tell me?

459
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,859
Well...

460
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,600
I'll tell you when you sober up.

461
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,036
Bye.

462
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:37,582
Do you have to go?

463
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,084
Pardon?

464
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,388
Can you stay

465
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,923
by my side?

466
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:50,628
Can you?

467
00:33:56,968 --> 00:34:00,038
Do you want me to stay by your side?

468
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,179
Gosh.

469
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,851
Those two bottles of soju are
making me sound too romantic.

470
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,222
Let me rephrase that in dry words.

471
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,559
Tell me whatever terms or salary you want.

472
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:25,229
I'll think about it.

473
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,466
So please reconsider our contract.

474
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,002
I need someone

475
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,838
to tell people apart for me
until the CEO election.

476
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,515
Gosh.

477
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:52,924
I have to go.

478
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:58,996
What's up with her?

479
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,280
Hello.

480
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,852
I think I'm in front of your house.

481
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,487
You're where?

482
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,495
My place is pretty shabby.

483
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,999
So this is what the word "shabby" means.

484
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,537
Incredible. I've only seen that word
in books until now.

485
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,673
This is the first time
I've actually seen something shabby.

486
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,877
You came all the way here at this hour.

487
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,946
I assume it's something important.

488
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,017
Let's end it.

489
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,153
Pardon?

490
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,222
I want to end it.

491
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,758
The relationship between your boss and me.

492
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,962
I want it to end more than anyone.

493
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,231
But If I break up with him,

494
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:11,802
my mom will break my back
by giving me a kick.

495
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,070
Tell your boss

496
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,441
he should tell his mom that we broke up.

497
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,944
That seems unlikely to happen.

498
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,916
He likes you.

499
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,151
What?

500
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,492
His mother thinks

501
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,893
he likes you.

502
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,199
What's going on here?

503
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,569
Why do things keep
getting more complicated?

504
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,071
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,775
I didn't know things would get
this complicated myself.

506
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,247
Then what about this?

507
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,349
Let's pretend

508
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,085
I met another guy.

509
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,187
Another guy?

510
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,357
Your boss was deeply in love with me,

511
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,927
but I was already seeing another man.

512
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,730
Once Ms. Sim hears this,

513
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,299
she'd be too proud

514
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:20,104
to say it to my mom.

515
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,809
She'd instead blame our
personal differences and busy schedules.

516
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,845
Wouldn't that settle everything
beautifully?

517
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,847
What do you think of my scenario?

518
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,617
Ms. Park, there's something more to this.

519
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,218
Listen up, Gal-hee.

520
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,355
Following your scenario resulted in my mom

521
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,290
ordering a dress for my wedding.

522
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,627
I think we have only two options left now.

523
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,463
We either follow my scenario

524
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:49,133
or your boss and I get married.

525
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,639
"No.

526
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,909
The only person my boss needs
by his side is

527
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,478
me,

528
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,581
Jeong Gal-hee."

529
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,418
Gosh, I caught you out again.

530
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,222
Let's hurry up and settle things.

531
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,890
Otherwise, my mom

532
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,793
will order wedding invitations next week.

533
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:31,776
Can you stay by my side?

534
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,612
Can you?

535
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,715
I wish I could.

536
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:45,956
Then what about this?

537
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,593
Let's pretend I met another guy.

538
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,462
I can't

539
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,031
lie to him again.

540
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,767
I can't.

541
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,610
I'll meet him and break up with him,

542
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,346
saying I met another guy.

543
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,514
I'll end this relationship completely.

544
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,216
All right.

545
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,552
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
CAN WE MEET TOMORROW?

546
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,693
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
CAN WE MEET TOMORROW?

547
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,428
Send it, Gal-hee.

548
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,899
Once you stop this crazy act,

549
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:34,605
everything will go back
to the way it used to be.

550
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,875
Then...

551
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,780
even if I can't be a woman to him anymore,

552
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,783
I'll be able to stay by his side

553
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,351
as his secretary.

554
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,821
So send it. Right now.

555
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,959
I sent it!

556
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,497
I have something to tell you.

557
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:02,266
Can we meet tomorrow?

558
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,468
Tomorrow?

559
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,138
What do I do?

560
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,675
I don't know how to raise
my blood pressure yet.

561
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,749
I'll take this purse

562
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,752
and wear these shoes.

563
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,324
Earrings...

564
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,298
Right. I have to copy the file.

565
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,212
EDG

566
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,516
It's an Excel file?

567
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,619
But Mr. Do rarely uses Excel.

568
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,224
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU
BUT GOD IS ALWAYS JUST TO EVERYONE

569
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,961
"Man may be unjust to you
but God is always just to everyone."

570
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:05,796
What is this?

571
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,732
What kind of file is this?

572
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,844
How am I supposed to put these on?

573
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,317
-Hi.
-Hi.

574
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,260
What's that noise?

575
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,298
-You dirty...
-Ma'am.

576
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,269
It's not what you think it is.

577
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,805
The stockings I'm wearing are

578
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,375
strictly for medical purposes.

579
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,777
If those stockings are for medical use,

580
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,847
this mop is for educational use, you punk.

581
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,849
Before I clean the toilets,

582
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,084
I should get rid of something
even filthier.

583
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,587
Get out, you pervert!

584
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,688
Okay.

585
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,791
How could you do this
at people's workplace

586
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,560
in broad daylight?

587
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,663
Get out, okay?

588
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,830
-Get out!
-Okay.

589
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,166
-Ma'am, I'm a patient.
-You dirty little...

590
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,634
I'm innocent!

591
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,337
You don't really look the type.
How could you do something so filthy?

592
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,873
You got the wrong idea.

593
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,142
I saw it with my own eyes!

594
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,650
Good morning.

595
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,019
Are you

596
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,922
going for gukbap again?

597
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,825
Darn it.

598
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,064
What? What's going on?

599
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,970
Mr. Do, let's go to your office.
Right now.

600
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,139
Hurry.

601
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,248
What did we just see?

602
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,486
Is this another strategy of his,

603
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,355
following the stockholders' meeting?

604
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,790
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

605
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,672
"Compression stockings for medical use"?

606
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,511
"Relieves symptoms
of varicose veins, skin ulcers,

607
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,947
and deep vein thrombosis."

608
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,083
Is that punk sick again?

609
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,360
DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY

610
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,030
"Department of Neurosurgery,
Sangmo Hospital."

611
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,707
Excuse me.

612
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,646
I'm Mr. Do's secretary.

613
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:45,149
Can you give me

614
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,751
Mr. Do's pants and shoes?

615
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,854
Just a second.

616
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,227
I even squeezed myself into these,
but my blood pressure isn't going up.

617
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:00,397
I really wanted to see
Veronica's face today.

618
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,239
Mr. Do, you've been acting
very strange lately.

619
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,974
The CEO election is
just around the corner.

620
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,076
Turn around.

621
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:14,878
Gosh.

622
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,849
Here are your pants.

623
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,389
If this is your hobby,

624
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,291
please only enjoy it at home.

625
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,793
I'm not doing this as a hobby.
It's for medical purposes!

626
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,562
These aren't just regular stockings.

627
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,697
These increase your blood pressure.

628
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,232
Is your condition that serious?

629
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,567
Turn around!

630
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,538
How do I even get out of these?

631
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:43,607
Well...

632
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,676
I can't do this.

633
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,379
You've taken off many stockings so far,
haven't you?

634
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,251
I've only dated girls who wear pants.
Are you happy now?

635
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,256
Gosh.

636
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:02,760
Pulling them off like that won't work.

637
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:03,894
What?

638
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,064
Try rolling them down
from the waist instead.

639
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,833
-Roll them down?
-I mean...

640
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,668
Like a snake shedding its skin...

641
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,936
Like this.

642
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:16,540
Do you want me to help?

643
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,775
Turn around!

644
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,843
Don't look at me or come near me!

645
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,012
Just stay there
and tell me what to do, okay?

646
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,050
How are you going to take them off then?

647
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,320
Gosh.

648
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,322
Mr. Do.

649
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,024
Yes?

650
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:38,028
I might have found a way.

651
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:39,963
What is it?

652
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,974
Let's rip them off.

653
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:53,677
Rip them off?

654
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,546
Let's do this.

655
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,849
I'm not looking at you.

656
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,450
My back is turned.

657
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,527
Excuse me. I'll have to touch you.

658
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,234
What's wrong?

659
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,303
Nothing.

660
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,104
Well...

661
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:23,540
Here we go.

662
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,654
You didn't have to see me home.

663
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:39,890
You're meeting

664
00:47:40,424 --> 00:47:42,492
someone later too.

665
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,962
Before that important appointment,

666
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,297
I'm kindly seeing you home.

667
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,701
So think about the contract
I talked about yesterday.

668
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,812
The flash drive I told you about...

669
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,848
It has a strange file in it.

670
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:08,285
Do you mean Romi's Licking

671
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,053
and Innocent Girl Ayeong?

672
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,524
They're nothing dirty.

673
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,793
They're videos of dogs that look like
the ones I used to have.

674
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,695
I wanted to show them to Dae-ju.

675
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,198
It's an Excel file.

676
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,367
The content is weird too.

677
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:26,236
It looks like a ledger,
full of mysterious numbers.

678
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:28,405
And it has a strange title.

679
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,942
"Man may be unjust to you
but God is always just to everyone."

680
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,124
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

681
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,026
Yes, I'm fine.

682
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,195
The bandage is wrinkled.

683
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,832
That's fine.
The cut isn't that deep anyway.

684
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:03,573
Why is there such a file
in my flash drive?

685
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,876
Maybe you took someone else's.

686
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,711
Those were handed out
on the foundation day.

687
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,912
They're everywhere.

688
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,950
But it was in the pocket of the suit
you wore on the day of the accident.

689
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,525
Gosh, I told him it was confidential.

690
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,627
Could it be

691
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,264
that the flash drive I picked up
in Dae-ju's office that day

692
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,067
was Dae-ju's, not mine?

693
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:34,504
I saved the copy of the file on my flash
drive and put it in your drawer.

694
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,974
Check it tomorrow morning.

695
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:38,608
Okay.

696
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:44,214
There seems to be something wrong
with the car. What do we do?

697
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,517
It should probably be taken
to the repair shop.

698
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,389
We're almost there, aren't we?

699
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,793
Well...

700
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,297
Mr. Do, you're not

701
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,433
particularly clingy with women, are you?

702
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,770
Do I ever cling to a woman?

703
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,472
Never!

704
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,679
Even if a girl breaks up with you,

705
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,015
do you never get hurt?

706
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:21,551
Women can't hurt me. Scissors can.

707
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,556
That's a relief.

708
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,794
Oh, it's raining.

709
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,798
I thought I had an umbrella.

710
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,501
-Come.
-Use this.

711
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,904
You can use my cardigan.

712
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,041
Come closer.

713
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,476
Forget it. Come here.

714
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,604
Am I seeing

715
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,873
your face?

716
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,447
What? Why now?

717
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,183
Pardon?

718
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,786
I'm not drunk.

719
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,923
I'm not nervous either. So why?

720
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,959
You're not even wearing
your cardigan right now.

721
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,929
Is your blood pressure up again?

722
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,833
Stay here. I'll go and get an umbrella.

723
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,001
Don't go.

724
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,575
Stay with me for one minute.

725
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,980
-Still...
-I'm fine.

726
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,117
Just look at me.

727
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,049
It's been a while,

728
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,752
Ms. Jeong.

729
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:56,173
Well... Does blood pressure
affect your intelligence as well?

730
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:58,508
I've been with you all day.

731
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,754
By the way, aren't you
meeting someone soon?

732
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,159
I'm sorry,

733
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,896
but I have to go now.
Cover yourself with this.

734
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,132
No way.

735
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,867
I'll use this instead.

736
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,287
Oh, my.

737
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:54,431
Hi, it's Do Min-ik.

738
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,601
Is it okay if we meet

739
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,769
somewhere else?

740
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,839
Something suddenly

741
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,041
came up.

742
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,578
Okay. See you in a bit.

743
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:09,879
See you.

744
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,986
Why does he want to meet somewhere else?

745
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,095
This place is

746
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,099
right there.

747
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:34,337
Is he telling me to come
to the front of the excavator?

748
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,587
Is something bothering you?

749
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:54,157
Can you read my mind?
How did you know that?

750
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,860
This is what you did
when your mother passed away.

751
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,395
Playing games all day.

752
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,400
Is it because of

753
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,669
the police?

754
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,277
Everything went well.

755
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,579
Don't worry about it.

756
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,282
Or is it

757
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,253
about the woman called Veronica Park?

758
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,292
How do you know about her?

759
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:40,003
This was delivered to the office.

760
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,817
It's getting late. Thanks
for bringing all the food, as always.

761
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,057
I'll see you at work tomorrow, Mr. Gi.

762
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,736
FROM VERONICA PARK

763
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,807
NOTARIZED WARNING

764
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:19,709
"Notarized warning"?

765
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,951
"If Gi Dae-ju does not buy a meal

766
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,086
as he promised,

767
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,390
he will be reported to the authorities

768
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,526
and face legal actions..."

769
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,741
BOSS

770
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:54,277
There's a problem, Boss.

771
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,886
Someone saw the document.

772
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,554
In addition,

773
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,923
she even remembers the phrase,
word for word.

774
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,492
Jeong Gal-hee.

775
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,329
Luckily, she doesn't seem to know
what those numbers mean yet.

776
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,065
But when she realizes what they mean,

777
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,635
she won't just sit back.

778
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,105
Now there are two options.

779
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,975
The woman gets rid of us,

780
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,645
or we

781
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,580
get rid of her.

782
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,375
Here she comes.

783
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:13,356
Will I see her face?

784
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:19,529
I will.

785
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,767
I do.

786
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,247
SPECIAL THANKS TO OH YOUNG-SIL

787
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,959
Did he recognize me?

788
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,961
How can everything be exactly the same?

789
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:52,929
Do you like me?

790
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,697
Don't you think it'd be unfair
if a woman like me

791
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:55,965
who has everything also has love?

792
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,600
My hunch was right.

793
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,869
I knew something would happen.

794
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,871
What are you two doing here?

795
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,375
