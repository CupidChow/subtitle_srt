1
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,039
Is the person you like

2
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,308
Veronica Park?

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,447
Is it Ms. Jeong?

4
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,285
Who is it you love?

5
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,859
Both of them.

6
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,662
I love both of them.

7
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,338
Hey.

8
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:15,708
I'm not asking, "Who do you love more,
Mom or Dad?"

9
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,411
You love both of them?

10
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,115
If you're a grown man,
shouldn't you at least know

11
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,317
who it is that you love?

12
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,419
I'm frustrated too.

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,689
I'm confused like crazy.

14
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,859
I don't know what's wrong with my head.

15
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,061
How did I come
to this disgusting conclusion?

16
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,933
When I'm with Veronica,

17
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,435
I think of Ms. Jeong.

18
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,804
When I'm with Ms. Jeong,

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,243
I think of Veronica.

20
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,313
I don't want to hear anymore.

21
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,617
At some point,

22
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,587
I started thinking

23
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,089
the two of them are so similar.

24
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,927
Sometimes, even their voices

25
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,363
sound similar.

26
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,133
When I touched Ms. Jeong's lips earlier,

27
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,568
it reminded me

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,371
of Veronica's lips

29
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,307
for a second.

30
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,812
Are you really the Do Min-ik I know?

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,150
Right. I hate myself for this too.

32
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,253
I can imagine how you'd feel.

33
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,925
I'll be going.

34
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,287
What could that have been, Mom?

35
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,758
What else? He meant what he did and said.

36
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,662
No way.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,200
The fish his father left behind died.

38
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,536
He was feeling all emotional,

39
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,038
and I happened to be there.

40
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,176
That's why he made such a mistake.

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,214
Still, would you expect your boss
to do that to just any girl?

42
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,616
Don't you know?

43
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,353
The woman he loves is Veronica Park.

44
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,622
She's you after all.

45
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,394
She has money.

46
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,030
Mr. Do said he loves her
because she has a lot of money.

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,400
Also because she is competent
and comes from a prestigious family.

48
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,103
She's not me.

49
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,372
Never.

50
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,944
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,681
If you'd been born into a better family,

52
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,951
you wouldn't have had to lie to him.

53
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,153
Don't say that.

54
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,892
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,095
I'm not letting you rest

56
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,265
even after you died.

57
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,302
I keep bothering you with my problems.

58
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,846
I still want to believe

59
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,517
that it wasn't a mistake.
That he loves you.

60
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,499
Get up right now!

61
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,004
Why would you show up here so early
and ask for a CT scan?

62
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,575
I'm sure there's something wrong
with my brain.

63
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,413
After the accident, I didn't only
lose the ability to recognize faces.

64
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,215
I also lost the ability
to control my emotions and desires.

65
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,384
I'm sure that's it.

66
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,819
What are you talking about?

67
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,421
The thing is,

68
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,125
I'm in love with two women
at the same time.

69
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,198
What's with you? Have you lost your mind?

70
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,800
Right? I'm living

71
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,702
in a civilized, monogamous society.

72
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,172
I've never had any girl problems
in my life.

73
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,008
And here I'm having these crazy thoughts.

74
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,577
Do a CT scan right now.

75
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,479
There's something wrong with me.

76
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,983
Seeing you like this reminds me

77
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,320
of back when I had to choose my specialty.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,289
I was torn between

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,990
neurosurgery and orthopedics.

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,326
It's not the same.

81
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,062
Do you know what's funny?

82
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,764
People always think about
where they should go,

83
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,667
but they rarely think about
where they come from.

84
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,235
What does that mean?

85
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,804
Stop thinking about
where your love is headed.

86
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,741
Think about where your feelings
originally come from.

87
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,477
That'll give you an answer

88
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,379
about who you should choose.

89
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,116
Ms. Jeong.

90
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,218
Mr. Do.

91
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,769
Well... Mr. Do.

92
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,138
About yesterday...

93
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,109
Stay away.

94
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,878
If I ever get close to you again,

95
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,515
avoid me.

96
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,919
I'm a disgusting man.

97
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,712
Stop.

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,081
Don't come within a one-meter radius.

99
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,083
No personal conversation
or physical contact is allowed.

100
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,785
-Mr. Do.
-Wait.

101
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,021
You haven't taken a day off
since your contract was renewed.

102
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,122
This is great.

103
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,426
Why don't you take a few days off?

104
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,428
That's too sudden.

105
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,398
Is this because of yesterday?

106
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:25,304
-Do you think what you did is a mistake?
-It was not a mistake.

107
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,306
It wasn't a mistake.

108
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,877
In any case, please

109
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,380
keep some distance from me.

110
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,132
Please explain why
I should keep a distance.

111
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,500
I'm not

112
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,371
as nice

113
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,308
as you think I am.

114
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,581
I know.

115
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,417
Without you, I can't even
recognize people's faces.

116
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,953
I can't tell whether
they're smiling or crying either.

117
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,122
I'm such a fool.

118
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,025
But there's a reason

119
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,494
why I should do this,

120
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,762
so please leave.

121
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,099
If you're near me,

122
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,503
I don't know...

123
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,576
what crazy thing I might do.

124
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,748
So please...

125
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,068
Can you

126
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,537
go get a bucket for me?

127
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,341
I need something to catch my tears in.

128
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,279
Why are you doing this?

129
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,748
I haven't heard from him.

130
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,117
I mean Mr. Chastity.

131
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,121
I knew he was taking advantage of you.

132
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,291
What is it that he suddenly
had to take care of at that hour?

133
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,561
Is he a neat freak?

134
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,831
Is he spring-cleaning his house?

135
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,432
Or could it be

136
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,069
that I signed the contract

137
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,673
way too fast?

138
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:46,312
Let me jump into the Han River right now.

139
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,915
My gosh.

140
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,492
Ms. Park, I found Mr. Gi.

141
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,398
I'm leaving.

142
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:07,600
Before you go,

143
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,935
tell me why you wanted me to come here.

144
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,072
Try saying, "Damn it."

145
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,041
You're supposed to teach me how to act.

146
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,442
Why are you making a teenager swear?

147
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,577
This is your workplace,

148
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,415
and that happens to be your first line.

149
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,150
Damn it.

150
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,719
See? I can make you swear right away.

151
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,488
Are you telling me to say
such a lousy line in this shabby theater?

152
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,624
After all the help with the guy,

153
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,694
shouldn't you at least let me
star in a TV show or something?

154
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,863
This is how I teach people how to act.

155
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,332
I humiliate the actor

156
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,536
into acting more expressively.
It's called "method acting."

157
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,206
Never let go of
your dreams and hopes, kid.

158
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,116
Damn it.

159
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,294
Can I borrow some bait?

160
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,732
Ms. Park Ok-sun?

161
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,201
I'm going to change my name.

162
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,938
Have you been following me?

163
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,808
You still don't know me?

164
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,911
I had someone else follow you.

165
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,649
I mean...

166
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,518
"You should trust people."

167
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,387
"Always love someone."

168
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,690
After telling me those sweet words,

169
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,359
one after another,

170
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,995
as soon as I signed the contract,

171
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,663
I stopped hearing from you.

172
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,699
It's moving.

173
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,668
You mean your heart is moving away?

174
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:51,637
I mean that.

175
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,273
If it's moving,

176
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,943
let me, Veronica Park, hold it still.

177
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,161
It looks fantastic.

178
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,275
She's not someone you can easily forget.

179
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,481
Why do you have to be so attractive

180
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,449
and sway a guy's heart?

181
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,485
Am I?

182
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,886
First of all,

183
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,888
I'd like to apologize.

184
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,624
For not calling me?

185
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,393
For what Min-ik did.

186
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,833
You found out about him and me?

187
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,069
If Min-ik has ever hurt you,

188
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,704
please forgive him.

189
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,072
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,009
It's understandable
that you got the wrong idea,

191
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,311
but Mr. Do and I don't have

192
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,246
the relationship you think--

193
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,914
I'm the one who should apologize.

194
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,751
Listening to Min-ik talk about you,

195
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,721
a lot of thoughts went through my mind.

196
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:18,490
It took me a while
to come to a conclusion.

197
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,492
If it's a bad one,

198
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,895
I refuse to hear it.

199
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:35,541
My conclusion was
that I couldn't make any conclusion.

200
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,612
Two guys fighting over a woman,

201
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,881
telling each other to give up on her.

202
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,349
It just doesn't make sense.

203
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,552
It's not our decision to make.

204
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,487
It's yours.

205
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,224
If you choose Min-ik, I'll give up on you.

206
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,494
If you choose me...

207
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,431
If that's your decision,

208
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,233
I'll make Min-ik give up by all means.

209
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,569
So just think about yourself

210
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,504
and follow your heart.

211
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,139
In that case,

212
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,742
I say...

213
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:15,147
Which guy should I choose?

214
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,584
You look nervous.

215
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,056
I know

216
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,593
a surefire way
to find out what you really want

217
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,062
in a situation like this.

218
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,031
What's that?

219
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,176
No.

220
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,948
I'll wait until you feel
more sure about this.

221
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,586
I wonder what Mr. Do is up to right now.

222
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,025
I think we should hold back

223
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,027
until you make up your mind.

224
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,596
You can hold your pee, yawn, tears
all you want,

225
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,665
but what kind of a guy holds back
from kissing a girl?

226
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:07,833
Especially when

227
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,170
my heart is burning

228
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,672
like a fire.

229
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,915
I'll get some more firewood.

230
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:27,186
Gosh.

231
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,689
Mr. Gi!

232
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,791
Stop right there!

233
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,709
Were you covered in filth or something?

234
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,512
You were in the shower
for more than two hours.

235
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,683
I am

236
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,154
-filth myself.
-What?

237
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,393
Thank you, Mom,

238
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,196
for accepting a jerk like me as your son.

239
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,833
For feeding me and raising me.

240
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,569
But it wasn't all in vain.

241
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,305
Now I'm being rewarded

242
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,708
with your marriage.

243
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,579
Have you received the exclusive contract
with Cinepark?

244
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,748
Not yet.

245
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,983
Not yet?

246
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,788
Come to think of it,
I haven't heard from Ms. Park in days.

247
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,559
Is everything all right
between you and Veronica?

248
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,595
-The thing is...
-Listen.

249
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,532
Veronica is a girl after all.

250
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,401
If you hurt her feelings, do something.

251
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,472
Meet her and try to make it up to her.

252
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,793
I'll meet Veronica
and ask her how she really feels.

253
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,297
If she wants to start seeing me again,

254
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,065
what's the problem?

255
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,170
But if she doesn't want to...

256
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,508
All right. In that case,

257
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,312
I'll think about it again.

258
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,997
Why did Mom have to say that?

259
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,371
Maybe it's good that he's keeping
his distance.

260
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,508
If he really loved me,

261
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,146
I'd feel too bad for lying to him.

262
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,251
Yes, it's a good thing.

263
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:28,934
Hello.

264
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,037
When I asked you to pretend to be me,

265
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,174
I hadn't really planned on this.

266
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,977
But regardless,

267
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,748
the two friends, Gi Dae-ju and Do Min-ik,

268
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,884
started competing for me.

269
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,419
It's such an interesting love triangle.

270
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,521
Is the man you're seeing

271
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,590
Mr. Gi?

272
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,793
Why did he tell me nothing was going on?

273
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,962
-What?
-Nothing.

274
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,131
Ms. Park.

275
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,035
Please don't tell anyone
about Mr. Do's condition.

276
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,503
Not even Mr. Gi.

277
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,973
If you pretend to be me for a month

278
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,709
as you promised, I'll...

279
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,884
Where's the office?

280
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,852
May I ask what this is about?

281
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,956
What is your boss doing here?

282
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,290
Pardon?

283
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,394
I'd like to see Ms. Park.

284
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,929
He's here to see me.

285
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,632
What do we do now?

286
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,835
What else?

287
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,075
Come here right now.

288
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,761
Hello, Ms. Park.

289
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:08,700
What are you doing?

290
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,236
Ms. Park.

291
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,907
I'm sorry I showed up unannounced.

292
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,386
I'm Veronica Park.

293
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,226
Have you been waiting long?

294
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,532
No. Your secretary

295
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:44,603
gave me a cup of coffee and everything.

296
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,071
I wasn't bored at all.

297
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,374
That's me. I'm Secretary Park.

298
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,376
Secretary Park.

299
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
All right. Thank you.

300
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,617
You're so kind, Ms. Park.

301
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,696
Go now.

302
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,199
Well, Secretary Park.

303
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,869
Can you excuse us for a moment?

304
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,171
Are you talking to me?

305
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,241
Imagine I'm not here.

306
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,143
You can talk about anything you want.

307
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,862
She's a bit peculiar.

308
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,564
Please don't mind her.

309
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,934
May I ask what made you
come over so suddenly?

310
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,705
Well...

311
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,109
This may come across as rude,

312
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:01,046
but my family wishes
to push ahead with our marriage.

313
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,316
So I'd like to settle things with you.

314
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,884
The man

315
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,254
you told me about before...

316
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,555
Are you still seeing him?

317
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,723
They broke up.

318
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,793
-Pardon?
-Ms. Park, you told me about this.

319
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,697
You met Mr. Do once out of curiosity
and once by mistake.

320
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,900
In the end, you started having feelings

321
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,135
for Mr. Do.

322
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:27,038
And now you're interested in him as a man.

323
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,542
Secretary Park.

324
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:34,579
She's been waiting for you to call,

325
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,149
checking her phone
all the time. Oh, right.

326
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,120
She wants you to take you to a concert.

327
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,656
She even bought tickets herself.

328
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,566
Ms. Park, look at his face.

329
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,002
He must be exhilarated.

330
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:01,339
His face is turning pale.

331
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,485
Secretary Park!

332
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,157
I think we should talk somewhere else.

333
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,893
All right.

334
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,445
I realized something today.

335
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,116
I should be nicer to my secretary.

336
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,853
Your secretary seemed

337
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,756
very unique.

338
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,025
By the way,

339
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,995
even though I told you
I was seeing another guy,

340
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,631
you came to see me.

341
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,867
Does that mean

342
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,136
you're still not over

343
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,306
me, Veronica Park?

344
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,543
Aren't you interested

345
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,779
in any other girl?

346
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,949
What are you talking about?
Why would I be?

347
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,188
I see.

348
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:28,994
You're not interested in any other girl.

349
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,663
Then again,

350
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,335
how could you be interested
in any other girl than me?

351
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,439
I'd fall in love with myself too.

352
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,742
What about you?

353
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,648
Is everything your secretary said true?

354
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:54,753
Are you interested in me as a man now?

355
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,591
Is it true?

356
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,192
Yes, I like you.

357
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,335
I like you so much that I forget

358
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,771
what I'm doing.

359
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:27,018
So are we officially dating now?

360
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,687
Pardon?

361
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,023
That's right.

362
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,628
By the way...

363
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,335
Right! The meeting.

364
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,138
Gosh, I'm late.

365
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,842
I'm sorry. I forgot about a meeting.

366
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,977
Pardon?

367
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,313
But you don't have any meetings today.

368
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,083
I think I have to go now.

369
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,151
Wait.

370
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,823
What happens to us now?

371
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,660
Well...

372
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,997
Ta-da.

373
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,433
Why don't we decide
whether or not we want to go out

374
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,535
on the day of the concert?

375
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,237
Why would we do that?

376
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,679
Hello, Ms. Jeong.
I need to come right now?

377
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,681
Okay, I'll be right there.

378
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,283
All right.

379
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,455
See you at 7 p.m. on Wednesday

380
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,425
at the Center for Performing Arts.

381
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,071
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

382
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:01,546
You...

383
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,386
So?

384
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,490
Darn it.

385
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,626
I'll call you back.

386
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,928
Hang up.

387
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,134
Hey.

388
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,971
How many times do I have to tell you
not to eat in the car?

389
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,142
I'm sure it was him.

390
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,679
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

391
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,949
See you at 7 p.m. on Wednesday

392
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,819
at the Center for Performing Arts.

393
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,023
Why did I bring up the concert there?

394
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,094
Whatever.

395
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,062
She likes me.

396
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,099
At the concert,
I'll tell her we should go out.

397
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,448
You're crazy.

398
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,284
You're still thinking about Ms. Jeong.

399
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,425
Is she okay?

400
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,594
I hope she is.

401
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,064
It's been only a day, and why do I miss...

402
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,573
Why don't I see Ms. Jeong

403
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,911
one last time before I make up my mind?

404
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,281
All right.

405
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,518
If you guys float up,
I'll go and see Ms. Jeong.

406
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,821
If you don't, I'll forget about it.

407
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,524
Here we go.

408
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,027
One, two, three.

409
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,634
I'm a generous man.

410
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,469
I'll give you another chance.

411
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,104
Let's start.

412
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,338
One,

413
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,074
two,

414
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,377
three.

415
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,748
I don't care what you think.

416
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,417
I'll go and see her if I want to.

417
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,202
He hesitated, didn't he?

418
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,304
He hesitated because of you.

419
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,072
I said, that's not true.

420
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,775
All he had to say was,
"Yes, we're together now."

421
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,144
But he left after lying about a meeting.

422
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,912
Stop saying that. Go away!

423
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,681
Go away right now!

424
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,983
Gosh.

425
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:57,255
Hey, see? He came to see you.

426
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:01,960
You're right.

427
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,150
I'm the one who told her to take days off.

428
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,587
What am I doing here?

429
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,623
Darn it.

430
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,362
Mr. Do.

431
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,332
Gosh. Ms. Jeong.

432
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,502
It's you, right?

433
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,204
Yes.

434
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,174
Are you here to see me?

435
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,309
What?

436
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,512
I'm not here to see you.

437
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,082
Then what is it?

438
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,652
Well...

439
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,421
You know...

440
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,391
Your laptop.

441
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,294
It seems like it's been fixed,

442
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,562
but you haven't given me the file yet.

443
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,432
So that's what you're here for.

444
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,534
Check your e-mail.

445
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,970
The file was a bit unstable,

446
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,239
so I sent it to you by e-mail

447
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,408
as soon as my laptop was fixed.

448
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,343
Oh, you did?

449
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:27,645
Yes.

450
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,914
Then I'll leave now.

451
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:35,753
Well... How are you?

452
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,057
Are you enjoying your days off?

453
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,692
Yes.

454
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,463
I think I know

455
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,666
why you told me to take days off.

456
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,635
You do?

457
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,136
You're in love

458
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,306
with Ms. Park,

459
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,543
and after what happened
between you and me,

460
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:01,879
you must've felt bad
and wanted to avoid me.

461
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,286
I guess I'm right.

462
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,127
You said

463
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,598
you're not as nice as I think you are.

464
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,534
Same here.

465
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,538
Your secretary is

466
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,608
not as nice as you think she is.

467
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,780
So if you're avoiding me
because of what happened that day,

468
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,550
I'll pretend it didn't happen.

469
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,721
I'll erase it from my memory
if you want me to.

470
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,759
So please stop feeling so bad.

471
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,130
If you're feeling so bad,

472
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,432
I can't make up my mind.

473
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,402
What do you mean?

474
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,504
Dae-ju calls me disgusting.

475
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,739
Dr. Gu calls me crazy.

476
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:03,841
I think

477
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,312
I might be going through

478
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,716
what I should've gone through in my teens.

479
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,319
Please understand.

480
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,324
I'll make up my mind

481
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,428
as soon

482
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,799
as I can.

483
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,345
This way.

484
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:57,228
Is he the man you saw at the funeral?

485
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,170
He's Eun Jeong-su, right?

486
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,840
The fingerprints on the knife matched his.

487
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,310
What did you say?

488
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,546
Eun Jeong-su is my driver.

489
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,948
What?

490
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,517
He's your driver?

491
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,952
What's wrong with you?

492
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,121
You said you clearly remembered
how the culprit looked.

493
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,723
But then you didn't recognize him

494
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,092
when he started working as your driver.

495
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,428
And after seeing him at the funeral,

496
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,730
you made a report to the police.

497
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,832
Was he aware

498
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,202
that I can't see people's faces
from the beginning?

499
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,538
Where is he now anyway?

500
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,507
He called in sick today.

501
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,176
I've contacted his cell phone company,

502
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,878
and he's already canceled his contract.

503
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,045
Really?

504
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,214
Do you have his résumé?

505
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,718
Send it over so we can track him down.

506
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,987
Hold on.

507
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,158
Does that mean Eun Jeong-su

508
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,294
went to Ms. Jeong's house with that knife?

509
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,463
That's right.

510
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,866
And you still haven't sent anyone
to guard her house?

511
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,868
Lower your voice!

512
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,038
Didn't you see her house?

513
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,641
The doors can be kicked open by anyone.

514
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,910
The windows are paper-thin.

515
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,946
Her blind brother is
the only man in the family.

516
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,949
She has no parents nor anyone to help her.

517
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,285
The house has
no security system whatsoever.

518
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,086
Isn't it your job to protect her?

519
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,589
How could you

520
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,725
leave her alone like that?

521
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,762
We don't have enough police officers
for that, understood?

522
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,131
Calm down. Please sit down.

523
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,433
Darn it.

524
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,734
Mr. Do.

525
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,803
Mr. Do, where are you going?

526
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,018
Mr. Do.

527
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,556
Is everything all right?

528
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:07,925
Yes.

529
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,867
Pack up.

530
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,836
Do you want me back at the office?

531
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,071
Not the office.

532
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,873
Move to a new place. Can you do that?

533
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,176
Pack a few important things first.

534
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,778
What's going on here?
Why do you want me to move?

535
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,480
It's Eun Jeong-su.

536
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,717
The punk who stabbed me
near the Han River.

537
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,018
Your driver?

538
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,153
Do you remember the knife
you found in your house?

539
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,722
That belongs to him too.

540
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,426
You were lucky you weren't home that day.

541
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,730
Imagine you were home alone.

542
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,599
I mean... Mr. Eun has been

543
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,602
working for you all this time.

544
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,537
Hurry up and pack your stuff.

545
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,573
Stay at a hotel for the time being.

546
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,441
-I can't.
-Why not?

547
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:01,078
How could I leave my blind brother behind?

548
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,314
Take him with you then.

549
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,283
Like I said before,

550
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,352
my brother has to stay at this house.

551
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,557
Hiding won't change anything.

552
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,494
There must be a reason

553
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,928
why Mr. Eun tried to harm you

554
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,365
and broke into my house.

555
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,135
You and I should find it out.

556
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,170
I'll find it out on my own.

557
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,406
You stay out of this.

558
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:31,642
Also, a security company
will visit tomorrow,

559
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,011
just so you know.

560
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,684
Mr. Do!

561
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,291
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN USE

562
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,065
He really sent them here in the end.

563
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,405
Hi, Myeong-jeong. Has he come?

564
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,641
How is he?

565
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:10,348
The glow has disappeared from his face.

566
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:14,418
He looks like he has no energy.

567
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:17,154
His shoulders are drooping
all the way down to his belly button.

568
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,993
He looks so weighed down
that he even looks shorter.

569
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,866
I'm sorry,

570
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,735
but can you make sure he eats?

571
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,603
Go.

572
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,674
Mr. Do.

573
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,210
Gal-hee asked me to get lunch for you.

574
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,611
Are you craving anything?

575
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:42,947
No.

576
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,283
I see.

577
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,557
It seems like he'd rather starve.

578
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,928
Hey, what does it even mean
not to crave anything?

579
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,363
I thought

580
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,966
everyone always craves something.

581
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,503
Kkanpunggi, jajangmyeon, tangsuyuk,

582
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,905
ox blood soup, beef intestine soup,

583
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,673
fermented skate...

584
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,209
Hello?

585
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,811
From Eun Jeong-su's résumé
to his contract,

586
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,846
I sent over everything that might help.

587
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,848
Please find him as soon as you can.

588
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,485
Okay.

589
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,956
Why did Eun Jeong-su

590
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,027
go to Ms. Jeong's house?

591
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,901
Check your e-mail.

592
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,438
The file was a bit unstable,

593
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,606
so I sent it to you by e-mail

594
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,009
as soon as my laptop was fixed.

595
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,711
The file.

596
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,984
E-MAILS

597
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,622
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

598
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,091
What?

599
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,360
"Incentives for the second half."

600
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:06,530
"A clear stream has no fish in it"?

601
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,469
What's all this?

602
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,439
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU
BUT GOD IS ALWAYS JUST TO EVERYONE

603
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,212
"Aromi"?

604
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,580
AROMI

605
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,849
"May 2004."

606
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,618
"Aromi, 100 million won"?

607
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,621
Who said it's worth 100 million won?

608
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,157
This isn't a platinum arowana.

609
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,425
It's a golden arowana.

610
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,460
What on earth is going on?

611
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,063
If this means

612
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,900
the Aromi I'm thinking of...

613
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,136
GI DAE-JU

614
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,271
"Dae-ju"?

615
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,211
Why is Dae-ju's name on this file?

616
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:01,185
He said he knew nothing about the file.

617
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,240
DIRECTOR GI DAE-JU

618
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,746
All right. If he says he doesn't know,

619
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,948
he doesn't know.

620
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,565
Come in.

621
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,339
Mr. Do.

622
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,309
It's about next week's joint meeting
of the media teams.

623
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:01,612
You're Ms. Lee, right?

624
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,815
Yes. Gal-hee is on vacation,

625
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,017
so I came over to ask you
about your schedule next week.

626
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,286
Just a second, please.

627
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,191
Well...

628
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,460
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

629
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:19,496
Tuesday would be the best for me.

630
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,667
Okay. I'll update you on this.

631
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,536
Ms. Lee.

632
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,137
Yes?

633
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,841
What's Dae-ju's schedule today?

634
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:35,179
He has a meeting with the PR Team soon.

635
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,549
CONCERT TICKET

636
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,351
The concert is today.

637
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,657
I didn't realize it's Wednesday already.

638
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,627
You'd better hurry up and get ready.

639
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,162
You don't want to get stuck
in the rush-hour traffic.

640
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,864
Your secretary is away too.

641
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:56,500
I will.

642
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:15,452
Do you remember? I promised you

643
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,688
I'd protect Dae-ju

644
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,690
by all means.

645
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,229
I didn't expect it to be so hard

646
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,264
to keep that simple promise.

647
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,112
Hello, Ms. Lee.

648
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,283
Can you come to the drivers' waiting room

649
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,719
a bit later?

650
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,354
I'd like to

651
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,725
introduce you to a group.

652
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,130
I'm sorry but I'm meeting someone later.

653
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,566
It's okay to come late at night.

654
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,868
There will be some familiar faces,

655
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,737
and I'm sure you'll like it.

656
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,177
Okay. See you later.

657
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,727
THE CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS

658
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,541
All right.

659
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,445
When Ms. Park comes,

660
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,883
I'll suggest

661
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,519
we go out.

662
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,469
I hope Ms. Jeong is doing okay.

663
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,205
Is the security system working well?

664
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,249
This is the first time
someone has given me flowers.

665
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,255
Those flowers must have withered by now.

666
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,243
Why are you not going in?

667
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:57,548
Why are you here again?
I didn't even call you.

668
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,117
What?

669
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,620
Are you scared
he'll want to go out with you?

670
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,324
What are you talking about?

671
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,128
If he wants to go out with me,

672
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,531
I'll smile and answer,

673
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,734
"Okay, Mr. Do.
I want to go out with you too."

674
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,674
I lied to Mr. Do,
and I'm paying for it now.

675
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,411
I'll do as Ms. Park says.

676
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,315
I can do it.

677
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,050
What if he

678
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,385
doesn't want to go out with you?

679
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,093
Don't say that.

680
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,698
I'm not hoping for that to happen anymore.

681
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,200
I'll be going now.

682
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,136
I hate to keep my boss waiting.

683
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,356
Don't get your hopes up.

684
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:15,759
Don't get your hopes up.

685
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,863
Don't you dare get your hopes up.

686
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:37,240
There is a man who is extremely important
in Veronica Park's life.

687
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,209
And he will be

688
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,645
at today's preview.

689
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,815
So I want you to make me look

690
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:48,051
even more attractive than yesterday.

691
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,989
I absolutely need to catch his eye

692
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:55,625
and get a kiss from him, okay?

693
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,994
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

694
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:10,574
Look who's here.

695
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,076
Hello, Ms. Park.

696
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,611
I can't do this.

697
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:39,736
Isn't the concert today?

698
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:43,340
I hate her so much.

699
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:47,444
Mr. Do was waiting for Veronica Park

700
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,780
with a bouquet of flowers in his hand.

701
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:53,717
And I hated him for that.

702
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,788
I also hated Veronica Park
for taking him away from me.

703
00:50:58,522 --> 00:50:59,790
Do you realize

704
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:05,595
that you're backbiting yourself?

705
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:11,001
After all, aren't you the woman

706
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,637
who took Mr. Do away from you?

707
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:21,645
I don't understand anything anymore.

708
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,086
Who am I?

709
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:33,190
Who is the woman I hate so much?

710
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,694
Do you see now

711
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,599
why I called it a severe punishment?

712
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:48,605
Yes.

713
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,209
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

714
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,245
I have to end this today.

715
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,250
I'll either tell Mr. Do the truth
and lose him

716
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,488
or end my life.

717
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,358
Anyway, it has to end today.

718
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,893
I can't go on like this.

719
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:12,129
So please...

720
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,167
So please let me tell him the truth.

721
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,473
Okay.

722
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:30,547
I think you've been punished enough.

723
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:32,516
But you know what?

724
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,520
There's a problem.

725
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:43,360
Once you hear this,

726
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:45,662
you'll beg me

727
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,432
to let you continue.

728
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:56,840
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

729
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,875
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.

730
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:09,085
What is it?

731
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,721
Let's go.

732
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:16,593
Whichever you choose, you have to
go back to the concert hall anyway.

733
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:28,071
This is an announcement
about the 7 p.m. concert.

734
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,640
The concert will start shortly.

735
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:35,178
As the entrance will be closed
once the concert starts...

736
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,047
Is she running late?

737
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,326
Can we go faster?

738
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,064
What were you going to tell me?

739
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,300
BOSS

740
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,236
Take it.

741
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,438
Tell me first.

742
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,540
Take the call first.

743
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:21,858
What's that noise?

744
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,228
Hello? Ms. Park?

745
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,231
Ms. Park?

746
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:34,004
NEW MEMBER

747
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,240
The new member must be Gal-hee, right?

748
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:41,444
If Gal-hee joins the group,
should we change our slogan?

749
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,848
But I like our slogan now.

750
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,082
Me too.

751
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,751
It is made up of letters from our names

752
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:51,621
mixed together with the famous quote
by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

753
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,224
It means "justice prevails in the end".

754
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,827
I think we're ready.

755
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,031
As always, let's shout our slogan
before we begin.

756
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,966
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

757
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,234
-Man!
-May!

758
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,435
-Be!
-Unjust!

759
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,803
-To!
-You!

760
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,971
-But!
-God!

761
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,072
-Is!
-Always!

762
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,206
-Just!
-To!

763
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:11,341
Everyone!

764
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,781
EULDOGUK

765
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,752
Thank you.

766
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,329
BOSS

767
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,731
Hello.

768
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,800
Is this Ms. Park's number?

769
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,103
She has yet another phone?

770
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:42,672
Yes, it is.

771
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,809
I was just talking to her on the phone

772
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,911
and heard a strange noise.

773
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,713
Well, the thing is,

774
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,282
Ms. Park had a car accident.

775
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,250
Pardon?

776
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,119
What happened?

777
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,188
Is she hurt a lot?

778
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,056
She was already running late,

779
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:02,826
and her previous secretary
suddenly showed up.

780
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,661
So they took the same car.

781
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:06,863
Is her previous secretary's name

782
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,335
Jeong Gal-hee by any chance?

783
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,437
Yes, that's right.

784
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,192
Where are they right now?

785
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:42,132
They're both in Sangmo Hospital.

786
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,901
Ms. Park hurt her neck and
was sent to the neurosurgery ward,

787
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:48,138
and Ms. Jeong hurt her arm and
was sent to the orthopedics ward.

788
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,676
I'll erase it from my memory

789
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,379
if you want me to.

790
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,682
So please stop feeling so bad.

791
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,320
Yes, I like you.

792
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,590
I like you so much that I forget

793
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,859
what I'm doing.

794
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,666
I was torn between

795
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,835
neurosurgery and orthopedics.

796
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,639
Stop thinking about
where your love is headed.

797
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:26,743
Think about where your feelings
originally came from.

798
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,108
-The patient...
-I think

799
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,643
she went up to the rooftop.

800
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,712
Thank you.

801
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,121
Mr. Do.

802
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,828
How did you know I was here?

803
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,079
As I came running here, I realized

804
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:46,816
why I started to have feelings for her
in the first place.

805
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,452
It was because she reminded me of you.

806
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,955
Mr. Do said he likes me.

807
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,190
I guess this is my last time
to look like this.

808
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:56,459
-These are peanuts.
-Right. Don't you like peanuts?

809
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,694
Who are you?

810
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,928
Mr. Do Min-ik!

811
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,563
Why did you do this to me?

812
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,998
Why did you do it?

813
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,267
