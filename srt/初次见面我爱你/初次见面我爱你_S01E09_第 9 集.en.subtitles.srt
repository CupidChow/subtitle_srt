1
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,875
It's 70,000 won for a full body massage,
and 50,000 for a foot massage.

2
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,044
I'm Korean.

3
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,868
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,048
Freeze.

5
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,758
Lately, I've been noticing things
dropped on the floor.

6
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:33,726
I knew something was fishy.

7
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,635
A knife?

8
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,738
As a gentleman,
I was hoping not to use a weapon.

9
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,810
You know what?

10
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,745
"Blind" can also mean "reckless."

11
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,481
And I'm both.

12
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,428
How did you know this laptop is
the only thing of any value in this house?

13
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,836
No! You can't take this!

14
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,139
I'm not giving this to you!

15
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,779
Am I bleeding?

16
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,983
Sir, why don't you take my eyes
instead of the laptop?

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,584
I can't even see.

18
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,154
I'll never be able to buy
a laptop for Gal-hee.

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,090
I should at least protect
the one she already has.

20
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,860
High five.

21
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,695
How can I help you?

22
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,431
I'm bleeding.

23
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,167
No!

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,903
I want you to make a phone call.
Call Jeong Gal...

25
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,640
I can't find Jeong Gal-uk
in your contact list.

26
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,475
Not Jeong Gal-uk! I mean Jeong Gal...

27
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,945
Oh, dear. There must be something wrong
with my hearing.

28
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,781
-Can you say it more clearly?
-Jeong Gal...

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,949
Forget it.

30
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,551
Call the police.

31
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,818
One moment, please.

32
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,520
Be quiet.

33
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,522
Police. Hello?

34
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,493
Hello? Please go ahead.

35
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,062
Hello? Are you all right?

36
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,566
Your location has been tracked.
We'll be on our way.

37
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,936
Hey!

38
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,494
I must've been out of my mind.

39
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,129
What was I thinking?

40
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,601
I'll tell him everything
when I go to work tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,603
So please give me just one day.

42
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,573
How will I even begin

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,041
to explain?

44
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:09,315
-Even police cars came.
-It was so noisy.

45
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,486
-I was so scared.
-I know, right?

46
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,121
What's going on?

47
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,391
Detective.

48
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,428
What is this?

49
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,631
There was cash lying around,

50
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,566
but he didn't take it?

51
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,335
He didn't even go into the rooms.

52
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,537
So the only thing he was after

53
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,107
was the laptop?

54
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,381
You're the lady from T&T Mobile.

55
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,883
Do you live here?

56
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,419
Yes. What happened?

57
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,655
Your house has been broken into.

58
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,123
What?

59
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,092
My brother. Where is he?

60
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,495
He's been transferred to the hospital
in an ambulance.

61
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,398
He got hurt while trying to protect
his sister's laptop.

62
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,733
Jung-hee!

63
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,836
Hey. Do you want some juice?

64
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,039
-There you go.
-Can I have some bread too?

65
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,240
Sure.

66
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,544
SANGMO HOSPITAL

67
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,549
You idiot.

68
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,852
You hurt yourself
while protecting that darn laptop?

69
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,487
Do you hear that?

70
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,823
She's such a humanist.
She puts people first.

71
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,392
Anyway, I saved your laptop.

72
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,369
Do you have any idea
how much a VIP room costs?

73
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,571
The laptop won't even turn on.

74
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,473
You're just wasting money!

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,841
Screw capitalism.

76
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,645
Isn't there any six-bed room?

77
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,881
I'm sorry. This was
the only room available.

78
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,419
Is he hurt a lot?

79
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,722
He said he'd bled a lot,

80
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,124
but it turned out to be grape juice.

81
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,126
That baffled me.

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,930
His little toe got a hairline fracture
and had to be splinted.

83
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,099
The doctor says
he doesn't need to wear a cast

84
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,035
-and can go home tomorrow.
-Okay.

85
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,042
That painting looks crooked.

86
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,878
Is it really crooked?

87
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,913
Guys, gather around.

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,618
That day, Gal-hee said,

89
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,354
-Min-ik.
-"Min-ik."

90
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,522
Didn't she?

91
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,657
-You heard it too?
-Yes.

92
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,793
I thought I misheard it.

93
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,828
If you think about it,
it's really strange.

94
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,931
She's never worn clothes
like that to work.

95
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,733
She wore that red cardigan

96
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,668
covered with lint even to the club.

97
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,073
Gal-hee is here.

98
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,479
Gal-hee, good morning.

99
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,015
Myeong-jeong, hi.

100
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,917
Have you fed the fish yet?

101
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,385
Yes, I have.

102
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,189
Are you sorting through scrap paper?

103
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,258
-Yes.
-Hey, Gal-hee.

104
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,459
What?

105
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,431
If you, one day, wear
red lipstick to work,

106
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,965
why would that be?

107
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,801
That's never going to happen.

108
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,169
Then...

109
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,840
what if you wear contacts to work?

110
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,710
That's not going to happen either.

111
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,448
What if you call your boss
by his first name?

112
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,419
That's impossible.

113
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,125
You guys

114
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,894
didn't see anything weird

115
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,430
at work yesterday, did you?

116
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,732
-No, we didn't.
-No, we didn't.

117
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,767
Hey.

118
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,403
-We weren't even here.
-That's absurd.

119
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,771
Am I wrong?

120
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,178
Hello, Mr. Do. I'm coming!

121
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,002
How will I face him?

122
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,037
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

123
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,441
All right. Calm down
and pretend nothing happened.

124
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,143
Just be your usual self.

125
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,659
Good morning, Mr. Do.

126
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,194
You're late.

127
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,497
I'm sorry. Something came up at home.

128
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,942
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

129
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,946
Here are blueberry yogurt
and a flat white.

130
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,549
I also brought some sushi

131
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,184
from the Kingdom Hotel.
You can have it for lunch.

132
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,680
Do you hate seeing my face so much?

133
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,617
Do you have to look away so fast?

134
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:48,154
I might be coming down with a cold,
that's all.

135
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,791
Gravels are over there.

136
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,561
Thank you.

137
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,738
Is everything okay?

138
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:06,872
Why do you ask?

139
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,141
Are you hoping it isn't?

140
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,210
No way.

141
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,113
If there's nothing wrong,
then that's good.

142
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,348
There is something wrong.

143
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,151
I broke up

144
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,622
with Veronica Park.

145
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,895
-What about you?
-Pardon?

146
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,930
I'm asking about that punk

147
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,466
who slept the whole time at the sauna.

148
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,838
We broke up too.

149
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,774
Like you said,
he wasn't good enough for me.

150
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,843
That's good.

151
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,684
-By the way, Mr. Do...
-What?

152
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,656
If you are heartbroken

153
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,527
and ever need company,

154
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,996
you can always let me know.

155
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,833
Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing,

156
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,337
I'll come to you.

157
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,009
Why are you being so nice to me?
It doesn't feel right.

158
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,781
Once I tell Mr. Gi everything,

159
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,583
I might not be able to see you again.

160
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,056
I don't need company.

161
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,891
You can leave now.

162
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,493
Okay.

163
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,030
I'll be right back after dropping off
my laptop at the service center.

164
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,879
Why did you want to see me?

165
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,482
I got you wrong.

166
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,984
-Isn't that Mr. Gi?
-Veronica Park's 100,000 votes.

167
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,188
I thought you she was swayed by you,
but it was someone else's work.

168
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,725
Look at this.

169
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,526
You know what this is, right?

170
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,928
DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY

171
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,663
"Department of Neurosurgery"?

172
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,533
Is Min-ik ill?

173
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,741
Goodness, I almost fell for it.

174
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:26,445
You're an amazing actor.
You should star in a film or something.

175
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,514
You and Min-ik know everything
about each other.

176
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,682
Stop pretending.

177
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,989
Well, I don't care whether
you're pretending or not.

178
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,527
Just find out what Min-ik's condition is.

179
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,064
If I manage to bring
that cuckoo down with that,

180
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,833
I'll merge the media teams
and let you take charge.

181
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,211
Gosh.

182
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,312
DIRECTOR GI DAE-JU

183
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,621
Hello, Mr. Gi.

184
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,537
Mr. Do said I shouldn't tell anyone
about his condition.

185
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,440
Just find out what Min-ik's condition is.

186
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,645
If I tell Mr. Gi,
it will put Mr. Do in danger.

187
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,079
Ms. Jeong.

188
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,115
Yes?

189
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,821
The reason why Min-ik
didn't recognize me that day...

190
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,489
Is it because he's ill in some way?

191
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,623
No.

192
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,860
It's because he was drunk.

193
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,228
He was drunk?

194
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,831
But Min-ik never drinks
more than a glass of champagne.

195
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:52,998
You're right.

196
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,702
But the thing is...

197
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,973
What can I say to convince him?

198
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,708
What do I say?

199
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,880
-I have feelings for Mr. Do.
-Pardon?

200
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,548
That day,

201
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,886
I was going to tell Mr. Do how I feel.

202
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,089
You saw how I dressed up and everything.

203
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,393
But when I met him,

204
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,796
I couldn't say anything.

205
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,599
Is that why you drank?

206
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,968
Yes. We both drank a lot.

207
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,872
We finished two bottles of soju together.

208
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,907
In the end, he got drunk.

209
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,510
He doesn't remember a thing
about that day.

210
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,112
He remembers neither what I told him

211
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,717
nor going to the movies to sober up.

212
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,757
Could you please keep this a secret?

213
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,895
It turned out that he's in love
with someone else.

214
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,432
So I was relieved when I found out

215
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,203
he doesn't remember anything
about that day.

216
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,171
If he remembers
that I told him about my feelings,

217
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,209
he'll feel uncomfortable working with me.

218
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,146
But I want to continue working for him.

219
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,753
Do you like him that much?

220
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,556
I want to protect him.

221
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,859
Even if I can't be his woman,

222
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,795
I want to protect him as his secretary.

223
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,264
Ms. Jeong.

224
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:33,999
Yes, Mr. Gi.

225
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,303
If Min-ik becomes ill

226
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,837
or something happens to him,

227
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,941
you have to tell me.

228
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,510
You and I are the only people
in this company

229
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,112
who can help him.

230
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,382
Okay.

231
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,888
By the way,

232
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,425
can I ask you something?

233
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,529
How do you know

234
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,898
Ms. Park of Cinepark?

235
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,504
We met through work.

236
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,841
Mr. Sim introduced her to me

237
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,710
regarding screening rights for Cinepark.

238
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,112
Is that all?

239
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:21,880
Yes.

240
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,556
I hope I did the right thing.

241
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,028
But if they met through work,

242
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,963
why did they go to the movies together
at night?

243
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,034
What on earth is going on?

244
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,004
Mr. Do, where are you going?

245
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,539
Cancel all my plans for today.

246
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,541
All of them? Why?

247
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,810
Cancel them.

248
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,912
You can go home.

249
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,157
But he won't be able
to recognize people without me.

250
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,629
Should I follow him?

251
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,635
Wait.

252
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,637
That's where...

253
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,646
It's so delicious.

254
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,698
It doesn't taste good at all.

255
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,641
What is he doing?

256
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,743
He was only pretending to be okay.

257
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,891
It's been hours.

258
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,494
He hasn't eaten anything all day.

259
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,596
What if he collapses or something?

260
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,503
CHOCO PIE

261
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,630
Who are you?

262
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,146
No. You can have it, ma'am.

263
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,587
I'm okay.

264
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,893
She can't talk?

265
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,634
All right, ma'am.

266
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,471
Thank you very much.

267
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,953
What a weird lady.

268
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,823
Is it okay to eat food from a stranger?

269
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,138
Is she watching me?

270
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,706
Eat it.

271
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,417
He ate it.

272
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,126
What's with her?

273
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,667
Now that I think of it,

274
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,202
I've only had a cup of coffee all day.

275
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,452
Oh, my.

276
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,690
Hello, Mr. Do.

277
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,459
Where are you?

278
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,162
I'm home.

279
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,865
That's great. This morning,

280
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,202
you said I should let you know
when I need company.

281
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,104
Is that still valid?

282
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,872
Of course.

283
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,109
I happen to be in your neighborhood
right now.

284
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,713
Can you cook for me?

285
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,047
Pardon?

286
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,750
I mean...

287
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:35,721
The white rice you made for me
at the hotel.

288
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,857
I'm craving it.

289
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,826
I guess you can't.

290
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,730
I can. It's just...

291
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,467
Well...

292
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,003
Please take your time coming here.

293
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,875
You can take as much time as you want.

294
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,710
Okay.

295
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,844
Shoot.

296
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,513
Why today, of all days?

297
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,683
Is he already here?

298
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,990
Flowers?

299
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,531
This is the first time
someone has given me flowers.

300
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,800
Don't get the wrong idea.

301
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,837
It's good manners to bring a gift
when you visit someone's home.

302
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,606
Also, the flower shop was the only place

303
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,810
open in the neighborhood.

304
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,214
Is the supermarket closed already?

305
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,849
May I go in?

306
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,152
Yes. But...

307
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,189
the place is in a mess right now.

308
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:23,728
It is indeed.

309
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,565
Does it look like this all the time?

310
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,567
Someone broke into my house yesterday.

311
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,869
-What?
-Nothing was stolen.

312
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,938
More precisely,
there was nothing to be stolen.

313
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,674
Still, the kitchen looks okay.

314
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,642
Let's go to the kitchen. Follow me.

315
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,644
Okay.

316
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,079
This way.

317
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,829
It's delicious.

318
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,634
I've bought many other things you like.

319
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,436
Why did you want to have this?

320
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,071
Well, just because

321
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,007
I suddenly remembered the time

322
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,844
when you cooked white rice for me
before the stockholders' meeting.

323
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,451
Try this.

324
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,853
I made it myself.

325
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,833
Have you lived here long?

326
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,635
Well, yes.

327
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,770
My brother is blind.

328
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,574
It's not easy for him to move
to a new house or a new neighborhood.

329
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:46,745
Luckily, our kind landlord has let us
stay here, raising the rent regularly,

330
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,046
for 10 years now.

331
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,083
Is he really kind
if he raises the rent regularly?

332
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,019
He's kinder than most.

333
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,855
Many landlords turn us down
because having a handicapped person

334
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,089
lowers the house price.

335
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,928
You have many people

336
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,797
to look after.

337
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,203
Is there more rice?

338
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,439
Yes, of course.

339
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,976
Does it taste okay?

340
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,080
Did you make this yourself too?

341
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,149
Of course. I made all of these myself.

342
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,818
I'm a pretty good cook.

343
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,655
What are you talking about?

344
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,692
Fine.

345
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,061
Twice?

346
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,431
Deal!

347
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,744
Hi.

348
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,856
I went to your office,
and they told me you were here.

349
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,458
This time,

350
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,094
I found this in my bag.

351
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,897
Oh, my. How did it end up there?

352
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,933
I had no idea.

353
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,439
Is he one of the guys
who have come to your notice?

354
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,609
He's one of the actors
who have come to my notice.

355
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:27,479
Do you usually talk to actors in bed?

356
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,217
You're jealous,

357
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,619
aren't you?

358
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,221
I'm just asking a question.

359
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,760
I can make actors so happy just by
telling them how much they'll get paid.

360
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:46,998
But how can I make this man happy?

361
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,436
Our bathroom set looks amazing.

362
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,505
The office set looks decent too.

363
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,674
Which place do you prefer?

364
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:58,877
Make your choice.

365
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,821
What did I do to have a gun pointed at me?

366
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,057
Hands up.

367
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,626
You're the one who confessed

368
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,695
that you are a jerk.

369
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,863
You're not going out with me anyway,

370
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,099
so why do you care
whether I'm a jerk or not?

371
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:23,902
Of course I do.

372
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,171
Bad guys are so attractive.

373
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,241
But when it comes to being bad,

374
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,746
I'm second to none, actually.

375
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,015
Who knows?

376
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,851
If you're about as bad as I am,

377
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,854
I might consider

378
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,457
going out with you.

379
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:48,960
I've been unfaithful

380
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,930
to my wifey.

381
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,232
I'm quitting my job.

382
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,902
I also shut my eyes to upcoming dangers.

383
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,474
Do you see how bad I am now?

384
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,979
Well, I'd say...

385
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,983
You should be handcuffed too.

386
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,659
You can't get it off? You can't?

387
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:22,560
My gosh.

388
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,696
My goodness. What do we do?

389
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,032
Ms. Kim! Give me the keys!

390
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,183
Was this intentional too?

391
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,086
It was a mistake.

392
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,790
I'll fire everyone on the props team.

393
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,360
Why did they have to make
the handcuffs so elaborate?

394
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,861
This is driving me crazy.

395
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,163
I'm hungry.

396
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,500
I need to pee too.

397
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,701
Ms. Park.

398
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,837
Eat some food.

399
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,040
The props team is on their way,

400
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,775
but there's heavy traffic.

401
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,046
Hello. Where are you right now?

402
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,849
No, not that place.

403
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,586
You said you were hungry.

404
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:28,793
I'm the CEO of Cinepark,

405
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,062
Veronica Park.

406
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,865
I have the whole movie world
under my thumb.

407
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,937
Do you expect me to eat this lousy food
in a holding cell?

408
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:42,874
Then I'll just go ahead.

409
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,008
Here.

410
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,793
It tastes so good.

411
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,197
Give me some of that.

412
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,532
Pickled cucumbers.

413
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,708
Why are you chuckling?

414
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,578
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

415
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,881
But sometimes, you're like a baby.

416
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,016
"A baby"?

417
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,853
You think I'm like a baby?

418
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,021
Yes.

419
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,823
Has the National Institute

420
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,493
of Korean Language changed
the definition of the word "baby"?

421
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,529
A devil, a demon,

422
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,198
a lunatic, and a bitch.

423
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:17,835
Those are the words people call me.

424
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,971
Babies can be devils sometimes.

425
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,706
But when they cry,

426
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,042
it's not because they're evil,

427
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,576
but because they're in pain.

428
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,013
And when they laugh, it's never fake.

429
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,850
I think babies are lovely.

430
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,065
If you want me to, I could come with you.

431
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,134
-What?
-I'll be standing outside the door

432
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,936
while you do your business in the toilet.

433
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,338
Just stretch out your arm,

434
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,506
-and it wouldn't be impossible.
-Hey!

435
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,175
I'm

436
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,179
the CEO of Cinepark, Veronica Park!

437
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,721
Hey.

438
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,157
I want you

439
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,894
to cover your ears at least.

440
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,430
As you know, I can't...

441
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,433
Oh, my. Excuse me.

442
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,069
I can't stretch my arm

443
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,805
and cover my ears at the same time.

444
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:34,045
So this is what it feels like
to be humiliated.

445
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,587
I can't do this.

446
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,925
I, Veronica Park,

447
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,595
will try to hold it in

448
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,765
even if that means
I have to risk wetting myself.

449
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:58,669
Until Mount Baekdu is worn away
And the East Sea

450
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,104
What are you doing?

451
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,875
I'll sing as loud as I can
so I won't hear anything.

452
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:06,811
You can focus on doing your business
in there.

453
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,547
I'll focus on singing the national anthem
out here.

454
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:14,752
Until Mount Baekdu is worn away

455
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,856
And the East Sea runs dry

456
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,961
May our country be protected by God

457
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,698
And prosper

458
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,573
Well...

459
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,142
Will you be

460
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,045
home alone tonight?

461
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,780
Yes, I guess so.

462
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,515
Aren't you scared?

463
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,217
The house has been broken into.

464
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,986
Even scarier things have happened before.

465
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:54,792
Do you want me

466
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,562
to stay with you?

467
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,832
Pardon?

468
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,304
No, it's okay.

469
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:11,642
I'm sure you didn't sleep well last night.
Go home and get some good sleep.

470
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,211
All right.

471
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,847
I guess it's inappropriate
for the boss to sleep over.

472
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:18,850
It will make you uncomfortable.

473
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,055
Thanks for the food.

474
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:25,623
Goodnight.

475
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,599
Is he really leaving?

476
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,438
He could've asked one more time.

477
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,975
Are you sure you don't need me there?

478
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,544
If you come here, I'll kill you.

479
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,113
I've never been treated
this well anywhere.

480
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,884
I mean, now that I'm home alone,

481
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,454
I'm getting a little scared, so...

482
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,423
I'm a girl too,

483
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,292
you know.

484
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,196
I'm hanging up.

485
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,867
Darn it.

486
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,737
Go away!

487
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:14,739
Go away.

488
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:18,776
What?

489
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,248
Mr. Do!

490
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,118
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,458
Why are you still here?

492
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,928
You left two hours ago.

493
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,468
Were you worried I'd be scared?

494
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,071
Is that why you've been guarding
my house here like a dog?

495
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,940
"Like a dog"?

496
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,676
What I mean is...

497
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,411
Yes. I haven't been up here
in a long time.

498
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,413
The air is so clean
and the stars are brighter here,

499
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,249
so I've been walking around a little bit.
The human can go inside now.

500
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,984
You don't have to worry about the dog.

501
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:03,854
Well...

502
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:10,194
Do you mean you'll stay here?

503
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,700
Well...

504
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,237
Do you want to come in?

505
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,582
Are you sure you want to sleep here?

506
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,851
Why don't you sleep in my brother's room?

507
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,820
The dog should stay in the living room

508
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:38,155
guarding the house.

509
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,624
I shouldn't go inside.

510
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,461
Don't worry about me.
You can go in and sleep.

511
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,397
-Mr. Do.
-What?

512
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,866
Can I ask you something?

513
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,703
What is it?

514
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,907
It's about Mr. Gi.

515
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,543
He's your closest friend, right?

516
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:05,216
Why are you hiding your condition
from him?

517
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,084
I'm not hiding anything.

518
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,053
My only secretary thinks I'm too much

519
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,255
and wants to leave me.

520
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,391
My only friend

521
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,960
would be so worried
if he finds out I'm ill.

522
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,063
Dae-ju is just too nice.

523
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,198
When we were little,
he'd carry me to the hospital

524
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,267
on his back in the middle of a test.

525
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,336
I don't want to burden him
with my illness.

526
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,073
It's not that I want to hide it from him.

527
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,282
What?

528
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,020
Nothing.

529
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,591
Until the CEO election,

530
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:51,462
I think no one should find out
about your condition.

531
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,332
I'll accompany you everywhere

532
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,600
so that you won't make a mistake.

533
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,436
Does that mean

534
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,338
you're not going to quit?

535
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,476
Goodnight.

536
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,146
Don't leave.

537
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,018
Ms. Jeong.

538
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,156
What do I do?

539
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,760
Right now...

540
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,364
For hours...

541
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,233
Actually,

542
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,136
all day,

543
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,240
I've been dying to call her.

544
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,478
Are you not over her yet?

545
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,380
I want to call her right now.

546
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,618
I want to tell her I miss her.

547
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,755
I want to meet her.

548
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,392
I want to hold her.
I want to tell her everything.

549
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,928
But I made a promise.

550
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,802
I promised that I'd move on

551
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:09,306
after today.

552
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,480
So please

553
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,951
help me get through the night

554
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,389
without doing anything stupid.

555
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,028
Please hold my hand.

556
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,571
I want you to hold my hand too.

557
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,274
Why?

558
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,512
I'm the same.

559
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,452
All day,

560
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:57,221
I've been wondering if he's eaten

561
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,659
and if he's hurt.

562
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:06,697
I can't stop worrying about him.

563
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,969
I want to be with him.

564
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,339
But we should

565
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,441
move on.

566
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,279
Let's move on.

567
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,621
Hold my hand tight.

568
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,861
Don't even think of calling

569
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,496
that jerk who slept the whole time.

570
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,500
Wait.

571
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,839
Can you put me to sleep too?

572
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,841
Pardon?

573
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:55,312
You put that guy to sleep.

574
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,682
Are you serious?

575
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,417
I want to

576
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:04,355
fall asleep

577
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,626
without thinking about anything.

578
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,129
So please put me to sleep.

579
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,168
Well...

580
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,108
Lie down here then.

581
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,497
There's this song
my mom used to sing for me.

582
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,167
Let's see if I remember it.

583
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,910
Goodnight, my baby

584
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:05,149
My sweet baby

585
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,753
With beautiful roses

586
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,858
Surrounding you

587
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:19,396
Goodnight, my baby

588
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,301
Get a good night's rest

589
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,405
Until morning comes

590
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,287
-Ms. Jeong?
-Mr. Do?

591
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:51,629
It's nine!

592
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,399
Let go of my hand!

593
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,901
My shirt!

594
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,670
-Ms. Jeong.
-I'm sorry,

595
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,138
but can you come to my house?

596
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,706
-What time is it?
-Thank you.

597
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,209
-Where are my pants?
-I have no idea.

598
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,443
-Where are they?
-What do we do?

599
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,811
-Where did they go?
-There they are.

600
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,014
Oh, good. My socks!

601
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,249
-Your socks?
-My socks!

602
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,718
-Shoot!
-They're here!

603
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,092
Ms. Jeong! Can I get a towel?

604
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,827
They're in the drawer.

605
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,538
What?

606
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,711
Why are these here?

607
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,152
Mr. Do, can you come here?

608
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,521
Okay. I'm coming.

609
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,425
Ms. Jeong.

610
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,760
What's wrong?

611
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,000
This.

612
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,254
Can I take you to the office?

613
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,124
No. Please take us
to the Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

614
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,426
The police station?

615
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,996
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

616
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,265
Can we just take it like this?

617
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,174
-Sir.
-Yes?

618
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,846
It seems like this isn't
just a regular knife.

619
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:49,947
What do you mean?

620
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,282
It's a car escape tool.

621
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,051
-A car escape tool?
-Yes. Look here.

622
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,054
This part is used to cut seat belts.

623
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,022
This part is a hammer.

624
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,059
It's used for breaking the windows
in an emergency.

625
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,863
Is this the same knife as the one
you saw on the day of the accident?

626
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,197
Yes, I'm sure.

627
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,569
Not everyone owns a tool like this.

628
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,005
Only drivers or car mechanics would.

629
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,374
Who else would need it?

630
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,911
That reminds me. I've seen one of these
another time.

631
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,849
My new driver had it.

632
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,455
At that time, I thought
it was just a regular knife.

633
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,056
No way.

634
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,260
What? Are you suspecting him?

635
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,297
You said you clearly remembered
how the culprit looked.

636
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:45,169
When the victim clearly saw
the culprit's face,

637
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,938
the culprit starts working
as the victim's driver?

638
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,307
Who has the nerve to do that?

639
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,409
I'd have him work for me.

640
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,879
We'll see once the fingerprints
are identified.

641
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:57,047
-Here.
-Okay.

642
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,253
Was there any important document
on the laptop he was trying to take?

643
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:06,523
Any personal information of your clients
or company secrets?

644
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,459
I'm not even allowed to have information
like that.

645
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,430
All I have is Mr. Do's schedule
and some data he needs.

646
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,834
Right. There was a strange file though.

647
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,535
-What do you mean?
-Well...

648
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,939
The flash drive

649
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:25,342
you took from Mr. Gi's office
on the day of the accident--

650
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,010
Mr. Gi? Did you say Mr. Gi?

651
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:31,815
That guy always made excuses,
but he won't be able get out

652
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,884
-of this one.
-I told you he's suspicious.

653
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,219
What about him?

654
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,754
His alibi for the day of the accident
didn't add up,

655
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,123
so we had to interrogate him again.

656
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,260
What kind of file was it?

657
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,996
I have a copy of it. I'll bring it to you.

658
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,236
It's not here.

659
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,472
-No?
-Gosh, that's strange.

660
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:58,208
I was sure I'd put it here.

661
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,014
Didn't you say there was
a strange phrase in it?

662
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,517
"Man may be unjust to you,
but God is always just to everyone."

663
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,255
Man...

664
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,124
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

665
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:17,995
"MAN IS UNJUST, BUT GOD IS JUST"

666
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,365
"Man is unjust, but God is just."

667
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,834
"This quote from Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow

668
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,802
means that justice always prevails.

669
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:28,105
We should all remember

670
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,440
that anyone who commits wrongdoing
will eventually

671
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,242
be brought to justice."

672
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,144
What could this mean?

673
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:37,948
I should've had my laptop fixed
right away.

674
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,983
JUSTICE ALWAYS PREVAILS

675
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,521
A file? What file?

676
00:48:45,022 --> 00:48:49,192
"Man may be unjust to you
but God is always just to everyone."

677
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,363
What do you mean, God is always fair?
That's not true.

678
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,468
He gave me both good looks and competence.

679
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,242
Why are you staring at me like that?

680
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,478
I haven't even seen that file.
I can't be the one who made it.

681
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,584
Then why was that flash drive
in your office?

682
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:15,953
I have no idea.

683
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,388
Is that file important?

684
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,033
I can't see his face,
but I have to trust him.

685
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,503
If I can't trust Dae-ju,

686
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,940
I can't trust anyone in the world.

687
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,380
Stop drinking.

688
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,384
Unless you want to get drunk
and make stupid mistakes.

689
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,722
I never do that.

690
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,458
By the way,

691
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,827
do you still like

692
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,197
the girl you talked about the other day?

693
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,735
I can't seem to

694
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,639
get over her.

695
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,144
That's too bad.

696
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,947
I should set Ms. Jeong up with someone.

697
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,282
-No.
-Why not?

698
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,984
I don't like it.

699
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,387
If you can date someone, why can't she?

700
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,327
There's this guy she can't get over.

701
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,063
She can't even sleep at night.

702
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,867
Who could he be?

703
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,202
Why don't you use your head?

704
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,072
There's this guy. He's a total jerk.

705
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,009
By the way,

706
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,213
have you decided

707
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,216
not to quit the company?

708
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,388
I'm preparing a little gift for you,

709
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,859
and I'll leave as soon as it's ready.

710
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,095
So just get ready to cry your eyes out,
wifey.

711
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,007
Mr. Park?

712
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,446
My only suit is at the dry cleaner's.

713
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,917
Go ahead. I'll pick up my suit
and catch up with you.

714
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,454
How does my face

715
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,158
look to you?

716
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,536
My mother used to tell me
that honesty is the best policy.

717
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,372
Okay. Be honest.

718
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,213
Your eyes are filled with ambition.

719
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,116
Your cheeks are full of greed.

720
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,518
Your lips are covered with selfishness.

721
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,587
You have a face that deserves a slap...

722
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,557
I'm sorry.

723
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,127
I couldn't help but water it down a bit

724
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,329
to get on your good side.

725
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,566
I agree with what you said.

726
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,769
But the thing is,

727
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:24,007
a guy tells me

728
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,909
I'm like a baby.

729
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,547
Do you think

730
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,316
I can trust him?

731
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,452
You should rather trust
a stranger on the street.

732
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,155
Is this what you asked me
to come here for?

733
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,191
The baby is happy.

734
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,260
Is it phone number one?

735
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,296
It's phone number ten.

736
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,403
"Mr. Park Hyeon-cheol's mother
passed away"?

737
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,138
Wait.

738
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,041
If it's Mr. Park's mother's funeral,

739
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,111
everyone from that company will be there,

740
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,615
including my baby.

741
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,886
I'm going to the department store.

742
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,354
Why are you going there?

743
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,357
To find

744
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,395
the sexiest mourning dress in the world.

745
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,267
What? Are you suspecting him?

746
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,446
Mr. Do, what about your clothes?

747
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,616
Ms. Jeong will bring them.

748
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,453
-Here's 100,000 won.
-200,000 won.

749
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,621
It's 300,000 won.

750
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,124
Thank you as always.

751
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,126
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

752
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,230
That's a lot.

753
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,832
They were lying when they said
the company was struggling.

754
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,167
Exactly.

755
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:00,370
Look how much condolence money
we managed to pocket from the executives.

756
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:04,207
By the way, why hasn't there been
any announcement lately?

757
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,209
We haven't had any meetings in a while.

758
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,314
I've been busy with something.

759
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:15,085
But there will be another announcement
soon. Please be patient.

760
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,121
-Shall we go now?
-By the way,

761
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,790
Gal-hee will be there too.

762
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,492
Aren't you going to tell her?

763
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:23,827
That's right.

764
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,864
It's time for her to know what we do.

765
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,840
Chairwoman Sim, I'm over here.

766
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,144
Are you not here yet? Where are you?

767
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,281
Are you here? I just arrived.

768
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:59,262
Calm down.

769
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,232
Ms. Jeong will be here soon.

770
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,569
Mr. Do!

771
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,042
It's me, Ms. Jeong.

772
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,045
You should change first.

773
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,492
Is there something wrong?

774
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,228
It seems stuck.

775
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,966
Why is it you again?

776
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,071
-Pardon?
-What's with my blood pressure?

777
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,386
I can see them.

778
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,356
Now that Ms. Jeong is with me,

779
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:36,359
I can see faces again.

780
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,531
Mr. Do, is your blood pressure up again?

781
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,137
Dr. Gu said my blood pressure
would rapidly go up

782
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,173
when I'm nervous or excited.

783
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,309
That's why vigorous exercise, alcohol,

784
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,378
and...

785
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,681
And? What is it?

786
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,652
The patient Dr. Park treated could clearly
see the face of the woman he loved too.

787
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:04,654
And...

788
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,624
This is crazy.

789
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,326
It never happened when I was with her
no matter how hard I tried.

790
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,163
Why does my blood pressure go up
only when I'm with you?

791
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,567
Someone's entering.

792
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:19,602
It's Mr. Sim.

793
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:32,315
What's wrong?

794
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:39,422
My poor uncle.

795
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,991
I see dark circles under your eyes.

796
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,294
Your skin looks so rough too.

797
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:47,997
Are those pimples around your nose?

798
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:51,000
Do you have constipation?

799
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,937
You're scary.

800
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,387
-Hi, Ha-ni.
-Jeong-su.

801
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,990
You should hide.

802
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,391
What?

803
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,402
We're here.

804
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,091
Ms. Jeong, stay here.

805
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,093
Mr. Do, where are you going?

806
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,648
Oh, my.

807
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:15,618
You're Mr. Do Min-ik, right?

808
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:17,620
Who are you?

809
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,624
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

810
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,616
But it was definitely him.

811
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,017
I'd better disappear from the company.

812
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,153
-You...
-I just ran into a woman.

813
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,956
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

814
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,824
Can't your boss recognize people's faces?

815
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,760
Do you mean the woman
you like is Veronica Park?

816
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,495
It's you I want to be with.

817
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:03,099
From now on,
you're the real Veronica Park.

818
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,335
