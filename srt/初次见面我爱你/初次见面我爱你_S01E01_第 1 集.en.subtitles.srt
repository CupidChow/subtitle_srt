1
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,603
AWARD FOR FRUGALITY

2
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,210
When she was little,
her family motto was...

3
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,715
"Patience is a virtue."

4
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,118
Awesome!

5
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,353
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

6
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,589
She thought it was brilliant.

7
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,594
Only she didn't know...

8
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,268
too much patience

9
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,736
killed her mom.

10
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,172
Gal-hee.

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,140
Our

12
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,276
family motto...

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,677
Yes, I'll keep it.

14
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,181
Get rid of it.

15
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,183
What?

16
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,018
Now that I'm dying,

17
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:27,187
I realized something.

18
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:31,091
Patience is...

19
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,926
-Okay.
-Patience is...

20
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,094
What about it?

21
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,601
-In the end, the 19-year-old Jeong Gal-hee
-Mom.

22
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,370
-never got to hear her mom's last words.
-Mom.

23
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,874
You can't leave like this.

24
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,010
Patience is what?

25
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,949
What on earth were you going to say
about patience?

26
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,889
10 YEARS LATER

27
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,390
They're so pretty.

28
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,228
But...

29
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,268
I'm afraid these are a bit too simple
to buy with this card.

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,172
Can you show me some other rings?
Just one more time.

31
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,440
Sure.

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:29,048
It should have started by now, right?

33
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,086
T&T ORIGINAL CONTENT WE LOVE KIDS

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,490
Where's this punk hiding?

35
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:57,143
He might be competent and all,
but we can't let that baby

36
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,045
take charge.

37
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,113
DIRECTOR KIM O-CHAN

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,247
Don't you think, Mr. Sim?

39
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:06,085
Dilated eyes, flared nostrils...

40
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,456
He might be saying that,
but he's in favor of me.

41
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,893
Goodness, please stop telling me
to stay in my CEO position.

42
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,328
The two things I hate the most

43
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,230
happen to be group fights
and family squabbles.

44
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,831
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

45
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,401
Oh, here comes Min-ik.

46
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,242
"The CEO position is mine
in the next term too."

47
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,878
That's what he's thinking.

48
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,880
As always,

49
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,216
Uncle Hae-yong can't hide
what's on his mind.

50
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,023
Mr. Do.

51
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,127
The number of new subscribers
last year increased by eight percent.

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,731
When you were launching IPTV,

53
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,100
I didn't expect it'd increase

54
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,102
mobile subscribers at all.

55
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,837
If I'm that competent,

56
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,474
why are you voting for my uncle?

57
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,476
Am I?

58
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,979
You laughed only after you said that.

59
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,449
Do you have some kind of scheme?

60
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,217
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,253
Gosh, I caught you out again.

62
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,589
The thing is,

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,825
you can vote for him if you want.

64
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:21,027
-The other two here--
-Min-ik!

65
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,266
Three including him.

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,802
These three are voting for me.

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,313
The rehearsal is almost over.

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,849
You know how much I hate crowded places.

69
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,153
You can continue badmouthing me.

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,022
I'll leave you now.

71
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,865
It's as if he does an MRI scan on me.

72
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,068
He never forgets a face.

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,437
He can read people's minds
by their facial expressions.

74
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,105
That's why some people call him

75
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,675
Mr. Mind Reader instead of Mr. Do.

76
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,678
Mr. Do. Kids, come over here.

77
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,614
These kids will perform today.

78
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,149
From here, Seul-gi...

79
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,918
Seul-gi, Ji-u, Gyu-min, U-yeong, Hyeon-a,

80
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:23,222
Ju-eun, Eun-u, Hyeon-su, Se-yeong,
and Da-yeong.

81
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,592
Wow, you know all our names.

82
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,664
The opening rehearsal will start soon.

83
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,033
Mr. Do Min-ik, can you come up on stage?

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,134
Mr. Do, please.

85
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:41,441
But why would the T&T Mobile owner's son
have to be so sensitive?

86
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,943
It's not like he has to care about
what other people think.

87
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,813
Oh, my.

88
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,382
Mr. Do's suit blends with the background.

89
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,018
What do we do?

90
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,520
Video Team left for an event
in Busan a while ago.

91
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,788
What's wrong?

92
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,593
Is there anyone at PR Team
who can fix the video?

93
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,163
Reporters will start entering
in five minutes.

94
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,568
Don't you think Mr. Do looks way too calm?

95
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,371
I'd be panicking in this situation.

96
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,573
Why would he?

97
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,242
It's someone else
who's panicking right now.

98
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,351
Do you mean Jeong Gal-hee?

99
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,954
More like Jeong Minion.

100
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,256
Who calls her by her real name
at our company?

101
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,393
I'm sure she's running errands for him
at this very moment too.

102
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,065
Do you know why she always wears flats?

103
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,001
Her boss calls her every 10 minutes,

104
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,070
and she can't run fast in high heels.

105
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,373
And that diaper bag she carries around.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,842
A razor, socks, an umbrella, slippers...

107
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,111
She carries around everything
her boss might ever need.

108
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,313
Believe it or not,

109
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,416
she even did civil defense training
in place of her boss.

110
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,750
I'm Do Min-ik.

111
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,051
HEALTH CHECKUP CENTER

112
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,555
Some even say she did
a urine test for her boss.

113
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,124
Had she lived in the Age of Discovery,

114
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,859
she would've worked on a sugar cane farm.

115
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,127
During the Joseon dynasty,

116
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,796
she would've become a government slave.

117
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,901
Here she comes. I can hear
the elephant-like stomping.

118
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,138
No time to chat. Mr. Do needs me.

119
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,777
I hear you come to work
even on weekends to feed your boss' fish.

120
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,748
Yes, since he even trusts me
with that kind of task.

121
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,020
And you even drive for him?

122
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,557
He obviously even trusts me with his life.

123
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,762
Because you act like you have no dignity,

124
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,364
people think all secretaries are minions.

125
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,568
I'm sorry, Se-yeong,

126
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,536
but I ask you to try
and protect our dignity.

127
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,105
My dignity has been buried in my mom's urn

128
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,975
and hasn't seen the light of day
since the 2010 World Cup.

129
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,179
No one else has paid me
more than my boss does,

130
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,081
and I'd do anything for that money.

131
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,684
So please let me go.

132
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,186
I hate to keep my boss waiting.

133
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,556
Mr. Do never keeps a secretary
longer than a year.

134
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,058
Really? Why not?

135
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,527
And Gal-hee will have worked for him
for a year soon.

136
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,641
Ms. Jeong.

137
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, Mr. Do!

138
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,050
You're late.

139
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,653
Well, with a new suit,

140
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:41,854
your tie should change.

141
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,858
And with a new tie,
your shoes should change too.

142
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,960
And whose fault is this?

143
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:50,730
I swear

144
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,399
Video Team said the background was yellow,

145
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,334
and I even double-checked.

146
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,736
But you didn't triple-checked.

147
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,807
I was busy getting a birthday present
for your mother all morning.

148
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,042
No prior preparation?

149
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,578
On top of that,

150
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,148
all suits were sold out in your size.

151
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,716
You didn't even have a plan B?

152
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,123
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

153
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,814
Also, after "from TV to mobile,"

154
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,950
you should add "from movies to mobile"

155
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,019
since there will be
more movie content in the future.

156
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,120
Shoes.

157
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,755
Yes, sir.

158
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,828
Hold my head.

159
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,738
Please welcome
Director Do Min-ik of T&T Mobile.

160
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,112
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

161
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,114
Hello, everyone.

162
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,883
I'm Director Do Min-ik of T&T Mobile.

163
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,956
Starting with We Love Kids,

164
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,692
T&T Media is planning to produce

165
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,461
various kinds of original content

166
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,197
including children's content.

167
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,867
We strive to overcome
the limitations of IPTV.

168
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,068
On that note...

169
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,670
FROM TV TO MOBILE
FROM MOVIES TO MOBILE

170
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,572
-"From TV to mobile."
-"From TV to mobile."

171
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,707
-"From movies to mobile."
-"From movies to mobile."

172
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,476
To live up to these slogans,

173
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,111
we'll work hard to produce

174
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,513
-high-quality content.
-Maybe he should've paused once.

175
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,281
T&T Mobile...

176
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,516
I think it's excellent.

177
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,285
Mr. Gi.

178
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,188
Why aren't you on stage?

179
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,324
He's doing a great job without me.

180
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,128
Still, you worked on it together.

181
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,630
Min-ik never wears a coat, right?

182
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,065
He always takes his car

183
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,366
in the underground parking lot.

184
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,068
That's right.

185
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,504
Since he doesn't wear a coat,

186
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,539
you'd feel bad for wearing one.

187
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,508
But it's still cold without one.

188
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,144
That's why you always wear that.

189
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,813
A red cardigan that works
both outdoors and indoors.

190
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,785
Mr. Gi, can you read my mind?

191
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,753
How did you know that?

192
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,891
Before Min-ik got a secretary,

193
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,361
he screamed, "Dae-ju!"
instead of, "Ms. Jeong!"

194
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,597
At Wharton, I sometimes
even slept with my shoes on.

195
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,166
So I could run to him right away.

196
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,201
I've slept with my eyebrows drawn on.

197
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,239
Oh, I'm sorry.

198
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,408
By the way,

199
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,478
don't work too hard.

200
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,415
Just because you're
patient, obedient, and hardworking

201
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,985
doesn't mean you'll be rewarded.

202
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,622
Please look forward to
the performance of T&T Mobile

203
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,725
in this year's IPTV market.

204
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,860
Thank you.

205
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,696
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

206
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,498
He's wrong, isn't he, Mom?

207
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,970
I still believe
that if I patiently work hard,

208
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,406
I will be appreciated.

209
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,775
-Right?
-Hey.

210
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,477
It's here.

211
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,247
Nam-hee got a letter
from the University of Pennsylvania.

212
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,216
You know,
I think it's an admission letter.

213
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,351
Really?

214
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,157
What does it say? Did she get in?

215
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,059
Is she accepted? Can she start right away?

216
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,896
"Dongboseong's spicy jajangmyeon."

217
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,299
"Collect 30 coupons
and get a free yangjangpi"?

218
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,071
Do you think
I should just jump into a lake?

219
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,839
I'd gladly do so right away

220
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,742
if it will make you able to see.

221
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,345
It's a good thing if she doesn't get in.

222
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,615
It's not like she can really go there
even if she gets in.

223
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,050
She will. That's...

224
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,788
the school my boss went to.

225
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,793
I'll make sure Nam-hee lives a life
like Mr. Do's.

226
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,395
I can't let her end up
hidden backstage like me.

227
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,965
I want her to be on stage
in the spotlight--

228
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,233
Do you have the money to send her?

229
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,576
HUMAN RESOURCES

230
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,779
Our department already sent

231
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,915
your contract renewal papers to Mr. Do.

232
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,484
Oh, I see.

233
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,853
You probably know this already,

234
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,089
but Mr. Do never keeps his secretary
for more than a year.

235
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,458
I know.

236
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,661
CONTRACT

237
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,463
I was wrong. There was one exception.

238
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,232
There was? Who?

239
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,435
She must have been
Mr. Do's first secretary.

240
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,573
From 2013, she worked for him for 3 years.

241
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,143
This is Mr. Do's handwriting, isn't it?

242
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,544
PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT REQUESTED

243
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,612
It sure is.

244
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,686
He wanted to give her
permanent employment.

245
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,189
It means I might have a chance.

246
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,467
There are Romi's Licking

247
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,736
and Innocent Girl Ayeong
files in this flash drive.

248
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,280
I guess I won't be getting
any sleep tonight.

249
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,418
What are those?

250
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,923
They're field day flyers.

251
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,692
I do have one for your team too.

252
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,396
THE 43RD T&T MOBILE FIELD DAY

253
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,300
-You can't go, right?
-I don't want to.

254
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,536
I'm not a fool who goes to a field day
on a weekend just to win a rice cooker.

255
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,243
HAPPY CHILDREN'S DAY
T&T MOBILE

256
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,480
She could've gone another way.
Why did she have to go there?

257
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,348
Who?

258
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,516
Ms. Jeong.

259
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,786
Where's she?

260
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,756
Under that banner,
surrounded by those kids.

261
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,524
She's completely stuck.

262
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,897
Do you have good eyesight
or good concentration?

263
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,800
How could you spot Ms. Jeong
in that crowd?

264
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,269
How could I not?
She looks exactly the same every day.

265
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,874
Even if I go deaf,
I'd still hear her voice.

266
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,411
Even if I go blind,
I'd still recognize her.

267
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,117
Then why don't you renew her contract?

268
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,588
No one knows you better
than Ms. Jeong does.

269
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,693
Did you forget?

270
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,962
The secretary who knew me
better than anyone...

271
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,299
You remember what she did to me.

272
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,224
Our department already sent

273
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,360
your contract renewal papers to Mr. Do.

274
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,795
Mr. Do, is that...

275
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,965
the document you received?

276
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,169
Yes, I just received it.

277
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,442
Let's forget it.

278
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,044
Pardon?

279
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,813
I'm sure you could use

280
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,016
a little rest.

281
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,818
No, I...

282
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,787
don't want to rest at all.

283
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,225
You don't want to rest?

284
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,993
No.

285
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,165
I don't mind getting worn out.
I love this company.

286
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,567
I'd go anywhere with you
if only you'd let me.

287
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm not afraid of anything.

288
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:18,771
Teach me one,

289
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,939
and I'll learn a thousand.

290
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,775
Until my throat burns,
my tongue turns white,

291
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,310
and my armpits get sweaty,
I'll keep running and running.

292
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,945
Gosh.

293
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,949
Why would you

294
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,552
get so worked up about this?

295
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,693
If you want it so badly...

296
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,331
I'll think about it.

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,369
Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Do.

298
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,304
-You can leave.
-Okay. Thank you.

299
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,672
Thank you.

300
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,108
Enjoy your lunch. Thank you.

301
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,012
He said he'd think about it.

302
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,681
What did that secretary do

303
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,783
to make him want to give her
permanent employment?

304
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,222
I haven't seen anyone look more desperate
than she did earlier in decades.

305
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,026
Gosh, why is she so obsessed
with the field day?

306
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,932
Mr. Do is here.

307
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,473
Mr. Do!

308
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,210
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

309
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,336
I'm bleeding.

310
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,405
-I'm terribly sorry.
-I'm bleeding.

311
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,207
Should I get some medicine or something?

312
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,009
-Taxi!
-Where are you going?

313
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:05,978
Taxi!

314
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,679
Taxi!

315
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,589
Why did I have to make such a mistake now?

316
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,960
Where is he going anyway?

317
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,131
Please take a look. I beg you.

318
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,134
There must be something wrong
with my head.

319
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,736
-What's two times eight?
-Sixteen.

320
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,070
-Eight times seven?
-Fifty-six.

321
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,372
-It's fifty-four.
-No, fifty-six.

322
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:34,439
You're fine.

323
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,476
Seriously, please just take a look.

324
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,646
It wasn't just a regular bump.
The door totally slammed into me!

325
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,214
I completely smacked into that door.

326
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,515
Gosh.

327
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,121
It's been more than 20 years
since your surgery.

328
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,757
You're the one who told me
to be cautious at all times.

329
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,159
You said crowded places were dangerous,

330
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,128
so I've never done any shopping myself.

331
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,797
I'm not supposed to be out of breath,
so I've never run.

332
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,599
Worrying I might trip, fall,
and hurt myself,

333
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,935
I've been avoiding field days all my life,
and I'm already 34.

334
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,572
A hundred of that wouldn't do anything.

335
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,473
Come back if you fall from a high place
or something.

336
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,409
-Really?
-Yes.

337
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,843
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

338
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,978
-Positive?
-Yes.

339
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,580
-Absolutely positive?
-Yes!

340
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,463
It's me.

341
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,510
I'M SORRY FOR STARTLING YOU.
TAKE THIS BEFORE GOING TO BED.

342
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,487
I'm sorry for startling you.

343
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,057
Take this before going to bed.

344
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,729
She didn't have to.

345
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,135
JEONG GAL-HEE
CONTRACT

346
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,272

347
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,892
I'M SORRY FOR STARTLING YOU.
TAKE THIS BEFORE GOING TO BED.

348
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,702
JEONG GAL-HEE
CONTRACT

349
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,109
T&T MOBILE SECRETARY INTERVIEW

350
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,844
DIRECTOR JU DONG-MAN

351
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,212
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

352
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,483
Please introduce yourself.

353
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,018
Okay.

354
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,354
My mother named me Gal-hee,
meaning "orderly,"

355
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,390
in the hope that I'd lead
an honorable and orderly life.

356
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,782
Just take the meat out of the freezer
for the soup.

357
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,284
I can do the rest when I get home.
You don't have to do anything.

358
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,688
Don't skip your private lessons,
Top Student.

359
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,223
Do you have to go to field day

360
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,491
on the anniversary of Mom's death?

361
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,760
My boss is considering
renewing my contract.

362
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,396
I'll show my loyalty to him until the end.

363
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:20,732
Don't skip your lessons.

364
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,303
Fire

365
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,372
shot!

366
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,212
Nice shot, Boss!

367
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,788
We're a team only when they need us.

368
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,023
Otherwise, they don't give a darn
about secretaries.

369
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,592
No one seems to want us.

370
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,161
I'm not surprised.

371
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,429
Dispatched workers

372
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,530
can't even join the union.

373
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,165
Whenever there's a rumor going around,

374
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,733
the executives suspect the secretaries.

375
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,202
If you want to backbite your boss,
do it in your grave.

376
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,039
-Hello, Ms. Eulwangni.
-Hello, Ms. Eulwangni.

377
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,910
Stop calling me that
when others are around.

378
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,479
Okay, Ms. Lee Eul-wang.

379
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,114
-Go!
-Go!

380
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,450
What are you doing?

381
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,521
I'm going to enter
Carry Your Colleague on Your Back.

382
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,592
-You'll carry Mr. Do on your back?
-Yes.

383
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,428
Hey, don't expect Mr. Mind Reader
to show up here.

384
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,631
He won't?

385
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,469
He never turned up last year
as well as the year before that.

386
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,905
He's here.

387
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,808
-You can do this!
-You can do this!

388
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,780
I think he's coming here.

389
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:50,989
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

390
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,530
Are you really Do Min-ik?

391
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,068
It's hot and crowded.

392
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,703
You might bump into someone or fall.

393
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,738
Why would you want to be
somewhere so dangerous?

394
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,773
Exactly.

395
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,077
Why do I want to do this?

396
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,979
You can do this!

397
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,014
-Let's go!
-Come on!

398
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,850
-Let's do this!
-Keep going!

399
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,990
You came, Mr. Do.

400
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,961
I did. For you.

401
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,398
I've given it some thought, and...

402
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,705
To test your teamwork, we'll play

403
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,141
Carry Your Colleague on Your Back!

404
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,212
If you've found a partner,
with your partner on your back...

405
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,647
Get on my back.

406
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,482
Pardon?

407
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,319
Well... How could I...

408
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,720
I said, get on my back.

409
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,631
Well...

410
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,493
Did you want to do this so badly?

411
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,129
Did I?

412
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,266
Ready!

413
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,572
Jeong Gal-hee!

414
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,911
Is that Min-ik?

415
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,347
Is he

416
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,148
running?

417
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,787
I can't reach.

418
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,791
Higher. Come on.

419
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:08,493
There you go.

420
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,567
-I got it!
-Good.

421
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,297
Director Do of Media Team One and
his secretary, Ms. Jeong, in first place!

422
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:47,666
Yes!

423
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,607
We came in first place! We did it!

424
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:56,875
We did it!

425
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:01,312
Mr. Do, we came in first place!

426
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,255
First place.

427
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,991
Are you happy now?

428
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,759
Pardon?

429
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,195
When signing a contract,
I offer the highest salary.

430
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,763
When ending one,

431
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,166
I offer the best present.

432
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,169
That's my rule.

433
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,675
Thank you for everything.

434
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,519
Today's winner is Management Support Team!

435
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:42,754
Congratulations!

436
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:47,258
Each team member will be awarded
a gift certificate worth 50,000 won.

437
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,562
Last but not least,
it's time for Lucky Draw.

438
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,897
You said you'd think about it.

439
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,734
You said you'd think about if I want it.

440
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,269
I said that? When?

441
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:02,407
If you want it so badly...

442
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,677
I'll think about it.

443
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,682
Was that...

444
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,890
You're firing me, and you're laughing?

445
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,528
Your contract was only for a year
in the first place.

446
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,531
That means I'd stop seeing you
after a year.

447
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,200
I thought that meant you could
continue seeing me after a year.

448
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,969
Haven't you heard the rumor

449
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,537
that I get a new secretary every year?

450
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,340
I have, but I thought it might change.

451
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,443
What gave you that hope?

452
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,379
One of your secretaries
worked for you for three years.

453
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,783
You even wanted to give her
permanent employment.

454
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,252
How much

455
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,621
do you know about me?

456
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,490
I thought

457
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,326
I could be like her if I worked hard.

458
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,061
Anyone could do what you do.

459
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,197
It doesn't have to be you.

460
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,002
Mr. Do.

461
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,373
Don't hold me responsible for your hope.

462
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,842
Hope means

463
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,478
a futile dream that something will happen.

464
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:17,282
But the only thing I can do is hope.

465
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,252
You're the one
who evaluates my performance.

466
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,154
You're the one who renews my contract.

467
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:26,591
All I can ever do is hope.

468
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,097
I didn't care if people called me a minion
and laughed at me

469
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,067
as long as you needed me

470
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,503
and wanted me.

471
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,806
I fed your fish even if I skipped meals.

472
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,409
I missed my mom's memorial service

473
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,778
to get a birthday present for your mother.

474
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,615
My bag is full of your stuff.

475
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,219
My journal is full of your plans.

476
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,754
And

477
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,657
I'm not even allowed to hope?

478
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,298
Who wins the last prize?

479
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,668
It even comes with steam functions
and can cook sticky rice.

480
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,137
Who is the winner
of this top-notch rice cooker?

481
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:18,176
Secretary Jeong Gal-hee
of Media Team One, congratulations!

482
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,515
Congratulations.

483
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,755
1ST PRIZE

484
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,020
Kyokyo just finished cooking
delicious rice.

485
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,224
Steam will be released.

486
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,229
Please stir the rice.

487
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,099
Cook with Kyokyo. Kyokyo.

488
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,735
That darn rice cooker!

489
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:36,447
I don't mind getting worn out.
I love this company.

490
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,916
I'd go anywhere with you
if only you'd let me.

491
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,918
I'm not afraid of anything.

492
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,995
Why did I get all excited
when he wasn't even thinking about it?

493
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:55,133
It's like taking digestive pills
before the food is even ready.

494
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,403
What should I do with my life?

495
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,671
I'm in complete darkness.

496
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,907
-You too?
-What?

497
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,177
Is that why you didn't go to work?

498
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,545
What?

499
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,515
Well...

500
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,124
Hello, Mr. Do.

501
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:25,530
So you really got fired?

502
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,932
Come over here later.

503
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:31,302
The secretaries will throw
a goodbye party for you.

504
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:35,139
You want me to take today off

505
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,241
and come back tomorrow?

506
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,577
I will, Mr. Do.

507
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,854
Let me see.

508
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,159
Romi and Ayeong.

509
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,327
ITEMS

510
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,497
"Items"?

511
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,598
ITEMS

512
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,004
MOBILE TO DRIVE MARKET GROWTH

513
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,739
T&T MOBILE MEDIA 2 DIRECTOR
GI DAE-JU

514
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,411
Impressive, buddy.

515
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,480
Pardon?

516
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,184
I mean Mr. Do.

517
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:23,721
He's so competent
that I'm starting to hate him.

518
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,290
I know.

519
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:27,825
From winning exclusive deals

520
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,094
to successfully launching
children's content...

521
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,130
This is why people say Media Team Two is

522
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,065
not half as good as Media Team One...

523
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,901
Oh, I'm sorry.

524
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,336
You don't have to apologize.

525
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,972
I know how competent Min-ik is
better than anyone.

526
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,275
I hope Media Team Two will start
achieving good results soon.

527
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,043
So do I.

528
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,112
By the way,

529
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,516
don't be so polite to me when we're alone,

530
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,451
Eul-wang.

531
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,255
CEO SIM HAE-YONG

532
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,430
Hello.

533
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,835
Mr. Gi!

534
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,775
I thought you were alone.

535
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,545
Our company's rising star,

536
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,381
Director Gi Dae-ju!
You've all heard of him, right?

537
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,920
Of course we have.
He got promoted to director recently.

538
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,222
By the way, isn't he

539
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,958
very good friends with Mr. Do?

540
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,427
Come on. Mr. Sim even made him come here.

541
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,429
Let Mr. Sim take care of it.

542
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,164
Come on in. Have a seat.

543
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,466
Here.

544
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,939
We need at least six votes

545
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,473
for Mr. Sim to stay in his position.

546
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,375
I know that.

547
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,712
But Mr. Do has been brilliant lately.

548
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,949
We have nice food in front of us.
Stop talking about work.

549
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,483
Enough already.

550
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,986
Let Mr. Gi eat.

551
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,088
Mr. Gi.

552
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:06,691
Try this.

553
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,262
Once you taste the head,

554
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,398
you can't go back to eating tails.

555
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,334
Why?

556
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,870
The head tastes

557
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:22,340
just too sweet.

558
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,052
PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL
FOR JYGP PRODUCTION COMPANY

559
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,859
Where's my flash drive?

560
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,428
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

561
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,766
Oh, Dae-ju has it.

562
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,795
CIVIL DEFENSE TRAINING

563
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,897
BOOK FLIGHT TICKETS FOR MR. DO

564
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,441
PICK UP MR. DO'S SHIRT BY 10TH

565
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,543
BOARD MEETING AT 2 P.M.

566
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,512
POLISH MR. DO'S SHOES

567
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,180
FEED MR. DO'S FISH

568
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,686
My bag is full of your stuff.

569
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,523
My journal is full of your plans.

570
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,210
Gal-hee, Mr. Do just left.

571
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,350
Where did he go?

572
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,156
Did Ms. Lee step out?

573
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,297
My flash drive...

574
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,675
Gosh, I told him it was confidential.

575
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:15,946
You weren't just a piece of clothing
to me. You were like my skin.

576
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:20,618
Thank you so much for everything.

577
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:22,787
Look at all this lint.

578
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,356
Let's go home now.

579
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:41,872
Min-ik.

580
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,174
Hi, wifey.

581
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,676
"That Place"?

582
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,113
What's going on? I thought he'd left.

583
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,548
You want to go to That Place right now?

584
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,560
I can't. I have a promotional shoot
scheduled early in the morning.

585
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,198
Never mind. I'll be right there.

586
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,466
See you at That Place.

587
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,075
"That place"?

588
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,385
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

589
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,155
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

590
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,991
Why does that keep following me around?

591
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:40,097
DRIVERS' WAITING ROOM

592
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,612
It seems like everyone's late.
I thought they'd be here by now.

593
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,748
Forget it.

594
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,050
The official minion of T&T Mobile

595
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,286
got what she deserved.
That's what they think.

596
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,157
You won't believe how long
the line was at the jokbal place.

597
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,294
Myeong-jeong.

598
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,329
Ri-ra.

599
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,434
Se-yeong.

600
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,203
Don't get emotional,
and absolutely no crying.

601
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,438
I'm only here because Ms. Lee is coming.

602
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,377
Let's eat.

603
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,554
THAT PLACE

604
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,724
What's taking him so long?

605
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,066
Sir, can I change my destination?

606
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,305
Kill him!

607
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,076
How dare he laugh
when he's firing someone!

608
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,678
How dare he!

609
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,448
I wouldn't have let him
get away with that.

610
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,818
That obnoxious psychopath.

611
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,989
I would've killed him
right then and there.

612
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,559
Gosh, I'm the one who got fired.
Why would you get drunk?

613
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,795
Let's go!

614
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:22,967
That arrogant jerk.

615
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,804
I'll smash his head in today.

616
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,273
Let's go.

617
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,108
Let's go! I'm in!

618
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,413
Let's go and kill that jerk!

619
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,783
Guys, please calm down.

620
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,620
If I killed everyone I hate

621
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,688
and who treats me unfairly,

622
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,225
half the world's population
would be dead by now.

623
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,194
Instead,

624
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,198
I try to be patient

625
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,600
at all times.

626
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,902
Do you know why?

627
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,605
Look at that.

628
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:02,873
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

629
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,975
Sadly, that happens to be

630
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,078
my family motto.

631
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,748
My family

632
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:15,519
and everyone who has to work
for someone else all his or her life

633
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,223
has to be obedient, humble, and patient

634
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,891
to survive.

635
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,296
The thing my mom tried to say
even on her deathbed...

636
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,533
It must have also been...

637
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,201
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

638
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,305
VIRTUE

639
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,648
Patience is...

640
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,885
Patience is...

641
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,753
"Patience is..."

642
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,155
PATIENCE IS A MURDER

643
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,823
"...a murder"?

644
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,893
Mom.

645
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:00,330
What on earth were you going to say
about patience?

646
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,598
What an idiot.

647
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,536
That was it.

648
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,773
How could I not know that?

649
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,124
Darn it.

650
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,460
-Let's go!
-Where?

651
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,328
Let's go and kill him.

652
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,132
Are we really going?

653
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,268
Are we really going to kill him?

654
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,572
Mom, are you watching?

655
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,174
Like your last words,

656
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,778
I'll go and kill him today!

657
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,647
-Yes!
-Yes!

658
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,123
Let's go!

659
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:37,995
Is that you?

660
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:42,766
Well...

661
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,135
Who are you?

662
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,339
You must be mistaken.

663
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:51,875
This is a private boat.

664
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:57,948
Okay?

665
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,287
What are you doing?

666
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,389
You can't...

667
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,191
You jerk!

668
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,990
Aren't you guys cold?

669
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,762
Are you too?

670
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,432
I have a little heartburn too.

671
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,437
What are you guys talking about?

672
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:31,875
I have to book golf early in the morning.

673
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,682
Mom bought sundae.
She wants me to come home.

674
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,584
You traitors.

675
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,619
Fine, go! Go home, all of you!

676
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,623
You should go home too.
You can't do anything alone anyway.

677
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,259
I'm not going home. I can't.

678
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,996
I'll follow my mom's last words
no matter what.

679
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,099
I'll kill that jerk!

680
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,268
Give them to me.

681
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,745
Will she be all right?

682
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,181
I don't care anymore.

683
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,050
Where are we anyway?

684
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,918
Call a taxi.

685
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,623
I'm freezing.

686
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,892
-Let's go home.
-It's too cold.

687
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,293
Who on earth are you?

688
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,098
A knife? Is that a knife?

689
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,201
You want to kill me or something?

690
00:49:58,428 --> 00:49:59,629
Ms. Jeong!

691
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,164
Yes, Mr. Do!

692
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,603
Wow, I can't believe you, Gal-hee.

693
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,273
What do I do with you?
You're hearing things now?

694
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:15,078
Fine, I'll kill him.

695
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,981
If I kill him, I'll stop hearing--

696
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,017
-Ms. Jeong!
-Yes, Mr. Do!

697
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,721
What's going on?

698
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,690
-Help!
-Is this real?

699
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,626
Ms. Jeong, help!

700
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,595
Help!

701
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,764
Mr. Do?

702
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,313
Please stop. I'm sorry.

703
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,027
-Are you okay?
-Stay away.

704
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,486
I think

705
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,288
I've seen him before.

706
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,090
What?

707
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,625
Where was it?

708
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,741
Mom looks angry.

709
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,311
What do you want for your birthday?

710
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:02,779
What if...

711
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,847
A boat.

712
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,515
Let's wait for him to wake up.

713
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,651
I hope he'll be okay.

714
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,433
Min-ik, are you awake now?

715
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:26,303
Who are you?

716
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,039
What are you talking about? I'm Dr. Gu.

717
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,846
You must be mistaken.

718
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:42,986
My head.

719
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,262
I'm at Sangmo Hospital?

720
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:59,135
Dr. Gu Seok-chan works here, right?

721
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,171
Please bring him to me.

722
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,043
DR. GU SEOK-CHAN

723
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,017
Wait.

724
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:17,754
Where did the doctor a minute ago
disappear to?

725
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:21,725
Why are you wearing Dr. Gu's gown?

726
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,094
You really don't recognize me?

727
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,096
Hey!

728
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:27,998
I can tell what's on a person's mind

729
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:31,501
just by looking at his or her face.
People call me Mr. Mind Reader.

730
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:36,239
I've known Dr. Gu for more than 20 years.
There's no way I don't recognize him.

731
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,675
-Nine times nine?
-Eighty-one.

732
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,210
-Four times seven?
-Twenty-eight.

733
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,383
This is what Dr. Gu usually does.

734
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,486
Min-ik.

735
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,355
Who do I look like

736
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,257
to you?

737
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,296
What do you take me for?

738
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:00,964
Goodness.

739
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,000
I saved him.

740
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,203
I'm not the one who tried to kill him.
I saved him!

741
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,740
We already have witness testimonies.

742
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,277
Quoting your mom's last words,

743
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:16,146
you said you'd kill him.

744
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,580
What?

745
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,384
Unbelievable.

746
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,586
You're being ridiculous.

747
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,623
What do you mean?
"Who do I look like to you?"

748
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,559
Do you think I'm blind or something?

749
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:50,747
I must be dreaming.

750
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,248
Yes, that's it.

751
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,852
I'll go back to sleep now.

752
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,421
I'll be fine by the time I get up.

753
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,361
How can this be?

754
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,396
It hurts.

755
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,099
That means this is...

756
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:20,643
I think I should

757
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,547
get going. I have an important shoot.

758
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,750
I should go there and
see people's faces...

759
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,185
-You can't.
-Let go!

760
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,358
Min-ik!

761
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:41,464
The worst case of fine dust is
coming from China.

762
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,867
The level of fine dust is

763
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,702
four to six times higher,

764
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,271
and a nationwide warning has been issued.

765
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,208
Due to the fog and dust,
visibility in Seoul

766
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,710
is less than 1km,

767
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,512
causing limited vision.

768
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,082
The air pollution in Beijing...

769
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,457
What's happening?

770
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,892
The fusiform gyrus.

771
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:12,061
There's something wrong with the area
of his brain that recognizes faces.

772
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,570
People's faces...

773
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,277
Kid, can you help me?

774
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,813
I'm...

775
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,882
I mean, people's faces keep changing
like monsters.

776
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:34,751
Do you have Alzheimer's too?

777
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,734
I have to get out of here.

778
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:53,703
I have to...

779
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:14,491
Even if I go deaf,
I'd still hear her voice.

780
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:20,163
Even if I go blind,
I'd still recognize her.

781
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,099
Ms. Jeong.

782
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,139
After turning me into a murder suspect,
how can you look completely fine?

783
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,910
I don't give a damn anymore

784
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:36,779
if you get beaten up
or get smashed on the ground.

785
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,281
Gosh.

786
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:58,902
Ms. Jeong.

787
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:02,972
Please...

788
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,775
help me.

789
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,711
Pardon?

790
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:18,454
SPECIAL THANKS TO
LEE MOON-SIK, KIM JEONG-PAL, KIM GI-DU

791
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,569
Stay right next to me from now on,
no matter what happens.

792
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,971
Why do you want me back?

793
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,941
You fired me yourself.
Why do you want me back now?

794
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,142
Don't even think about it.

795
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,277
Who on earth are you?

796
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,746
Gal-hee, I can only see you.

797
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:47,584
Have you finally decided
to get me out of the gutter?

798
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:48,885
Please hurry and find him.

799
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:50,486
I need to see

800
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,121
who did this to me.

801
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,658
He's your colleague and closest friend.

802
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,759
Dae-ju?

803
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,430
