1
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:48,982
Sometimes, one minute
can change everything.

2
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,304
Nice to meet you.

3
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,240
I'm Do Min-ik.

4
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,617
Nice to meet you. I'm Do Min-ik.

5
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,921
Nice to meet you.

6
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,691
My name is Eun Jeong-su.

7
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:10,830
This guy.

8
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,832
It's him, right?

9
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,075
Did you meet him?

10
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,677
Yes, I met him just now.

11
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,746
How did it go?

12
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,983
Mr. Gi!

13
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,025
Let's talk later.

14
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,065
Who is he?

15
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,636
He's Min-ik's new driver.

16
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,772
Are you free sometime this week?

17
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,507
I'd like to make some plans.

18
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,944
It's about the thing I said earlier.

19
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,627
No way.

20
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,130
It can't be.

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,165
It's impossible.

22
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,366
Ha-ni.

23
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,402
-What are you doing?
-Myeong-jeong.

24
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,907
Guys, gather around.

25
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,611
This is what happened
on my way to work this morning.

26
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,914
I swear I saw something red flash by
in front of me.

27
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,219
Are you saying you saw Jeong Gal-hee?

28
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,189
She'd never come back here
unless she has no brains.

29
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,291
Swallows come back in the spring,

30
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,694
and beggars always come back
knocking on your door,

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,362
but Gal-hee never will.

32
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,365
How could she work for someone
whom she tried to kill?

33
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,976
Here's my schedule for this week.

34
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,280
And this is the joint meeting schedule.
My number's changed.

35
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,149
-Save it.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,752
About lunch, do you know that place,
Lepommi, in Cheongdam-dong?

37
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,621
Get some truffle gnocchi for me there.

38
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,724
Also, stop by Yeonnam-dong
on your way back and...

39
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,929
get...

40
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,308
Bend down, will you?

41
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,709
I can't.

42
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,879
-Why not?
-"Tell me what you want."

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,248
You said that, didn't you?

44
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,716
Did I?

45
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,185
"I'll revise the contract as you wish."

46
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,553
You said that too.

47
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,223
-Did I say that?
-Also,

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,159
even after I turned you down,
you showed up again and said,

49
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,529
"I can only see you."

50
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,231
You sounded extremely desperate.

51
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,033
No, I didn't.

52
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,137
"Gal-hee, I can only--"

53
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,571
That's enough!

54
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:09,275
Fine, tell me what you want.

55
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,313
CONDITIONS FOR CONTRACT RENEWAL

56
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,915
"Working hours are from 9 a.m.

57
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,751
to 8 p.m.

58
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,422
I refuse to take calls
outside working hours

59
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,791
or run personal errands

60
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,526
unrelated to work.

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,762
I demand an hour of lunch break every day.

62
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,899
I work five days a week
unless decided otherwise."

63
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,971
Since when do secretaries have
set working hours?

64
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,108
As a secretary,
you go home when your boss does.

65
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,012
You work whenever your boss is working.

66
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,350
I'm back here
as a secretary of T&T Mobile,

67
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,387
not Do Min-ik's minion.

68
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,425
If you don't work on weekends,
who will feed my fish?

69
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,394
That's animal abuse.

70
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,129
Are you aware

71
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,599
I've been skipping meals
to feed your fish every weekend?

72
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,701
That's abuse.

73
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,704
Are you saying you don't care
if my fish starves?

74
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,975
"Anyone could do what you do.

75
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,544
It doesn't have to be you."

76
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,346
You said that yourself,

77
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,681
didn't you?

78
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,449
That means

79
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:27,620
anyone could do it.

80
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,694
Well,

81
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,630
if you'd rather I left,

82
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,001
I will do so willingly.

83
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,079
Fine, all right.

84
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,114
But there's one condition.

85
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,282
Fire away.

86
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,385
Your boss isn't the kind of person

87
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,087
who gives up easily.

88
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,955
I have an illness, so what?

89
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,124
Even if my illness can't be cured,

90
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,827
I won't let it drag me down.
I'll push through it.

91
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,163
I'll win the approval of the board
and become

92
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,431
the CEO of T&T Mobile.

93
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,766
"From TV to mobile,
from movies to mobile."

94
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,035
I will realize the dream
of running a contents business

95
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,571
that my father never got to realize.

96
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,807
so do everything you can to help me.

97
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:24,310
No one can find out about my illness.

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,746
People should think
that I see every fine line

99
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,283
and every little pore and hair
on their faces.

100
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,417
Got it?

101
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,320
Yes, Mr. Do.

102
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,389
-Is that the only condition?
-No.

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,624
There's one more.

104
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,106
And it's a very

105
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,442
important one.

106
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,749
What is it?

107
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,187
As soon as my illness is cured,

108
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,991
the contract between you and me

109
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:15,895
will be terminated immediately.

110
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,675
Darn it.

111
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,945
All he needed was someone
who could tell people apart for him.

112
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,751
Fine. Whatever. I'll just do
as much as I get paid.

113
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,665
Buses...

114
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,202
are running?

115
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,508
The sun is still up.

116
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,546
There are people on the street.

117
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,852
Are you watching, Mom?

118
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,789
Your daughter finally made it.

119
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,796
I got off work when everyone else did.

120
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,268
This is what I call happiness!

121
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,449
-Jeong Gal-hee?
-Jeong Gal-hee?

122
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,861
I know, I get it.

123
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,731
You all must be puzzled.

124
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,034
Knock, knock, any brains there?

125
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,437
If so, please explain.

126
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,172
How could you go from "I want to kill him"

127
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,174
to "I want to work for him" overnight?

128
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,477
What's the fuss about?

129
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,281
-Hello, Ms. Lee.
-Hello, Ms. Lee.

130
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,216
I asked her to come.

131
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,484
Please.

132
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,589
Ms. Lee, let me explain.

133
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,525
You can work anywhere you want
as long as you're paid.

134
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,361
What's the big deal?

135
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,863
Welcome back. I'm glad to see you again.

136
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,832
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

137
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,468
Today's on me, everyone.

138
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,274
What are they doing near my workplace?

139
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,377
Who?

140
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,681
Ms. Lee, I'm really sorry,

141
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,149
but I have to go.

142
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,351
Where's the bill?

143
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't worry. It must be
something urgent. I'll get this.

144
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,355
Thank you so much, Ms. Lee.

145
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,424
Let's drink and sing karaoke soon.
It's my treat.

146
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,659
We'll have a blast.

147
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,360
Can you take us to a club instead?

148
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,130
Sure. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

149
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,297
-Keep your promise!
-Okay.

150
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,399
A club...

151
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,035
-Have you ever been to a club?
-No.

152
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,273
Don't you see this?

153
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,841
I don't care if you're police officers.

154
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,077
I still can't let you in.

155
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,945
Sir, we're busy.

156
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,115
This is obstruction of justice.

157
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,751
-Excuse me!
-Ma'am.

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,320
-Do you remember us?
-So it really was her.

159
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,056
With Mr. Do Min-ik--

160
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,658
Do Min-ik?

161
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,794
I'm sorry,

162
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,396
but can we talk somewhere else?

163
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,799
Where's Mr. Do now?

164
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,269
-Look.
-Yes, sir.

165
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,105
You're close to that girl
in the red cardigan, aren't you?

166
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,108
Find out what Do Min-ik, that punk,
is up to these days.

167
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,810
I will.

168
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,622
From morning to night,

169
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,425
I'm giving you many presents today.

170
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,634
What's the present
you sent me this morning?

171
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,470
Do you mean Ms. Jeong?

172
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,039
Is Ms. Jeong back?

173
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,508
That's not it?

174
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,978
I spent all my budget for this month

175
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,013
just to break this to you.

176
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,015
But if Ms. Jeong is back,

177
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,754
this really is a perfect time
to celebrate.

178
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,893
What is it you want to tell me?
Why would you spend so much money?

179
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:42,595
You want to ask me for a favor?

180
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,096
I want to confess something.

181
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,265
Dae-ju?

182
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,934
This was at 11:53 p.m.

183
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,172
It means he was already there
when you arrived.

184
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,909
Then where did he go without seeing you?

185
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,315
I don't want to fight over

186
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,984
who's going to say it first.

187
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,720
So let me say it first.

188
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,256
Ladies first, of course.

189
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,561
I had an accident

190
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,464
the day we were supposed to meet here.

191
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,332
An accident?

192
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,701
I was waiting for you...

193
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,522
I can't tell

194
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,626
if he's genuinely surprised by this

195
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,895
or just pretending to be.

196
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,934
Still, I believe his face would be saying,

197
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,438
"I'm very worried about you."

198
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,813
THAT PLACE

199
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,114
Has the culprit been caught?

200
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,116
Did you see his face?

201
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,085
I did,

202
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,454
but he's not caught yet.

203
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,525
I hope you didn't get hurt.

204
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,394
I did get hurt a little.

205
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,030
Hold on.

206
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,841
-Who are you?
-Well...

207
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,744
I didn't know you were both here.

208
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,815
You don't need that dangerous thing.
We're police officers.

209
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,026
Ms. Jeong?

210
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,873
Is this why you're suspecting me?

211
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,577
When you want to kill someone,
it's usually someone you know,

212
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,812
and most likely someone close to you.

213
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,183
Seventy-five percent of murderers
are the victim's acquaintances.

214
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,785
Sir.

215
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,857
If there's any doubt,
it should be cleared up.

216
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,325
Here's what happened.

217
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,197
I went to the boat to meet Min-ik.

218
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,767
Hello, Ms. Lee.

219
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,936
Ms. Lee?

220
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,272
But something happened
to my secretary, Ms. Lee.

221
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,340
Ms. Lee.

222
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,608
So I left.

223
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,912
Min-ik wouldn't answer his phone,

224
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,149
so I got worried

225
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,785
and went back to the boat afterward.

226
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:56,722
Excuse me.

227
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,795
Well...

228
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,364
Can I borrow your phone?

229
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,100
I need to make an urgent phone call,
but my phone is dead.

230
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,705
Thank you.

231
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,045
If I'd known he was the culprit,

232
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,782
I would've taken a closer look.

233
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,454
Did you pay with a credit card
in the taxi?

234
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,290
-I paid with cash.
-"Cash"?

235
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:35,260
Who pays with cash in a taxi these days?

236
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,696
That's why I try to pay with cash.

237
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,400
Taxi drivers love it
when they hold cash in their hand.

238
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,069
That's nice of you.

239
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,274
Write down your secretary's phone number
for me.

240
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,111
Do you have to talk to her?

241
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,445
If I don't,

242
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,181
how will you prove your alibi?

243
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,191
You don't have to.

244
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
I want the investigation terminated.

245
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,229
Mr. Do.

246
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,865
Are you kidding me?

247
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,002
One moment you nag us to find the culprit,

248
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,938
the next you want
the investigation terminated.

249
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,109
Do you think you can boss around
the police?

250
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,545
Am I one of your secretaries?

251
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,947
I want the investigation terminated
as well.

252
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,051
-Pardon?
-The CEO election is

253
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,252
around the corner.

254
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,888
Everyone's dying to spread rumors.
The police, a murder attempt...

255
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,723
It'd make people go crazy.

256
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,626
Imagine reporters smelling something
and joining in too.

257
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,961
It'll put Min-ik in serious trouble.

258
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,299
Considering nothing more has happened
since then, I wouldn't worry.

259
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,802
You said 75 percent.

260
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,805
Then there's the other 25 percent too.

261
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,042
Can you believe these guys?

262
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,014
You can't be too careful.

263
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,650
Always take your car
even to personal appointments.

264
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,386
Sir, I hope you understand.

265
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,288
Sure, don't worry.

266
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,956
Or how about this?

267
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,358
Get a bodyguard.

268
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,993
Maybe that's not a good idea.

269
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,863
It'll stir up suspicions at the company.

270
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,801
Why are you here?

271
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,303
Pardon?

272
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,640
It's 11:50 p.m. now.

273
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,542
According to our contract,

274
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,412
you should've gotten off work
four hours ago.

275
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:34,913
Considering that,

276
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,116
you could've just given me
a call or something.

277
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,951
Why did you come all the way here?

278
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,719
Don't tell me

279
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,355
you were worried about me.

280
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,961
Worried about you, my foot.
It was a force of habit.

281
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,363
I'm still new
to getting off work at 8 p.m.

282
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,599
Glad to hear that.
I hope you never get used to it.

283
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,178
Have I...

284
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,416
said this before?

285
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,419
Said what?

286
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,390
Thank you...

287
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,495
for coming back.

288
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,888
Use this if you want.

289
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,343
I'm here.

290
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,414
I love you as always.

291
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,620
Chairwoman Sim.

292
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,191
It's you, Ms. Park.

293
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,193
I heard your son caused trouble.

294
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,930
Now you're being too direct.

295
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,466
I wasn't that bad.
It was just a little mistake.

296
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,936
I happen to be an expert in that area.

297
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,038
If he didn't even recognize
his own mother,

298
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,773
there are only two possibilities.

299
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,209
Alcohol or drugs.

300
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,682
I should stop scaring the innocent lady.

301
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,385
I came here because I thought

302
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,154
your son might be ready
for my daughter now.

303
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,290
Your daughter?

304
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:02,561
Yes, the crazy bitch in my family.

305
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,496
You've heard, right?

306
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,168
The "crazy bitch"?

307
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,107
She's just unique. She's special.

308
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,277
If you think so,

309
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,812
can you please take her?

310
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,116
Your daughter and my son?

311
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,553
Didn't you ask me about
screening rights for Cinepark?

312
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,326
Tell your son to try his luck.

313
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,096
Once your son takes my daughter,

314
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,465
screening rights wouldn't be a problem.

315
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,201
The whole Park Group can be

316
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,104
yours.

317
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,087
I'm home.

318
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,624
Hi.

319
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,160
How are you feeling today?

320
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,263
Do you recognize me?

321
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,669
I'm sorry. I was drunk that day.

322
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,610
If you're playing some kind of game,
be more careful.

323
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,479
It's too obvious.

324
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,084
I want you to

325
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,286
go on a blind date.

326
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,794
Have you met her?

327
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,630
I have.

328
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,068
She's such a celebrity.

329
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,237
I guess you've crossed paths a few times.

330
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,773
But I'd expected you
to be more surprised than this.

331
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,143
Should I be?

332
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,049
You're just like your father.

333
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,618
You know how to take advantage of women.

334
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,490
Who on earth is she?

335
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,426
With her help,

336
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,629
you'll easily be elected the new CEO.

337
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,499
Then I'll use you

338
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,568
to get rid of your uncle
and take over the whole company.

339
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,340
What do you say?
Does that make me a bad person?

340
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:30,842
If I do as you say,

341
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,946
will you accept me as your family?

342
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,848
You'll be

343
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,619
accepted as her family at least.

344
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,929
I can become the CEO

345
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,331
even without her help.

346
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,001
But I'll meet her

347
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,038
if I can repay you for raising me

348
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,240
by doing so.

349
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,793
Family

350
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,895
sure is nice.

351
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,131
I like women too.

352
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,809
But I can't even see her face.

353
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,453
Who are you?

354
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:54,092
What do you look like?

355
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,274
Ms. Park, everything's ready.

356
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,519
Director Kim, stay with Veronica Park

357
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,654
and keep an eye on her lips.

358
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,656
-Her lips?
-You've never heard?

359
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,925
A slight smile at the preview means

360
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,362
a million viewers. A smile with teeth
showing means five million viewers.

361
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,664
If Paul the Octopus predicts
World Cup results,

362
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,700
Veronica Park predicts
which movies will be hits.

363
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,673
She's never been wrong once.

364
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,198
Try and make me show my teeth.

365
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,339
I'm so happy you're back.

366
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,512
Have we ever hung out on a weekend before?

367
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,883
That's because you worked every weekend.

368
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,522
By the way,

369
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,525
the police officers who showed up
at work the other day...

370
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,694
-What was that about?
-Sorry?

371
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,997
Did Mr. Do get in trouble?

372
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,167
Did he get drunk?

373
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,003
Did he commit assault?

374
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,738
Or was it sexual harassment?

375
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,774
-Hey!
-What?

376
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,178
Is this where you wanted to watch a movie?

377
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,713
Yes.

378
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,114
Cinepark.

379
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,284
I can't watch a movie here.

380
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,418
It was fun today.

381
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,187
What are you talking about?

382
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,189
Cinepark theaters are all over Seoul.

383
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,924
If you can't watch a movie here,

384
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,159
you can't watch any movies at all.

385
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,730
That's why Frozen is
the last movie I watched.

386
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,232
Why can't you watch a movie here anyway?

387
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,509
I worked for the CEO of this company

388
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,545
before I worked for Mr. Do.

389
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,589
Brother.

390
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,925
It hurts a lot.

391
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,894
Bok-sun.

392
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,032
Bok-sun, open your eyes!

393
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,933
We're almost home.

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,537
Do you mean the heiress to Park Group,
which owns everything from distributors

395
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,272
to production companies and theaters?

396
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,208
Yes. The CEO of Cinepark,

397
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,010
Veronica Park.

398
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,312
I can't leave my little sister behind!

399
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:05,016
Sir, please let go of me!

400
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,352
Also known as the Movie Bitch.

401
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,089
Bok-sun!

402
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,824
Sir!

403
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,799
Apologize to electricity.

404
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,935
Apologize to the Korea Electric Power
Corporation employees

405
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,471
stuck in the electrical room
wearing hazmat suits all day

406
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,941
for this trashy movie to be played.

407
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,578
Apologize to kids in Cambodia
who can't study at night

408
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,981
because there's no electricity.

409
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,352
Apologize to Tesla and Edison
who devoted their lives

410
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,290
to inventing electricity
for this lousy movie to be played.

411
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,927
Apologize to all of them.

412
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,604
I heard her nickname is Manizer.

413
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,040
She flirts with every single guy she sees.

414
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,441
In the movie,

415
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,344
there was this guy selling rice cakes.

416
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,180
Get his phone number.

417
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,950
Yes, ma'am.

418
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,219
Three years ago...

419
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,333
It's Bin!

420
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,401
Just go.

421
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,070
Oh, no.

422
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:40,411
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

423
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,646
BIN

424
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,487
Hi, Bin. I'm on my way to you.

425
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,655
Wait just a second.

426
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,664
Awesome.

427
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,134
I could put up with everything else,

428
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,170
but that part of the job made me quit.

429
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:08,740
If working with her was
like having burns all over my body,

430
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,875
what I have now
is just a little sty in the eye.

431
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,887
Hello, Ms. Park.

432
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,197
So it really is you, Gal-hee.

433
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,469
I've been well.

434
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,505
Much better than when I worked here.

435
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,741
We had so much fun together,

436
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:45,143
right?

437
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,580
You were my perfect avatar.

438
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,782
What are you up to these days?

439
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,617
I'm actually

440
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,120
looking for a new secretary.

441
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,122
No thanks!

442
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,492
I'm working for an amazing boss.

443
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,127
I love my current job.

444
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,671
I've been waiting.

445
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,741
Okay.

446
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,276
I'll be on time.

447
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:26,017
So who's this amazing boss of yours?

448
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,655
I work for Mr. Do Min-ik of T&T Mobile.

449
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,757
Really?

450
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,594
Then we'll be seeing each other a lot.

451
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:49,107
What does she mean, we'll be seeing

452
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,675
each other a lot?

453
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,846
There you go.

454
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,149
There's an N missing.

455
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:00,151
Pardon?

456
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,853
P, E, N, N.

457
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,222
"Pennsylvania" should be spelled
with double N.

458
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,193
-Is it a typo?
-Do they still send these by post?

459
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,796
I thought they e-mail everything
these days.

460
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:13,798
No way.

461
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:17,502
Gosh!

462
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:21,172
Why? Why is this in front of my eyes?
Why is she looking at me?

463
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,942
What's with the fuss?

464
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,144
Do you know her? Who is she?

465
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,012
Who is she? Can't you see...

466
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,415
I guess you can't.

467
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,418
She's Veronica Park, the CEO of Cinepark.

468
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,221
Is she?

469
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,592
Have you met her?

470
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,061
No.

471
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,597
I've heard the rumors,
but I haven't met her yet.

472
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,934
If I'd known, I would've said no.

473
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,669
Yes, that's a good idea.

474
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,339
-You should never meet her.
-The 13th.

475
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,174
Kingdom Hotel at 9 p.m.

476
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,609
You're meeting her?

477
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,946
Unfortunately, your boss
keeps every promise

478
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,982
he makes.

479
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,784
It has to be 9 p.m.

480
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,620
I don't want to stay long

481
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,589
with this loud woman.

482
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,095
Darn it.

483
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,079
Have you found out?

484
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,983
Well, not yet.

485
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,824
You know what? Let's say I'm...

486
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,226
Going down.

487
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,728
...from my position.
That means your contract will be...

488
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,597
Canceled.

489
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,865
Got it?

490
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,868
Please give me until the end of this week.

491
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,804
I'll find it out by all means.

492
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,975
One hundred and sixty-three.

493
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,676
One hundred and seventy-five.

494
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,545
One hundred and seventy-five.

495
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,213
One hundred and eighty.

496
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,817
One hundred and fifty-five.

497
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,053
One hundred and fifty-five.

498
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,258
One hundred and fifty-three.

499
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,728
One hundred and fifty-three.

500
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,197
One hundred and sixty-eight.

501
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,867
And... One hundred and sixty.

502
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,302
One hundred and sixty-eight.

503
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,642
I'm leaving.

504
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:39,710
Okay.

505
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,414
One hundred and sixty-five.

506
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,920
One hundred and seventy-three.

507
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,123
What are you doing?

508
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,325
This?

509
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,161
I'm memorizing all the employees' heights.

510
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,230
If I know how tall everyone is,

511
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,632
it'll help me tell them apart.

512
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,102
You're going to memorize all of them?

513
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,771
Yes, I'm almost done.
Do you want to see it?

514
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,474
Here we go.

515
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,943
Between 160cm and 170cm,

516
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,211
there are 23 employees.

517
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,414
And Mr. Park and Mr. Kim

518
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,150
belong to that category.

519
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,220
By dividing the category by gender...

520
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,922
Oh, and you're 168cm tall.

521
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,661
Let me see.

522
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,798
What are you doing?

523
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,666
Hairstyles.

524
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,337
Mr. Park has curly hair.

525
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,740
Mr. Kim has an undercut.

526
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,410
If you remember their hairstyles,

527
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,646
it'll become even easier.

528
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,448
Right.

529
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,886
Does Ms. Yuk have long hair?

530
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,792
I'm working overtime again.

531
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,495
Doesn't she have a bob?

532
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,531
A bob? Did she get a haircut?

533
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,568
Human Resources. Mr. Choe?

534
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:14,939
Shiny.

535
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,208
You'll recognize him right away.

536
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,178
Ms. Mo...

537
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,010
First of all, I know

538
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,980
what you're going through.

539
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,616
Take good care of yourself.

540
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,286
I'm calling from
T&T Mobile Media Team One.

541
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,522
Mr. Do would like to book an appointment

542
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,123
with Ms. Park.

543
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,693
I only started yesterday,
so I haven't heard anything yet.

544
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,761
Can I ask her first and call you back?

545
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,997
Then please ask her if she could meet him

546
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,566
at the Kingdom Hotel
at 9 p.m. on the 13th.

547
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,301
KINGDOM HOTEL AT 9 P. M. ON THE 13TH

548
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,570
Please wait.

549
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,905
Hello, Ms. Park.

550
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:22,640
I just got a call from T&T Mobile.

551
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,243
I know. At 9 p.m. on the 13th.

552
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,515
She already knows.

553
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,417
Really?

554
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,557
Then I'll make a reservation
under the name of T&T Mobile.

555
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,592
Bye.

556
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,062
How did she know?

557
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,866
Did Chairwoman Sim tell her directly?

558
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,370
Is this fate?

559
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,940
Fate?

560
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,576
Am I talking to a doctor
or a fortune-teller?

561
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,112
When is Dr. Park coming back from the US?

562
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,649
What you're saying
can't be explained by medicine.

563
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,717
You can only see
one person's face clearly?

564
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,019
I mean...

565
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,955
Does that really make no sense?

566
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,623
It doesn't.

567
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,159
With the damaged area in your brain,

568
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,861
you should not recognize any faces at all.

569
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,630
It doesn't make sense
to recognize a certain face.

570
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,999
Then what's going on?

571
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,036
-Is she bald?
-No.

572
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,771
-Does she have a big mole?
-No.

573
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,940
Then is it Chanel No. 5?

574
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,677
Does she wear a lot of perfume?

575
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,112
Does she wear the same uniform every day?

576
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,017
She doesn't wear a uniform,

577
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,520
but she does wear
pretty much the same clothes

578
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,889
every day.

579
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,726
There's another possibility.

580
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,394
What is it?

581
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,196
An imprint.

582
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,266
An imprint?

583
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,104
The hairstyle, bags, and clothes
she wears every day

584
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,573
are imprinted in your mind,

585
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,375
and it helps you recognize her.

586
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,311
It's not your eyes that see her face.

587
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:10,348
It's your brain that's imprinted with her.

588
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,484
"This person wears this perfume."

589
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,486
"This woman always wears a red cardigan."

590
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,055
It's like when thinking of a mustache

591
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,459
makes you remember Charlie Chaplin's face.

592
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,441
Now that I think of it,

593
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,944
whenever she was with me,

594
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,613
she was wearing a red cardigan.

595
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,226
Hello, Mr. Do.

596
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,572
May I ask what you're doing?

597
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,847
Mr. Do, what are you doing?

598
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,124
Ms. Jeong.

599
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,226
-Take off your clothes.
-Pardon?

600
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,497
Mr. Do.

601
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:09,500
This counts as sexual harassment.

602
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,634
Then

603
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,136
put on more clothes.

604
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,007
Let me see. Put this on.

605
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,742
There you go.

606
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,178
Put this tie on too.

607
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,815
Put it on.

608
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,851
Take off your glasses.

609
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,186
Change shoes too.

610
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,290
Put on these shoes instead.

611
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,025
Can you put your hair down?

612
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:36,994
I'll give you three minutes.

613
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,464
Tell me when you're done.

614
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,344
Who would've known
being a secretary would be this hard?

615
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,090
I'm done. You can come in.

616
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,284
Ms. Jeong.

617
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,729
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

618
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,599
No, I'm not.

619
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,568
I'm not feeling well at all.

620
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,237
Fate, my foot.

621
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:28,939
Ms. Jeong.

622
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,909
Well... Our contract...

623
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,911
-It's not--
-Oh, our contract?

624
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:38,148
I thought you might change your mind.

625
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,518
So I just had it notarized.

626
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,656
Ta-da.

627
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,432
That's smart. That's very smart.

628
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,672
Please don't do this to me.

629
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,476
I'm crying even more than when Mom died.

630
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,879
Oh, yes.

631
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,349
A table for two at 9 p.m.
under the name of T&T Mobile.

632
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,751
-Also...
-I said,

633
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,719
I'm not bringing any darn pickles.

634
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,122
Shut up. You better have
only instant rice and pickles

635
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,623
for every meal.

636
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,925
You can't spend all your money eating out

637
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,994
and ask Gal-hee to send more money.

638
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,796
Be quiet, guys.

639
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:28,265
I've checked everything else on the menu,

640
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,901
but can you tell me what will be served
as an amuse-bouche?

641
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,037
Amuse what?

642
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,039
As you may know,

643
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,107
the chef decides what to serve every day.

644
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,611
I know that, but my boss

645
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,746
has a very bad allergy to peanuts.

646
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,983
Can you at least tell me if any peanuts

647
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,785
will be used in the menu that day?

648
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,654
Okay. Thank you.

649
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,858
Do you even know what amuse-whatever is?

650
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,593
I don't.

651
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,097
And I never will.

652
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,766
Why not? Let's buy some and try.

653
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:05,469
I'm afraid we can't.

654
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,604
You can't just

655
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,007
order it and try it that easily.

656
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,810
An amuse-bouche is
a part of a French course dinner

657
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:17,147
where the chef showcases the restaurant's
very best flavors.

658
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,951
In other words, you can only have it

659
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,121
when you have a top-notch course meal

660
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:26,356
at a top-notch restaurant.

661
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,493
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

662
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,695
It's because of the onion.

663
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,832
Nam-hee,

664
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,402
study abroad and become a person
who can enjoy amuse-bouches.

665
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,672
Don't become a person who has to ask about
an amuse-bouche for someone else.

666
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,340
Okay? Got it?

667
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,342
You're pathetic.

668
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:48,879
Not everyone is a top student.

669
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,282
Eat it, you silly girl.

670
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:53,484
What did you say?

671
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,219
Why would you throw that at me?

672
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,554
-I just wanted to give it to you.
-Peel this.

673
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,156
Stop crying.

674
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,526
You're taking the girls to a club tonight?

675
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,128
It must be pretty expensive.

676
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,996
I owe them a lot.

677
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,532
They even threw a goodbye party
for me when I got fired.

678
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,235
But

679
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,505
something happened
to my secretary, Ms. Lee.

680
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,839
So I left.

681
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,112
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

682
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,315
What were you doing
when we were having a goodbye party?

683
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,518
What?

684
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,587
Se-yeong said you were coming too,

685
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,055
but you never did.

686
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,027
I was meaning to,

687
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:38,529
but my mom suddenly got sick,

688
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,831
so I had to go visit her. I'm sorry.

689
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,700
You went to visit your mother?
In Hwangcheon?

690
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:44,768
Yes.

691
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,539
Mr. Gi said

692
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,608
he left because
something happened to Ms. Lee.

693
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:55,612
But Ms. Lee was visiting her mother?

694
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,188
You get off work early these days.

695
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,660
Yes, I've tamed my boss completely.

696
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,929
I get off work at 8 p.m.

697
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,197
and take weekends off.

698
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,866
I get an hour of lunch break
every day too.

699
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,036
Are you sure you've tamed him?

700
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,071
Not the other way around?

701
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,207
That's just normal.

702
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,808
Taking weekends off

703
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,443
and getting off work on time.

704
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,813
You're being so happy for getting
what you were supposed to have anyway.

705
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,648
To me, it seems like
you've been tamed by him,

706
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,917
not the other way around.

707
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:38,288
Your boss has impressive skills.

708
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:42,226
Pretending to be generous while giving you

709
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,328
only the basic things you deserve anyway.

710
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,564
Turning your legitimate rights
into something to get excited about.

711
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,144
A high-pitched voice.

712
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:05,148
Fancy clothes. High heels.

713
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,284
With this information,

714
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,120
I'll be able to recognize her
without seeing her face, right?

715
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,326
I already told her the reservation was

716
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,195
under the name of T&T Mobile.

717
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,231
Everything will probably be fine
as long as you find the right table.

718
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,536
"Probably"?

719
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,541
Do you know who Veronica Park is?

720
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,778
She has the whole movie world
under her thumb.

721
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,914
Even if I'll never see her again,

722
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,982
I can't afford to get
on the wrong side of her.

723
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:40,918
What do you know?

724
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,724
So there is someone you're scared of.

725
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:55,132
I thought you treated everyone
in the world the way you treat me.

726
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:56,800
What?

727
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:00,470
Nothing.

728
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,510
You'd better leave early.

729
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,179
There's a protest going on at Gwanghwamun.

730
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,181
The traffic is really bad.

731
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,284
See you.

732
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,523
What's with her?

733
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,265
-No way.
-It's true.

734
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,267
Sorry I'm late, guys.

735
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,703
-Hey!
-Hey!

736
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,572
Gosh. What?

737
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,742
Are you going to dig up sweet potatoes
or pick mugworts?

738
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,811
You want to go to a club
looking like this?

739
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:43,947
I'm wearing contacts
instead of my glasses.

740
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:50,153
You said we'd have a blast.
But in that rag?

741
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,956
What you should've taken off is
that darn cardigan, not your glasses!

742
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,460
Is it that bad?

743
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:57,694
-I'm dizzy.
-Se-yeong.

744
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,564
There are some clothes in the paper bag.
Change her into whatever.

745
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,033
Gosh.

746
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,635
Do I even have to dress her now?

747
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:09,039
Take that cardigan off right now.
It kills my imagination.

748
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,774
-Throw it away.
-Please.

749
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,421
What should we do?

750
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:26,990
You might be a little late.

751
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,764
-It's that place, right?
-Yes.

752
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,266
I'll get off here.

753
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,634
It'll be faster if I run.

754
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,255
-Exactly.
-I told you.

755
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,761
Take it easy.

756
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,196
You can't stop me.

757
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,131
This isn't about you anymore.

758
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:10,600
This is a battle
between me and your eyebrows.

759
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,471
How funny. This is giving me
a strange sense of accomplishment.

760
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:18,608
Do I even have to put earrings on her now?

761
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,481
I wonder if he's arrived.

762
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,183
The traffic is supposed to be really bad.

763
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:47,537
MS. JEONG

764
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,374
-Why isn't he picking up?
-The person you dialed...

765
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,816
I'm calling from T&T Mobile.
Has Ms. Park left?

766
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,885
I'm sure she's already arrived.

767
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,987
Her last appointment was in Samseong-dong,

768
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,256
so he went straight to the Princess Hotel.

769
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:07,891
Pardon?

770
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:09,159
-Hey!
-Hey!

771
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,161
Why the Princess Hotel?

772
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:14,264
I clearly said the Kingdom Hotel!

773
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,100
Right? That's what I heard too.

774
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,236
But Ms. Park insisted
it was the Princess Hotel.

775
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,804
Darn it.

776
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:24,975
-Gal-hee!
-Gal-hee!

777
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,557
Nice to meet you. I'm Veronica Park.

778
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:45,996
Nice to meet you.

779
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,031
I'm Gi Dae-ju of T&T Mobile.

780
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,599
Gi Dae-ju?

781
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,442
What happened?

782
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,012
That's what I want to ask you.

783
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,947
Why are you at the Princess Hotel?
I clearly said

784
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,016
the Kingdom Hotel.

785
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,024
T&T Mobile will contact you.

786
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:19,563
Try to behave this time,

787
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:21,364
okay?

788
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,770
I never say no to guys.

789
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,172
Do Min-ik.

790
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,051
Ms. Park, I'm Sim Hae-yong of T&T Mobile.

791
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,653
I've been waiting.

792
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,854
Really?

793
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,026
I'd like to set you up with a guy
I'm very fond of.

794
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,668
How about the Princess Hotel
at 9 p.m. on the 13th?

795
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,838
Okay. I'll be on time.

796
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,079
So who's this amazing boss of yours?

797
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,882
I work for Mr. Do Min-ik of T&T Mobile.

798
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,288
Now I know what happened.

799
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,257
There must have been a mistake.

800
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:21,925
Let me find Mr. Do

801
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,094
and tell him you'll be a bit late.

802
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,195
No.

803
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:35,071
Every mistake can be turned into a tango.

804
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,474
Have I told you
that's my favorite movie quote?

805
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,777
What about it though?

806
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,347
I thought it suited
the situation perfectly.

807
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,850
I might have gotten all tangled up,

808
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,254
but I have a feeling
this dance will be a lot of fun.

809
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,458
You find your way
out of this tangle now. See you.

810
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,263
Ms. Park! Hello?

811
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,241
Gosh, why did these two
have to get tangled up now?

812
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,012
I nagged him so much

813
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,315
to show up prepared.

814
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,217
I'll go there

815
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,520
and tell him the truth.

816
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,831
Excuse me.

817
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,633
If you have to wait a bit longer,

818
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,436
would you like an amuse-bouche
and some bread served first?

819
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,673
-Yes, please.
-Sure.

820
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:50,880
I'm so sorry, guys.

821
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,049
The old man just left.

822
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,385
I can get there in 10 minutes by taxi.

823
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,953
Stay right there, all of you.

824
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:01,157
I have so much information
to get out of Gal-hee tonight.

825
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:03,960
Jeong-su?

826
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,500
Jeong-su.

827
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,769
What are you doing here?

828
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,239
You can't be here!

829
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,985
I've been waiting for you.

830
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,388
Pardon?

831
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:16,566
Sometimes, one minute
can change everything.

832
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:40,590
That moment, I felt a sudden urge
to sit in the chair

833
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,625
he pulled out for me.

834
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,830
Here's today's amuse-bouche.

835
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,739
I also wanted to taste an amuse-bouche

836
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,210
I thought I'd never get to taste
in my life.

837
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,544
And...

838
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,920
I wanted to know

839
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,526
how this man would treat a woman

840
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,095
who wasn't me.

841
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,300
Right.

842
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,571
I'm sorry I forgot to introduce myself.

843
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,041
Nice to meet you.

844
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,347
I'm Do Min-ik.

845
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,386
Thank you for everything.

846
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:49,592
That was

847
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:53,730
the minute that changed my life.

848
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:01,971
Nice to meet you.

849
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,440
I'm Veronica Park.

850
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,999
Why are you staring at me like that?

851
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,603
It's just that you're quite different
from what I expected.

852
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:36,406
Give me Veronica Park's phone number.

853
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,841
So give me that guy's phone number.

854
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,379
I found it, Boss.

855
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,149
Who are you? No way. Is it you?

856
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,150
No!

857
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,787
