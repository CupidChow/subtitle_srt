1
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,645
Here she comes.

2
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,457
Will I see her face?

3
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:02,962
I will.

4
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
I do.

5
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,143
What?

6
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,548
What's wrong again?

7
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:23,783
My gosh.

8
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,459
Damn it!

9
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,098
What's wrong? Are you all right?

10
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,935
Well...

11
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,006
Please come over here.

12
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,010
Was this how Ms. Jeong was standing?

13
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,947
Like this?

14
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,785
Or... Was it like this?

15
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,088
What are you doing?

16
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:04,891
What?

17
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,595
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,532
We haven't seen in a long time,
but I was being rude.

19
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,170
It's okay.

20
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,907
I'm here to say something
to disappoint you anyway.

21
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,343
What? What do you mean?

22
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,514
I was going to say it over the phone,
but I didn't want to be rude

23
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,149
since our families are close.

24
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,120
I, Veronica Park, am seeing someone else.

25
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,457
So tell your mom, Chairwoman Sim

26
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,625
about this.

27
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,795
That our relationship has come to an end.

28
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,399
All right then.

29
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,301
Wait.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,336
Who is that guy?

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,005
Is he rich?

32
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,540
Is he competent?

33
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,477
Or is he more handsome than I am?

34
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,351
To me, he is.

35
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,127
All right then. Bye.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,670
It's done. I seemed very natural.

37
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,741
Is he hurt a lot?

38
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,913
He was just standing there speechless.

39
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,385
Don't look back, Jeong Gal-hee.

40
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,554
If you do,

41
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,358
you will never be
able to go back to Mr. Do.

42
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:02,942
How about just one day together?

43
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,979
Actually, it would be only for half a day
at most.

44
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,881
Just for 12 hours from now on.

45
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,350
What?

46
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,752
Have an affair with me.

47
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,888
Mr. Do Min-ik.

48
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,625
Only for exactly 12 hours from now on.

49
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,928
If you don't change your mind

50
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,530
within the given time,

51
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,568
I'll let you go
with no regret or resentment.

52
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,071
If you want, I'll erase

53
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,843
all the memories about you.

54
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,412
It will be as if

55
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,383
we have never even met.

56
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,263
So are you saying
you've set the timer for 12 hours?

57
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,065
What about her face?

58
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,067
You didn't see it at all?

59
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,835
I did.

60
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,405
Only her lips.

61
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,509
I just can't see more than that.

62
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,345
Drinking, cycling, and wearing stockings.

63
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,816
Nothing has worked.
What am I supposed to do now?

64
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,184
Do you

65
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,820
really have to try something else?

66
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,002
Dr. Gu might be right.

67
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,039
I want to see her face
more than anything else,

68
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,974
but just to see it for one minute,

69
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,944
I don't want to waste
my last moments with her

70
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,246
trying to increase my blood pressure.

71
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,055
I'll just try

72
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,926
to love and adore her
for the rest of the time.

73
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,362
Then I might be

74
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,265
able to see her face at some point,
just like a gift.

75
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,071
It's only for 12 hours, Mom.

76
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,143
Can I stay as his woman,
not as his secretary

77
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,179
during that time?

78
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,583
Then I will let him go with no regret.

79
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,686
It will be as if

80
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,956
we have never even met.

81
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,662
So...

82
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,000
What should we do to have an affair?

83
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,838
What?

84
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,609
It's folded.

85
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,944
It's okay. It's just a small cut.

86
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,049
This is...

87
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,620
A bandage like this is not common, is it?

88
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,222
It looks the same.

89
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,324
It's very common.

90
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,427
It's in trend these days.

91
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,295
Well...

92
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,464
Is it really popular?

93
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,167
But it's the same finger as well.

94
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,671
And the way it's wrinkled is the same too.
How can everything be exactly the same?

95
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,006
Well...

96
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,446
Now it feels like we're having an affair.

97
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,449
Are you okay with this?

98
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,452
Yes. I'm okay.

99
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,992
My heart is beating quite fast.

100
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,700
Where should we go now?

101
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,136
I think we need a car

102
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,938
to go around all night.

103
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,774
So I asked my driver to come over here.

104
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,809
Who?

105
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,446
There he is.

106
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,885
No...

107
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,398
I want to be alone with you.

108
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,802
Okay.

109
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,606
Now that we're having an affair,

110
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,908
I want it to be just the two of us.

111
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,244
Can we do that?

112
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,219
Hello, Mr. Eun.

113
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,355
Something's

114
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,624
suddenly come up.

115
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,061
You may go home now.

116
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,466
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

117
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,368
Okay.

118
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,623
This is just the beginning,

119
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,626
but I'm feeling a little nervous already.

120
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,865
Is there any place
where I can find some peace of mind?

121
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,333
Just tell me anything you want.

122
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,870
You can use me to go somewhere
you couldn't go with the guy.

123
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,140
Or you can ask me to do something
the guy didn't do for you.

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,309
If there's something

125
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,643
you've always wanted to try,

126
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,813
you're welcome to use me
to do such things.

127
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,483
Something I've always wanted to try?

128
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,587
I have one.

129
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,356
Abusing my power.

130
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,064
Here.

131
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,773
It's so delicious.

132
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,813
All you wanted to do is
let someone make coffee for you?

133
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,415
If you want some really nice coffee,

134
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,618
I can find a cafe
that's open for 24 hours.

135
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,852
No.

136
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,356
That's not the coffee

137
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,292
I want to drink now.

138
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,027
This is what I want.

139
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,264
With two spoonful of sugar
and one spoonful of coffee.

140
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,034
It has to be made by someone else.

141
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,138
Sitting at a desk wiped by someone else

142
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,041
and wearing shoes
polished by someone else,

143
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,745
I want to drink coffee

144
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,749
that's made by someone else.
How great is that?

145
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,721
It sounds like something
you've done your whole life.

146
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,126
That's true,

147
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,030
but I never get tired of it.
Do you not know that?

148
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,870
If that's what you want,
I know where we should go.

149
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,018
No. We can't go in there.

150
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,655
Apparently, what you want to do is

151
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,323
abusing your power in an office.

152
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,525
This is

153
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,727
the best place to do that.

154
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,431
Me getting into this building is like

155
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,966
putting my toes on a threshold

156
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,169
and putting my fingers on a cutting board.

157
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,370
Why?

158
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,672
Are you afraid people would recognize you?

159
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,911
Look.

160
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,747
Do you see the window over there?

161
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,718
I know pretty well about this company.

162
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,154
If my secretary and I are off work,

163
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,157
it means no one else is in the office.

164
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,260
So you're aware of that.

165
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,498
Sorry?

166
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,269
Nothing. I still don't think
this is a good idea.

167
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,038
Let's go.

168
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,477
Did you catch a cold? That's not good.

169
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,880
I got caught in the rain,
so my clothes are wet.

170
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,917
Oh, right. I think my secretary
keeps an extra suit in the office.

171
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,152
That's right. I do.

172
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,222
What?

173
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,727
I bet she has an extra suit in the office.

174
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,662
This is driving me crazy.

175
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,333
I can't tell him that it's in the cabinet.

176
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,436
It's okay. It will dry soon.

177
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,343
I think you should get changed.

178
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,414
Gosh. But this place is just...

179
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,687
Well... Will you excuse me for a moment?

180
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,422
I need to make a phone call.

181
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,891
Okay.

182
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,331
Be careful of the surveillance camera
at 11 o'clock in clock position.

183
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,581
Let's go.

184
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,794
Gosh, you startled me.

185
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,130
What should we do? It's Gal-hee.

186
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,665
Just answer it.

187
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,338
Gal... Gal-hee.

188
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,975
I'm home.

189
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,845
The others?

190
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,983
They all went home.

191
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:12,551
So you mean

192
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,287
there's no one on the 37th floor?

193
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,789
Sure.

194
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,558
But why do you ask?

195
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,628
You're not coming back

196
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,930
to the office, are you?

197
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,099
No, of course not!

198
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,942
I forgot to feed the fish.

199
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,344
So I wanted to ask you a favor.

200
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,248
By the way,
why are you stuttering like that?

201
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,118
Are you still in the office?

202
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,554
Gosh, no.

203
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,624
Hey, I'm the one
who can never skip a meal, not the fish.

204
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,327
I'm sure the fish is fine. Don't worry.

205
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,730
I'll see you tomorrow.

206
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,498
Bye.

207
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,647
This way, please.

208
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,582
Okay.

209
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,102
Min-ik.

210
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,904
It's Gal-hee.

211
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,306
Gosh, what do we do?

212
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,241
Hey, hide.

213
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,013
You don't know where it is.
What's the rush?

214
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,059
Why is that in the middle of the corridor?

215
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,719
This is why I love the law.

216
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,188
Whether one is bad or crazy,

217
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,323
I can make him come running right away.

218
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,426
Do you like me?

219
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,500
Well... Don't you think

220
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,602
it'd be unfair if a woman like me
who has everything

221
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,171
including money, good parents,
and good looks

222
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,906
also has love?

223
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,310
I just have fun with a guy

224
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,245
I'm interested in and break up.

225
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,346
Love is

226
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,583
just for ordinary people who need it.

227
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,552
That's how I'm practicing
the life of noblesse oblige.

228
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,588
Does it answer your question?

229
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:05,858
You risked your position of CEO
for a guy you don't even like.

230
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,994
Is it part of noblesse oblige then?

231
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,566
I must say it's kind of confidence.

232
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,935
I think I will be

233
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,538
able to get reappointed
even without Mr. Sim's stocks.

234
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,740
I'm sorry if I misunderstood you.

235
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,044
I understand that you were
just being considerate.

236
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,846
I get that you're getting a meal
for your 100,000 stocks for fun.

237
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,782
But I still think

238
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,984
risking your position of CEO
is quite a big deal.

239
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,453
For someone like me,

240
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,688
it's just hard to understand
if it's not about love.

241
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,164
The bigger the stake,
the more exciting it gets.

242
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,541
If you're done, shall we get going?

243
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,056
What are you doing?

244
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,525
Are you leaving just like that?

245
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,198
To be honest, I was afraid
that you might lose your position

246
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,799
because of me.

247
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,835
Fortunately, that's not going to happen.

248
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,270
So I think I should say
goodbye to you here.

249
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,372
Say goodbye?

250
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,508
We should start hanging out now.

251
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,276
I don't hang out with a woman.

252
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,711
Are you a saint or what?

253
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,314
Why are you so chaste?

254
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,486
This bike. I've used it
since I was in high school.

255
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,522
This backpack. I've used it
since I was in college.

256
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,225
I only buy things that I can use
for more than ten years.

257
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,295
And I only hang out with a woman
whom I'll keep in touch even after I die.

258
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,764
So are you saying

259
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,435
you at least see me as a woman?

260
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,837
Yes.

261
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,210
I think you are a cool woman.

262
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,249
Some try to use other people
to keep their positions.

263
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,819
But you risked your position to help me.

264
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,623
If I get to run my own business,
I want to be a CEO like you.

265
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,725
If I date someone,

266
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,694
I want to meet a woman like you.

267
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,531
Then you should have fun with me.

268
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,466
I mean I want to get to know you better.

269
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,868
It doesn't mean
I want to hang out with you.

270
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,805
Most guys love it
when I hang out with them

271
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,641
spending my money.

272
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,942
I forgot to tell you this.

273
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,745
I'm going to leave the company next month.

274
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,949
Still, I'd like you to review
the project proposal I gave you.

275
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,686
I only say hi, but never say bye.

276
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,423
If you insist on leaving, just go ahead.

277
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,625
Thank you for everything.

278
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,941
I'm going to stay

279
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,110
in my office all night.

280
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,889
It has just arrived, Ms. Lee.

281
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,894
What took you so long?

282
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,163
Did something happen on your way here?

283
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,397
The thing is...

284
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,345
Min-ik, hurry.

285
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,734
We saw Gal-hee on the way... Gosh.

286
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,339
Nothing happened, Ms. Lee. Don't worry.

287
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,475
Are you sure?

288
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,983
Do you want to check this thing?

289
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,326
No. Yes.

290
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,595
You don't have to worry.

291
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,508
From up here,

292
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,644
everything seems so small.

293
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,947
Thanks to you, I found it immediately.

294
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,417
How did you know where it was?

295
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:05,057
It was in a place that's easy to find.

296
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,797
Please have a seat here.

297
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,433
What?

298
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,424
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

299
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:45,330
What are you doing?

300
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,768
Sitting at a desk wiped by someone else.

301
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,508
In a blanket

302
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,344
someone else puts around you.

303
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,724
And wearing shoes
polished by someone else.

304
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,192
That's what you wanted.

305
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,734
I don't like

306
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,503
that you're doing this to someone else.

307
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,105
Someone else?

308
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,274
I'm doing it for you.

309
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:36,648
But the thing is

310
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,885
I'm not really who I am now.

311
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,697
What do you like about that guy?

312
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,239
It's not like I liked him
from the beginning.

313
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,308
But...

314
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,710
I saw something in him.

315
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,980
He was about to collapse,

316
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,516
but he got through it without giving up.

317
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,787
As you might know, I, Veronica Park,

318
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,124
have grown up lacking nothing.

319
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,394
So I don't know much
about difficulties in life.

320
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,897
But someone told me this.

321
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,501
When one is having a hard time,
what raises him up is

322
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,370
not money nor connections.

323
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,806
It's people.

324
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,915
I wanted to stay with him.

325
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,887
He seems to have everything,

326
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,025
but he doesn't have good people
around him.

327
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,430
Gosh.

328
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,334
I'm so jealous of him.

329
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,712
Now that we're here,
we should feed the arowana.

330
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,949
It seems very hungry.

331
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,253
Do you know about arowana?

332
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,557
I know it very well.

333
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,361
Apparently it brings
good luck or something.

334
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,999
Someone I know treasures it so much.

335
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,834
Even more than his own secretary.

336
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,270
My father left it to me.

337
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:43,475
He said his business went well
after he got this fish.

338
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,611
He treasured it when he was alive.

339
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:48,280
You know it.

340
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:52,017
No one in my family is
related to me by blood.

341
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,553
What?

342
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,022
What?

343
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,262
I guess my mother didn't tell you.

344
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,332
Since this is about marriage,

345
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,735
I thought she would've told you.

346
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,307
I'm not Chairwoman Sim's

347
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,777
real son.

348
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,084
Are you disappointed?

349
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,520
Gosh, no.

350
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,122
It's not like that.

351
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,327
Then...

352
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,564
who's your real mom?

353
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,835
I came here when I was seven,
so I don't remember much about her.

354
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,773
I was born out of wedlock,
and I'm like a cuckoo chick.

355
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,609
I heard that a lot.

356
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,348
So I guess it was one of the women
my father had an affair with.

357
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,085
I'm sorry I asked.

358
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,390
I thought you cherished it
just because it is worth 100 million won.

359
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,525
Shall we feed it first?

360
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,827
Gosh, no.

361
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:14,566
That's not how you abuse your power.

362
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,903
Please stay seated.
I'll go and get the food.

363
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,090
I can see him very well from here.

364
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:47,966
Did he

365
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,637
ever look at me
like I'm looking at him now?

366
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,842
CALL PLANNING TEAM 2

367
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,744
DON'T FORGET TO CLEAN
THE FISH TANK TOMORROW

368
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,785
Ms. Jeong doesn't have to do this.

369
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,503
Yes, Boss.

370
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,339
Did you check the message?

371
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,508
No.

372
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,111
I think I should take care of it first.

373
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,085
It's quite chilly at night.

374
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:47,192
I think we should go to some place warm.

375
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,462
It's 2 a.m. now.

376
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,832
Where should we go to warm ourselves

377
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,202
and lie down and relax at this hour?

378
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,676
Are you asking me to go there with you?

379
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,754
In this place,

380
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,224
everyone wears the same outfits.

381
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,160
Did you not mean
that you wanted to go to a sauna?

382
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,729
In this place, everyone wears...

383
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:28,233
Oh, right. He can't recognize
people wearing the same outfits.

384
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,636
Well... Let me tie your hair.

385
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,684
It's 99. That's the number
I should remember.

386
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,588
It's done.

387
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,860
I'm suddenly feeling thirsty.

388
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,896
I'll go and buy something to drink.

389
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,906
What? Gosh.

390
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,345
Darn it.

391
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,052
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

392
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,656
Let me see. What should I buy?

393
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,393
Please wait.

394
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:34,666
I think I know her.

395
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,972
-Thank you.
-No problem.

396
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,476
Oh, that's right. She's the secretary.

397
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,281
Darn it. Will you be careful?

398
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,917
-Excuse me.
-Do Min-ik.

399
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,021
Do you know me?

400
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,825
It's me. Your doctor, Gu Seok-chan.

401
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:04,229
What? What are you doing here?

402
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,531
I have to perform surgery
at early morning,

403
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,132
so I came here for a nap.

404
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,136
By the way, did you not say
that you can recognize your secretary?

405
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,873
Yes, I can. Why?

406
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,875
Is your secretary

407
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,776
the woman you set the timer for?

408
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,678
She was buying something at the snack bar.

409
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,380
Ms. Jeong?

410
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,650
You should pay with your key.

411
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,452
Okay. Hang on a second.

412
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,521
Here.

413
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,157
See? She's right over there.

414
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,469
Okay. I'll be right there.

415
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,008
I wish I could see the girl
you have a crush on.

416
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,609
I should go for surgery now.

417
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,412
Call me as soon as your time is up. Okay?

418
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,713
-Yes.
-Bye.

419
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,362
Why is he coming?

420
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,399
-Min--
-Ms. Jeong?

421
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,236
Did he recognize me?

422
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,238
It's you, Ms. Jeong. Right?

423
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,240
What should I say?

424
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,842
How did he know it's me?

425
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,144
This is strange.

426
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,680
Dr. Gu said

427
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,281
it was her.

428
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,849
Hello, Mr. Do.

429
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,322
Did you just ignore me?

430
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,125
Because I can't recognize you
when you're dressed like that?

431
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,061
What are you talking about?

432
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,330
I'm not wearing my glasses

433
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,131
as I don't want to damage
the lenses in the sauna.

434
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,667
Who did you come here with at this hour?

435
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,970
-Of course I'm alone--
-That's not true.

436
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,404
You bought two drinks.

437
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,308
I was going to come alone,

438
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,677
-but someone wanted to tag along.
-Who?

439
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,280
Is it a guy?

440
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:06,484
Well... Kind of.

441
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,519
I'm seeing someone.

442
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,994
Do you see the guy over there?

443
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,562
Right there.

444
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,699
As you can see, he's sound asleep.

445
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,268
So I'm afraid
I can't introduce him to you.

446
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:28,639
So I hope you have fun here.

447
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:29,907
Bye then.

448
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,350
It's number 99. I'm sure

449
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,586
it's Veronica Park's key.

450
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,590
What? He remembers my number?

451
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,658
Why is this key on your wrist?

452
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,328
Well...

453
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,798
-I met her.
-What?

454
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,666
I just ran into her.

455
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:59,470
She gave me this key
and told me to buy something to eat.

456
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,774
I was wondering who she was with,
and it was you.

457
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,979
So where did she go?

458
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,816
She said she'd go to the ladies' room.

459
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,487
That's right. The one around the corner.

460
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,656
-Around the corner?
-It's over there.

461
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,392
She just got
into the herbal medicine room.

462
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,794
You should go.

463
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,829
Oh, wait.

464
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,633
Please bring this to her.

465
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,268
Bye then.

466
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,196
Gosh, it's hot.

467
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,536
Min-ik.

468
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,544
You said you'd buy something to drink.
What are you doing here?

469
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,849
The clean energy of the crystals

470
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:21,385
quenches my thirst.

471
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,721
I just met my secretary--

472
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,289
I know.

473
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,759
I just found out

474
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,863
that your secretary is Jeong Gal-hee.

475
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,132
Right. Here.

476
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,733
Thanks.

477
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,273
By the way, will you
stay here for a moment?

478
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,674
I have something to tell my secretary.

479
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,842
No.

480
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,748
Don't you think

481
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,417
you can talk to her

482
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,887
tomorrow at work?

483
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,623
I'm sorry.

484
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,458
It won't take long. I'll be right back.

485
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,864
Darn it.

486
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,067
What else does he want to tell me?

487
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,321
-Were you looking for me?
-You startled me.

488
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,123
It's me, Ms. Jeong.

489
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,594
How did you know I was looking for you?

490
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,298
You always look for me.

491
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,568
Why? Is there anything
you want to tell me?

492
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,069
Well...

493
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,606
Where can you buy pebbles?

494
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,840
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

495
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,644
You know why. Even if you go home now,
it'll be about 4 or 5 a.m.

496
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,581
If you buy pebbles on your way to work,

497
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,416
it will interfere with your work tomorrow.

498
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,984
Send me a text

499
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,719
about where you buy pebbles.

500
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,888
I'll buy them on my way to work tomorrow.

501
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:08,159
It's nothing important. What's the rush?

502
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,629
By the way, the guy you are seeing

503
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,698
is sleeping for too long.

504
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,602
-Hey, wake up.
-Gosh.

505
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,275
Why would you wake him up?

506
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,711
He's just sleeping the whole time
after bringing you here.

507
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,747
Do you seriously think
that it's a bad thing to wake him up?

508
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,282
Why are you mad at me?

509
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:35,586
He's just sleeping because
he's tired. Can't you see that?

510
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,090
Gosh. Just go. Get going.

511
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,762
Ask him to take you home.

512
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,198
I know you won't wake him up,

513
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,566
but don't go home by yourself.

514
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,802
-Darn it.
-My gosh.

515
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,310
Stay focused, Gal-hee.

516
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,580
You're now Veronica Park again.

517
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,951
Do, re, mi, fa, sol

518
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,653
Sol

519
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,237
Did you talk to your secretary?

520
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,106
Yes.

521
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,110
Then why do you look upset?

522
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,581
Did she make a mistake or something?

523
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,551
No. It's not like that.

524
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:42,920
Well...

525
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,456
She just doesn't like me.

526
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,924
She doesn't like you?

527
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:49,860
Right.

528
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,763
I like you.

529
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,601
I recently gave her
a new contract for renewal.

530
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,303
But she didn't like it.

531
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,640
She just wants to quit.

532
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,410
I want to stay.

533
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,549
Well... Mr. Do.

534
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,420
I know Gal-hee better than anyone.

535
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:19,990
If she wants to quit,

536
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,160
that's not because she hates you.

537
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,263
I think that's because she hates herself.

538
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,334
When she decides to leave someone,

539
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,838
it doesn't mean she hates that person.

540
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,740
She just hates herself.

541
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,945
She wants to stay,
but she has to run away.

542
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,382
Even if she likes the person,

543
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,985
but she has to hate him.

544
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:51,055
Sometimes things like that happen.

545
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,692
So why don't you

546
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,063
try to understand her?

547
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,000
I'm pretty sure

548
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,803
Gal-hee is feeling bad for you.

549
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,875
I wonder

550
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:14,345
why there are such rumors about you.

551
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,715
You're so considerate

552
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,317
and warm-hearted.

553
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,490
Gosh, why am I feeling so sleepy?

554
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,628
I ran around too much today.

555
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,169
Here.

556
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,943
Get some sleep.

557
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,618
I'm Veronica Park.

558
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,455
I'm not a person who takes a nap

559
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,457
in a shabby place like this.

560
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,763
Her legs.

561
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,066
Her arms.

562
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,201
Her hair.

563
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,103
I can see them all.

564
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,306
But I can never see her face.

565
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,077
I wish I could see it
only for ten seconds.

566
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,813
Only for ten seconds.

567
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,330
It's 70,000 won for a full body massage,
and 50,000 for a foot massage.

568
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,432
I'm Korean.

569
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,051
There's no one in here.
Is that because it's a late-night movie?

570
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,555
I knew it.

571
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,224
At this hour of the day,
someone I know from Cinepark

572
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,892
should be with a guy.

573
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:44,128
She would never be at work.

574
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,199
Gosh, I haven't watched a movie
for such a long time.

575
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,112
No way.

576
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,383
He hasn't opened his bag yet?

577
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,788
I guess he rarely opens his heart
as well as his bag.

578
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,090
You should go now.

579
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,858
The morning is coming soon.

580
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,398
Are you all thumbs?

581
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,467
You were good at writing
the notarized warning,

582
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,202
so I thought you were quite dexterous.

583
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:27,938
Give me that.

584
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,979
All I can do here is
take care of things for guys.

585
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,214
When are you going to teach me how to act?

586
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,117
At this rate, it will take me forever
to make money for my sister.

587
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,319
When it comes to acting,

588
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,289
you should know what life is.

589
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,193
If you work for me only for three months,

590
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,963
you will learn how to live life
like an intensive course--

591
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,798
It's sticking out.

592
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,166
I'm sorry.

593
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,169
Darn it.

594
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,706
Did I just

595
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,642
apologize to you?

596
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:08,112
If you can't do it right, just stay still.
You're just bothering me.

597
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:11,915
Why does it feel like
I'm learning about life from you?

598
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,857
If he comes, send him downstairs.

599
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,193
I'll be

600
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,597
watching a movie there.

601
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,389
No way.

602
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,348
I opened my bag before going out
for exercise in the morning.

603
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,551
And I

604
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,587
found this in my bag.

605
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,290
Oh, I didn't know it was there.

606
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,925
I've been looking all over for it.

607
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,993
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

608
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,497
It was a mistake.

609
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:40,370
Don't you have a lot of guys
around you to hang out with?

610
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,244
I stayed up all night,

611
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:50,047
so my eyelids are growing heavy
with sleep.

612
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,750
Can we get the facts straight later?

613
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,420
I'd like to borrow this first.

614
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,025
Why?

615
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,129
Do you think my head would be too heavy?

616
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,298
I'm afraid my heart
would start beating fast.

617
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,034
If I fall for a cool woman like you,

618
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,437
I don't think I'll be able to handle it.

619
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,850
Are you happy now, Mr. Chastity?

620
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,099
"Offer bread to those who are hungry,

621
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,402
and offer a shoulder
to those who are sleepy."

622
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,205
That's what my grandfather taught me.

623
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,307
I love your grandpa.

624
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,481
Come to think of it,
I forgot to tell you something.

625
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:01,218
How did you end up

626
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,154
being a jerk?

627
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,524
Well... What are you two doing here?

628
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,427
Do you know him?

629
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,330
What?

630
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,704
Get out.

631
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,372
Why all of a sudden?

632
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:59,309
Did you not hear me? Just wait outside.

633
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,882
I'll wait outside.

634
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,191
My hunch was right.

635
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,462
I knew

636
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:23,667
something would happen today.

637
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,403
What on earth is going on?

638
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:29,139
It's all my fault.

639
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,944
And I might have waited
for this to happen.

640
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:37,314
I couldn't deal with it myself,

641
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,784
so I might have wanted someone
to punish me.

642
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,524
But can you please let this slide
only for one day?

643
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,163
Mr. Do and I promised to spend
a certain period of time together,

644
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,768
and I have less than an hour left.

645
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,441
It's something I can never get again.

646
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,848
And this isn't how I want to end it.

647
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,822
I'll tell him everything
when I go to work tomorrow morning.

648
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,625
So please give me just one day.

649
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,987
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

650
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,524
Who was that guy?

651
00:49:58,195 --> 00:49:59,696
I'm Veronica Park.

652
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,066
I know a lot of guys.

653
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,872
-Did they fight?
-Why did he make a woman cry?

654
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,618
Are you

655
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,422
crying right now?

656
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,624
Gosh, well...

657
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,060
The movie was really sad.

658
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,097
Gosh, my heart aches.

659
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,367
The movie we watched

660
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,704
was a comedy...

661
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,007
I guess you interpreted it
in a different way.

662
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,809
Stay here for a moment.

663
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,045
I'll go and get some tissues.

664
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,481
Please don't go.

665
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:03,226
I want to spend
the rest of the time with you

666
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,228
even if it's only for a few seconds.

667
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,797
Can you see me smile?

668
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,141
We have 39 minutes left.

669
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,211
Do you want to go and watch the sunrise?

670
00:51:58,582 --> 00:51:59,716
Yes.

671
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,936
Your feelings for that guy.

672
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:22,906
I guess they haven't changed, right?

673
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,343
I'm sorry, Mr. Do Min-ik.

674
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,913
You made the right choice.

675
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:33,884
You said that earlier.

676
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,086
When you decide to leave someone,

677
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,089
it doesn't mean you hate that person.

678
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,259
It might be because you just hate herself.

679
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:46,429
To be honest,

680
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,967
I can't see your face.

681
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,640
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

682
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,511
I recently got a disease called
prosopagnosia from an accident.

683
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,183
I can't see people's faces.

684
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,353
But I really

685
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,491
wanted to see your face.

686
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:21,565
But

687
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,034
I don't think I'm a good guy.

688
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,271
There was no gift.

689
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:36,079
The guy you chose can
at least feel happy for you

690
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,016
when you smile,

691
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,687
and console you when you cry.

692
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,822
I guess he's like that.

693
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,632
I don't want to talk about it.

694
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,034
Let's do something else.

695
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,006
We have as much as 10 minutes left.

696
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:09,079
Tell me if there's anything
you want to do for 10 minutes.

697
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,880
I'll do anything for you.

698
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,785
You don't want to hear it.

699
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,188
I want to.

700
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,992
It'd be better not to know.

701
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,693
I want to know.

702
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,465
I want to kiss you.

703
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,004
You want to kiss me?

704
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:42,712
Before I get over this disease,
I will never date anyone.

705
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,814
And I won't fall in love with anyone.

706
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:50,620
So you might be
the last woman I ever like.

707
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,624
I want to have

708
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,427
my last kiss in life

709
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,563
with someone I like.

710
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,602
But still, it's not something I can...

711
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,973
I knew it.

712
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,044
It's not something you can do.

713
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,392
So now...

714
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,463
the time is up.

715
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,634
For the past 12 hours I spent with you,

716
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,004
I was happier

717
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,575
than I had ever been.

718
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,680
All right then.

719
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,159
Do it.

720
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,640
Mom.

721
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:22,045
I thought it wouldn't be
so bad to die young.

722
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,816
Because it's the only way
I can see you again.

723
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,753
But now,

724
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,922
I don't think I can ever see you again.

725
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:38,094
I might not be able to make it
to Heaven where you are now.

726
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,231
I'm sorry.

727
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,433
I'm sorry, Mom.

728
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,025
It's just a kiss.

729
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,996
It's no big deal to me, Veronica Park.

730
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,763
A little lower than that.

731
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,768
A little to the side.

732
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,028
SPECIAL THANKS TO WOO HYUN

733
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:38,608
I broke up with Veronica Park.

734
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,044
I have feelings for Mr. Do.

735
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,812
That's too bad.

736
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,781
I should set Ms. Jeong up with someone.

737
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:45,915
No.

738
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,952
Will you be home alone tonight?

739
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,020
Do you want me to stay with you?

740
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,993
