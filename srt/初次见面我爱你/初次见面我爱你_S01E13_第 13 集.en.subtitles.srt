1
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,704
You know what happens when the trust

2
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,206
between a boss and a secretary breaks.

3
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,577
Jeong Gal-hee.

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,649
You're fired.

5
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,063
Have I ever told you

6
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,166
why I helped you?

7
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,703
Do you know about arowana?

8
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,507
I know it very well.

9
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,211
Apparently it brings
good luck or something.

10
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,080
My father left it to me.

11
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,552
There was once a man who cared
more about his fish than his secretary.

12
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,854
How many times do I have to tell you?

13
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,623
I'm going to leave this fish to Min-ik.

14
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,292
I told you to take the utmost care of it!

15
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,693
-I'm sorry, Mr. Do.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,894
Save it by all means.

17
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,864
If it dies, you're both dead meat.

18
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,332
Go and save it!

19
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:44,938
Darn it.

20
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,939
CHAIRMAN DO WAN-BAE

21
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,376
We're bringing the fish to you now.

22
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,112
Yes, we're at the intersection...

23
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,051
Seon-hui.

24
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,324
Save it by all means.

25
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,193
If it dies, you're both dead meat.

26
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,600
Seon-hui!

27
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,411
The secretary died
while trying to save her boss's fish,

28
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,182
but the company refused to acknowledge it
as a workplace accident.

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,420
Reporting it as such would've revealed
that the secretary worked extra hours

30
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,624
and that her boss accepted a fish
worth a hundred million won

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,526
as a bribe.

32
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,562
So I swapped the hundred-million-won fish

33
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,031
for a ten-million-won fish.

34
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,569
-The difference was used to pay...
-Eul-wang.

35
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,737
Where did you get this money?

36
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,672
...the tuition
of the dead secretary's son,

37
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,674
who wasn't compensated by the company.

38
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,245
Euldoguk is an organization
I founded at that time.

39
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,982
We stole dirty money from our bosses

40
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,552
and gave it to employees
who'd been treated unfairly.

41
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,687
-No. Okay.
-Paintings received as bribes

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,389
were replaced with fake ones.

43
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,758
-We also pocketed condolence money
-Here's 100,000 won.

44
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,194
exceeding the legal limit.
That's how we built our fund.

45
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,863
The secretaries of T&T Mobile

46
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,566
who've never been allowed
to take a short break

47
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:23,570
-have finally got the waiting room.
-All our money

48
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,773
was spent on improving the working
conditions of dispatched workers.

49
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,709
That's also how the waiting room
for secretaries and drivers was built.

50
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,745
-So? Darn it.
-When I first heard about you,

51
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,881
-I'll call you back.
-I couldn't turn a blind eye.

52
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,149
Hang up.

53
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,851
Damn.

54
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,057
Hey.

55
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,061
How many times do I have to tell you
not to eat in the car?

56
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,430
I didn't. I know you don't like it,

57
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,365
so I never eat anything in the car.

58
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,867
Then what's this smell?

59
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,270
Could it be coming from the heater?

60
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,105
Are you kidding me?

61
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,574
Do you think I can't tell
when the car smells like food?

62
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,611
What do you take me for? A moron?

63
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,846
Hey!

64
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,048
Hey! Do something!

65
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:23,830
EUN JEONG-SU

66
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,798
What do you mean?

67
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,002
It won't be reported
as a workplace accident?

68
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,703
Mr. Sim is accusing you

69
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,106
of attempted murder.

70
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,141
He told the Workers' Compensation Board

71
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,043
that you caused the accident on purpose

72
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,145
to get back at him for hurting your neck.

73
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,380
What?

74
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,082
Then

75
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,719
who's going to compensate me
for my injured knee?

76
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,289
Hello? Wait...

77
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,733
Are you Mr. Eun Jeong-su?

78
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,470
Who are you?

79
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,141
Ms. Mo Ha-ni told me about you.
I'm Lee Eul-wang.

80
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,787
Euldoguk is paying you
six months' compensation.

81
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,756
It's 10,610,000 won in total.

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,158
I'm not sure

83
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,828
if I should take this.

84
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,862
Please do.

85
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,165
This is what I started
the organization for.

86
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,639
In return for the money,

87
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,774
please let me do something for Euldoguk.

88
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,309
Well...

89
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,145
I'd love to help however I can.

90
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,518
How about you take care of our ledger?

91
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,388
I don't feel comfortable
about keeping it in the company.

92
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,691
Of course. Consider it done, Boss.

93
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,827
"Boss"?

94
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,333
This is a knife used for escaping a car.

95
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,736
Since I started working as a driver at 20,

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,804
I've always carried one

97
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,207
to save myself

98
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,509
in case anything happens.

99
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,545
One boss grabbed me by the hair

100
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,347
for observing traffic signals.

101
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,548
Another boss

102
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,617
threw a cigarette butt at me

103
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,786
for letting a car cut in front of us.

104
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,889
I don't want to serve someone
in a high position

105
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,592
but someone I can respect.

106
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,532
Ha-ni said she'd leave the ledger
at the office.

107
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,534
Wait for me here for a second.

108
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,750
Did Ms. Lee step out?

109
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,954
My flash drive...

110
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,196
Gosh, I told him it was confidential.

111
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,675
Hello, Boss.

112
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,945
It seems like the ledger
got into Mr. Do's hands.

113
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,180
If he sees the file...

114
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,284
Did you say you heard where he was going?

115
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,753
It sounded like he was meeting Dae-ju
at the Han River.

116
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,224
If you lure Mr. Gi away,

117
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,758
I'll get the file.

118
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,662
Is that you?

119
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,565
Well...

120
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,766
If only...

121
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,968
Who are you?

122
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,871
I hadn't gone there
to get the ledger at that time...

123
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,843
I want to turn myself in.

124
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,879
What?

125
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,680
I wanted to help you,

126
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,350
but I only made things worse for you.

127
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,319
Now that Mr. Do has seen the ledger,

128
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,489
it's a matter of time
before Euldoguk gets exposed.

129
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,259
How about I turn myself in

130
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,528
and say I'm responsible for the ledger

131
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,096
and what happened to Mr. Do?

132
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,264
No.

133
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,866
It's the company and Mr. Sim
that should be punished,

134
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,568
not you.

135
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,004
What if

136
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,675
everyone in Euldoguk gets fired?

137
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,649
Because of me,

138
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,654
Mr. Do can't recognize
people's faces anymore.

139
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,957
Why do you think that's your fault?

140
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,661
Mr. Do's father only hired dispatched
workers as drivers and secretaries

141
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,329
to reduce labor costs.

142
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,965
Mr. Sim treated his driver
as less than human.

143
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,700
They're the ones to blame.

144
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,975
I'll do anything to protect Euldoguk.

145
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,378
Take a few days off and get some rest.

146
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,181
I'll be in touch when things settle down.

147
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,623
We'll take an old car from Havana

148
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,759
and drive along the Malecon beach.

149
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,562
After that, we'll end up in a salsa club

150
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,699
and have a glass of mojito.

151
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,302
SANGMO HOSPITAL

152
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,538
What's all this talk about Cuba
all of a sudden?

153
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,440
If you have to go,
take your girlfriend instead.

154
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,542
Haven't you been listening?

155
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,812
I spent the past hour
telling you about my sad love.

156
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,314
That the two women I was in love with

157
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,249
turned out to be the same person.

158
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,686
Still, I couldn't go on vacation to Cuba
when my patients are here.

159
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,221
Then who am I supposed to take with me?

160
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,389
My secretary fooled me.

161
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,691
I ended up suspecting my closest friend.
My family...

162
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,760
has never...

163
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,396
really existed.

164
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,698
Let me see.

165
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,468
I couldn't come to Cuba with you,
but I can have a look at your neck.

166
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,437
By the way,

167
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,041
if the two women you were in love with
turned out to be the same person,

168
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,809
isn't that a good thing?

169
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,211
You think it's a good thing?

170
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,813
That's not the point!

171
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,050
I'm sure she had her reasons.

172
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,687
Whose side are you on?

173
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,423
Fine, I get it.

174
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,393
What a horrible woman.
She deserves to be torn to pieces.

175
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,862
She disgusts me. Are you happy now?

176
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,135
Anyway, you must have taken
your medicine regularly.

177
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,404
Otherwise, you'd be

178
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,105
in a much worse condition now.

179
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,940
Whatever. I'm leaving.

180
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,309
It's not like I have nowhere else to go.

181
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,525
Was this

182
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,728
the only place you could think of?

183
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,886
Here. Take it.

184
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,623
I'm sick of it now.

185
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,366
Yes, Mr. Park.

186
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,803
Do you know Mr. Eun's parents'
phone number or anyone who can help?

187
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,039
I see.

188
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,175
If you hear from him, please let me know.

189
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,411
Thank you.

190
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,414
Who is it?

191
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,073
I heard about it briefly
at the police station.

192
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,276
But Mr. Eun didn't look like a person
who would do such a thing.

193
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,981
Dae-ju, now that you're
quitting the company,

194
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,049
why don't you come to Cuba with me
and learn salsa?

195
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,120
Why would you go to Cuba?

196
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,989
The CEO election is in three days,
remember?

197
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,223
I don't care.

198
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,892
Who cares about the new CEO?

199
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,227
Also, you said you saw the culprit's face.

200
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,730
Then why didn't you recognize
the person who stabbed you

201
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,298
when he came to work as your driver?

202
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,599
Well...

203
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,040
I hurt myself a little.

204
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,909
You hurt yourself?

205
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,512
You know, on the yacht that day...

206
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,283
I hurt my head a little.

207
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,853
A clip that was inserted in my head
when I was seven

208
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,422
slipped or something.

209
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,623
What?

210
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,359
You said you weren't hurt.

211
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,132
-Dae-ju.
-Yes?

212
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,270
Dae-ju.

213
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,772
What?

214
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,542
I...

215
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,080
can't see...

216
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,318
your face.

217
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,754
What?

218
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,690
Your eyes,

219
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,893
nose,

220
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,964
and mouth.

221
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,266
I can't see any of them.

222
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,902
Perhaps

223
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,272
I might have to

224
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,276
live like this for the rest of my life.

225
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,882
You've looked after me since I was seven.

226
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,150
I hate to tell you...

227
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,323
that I'm ill again.

228
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,959
Min-ik.

229
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,561
You know what?

230
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,333
When you can't see a person's face,

231
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,274
it becomes harder
to read the person's mind.

232
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,447
Without seeing the facial expressions,

233
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,054
it's hard to guess
what the person is thinking.

234
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,062
I'm sorry, Dae-ju.

235
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,135
I shouldn't have suspected you

236
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,409
no matter what.

237
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,752
Shall we go out?

238
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,299
Why aren't you here yet?

239
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,275
Are you running late today?

240
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,944
2009 SCHOOL PRESENTATION

241
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,381
Are you coming at all?

242
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,418
Jeong Gal-hee.

243
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,191
You're fired.

244
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,102
Gal-hee, is that you?

245
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,637
Why are you not in bed yet?

246
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,240
Jung-hee.

247
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,843
Something's not right.

248
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,713
Mom won't show up.

249
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,889
Maybe Mom hates me too now.

250
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:11,096
She probably thinks I'm a bad person
and hates me now.

251
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,799
What do I do?

252
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,369
What happened? Is there something wrong?

253
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,841
Should I go to him tomorrow

254
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,945
and beg him to forgive me?

255
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,314
Will he listen?

256
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,384
Everyone seems to hate seeing me now.

257
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,654
Says who?

258
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,825
You're a person I can never see
no matter how much I wish I could.

259
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,227
How could anyone hate seeing you?

260
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,624
PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE

261
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,129
As of today,

262
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,898
Euldoguk is dissolved.

263
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,433
Pardon?

264
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,402
Why? This is so sudden.

265
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,406
Is it because the ledger
got into Mr. Do's hands?

266
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,908
We'll have to wait and see,

267
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,910
but Mr. Eun is being chased by the police,

268
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,114
and Mr. Do will probably take action soon.

269
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,815
Still,

270
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,485
everyone's worked so hard
for this organization so far.

271
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,389
As I promised
when you joined the organization,

272
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,825
in case of exposure,
I'll take full responsibility.

273
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,362
So no matter what happens
in the company from now on,

274
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,333
you have nothing to do with me.

275
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:59,238
Euldoguk has been operated solely by me.

276
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,090
Hey.

277
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,993
The other day, didn't you say

278
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,428
we should settle the girl issues?

279
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,599
I'll explain some other time.

280
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,502
I don't want to give you a heartache
in addition to a headache.

281
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,140
Like I said, since I can't see your face,

282
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,809
it's easy for me to get you wrong.

283
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,048
Gosh, what is it?

284
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,685
It's about Veronica Park.

285
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,988
-What?
-I like her too.

286
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,462
Goodness. I'm impressed, buddy.

287
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,065
So that's how you made Cinepark
sign the contract.

288
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,369
Hey, how can you laugh in this situation?

289
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,971
Here's the thing.

290
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,975
It's true that I had feelings
for Veronica Park.

291
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,711
But it turned out

292
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,914
that I didn't know her at all.

293
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,950
What are you talking about?

294
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,820
It's a long story.

295
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,454
Can't you be miserable
in a more creative way?

296
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,424
Is this all you could think of?

297
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,265
Your neck brace is gone.

298
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,735
Instead,

299
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,104
I'm wearing a back brace now.

300
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,574
My back had been practically
destroyed by my mom.

301
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,845
But this morning, I finally
managed to straighten myself up.

302
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,813
What did Ms. Park say

303
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,316
about you seeing Mr. Gi?

304
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,886
I don't remember so much
because I got beaten up so badly.

305
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,823
"Confiscation of property, disownment,

306
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,992
an urge to kill..."

307
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,761
Those are some of the words

308
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,497
I vaguely remember hearing.

309
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,700
What about your boss? What did he say?

310
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,236
I got fired.

311
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,174
Consider yourself lucky
that he's not suing you.

312
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,411
What am I supposed to do now?

313
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,881
I've been thinking of going to him

314
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,649
and begging him to forgive me.

315
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,086
Have you seen chairmen
who abused their power

316
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,522
apologize for what they did on TV?

317
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:08,293
Does that make you go,
"That's okay. You're forgiven now"?

318
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,395
Still, I want to do something.

319
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,864
Of course, you should.

320
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,967
When my mom beats me up,
I scream as loud as I can.

321
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,504
She wouldn't feel better
until she sees some response from me.

322
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,807
So what do you suggest I do?

323
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,880
When you have absolutely no idea
what to do,

324
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,217
you should do certain things.

325
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,986
Do what?

326
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,258
First, have a horrendously expensive meal.

327
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,661
-A meal?
-Yes.

328
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,598
"Is this what I get for what I paid?

329
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,734
Are you kidding me?"

330
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,437
A meal expensive enough
to make you say that.

331
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:57,976
Next, go and buy some utterly useless
but pretty things.

332
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:02,981
Lastly, watch a comedy show
that makes you laugh your head off.

333
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,618
"What am I doing here
after getting fired from my job?"

334
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,622
A show funny enough
to make you feel sorry for yourself.

335
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:17,295
Trust me. After doing all of those things,

336
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,897
you'll realize what you should do,

337
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,172
Good luck.

338
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,870
Hello.

339
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,607
Did you just ask

340
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,310
who I am?

341
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,625
Nice to see you.

342
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,596
I'm the original Veronica Park.

343
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,032
Okay.

344
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,275
Why did you want to see me?

345
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,744
I mean...

346
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,648
I just hate to see the girl so miserable.

347
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,517
She's been under her blanket so long

348
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,786
that her room smells like a stable.

349
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,857
After crying all day,
her eyes are all puffy.

350
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,459
It sure was a horrible sight.

351
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,097
If you're done, please excuse me now.

352
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,699
I made her do it.

353
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,602
She may be the one who started it,

354
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,404
but I stopped her from ending it.

355
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:11,476
She wanted to tell you the truth
even if it meant her life would end.

356
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,314
But I stopped her,
saying I'd make you the CEO.

357
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,416
Why did you do that?

358
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,988
I wanted to go out with Mr. Gi,

359
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,326
and that was the only way.

360
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,028
If she hadn't started in the first place,

361
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,497
she wouldn't have been
swayed by you either.

362
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,700
Think of how much she would've liked you
to go to such lengths.

363
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,304
You have every reason to be angry.

364
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,574
It's your decision to forgive or fire her.

365
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,611
But there's one thing you should know.

366
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,848
When you told her about your feelings,

367
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,684
she was incredibly happy.

368
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,322
She said she felt sick

369
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,492
because her heart fluttered so much.

370
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:04,095
She said it was as if she'd hurt her heart

371
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,599
instead of her arm.

372
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,723
If you're quitting your job,
why do you keep coming to the office?

373
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:38,229
I haven't been able to tell Ms. Lee yet.

374
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,565
I'd better tell her before it's accepted,

375
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,867
but she seems to be in a bad mood lately.

376
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,443
About the flash drive
I picked up in your office...

377
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,213
Because your name was in the file,
I've felt uncomfortable

378
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,115
about asking anyone about it.

379
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,617
But if you're okay with it,

380
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,019
I'm thinking of asking
the Inspection Team to take a look at it.

381
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,387
Sure.

382
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,923
Send me a copy of it too
so I can take a look.

383
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,791
Okay.

384
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,863
Let me ask you about Ms. Jeong.

385
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,966
You'll see her again, right?

386
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,736
Why would I?

387
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,571
You can't even recognize people's faces.

388
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,773
How will you prepare for the board meeting
without her?

389
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,110
I can deal with it.

390
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,546
Min-ik.

391
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,882
I saw it.

392
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,217
What do you mean?

393
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,687
Mr. Do and I promised to spend
a certain period of time together,

394
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,323
and I have less than an hour left.

395
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,860
How Ms. Jeong looked when she begged
to spend an hour with you.

396
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,296
It's something I can never get again.

397
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,704
And this isn't how I want to end it.

398
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,140
Do you like him that much?

399
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,643
Also when she said she wanted to stay
next to you at least as your secretary.

400
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,345
I want to protect him.

401
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,747
Even if I can't be his woman,

402
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,483
I want to protect him as his secretary.

403
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:10,388
Maybe she's been saying it the whole time.

404
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,857
That she wants to tell you the truth.

405
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:15,060
That she loves you.

406
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,130
Maybe you just failed to see it.

407
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,635
I'm going home

408
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,403
if you don't stop lecturing me.

409
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,006
When you love someone,

410
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,509
even if that person
disappoints or hurts you once,

411
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,878
you take the person back.

412
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,318
Take her back.

413
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,854
Like she took you back

414
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,023
after you fired her.

415
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,604
I'm home.

416
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,974
How will you lead a company
when you can't even win a woman's heart?

417
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:06,611
I couldn't believe
what Ms. Park said today.

418
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,981
Do you have any idea
who Veronica Park is seeing?

419
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,417
Please don't bother Dae-ju about it.

420
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,152
I beg you.

421
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,089
If you knew, why did you lose her
to a guy like him?

422
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,494
Mom.

423
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,563
I can't eat peanuts.

424
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,631
What?

425
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,266
I have a bad allergy to them.

426
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,970
The other day at dinner,
you didn't seem to know.

427
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,005
Why are you suddenly
talking about peanuts?

428
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:37,041
If it's that important,
why didn't you tell me earlier?

429
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,510
I did.

430
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,412
In elementary school,
I collapsed on an excursion

431
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,680
because of that.

432
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,116
In high school, Dae-ju carried me
to the emergency room

433
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,584
because of that.

434
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,920
Last year when we got a new housekeeper,

435
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,089
Ms. Jeong ran to our house
with my medicine.

436
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
That was also because of peanuts.

437
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:56,795
And I told you

438
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,498
every time.

439
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,335
Are you telling me to become a better mom?

440
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:05,503
No.

441
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,406
You don't have to care about it
from now on either.

442
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,609
Luckily, I have people around me

443
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:13,144
who keep me safe.

444
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,180
But the thing is,

445
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,315
you always tell me

446
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,151
I should be more careful
when I'm playing a game.

447
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,621
It's fine if you don't remember
your son's birthday,

448
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,757
but maybe you'd better remember this.

449
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,294
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

450
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,003
No matter what,

451
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,040
I love you always, Mom.

452
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:01,492
I know I've wronged you.

453
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,463
But please take this before going to bed.

454
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,721
Why should I take her back?
She hasn't even sent me a single text

455
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,923
saying sorry.

456
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,536
I'll start now.

457
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,085
People do this
when someone hurts his or her arm.

458
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:05,590
-Oh, no. Wait!
-Pardon?

459
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,192
You can't cut it here.

460
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,495
You can't cut this part.

461
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,132
Please cut here instead.

462
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,366
All right.

463
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,283
Mr. Do.

464
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,779
He must be here for his regular checkup.

465
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,984
Is he not eating well?

466
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,553
He looks so haggard.

467
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,889
The board meeting is tomorrow.

468
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,626
Will he be fine by himself?

469
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,099
I'm sorry.

470
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,169
I'm sorry, Mr. Do.

471
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,457
First, have a horrendously expensive meal.

472
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,868
All right. I'll give it a shot.

473
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,624
Hi. Do you want to play with me?

474
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,997
You apparently don't want to.

475
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,273
I'm a terrible person, aren't I?

476
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:42,246
What should I do now?

477
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,184
You don't know?

478
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:51,222
Will I see Mr. Do again?

479
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,197
Do you think I will?

480
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,873
Excuse me. I'll take this one.

481
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,410
Hurrah, here I am

482
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,512
Hurrah, here I am again

483
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,381
The beggar from last year is back

484
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,851
As the old saying goes...

485
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,556
It's so funny.

486
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,625
Show some respect, you punk.

487
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,638
You...

488
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,641
Damn it.

489
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,322
So this is Pennsylvania?

490
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,491
I did this because I felt so guilty.

491
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,361
What?

492
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,498
I was the only one
who could make our family rich.

493
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,567
You and Jung-hee had
such high hopes for me.

494
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,070
I couldn't bring myself
to tell you I didn't get in.

495
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,339
Is that your excuse?

496
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,742
I was going to tell you, I swear.

497
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,545
But as time went by,
I got more and more scared.

498
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,316
I was sure you'd never forgive me.

499
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,654
You...

500
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,891
Who do you think loves you
the most in the world?

501
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,829
I may not be the person
you love the most in the world,

502
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,900
but the people who love you the most
are me and Jung-hee.

503
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,270
Hiding is even worse than lying.

504
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,006
Jung-hee and I are
the only family you have.

505
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,442
It's not like you can avoid us
for the rest of your life.

506
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,948
No matter how scared you were,
you should've come and told us the truth.

507
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:58,716
Hiding doesn't...

508
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,155
Nam-hee.

509
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,025
Say to me what I just said.

510
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,160
What?

511
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,862
What I just said. Say it back to me.

512
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:16,000
"Hiding is even worse than lying.

513
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,704
I'm the one who loves you
the most in the world.

514
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,008
It's not like you can avoid me
for the rest of your life."

515
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,676
Right.

516
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,048
I shouldn't be hiding like this.

517
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,054
No matter how scared I am,
he loved me the way I was.

518
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,193
And tomorrow is
the most important day of his life.

519
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,830
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

520
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:49,300
I'm sorry, Nam-hee,

521
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,670
but I have to get back to work.

522
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,807
Move back home tomorrow.

523
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,112
Gal-hee!

524
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,481
Gal-hee!

525
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,122
My application has already been submitted.

526
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,192
Here's the quarterly report

527
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:17,895
and my stock holding statement.

528
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,267
Maybe I should call the directors
before the meeting.

529
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:31,776
Mr. Do.

530
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,613
It's me, Ms. Jeong.

531
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:46,757
Do you not know

532
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,527
what "fired" means?

533
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,399
I do.

534
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,537
But there's something
I really need to tell you.

535
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,806
Can you spare me three minutes?

536
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,510
No. Please listen to me just for a minute.

537
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,483
Leave.

538
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,386
I don't want to hear anything more
from you.

539
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,655
Then please just listen to me

540
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,392
while your coffee brews.

541
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,029
At first,

542
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:04,735
I just wanted to sit in the chair
you pull out for me.

543
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,339
You probably wouldn't understand.

544
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,043
But I had only pulled out chairs
for other people until then,

545
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:19,683
so I wanted to sit in that chair
just for once.

546
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:27,291
But actually, maybe it wasn't
only about the chair.

547
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,595
I was happy.

548
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:39,303
To be treated as a woman by you.

549
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,842
Even though the woman you loved

550
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,148
wasn't the real me,

551
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,654
you still loved me.

552
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,596
It made me so happy that I couldn't stop.

553
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,468
I'm sorry.

554
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,544
Are you done now?

555
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,617
I know I can never be forgiven,

556
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:28,752
and I know you hate me.

557
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:33,824
What are you trying to say?

558
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,359
No matter what,

559
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,863
tomorrow is such an important day
in your life.

560
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,099
You've worked so hard for this day.

561
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,873
As long as I don't put on that cardigan,

562
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,944
you won't have to see my face.

563
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,982
Imagine I'm someone else, and use me.

564
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,751
I won't ask you to see me as a woman.

565
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,087
I won't see you as a man either.

566
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,791
Once you become the CEO,

567
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,128
I'll leave with no regrets.

568
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,567
So please let me be your secretary

569
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,271
for one more day.

570
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,078
Do you remember the thing I said?

571
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:30,814
That if even you were lying to me,

572
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,084
I'd never be able to trust anyone
for the rest of my life.

573
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,390
Go back.

574
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,561
You don't belong here anymore.

575
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,264
I'll wait outside.

576
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,002
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

577
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,387
Isn't it too hot
to sit by the fire in June?

578
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,659
You could call this the Sunshine Policy.

579
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:18,729
What's the point?

580
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,033
In the end, my policy

581
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,570
successfully took off your jacket.

582
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:27,871
I mean Ms. Jeong.

583
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,943
I guess I won't get
any romance tonight either.

584
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,045
You knew about it.

585
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,381
That's why you said
you had a love triangle with Min-ik

586
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,617
when you hadn't even met him.

587
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,218
That's right.

588
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:45,055
I'm the one who made her do it.

589
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,631
Clench your teeth.

590
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,100
It will be a difficult night.

591
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,872
Who is she?

592
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:06,176
It's embarrassing to admit,
but she's my mother.

593
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,279
Nice to meet you.

594
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:12,116
Are you the guy

595
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,351
called Gi Dae-ju?

596
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,021
Is he the guy

597
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,790
you canceled your wedding with Mr. Do for?

598
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:20,991
Mom!

599
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,728
It's inhumane to attack a man's back.

600
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,698
I don't care if I have to suffer from

601
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,833
scoliosis or herniated disc.

602
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:33,537
But if you lay a finger on him

603
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,708
and cause the slightest damage
to his back,

604
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,011
and I won't sit back.

605
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:42,413
Don't be ridiculous.

606
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,782
Your mother looks way too delicate
and softhearted

607
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,517
to ever use any violence.

608
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,623
All right. What does your father do?

609
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,857
Mom.

610
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,860
I've already looked into it,

611
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,196
and I don't think

612
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,001
you'll hear a satisfactory answer
regarding that matter.

613
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,838
You lied to both mothers,

614
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,942
as if you had two bodies,

615
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,344
that you were seeing Mr. Do.

616
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,315
Did you do all that for a guy who can't
even give me a satisfactory answer?

617
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,618
Ma'am, I know I fall short
of your standards, but--

618
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:24,788
Girl, I give you a month.

619
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,125
During the time,

620
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:31,729
burn everything in that fire and move on.

621
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:36,700
You both should marry someone else
in your own league instead.

622
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,236
In the meantime,

623
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,740
I'll make Chairwoman Sim change her mind
by all means.

624
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,722
I'm sorry you had to face
the ugly truth of a rich family.

625
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,224
So it was because of me

626
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,426
that you made Ms. Jeong do that.

627
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,364
I'll do my best to meet
your mother's standards.

628
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,834
Forget about my mom's standards.

629
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,671
Try to meet my standards instead.

630
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:18,675
I happen to have

631
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,578
pretty high expectations of you.

632
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,780
What do you mean?

633
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,717
There's only one kind of man

634
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,121
I want you to be.

635
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,523
What kind?

636
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,658
The competent kind?

637
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:38,495
Then what about

638
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,198
the hardworking kind?

639
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,472
The dirty kind.

640
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,510
I might have seen your potential

641
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,079
at the preview the other day.

642
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,182
What do you say?

643
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:02,820
Would you be up for exploring
your potential tonight?

644
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,958
Is that Ms. Jeong?

645
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,262
What is she still doing here?

646
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,771
Hello, Mr. Kim.

647
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,575
Okay. I'll be right there.

648
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,586
All right.

649
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,122
Don't worry too much.
I'll see you at the board meeting.

650
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,125
Okay. Thank you so much.

651
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,554
As far as I know, it's three to three now.

652
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,491
What about Mr. Kwak and Mr. Yang?

653
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,559
They're keeping quiet.

654
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,795
They'll probably make up their minds
at the meeting.

655
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:55,299
But I have no idea
what Gi Dae-ju is thinking.

656
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,869
Mr. Sim, did you hear?

657
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,204
According to Mr. Park at Cinepark,

658
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,808
Chairwoman Park signed and sent
the exclusive contract weeks ago.

659
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,944
What?

660
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,380
Then why hasn't Mr. Gi said anything
to Mr. Sim yet?

661
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,052
What if he's handed it over to Mr. Do?

662
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:18,021
That punk.

663
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,224
Well...

664
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,262
Is that why he submitted
a resignation letter?

665
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,030
There's no way I'll accept it.

666
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,465
Be it a breach of confidence

667
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:29,666
or embezzlement,

668
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,301
I'll hold a disciplinary committee

669
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,304
and make sure he can't set foot
in this field again.

670
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,617
DIRECTOR DO MIN-IK

671
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,525
If Do Min-ik took it,
it should be somewhere here.

672
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:00,797
MAN MAY BE UNJUST TO YOU

673
00:50:00,864 --> 00:50:01,965
What's this?

674
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,674
"Man may be unjust to you
but God is always just to everyone"?

675
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,844
Yes, Mr. Sim.

676
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,781
Mr. Do already asked me
to have a look at it.

677
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,550
And it seems like
company funds have been embezzled.

678
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,452
By whom? Do Min-ik?

679
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,821
-No. By Lee Eul-wang.
-Who's that?

680
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,290
You know, Mr. Gi's secretary.

681
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,393
But there's something strange.

682
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,562
The drivers' waiting room,
compensation payouts...

683
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,664
Those are the things
she spent the money on.

684
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,036
Anyway, it seems like there are
more secretaries involved in this.

685
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:42,072
I don't care about the smaller fish.
I want to get the big one.

686
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,842
Find out if Mr. Do pocketed
any money himself

687
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,644
and who the involved secretaries are.

688
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,979
I'll fire them all.

689
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,254
I'm Lee Eul-wang.

690
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,161
So it's you

691
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,129
who led the thieves.

692
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:07,964
I didn't lead anyone.

693
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,667
Everything was done by me alone.

694
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,269
I know everything.

695
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,137
There are more people involved.

696
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,644
You can do whatever you want with me.

697
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,113
But the others had no idea
what they were doing.

698
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,849
I pressured them into doing it.
They're victims.

699
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,118
I'm sorry to say this,

700
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:33,256
but the fun of fishing
isn't releasing them.

701
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,692
Whether they are big or small,

702
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,961
killing them is the fun part.

703
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:41,932
Wait and see

704
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,134
what happens to your lives now.

705
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,575
It's not a smart thing to do
to get in my way.

706
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,176
How about

707
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,346
I bring the big fish to you?

708
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:58,882
What?

709
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,352
I'll bring the big fish to you
so you can keep your CEO position.

710
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,187
Would you release
all the smaller fish then?

711
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,791
How could you possibly get the big fish
when I can't?

712
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:10,293
"A person whose
physical or mental condition is

713
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,596
not fit for the task

714
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,831
cannot be elected the CEO."

715
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,234
Mr. Do Min-ik is suffering from

716
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,037
a serious illness.

717
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,707
He is?

718
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:26,676
What kind of illness?

719
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:28,211
Promise me

720
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:29,679
you'll fire only me

721
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:32,015
and leave the others alone.

722
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,524
Of course, you'd want to see it first.

723
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,292
Okay.

724
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,728
See you tomorrow, Mr. Yang.

725
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,396
Bye.

726
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,037
I'd better not mix up
the directors' faces tomorrow.

727
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,609
I hope I memorized everything.
Where's my notebook?

728
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,453
Is it at the office?

729
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,183
She left all her stuff here.

730
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,322
She could've taken this home today.

731
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,061
Then again,

732
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,598
she was only wearing this cardigan for me.

733
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,094
I'M SO SORRY, MR. DO
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LIE TO YOU FROM THE START

734
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,230
Maybe

735
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,966
she's been saying it the whole time.

736
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,435
That she wants to tell you the truth.

737
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,704
That she loves you.

738
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,806
She said she felt sick

739
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,142
because her heart fluttered so much.

740
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,710
She said it was

741
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,679
as if she'd hurt her heart
instead of her arm.

742
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,251
If you need anything, let me know anytime.

743
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,944
Has she left or not?

744
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,947
She's making me feel bad.

745
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,605
Mr. Do.

746
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,682
It's me, Ms. Jeong.

747
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,785
Do you need anything?

748
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,156
Well...

749
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,259
Where's my notebook?

750
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:39,229
-Which one?
-You know,

751
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,199
the one where I described
all the directors' appearances.

752
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:46,870
You forgot it at the office once,

753
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:49,439
so I put it in my second drawer.

754
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,877
Okay.

755
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,484
Should I find it for you?

756
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,887
Or should I go and buy
some snacks for you?

757
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,529
If you're tired, should I drive you home?

758
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,605
If you do this all night,

759
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,609
do you think I'll feel bad?

760
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:27,744
No.

761
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:31,815
I just thought

762
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:36,486
you might need something urgently
like you did now.

763
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,631
Is one day all you need?

764
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:50,433
Pardon?

765
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,069
If I let you be my secretary
for one more day,

766
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,639
will you leave with no regrets?

767
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,077
Yes, only if you let me.

768
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,250
I still

769
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:09,853
hate you.

770
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,390
I'm still angry about what you did to me.

771
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,563
But without you, there's no one

772
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,768
I can recognize.

773
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,356
So

774
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:48,758
tomorrow...

775
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,169
Come to work

776
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,606
wearing this.

777
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,213
Okay.

778
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,005
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHOI JEONG-WOO

779
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:50,219
Do you think I deserve
to become the CEO of this company?

780
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:52,455
Think of who made your mom die.

781
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:54,324
You should've told me.

782
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,026
Do you expect me to spare you
after the things you've done?

783
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:00,396
If anything happens to you,
I can know it right away.

784
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,397
So just send me a signal.

785
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,600
Among these people, which one is Mr. Park?

786
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,569
