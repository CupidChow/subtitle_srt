1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,430
Physical: 100's team match.

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,391
Team Nam Kyung-jin
versus Team Jang Eun-sil.

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,600
-Let's go!
-Go!

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,477
The game will now begin.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,689
-Grab three each.
-Let's go.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,315
Don't get hurt.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,775
Go up.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,407
We may be considered the weakest team,
but we can win.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,117
Bag as much as you can.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,245
I struggled with the sand for 12 minutes.

11
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,872
Go.

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,042
I really wanted to win.

13
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,544
Careful.

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,506
-Okay.
-Fill it up more.

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,217
This is fun!

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,135
Let's do this!

17
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,553
Kyung-jin is really strong.

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,597
Move them quickly.

19
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,017
We're definitely going to win.
How could we lose?

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,934
Go!

21
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,978
One minute left.

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,396
Quickly!

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,898
Let's make one more trip.

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,857
Last one!

25
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,362
Damn it.

26
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,989
Forty-five seconds!

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,948
Slowly.

28
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,787
Game over.

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,794
Physical: 100's second quest.

30
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,048
Team Nam Kyung-jin…

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
versus Team Jang Eun-sil.

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,895
Please!

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,357
It'll be an utterly perfect win.

34
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,610
I want to prove that we are stronger.

35
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:56,241
I wanted our team to win,
and I wanted to help us win.

36
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,952
Whoever we took on,
I was sure we could win.

37
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,123
Let's win. There's no way we'll lose.

38
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,875
The winning team is…

39
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,933
We won!

40
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,060
We did it!

41
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,981
Well done!

42
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,859
TEAM JANG EUN-SIL
TEAM NAM KYUNG-JIN

43
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,529
-I told you we could do it!
-We did it.

44
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,031
-We did it.
-We actually did it.

45
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,285
-We won.
-We did it!

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,453
-I knew we'd win.
-Good job.

47
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,625
Everyone thought our team was the weakest.

48
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,296
It was a revolt of the underdogs.

49
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,048
My teammates all did so well.

50
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,385
I ended up letting them
carry me through this game.

51
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,430
You told us to get ready to go home.

52
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,807
You can pack up your stuff and go on home.

53
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,518
It's okay.

54
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,151
It's over.

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,321
We did it.

56
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,780
Is this for real?

57
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:24,037
We lost to the team we chose
thinking they were the weakest,

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,998
so it was quite upsetting.

59
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,793
After setting up the bridge,

60
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,129
I should have moved more quickly

61
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,923
to help move the sand.

62
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,051
I think that's the biggest reason we lost.

63
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,639
That makes it even more upsetting.

64
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,566
Losing is…

65
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,195
something I don't even
want to think about.

66
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,489
But we lost.

67
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,662
As the team leader, I feel terrible.

68
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,499
If only I had moved one more bag,
we would have won.

69
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,478
But since Jang Eun-sil,
my fellow wrestler, won,

70
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:35,316
wrestlers will get more of a spotlight.

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,652
If she stays hungry for the win,

72
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,281
I think she might win this competition.

73
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:46,035
I hope she does, and I'll root for her.

74
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,208
TEAM JANG EUN-SIL

75
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,218
PHYSICAL: 100

76
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,222
THE UNINVITED GUESTS

77
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:11,519
TEAM KIM SANG-WOOK VS TEAM MA SUN-HO

78
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,937
Some may disagree,

79
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,939
but I thought we might be
the strongest team.

80
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,065
Kim Kang-min,

81
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,608
KIM KANG-MIN
BODYBUILDER

82
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,526
Song A-reum,

83
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,028
SONG A-REUM
BODYBUILDER

84
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:20,945
Miracle,

85
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,488
MIRACLE
DANCER

86
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,531
Jeong Han-saem.

87
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,325
JEONG HAN-SAEM
MUSICAL ACTOR

88
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,368
Overall, they're quite strong.

89
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,788
They have good strength and endurance.

90
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,042
When comparing the strengths
of individual members,

91
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,461
my team definitely had the upper hand.

92
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,297
I don't think that's right.
I really don't.

93
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,510
I believe we have the advantage
over the guys on the other team.

94
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,139
I mean, we have a few MMA fighters.

95
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,433
KIM SANG-WOOK

96
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,810
JOO DONG-JO

97
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,481
OVAN

98
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,317
When it comes to tasks
that require stamina or speed,

99
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,403
I thought we were much stronger than them.

100
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,158
Let's go.

101
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,996
So it involves climbing stairs.

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,415
I'm confident at climbing stairs.

103
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,961
Be careful not to fall.

104
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,880
There's a bridge.

105
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,051
-We have to build a bridge?
-So we have to build this?

106
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,638
A good strategy will be the key here.
We have to plan really well.

107
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,809
There was just half a bridge.
Do we have to walk on the ropes?

108
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,187
The first thing I checked out was
the height that we might fall from.

109
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,231
I was a bit worried.

110
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,485
When I first saw it,
I found it very interesting.

111
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,114
But I still couldn't figure out
what the challenge was.

112
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,539
Physical: 100's team match.

113
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:58,709
-Do you get it?
-The second quest will now be revealed.

114
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,378
The second quest is…

115
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,340
"Moving Sand."

116
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,349
Both teams must cross the bridges
and fill the tube with sand.

117
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,059
We'll win this.

118
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,561
OVAN
SINGER

119
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,896
If the bridge sways,

120
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,524
it's a mission that requires
a good sense of balance.

121
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:26,237
We would do much better than them.

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,364
It's not just about strength.

123
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,660
It requires overall agility and balance.

124
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,745
My mind was suddenly racing.

125
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,166
How should I distribute the tasks?
What should be our strategy?

126
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,463
You go down and keep bagging sand.

127
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,465
You and I should
install the bridge quickly.

128
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,800
I think that'll be best.
We'll build the bridge.

129
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,761
I immediately thought I could do well.

130
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,555
That I should put the bridge together.

131
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,850
As soon as we start, you two run down.

132
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,310
-There's only a few planks.
-Right.

133
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,020
-Bring them all up and build the bridge.
-Okay.

134
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,482
While they do that,
the three of us can bag the sand.

135
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,399
First…

136
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,279
While he builds the bridge,
we bag the sand and get ready to come up.

137
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,825
-As soon as Dong-jo builds it, we will…
-You want me to build the bridge?

138
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,703
-I think that would be best.
-Got it.

139
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,163
-While you do that…
-I'll try.

140
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,294
Physical: 100's second quest.

141
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,673
Losing is not an option.
We'll win at all costs.

142
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,930
We're determined to survive at all costs.

143
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,892
We have to win today's mission.

144
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,769
Team Kim Sang-wook…

145
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,188
I want to win this competition.

146
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,981
… versus Team Ma Sun-ho.

147
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,860
I feel bad for them,
but I think it's only right that we win.

148
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,030
The game will now begin.

149
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,995
-Careful. Be safe.
-Okay.

150
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,459
-Okay.
-Let's go.

151
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,378
Don't overdo it. Take it easy.

152
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,464
Keep your pace.
Let's do as much as we can.

153
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,426
The team to build
the bridge first will win.

154
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,685
We have to win.

155
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,230
Dong-jo, I'll put them right behind you.

156
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,606
Just hand them over right away.

157
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,941
-What?
-Just hand them to me.

158
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,776
Let's go.

159
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,991
Damn it.

160
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,747
Are they heavy?

161
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,000
-They are.
-He says they are.

162
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,264
It's okay. Don't even look.

163
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,725
Dong-jo has good balance
since he's smaller,

164
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,936
so I asked him to build it
as fast as he could.

165
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,771
Good.

166
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,609
-Hand them over with the velcro off.
-I will.

167
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,362
Bring more planks.

168
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,489
Keep them coming. Quickly.

169
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,868
My job is to build the bridge.

170
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,663
If everyone does their job properly,

171
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,165
that team will definitely win.

172
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,626
Quickly.

173
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,181
I was in too much of a rush,
and I started making mistakes.

174
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,599
I need help with the planks.

175
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,393
It's okay.

176
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,565
Undo the velcro on the back of the planks.

177
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,192
-No more planks!
-I'm right behind you.

178
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,652
No more planks!

179
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,239
TEAM MA SUN-HO'S BRIDGE IS COMPLETE

180
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,786
You got this.

181
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,921
-Done.
-Quickly.

182
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,922
Okay, move.

183
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,717
Move.

184
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,178
Let's go!

185
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,263
TEAM MA SUN-HO

186
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,640
It's shaking.

187
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,102
It's okay.

188
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,479
-We're doing well.
-Damn it.

189
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,698
-Careful.
-Sang-wook, we have to go quickly.

190
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,075
Hurry.

191
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,578
I think the other team's bridge
was completed first.

192
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,542
I felt very rushed,
but it was too early to say.

193
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,503
We could still turn the tables.

194
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,632
It's almost done.

195
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,302
Careful.

196
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,848
TEAM KIM SANG-WOOK'S BRIDGE IS COMPLETE

197
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,937
You have to bring back the bags.

198
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,106
TEAM KIM SANG-WOOK

199
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,942
What about this one?

200
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,819
Give it to us and we'll fill it.

201
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,906
Damn it. Sang-wook.

202
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,700
Slowly.

203
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,493
Slowly.

204
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,873
The bridge moved a lot,
so it was difficult.

205
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,628
Careful.

206
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,258
I was a bit slow
building the bridge in the beginning.

207
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,887
I thought I could make up for it
if I ran harder.

208
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,096
Bring back the bags.

209
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,474
Throw it.

210
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,185
He's here. You go first.

211
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,186
The bags.

212
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,188
You have to bring back the bag.

213
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,154
Nice.

214
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,328
Careful. Go ahead.
I'll hold the bridge steady.

215
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,537
Go.

216
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,455
Careful.

217
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,291
We'll win.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,211
Take it slow. Don't rush yourselves.

219
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:21,133
Both my teammates and I were
faster than the other team

220
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,220
in climbing the stairs
and crossing the bridge.

221
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,263
Let's show them
what we MMA fighters can do.

222
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,061
We have to move these two faster!

223
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,605
A little faster.

224
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,900
We worked really hard.

225
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,111
-There's more behind you.
-I thought we would win.

226
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,329
-Let's fill the big one.
-Okay.

227
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,874
Honey, come here and fill this.

228
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,964
I was completely fired up.

229
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,132
I couldn't lose there.

230
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,635
The big one.

231
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:11,892
Give me one more.

232
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:16,689
When it came to strength,
I thought my team was superior.

233
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,732
Han-saem. Move!

234
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
-Okay.
-Move.

235
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,060
This is fine.

236
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,520
Safety is important right now.

237
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,522
You can really fall down now.

238
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,648
Don't run into each other.

239
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,738
Let's go.

240
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,118
Let's keep it up. We got this.

241
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,833
I thought we'd won.

242
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,544
I was confident we'd never lose.

243
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,297
We came a long way to get here.
We have to survive.

244
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,593
Good. Go this way.

245
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,305
You got this!

246
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,431
-Go.
-Let's go!

247
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,434
There are many variables in a team match,

248
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:39,229
so there's no absolute overdog
or underdog.

249
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,870
One minute left.

250
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,956
One minute left!

251
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,919
-It's the last run!
-The last!

252
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,171
Come on! You got this!

253
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,137
Seven, six,

254
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,892
five, four, three, two, one.

255
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,897
Game over.

256
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,364
Everything was difficult.

257
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:35,452
You can't play this game
if you don't have a lot of stamina.

258
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,580
I think I got tired
from the moment it started.

259
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,835
Keeping my balance and
crossing the bridge was very difficult.

260
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,545
What a well-made game!

261
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,214
I mean it.

262
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,091
This is crazy. I never imagined this.

263
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,678
You did so well.

264
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,471
Well done. We won.

265
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,140
-Well done, Sang-wook.
-Good job.

266
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,434
-Well done.
-Good job.

267
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,518
Are you okay?

268
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,610
Physical: 100's second quest.

269
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:13,198
Out of the two teams,
the winning team will survive,

270
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,537
and the losing team's bridge will break,
and the team leader will fall.

271
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,581
I'm going to fall?

272
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,957
No, it's okay.

273
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,625
You won't fall.

274
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,294
We lost.

275
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,421
Now,

276
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,715
The winners…

277
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,259
will now be announced.

278
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,346
I really couldn't guess who would win.

279
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,392
I'm sorry, but we'll take the win.

280
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,605
Physical: 100's second quest.

281
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,357
Team Kim Sang-wook…

282
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,444
versus Team Ma Sun-ho.

283
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,908
The winning team is…

284
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,870
Please.

285
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,832
I really want to win,
and I want to show a good outcome.

286
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,269
TEAM MA SUN-HO
TEAM KIM SANG-WOOK

287
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,985
It was so thrilling.

288
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,904
I didn't know I'd be so happy.

289
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,035
It was a magnificent victory.

290
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,080
Wait, let me…

291
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,546
While completing the quest,

292
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,256
even though it was super chaotic,

293
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,675
I saw the face
of each and every team member.

294
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,927
My teammates did their best,

295
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,556
and I can't thank them enough.

296
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,015
Good game.

297
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,143
-Good game.
-You too.

298
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,062
I felt mostly disappointed.

299
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,275
I was too slow to build the bridge.

300
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,110
It's a shame.

301
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,904
-Good work.
-Good work.

302
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,948
-We were the best.
-Well done.

303
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,616
Good effort. We were the best.

304
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,827
It's not that I didn't believe in my team.

305
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,580
I didn't believe in myself.

306
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:29,084
It was my strategy
that wasn't good enough, not the team.

307
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,965
TEAM MA SUN-HO

308
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:40,429
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN VS TEAM JANG SEONG-MIN

309
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,393
TEAM LEADER YUN SUNG-BIN

310
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,895
-Let's do this.
-Let's move on.

311
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,229
TEAM LEADER JANG SEONG-MIN

312
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,689
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

313
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,774
Jang Seong-min's team.

314
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,818
Jang Seong-min's team.

315
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:55,777
Me?

316
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,697
Let's go!

317
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,993
I was going to pick yours, so thank you.

318
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,580
-Feisty!
-Good one!

319
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,750
Obviously, it's important that we win,

320
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,669
but I wanted to pick a team
that we could have a fun game with.

321
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,587
The last one?

322
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,172
The last team has three women.

323
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,674
The team with Yang Hak-seon
and Park Hyung-geun.

324
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,260
-They have three women and only two men.
-Yes.

325
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,307
But I don't think the second to last team
has great members either.

326
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,392
-Jang Seong-min's team?
-You have a point.

327
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,644
Let's just pick them.

328
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,103
Should we really pick that team?

329
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,855
I was slightly unsure

330
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,316
because he was on the national rugby team.

331
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,069
He has strength and agility,

332
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,529
so it was a bit intimidating.

333
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,407
When Yun Sung-bin picked us,

334
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,202
it hurt my pride so much,

335
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,913
so I really wanted to win,
and I wanted to beat him.

336
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,790
He must have underestimated us.

337
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,418
I thought it was for the better.
We have a rugby player, a fencer,

338
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,254
and a CrossFitter who owns a gym.

339
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,256
I thought we had an advantage.

340
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,466
-Let's kill them for real, okay?
-Let's kill them.

341
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,677
-Let's kill them!
-Let's kill them!

342
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
Let's kill them.

343
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,808
I didn't care who I was up against.
I just wanted to have fun.

344
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,142
What will the game be?

345
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,436
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

346
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,148
What is all this?

347
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,402
-Sand.
-Sand.

348
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,445
-What's this?
-There's sand.

349
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,322
What is this?

350
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:34,001
What is all this?
The high staircase and mounds of sand.

351
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,378
It's carrying sand.

352
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,173
If it's about moving it without rest,
we're at an advantage.

353
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,133
Right.

354
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,385
-I think we have much better stamina.
-Yes.

355
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,594
-We do.
-I think

356
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,014
if we build the bridge faster, we can win.

357
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,515
I think we have better stamina.

358
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,101
I thought the game itself was favorable.

359
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,520
I had high expectations.
We should win this for sure.

360
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,647
-This is the last game, damn it.
-Let's focus.

361
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,191
Win this, and we'll win the competition.

362
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:02,404
It's basically about building a bridge
and moving sand across it.

363
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,282
It's shakier than you think.
If you fall, it's done.

364
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,618
-It's harder to control than you think.
-And there are five of us.

365
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,621
I thought we had it over them overall.

366
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,082
Speed, stamina, power…

367
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,044
I thought we all had
a good balance of those traits.

368
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:21,048
So I thought it would be
an easy win for our team.

369
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,634
I thought we'd absolutely win.
Because we obviously had it over them.

370
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,220
You could see that at a glance.

371
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,805
Physical: 100.

372
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,515
Team Yun Sung-bin…

373
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,518
If there's no accident or mistake,

374
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,062
there should be no problem.

375
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,772
…versus Team Jang Seong-min.

376
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,525
Our pride is at stake, so we can't lose.

377
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,445
I'll make them realize
they made the wrong choice.

378
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,072
The game…

379
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,033
will now begin.

380
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,452
-Go.
-Don't rush. Slowly.

381
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,538
-Go.
-Don't rush. Slowly.

382
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,505
-Do you want to put those on here?
-No, I'm fine.

383
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,381
It's going smoothly.

384
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,384
To build the bridge quickly,

385
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,138
a minimal number of people
brought up the planks.

386
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,934
And while one person built the bridge
as fast as possible,

387
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,728
the rest bagged the sand.

388
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,482
This is good. Let's go.

389
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,277
We thought it would require cooperation
more than individual capabilities,

390
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,281
so two of us worked on the bridge
while two bagged the sand.

391
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,951
Let's go. Nice.

392
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,166
How's it going up there?

393
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,876
I can't see from here.

394
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,002
I'll go and see.

395
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,631
Shouldn't we just ask?

396
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,967
He's going already?

397
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,306
Good.

398
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,145
It was a bit of a variable.

399
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,439
It took much longer than I thought
for one person to build the bridge,

400
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,150
so I got a little anxious.

401
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,070
Thank you.

402
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,659
We're almost there.

403
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,246
Go.

404
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,455
-Move.
-Go!

405
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,834
-Sung-bin, two planks!
-Let's go.

406
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,085
-Let's go.
-Go.

407
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,044
Move.

408
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,045
Good.

409
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,630
Pour it quickly.

410
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,466
-Pour it quick.
-We're leading.

411
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,304
When I looked over to our opponents,
they looked discouraged.

412
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,014
I thought we would definitely win.

413
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:34,931
Good.

414
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,101
We'll win. Keep going!

415
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,436
Keep going!

416
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:41,897
Good.

417
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,815
We're leading.

418
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,446
Look ahead.

419
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,283
If I mess up here,
I could screw over my team.

420
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,619
To be honest, I felt pretty anxious.

421
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,961
I was surprised.

422
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,881
We finished the bridge first,
and I thought it was well-made.

423
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,175
I felt a bit dejected.

424
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,472
-Nice
-It's okay.

425
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,974
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

426
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,517
I thought I taped them tightly.

427
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,727
I was pleased.

428
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,730
I thought we could make up for the delay.

429
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,774
Sung-bin, two planks!

430
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,234
Two planks.

431
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,320
Let's go across. Let's go!

432
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,571
Go.

433
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,037
-We need more.
-One at a time.

434
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,497
Hey!

435
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,749
You can come.

436
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,044
You can come.

437
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,839
It's okay, come.

438
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,092
Slowly, a little slower.

439
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,760
We can't run too hard.

440
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,348
-One by one.
-Almost there.

441
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,643
Quickly, good.

442
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,769
Don't run.

443
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,729
-Walk one at a time.
-I'll go slowly.

444
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,316
Slowly.

445
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,360
-One at a time. Go slowly.
-Steadily.

446
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,611
-Nice.
-Let's go.

447
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,822
-I'll go slowly.
-Okay.

448
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,950
There's time.

449
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:17,951
We're leading.

450
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,369
Don't run.

451
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,579
Things seemed kind of confusing at first,

452
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,873
but after that, I emptied my head

453
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,042
and decided to just do my best.

454
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,795
I'll just do my part.

455
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,300
Come.

456
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,011
Take those.

457
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,727
The man with the crazy physique,
Yun Sung-bin.

458
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,438
I could see how strong he was

459
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,190
in terms of willpower

460
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,192
as well as physical competence.

461
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,614
Let's go.

462
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,991
Pack the sand faster!

463
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,869
Let's go!

464
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,374
Don't give up! Keep going!

465
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,307
-Hey, this is dangerous.
-Just go.

466
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,731
When the siren went off
to tell us that we had three minutes,

467
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,317
I thought, "12 minutes went by so fast."

468
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,070
That's when I felt a bit rushed.

469
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,414
Just come.

470
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,665
We can't do anything about that.

471
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,960
It's dangerous. Be careful.

472
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,920
It's okay.

473
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,590
I'm coming.

474
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,258
Come quickly.

475
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,928
-Go first.
-Just jump over this.

476
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,805
It's okay, I'll make it.

477
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,225
Two minutes and twenty seconds!

478
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,982
-Okay, nice.
-Let's cross.

479
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,610
-Let's do this!
-We got this!

480
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,945
Damn it.

481
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,489
-Give it to me.
-Go quickly.

482
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,740
Keep going!

483
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,326
Don't give up!

484
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,744
Don't give up!

485
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,705
Let's go.

486
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,542
-One minute!
-There's only one minute left!

487
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,377
Fill them all up.

488
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,838
Only one minute left!

489
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,965
-We're almost there.
-Just fill them all up.

490
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,967
-Only one minute left!
-We're almost there.

491
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,180
Forty-five seconds.

492
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,224
Hey, we have 40 seconds.

493
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,059
Let's go all at once.

494
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,269
-Quickly.
-Let's go.

495
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,437
-Take these.
-Go.

496
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,938
This is the last one. Let's go.

497
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,815
Thirty seconds left.

498
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,899
Thirty seconds!

499
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,735
Let's go once more.

500
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,528
We have to go now.

501
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,574
Let's go together.

502
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,867
Don't come, stay there.

503
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,410
We got this.

504
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,619
Ten seconds.

505
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,497
-Move.
-Run.

506
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,874
-Go now.
-Five.

507
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,916
-Quickly.
-Four.

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,710
-Run!
-Three.

509
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,761
Two.

510
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,931
-Nice!
-Game over.

511
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,684
-All right.
-We won!

512
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,062
We won. 100 percent.

513
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,106
We can't lose.

514
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,527
We won. 100 percent.

515
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,362
Once it was over,

516
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,616
I was relieved because I was exhausted.

517
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:48,578
Forget winning or losing.
I was just happy it was over.

518
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,457
That was good cardio.

519
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,297
Good job. You did a lot of running.
It took us a while to bag the sand.

520
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,717
It's okay. We did our best.

521
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,559
Are you okay, Seong-min?

522
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:20,485
It was kind of like
when I played in the playground as a kid.

523
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,446
Both teams worked hard, and I liked that.

524
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,032
I had a lot of fun.

525
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,786
Physical: 100's second quest.

526
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,248
The winning team will now be revealed.

527
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,672
Team Yun Sung-bin
versus Team Jang Seong-min.

528
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,341
The winning team is…

529
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,344
We all worked together,

530
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,930
and I think we moved faster.

531
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,767
We got off to a good start,
so I think we're the winners.

532
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,549
-Well done.
-Good job.

533
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,138
-I thought we actually lost.
-I was so damn scared.

534
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,851
-We worked really hard.
-We really did.

535
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,854
We did well.

536
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,238
To be honest, I thought we'd win.

537
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,866
We lost by a really small margin.

538
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:54,537
If I had made one more trip,
it could have ended differently.

539
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,955
I feel bad about that.

540
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,668
First of all, congratulations.

541
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,965
I hope you finish the remaining missions
without injuries.

542
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,676
I'll root for you from afar.

543
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,802
This is heartbreaking.

544
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,476
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN

545
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,480
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON VS TEAM TARZAN

546
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,150
I like this kind of tension.

547
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,277
It's true that we're more vigorous.

548
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,570
I came here to succeed.

549
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,781
I'm here to be number one.

550
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,076
They've already made it.
They're already stable.

551
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,494
We're all young.

552
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,704
-They're not desperate.
-But we are.

553
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,706
I was really determined to win.

554
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,916
I'm still hungry for more.

555
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,878
They are younger,
so they may have better stamina,

556
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,132
but we have a lot of experience
in various contexts.

557
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:52,303
We'll need to use our brains.
This is where the battle of wits begins.

558
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,264
Let's say the game's started.

559
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,265
And for instance,

560
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,519
-the team that gets more small balls wins.
-That could be it.

561
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,563
If it's something of that sort,

562
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,858
don't get too greedy and bring too many.

563
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,610
Put your greed aside.

564
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,988
We must move fast.

565
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,952
It's very likely
that it'll be something like that.

566
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,078
At least in my opinion.

567
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,664
I was looking for a way to win somehow.

568
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:24,335
I felt like there was a 50-50 chance,
so I kept an eye out.

569
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,676
Physical: 100's team match.

570
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,012
The second quest will now be revealed.

571
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:35,722
The second quest is

572
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,516
"Moving Sand."

573
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,184
We have to move individually.

574
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,855
Should the lighter person go?

575
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,983
It has to be fixed. Who should do this?

576
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,860
-Jeong-yun and I will do it.
-Two people set it up.

577
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,237
The three of us should bag the sand.

578
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,363
-We'll pile them up.
-Yes.

579
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,295
Physical: 100's second quest.

580
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,589
Team Choo Sung-hoon…

581
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,759
versus Team Tarzan.

582
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:13,885
The game…

583
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,928
will now begin.

584
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,805
Let's go.

585
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,729
My team's strength

586
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,899
is that we're all young
and have a great fighting spirit.

587
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,109
I was sure we could win

588
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:35,656
as long as we move quickly
and do our jobs properly.

589
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,120
Leave it and go.

590
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,375
-I'll put them right behind you.
-Okay.

591
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,589
Don't move. You can do this, right?

592
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,632
-Yes.
-Go slowly.

593
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,720
I tried to build the bridge faster
than the other team.

594
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,434
It'll be hard to carry if it's too heavy.

595
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:18,199
Bring as much sand as you can
to the top of the stairs.

596
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,576
That was my plan.

597
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,704
Seong-hyeok, lift one side.
No, it needs more sand.

598
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,040
No, let's go as is.

599
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,167
You have to carry one in each hand. Wait.

600
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,710
Wait…

601
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,628
Is it too heavy?

602
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,213
-Should I take some out?
-This is so heavy.

603
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,214
Where is it?

604
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,511
Is it done? Is it taking a while?

605
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,346
-Just a second.
-Should I wait?

606
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,558
Can I come through now?

607
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,059
Is this it?

608
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,727
Don't rush. Make it sturdy.

609
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,480
Don't rush. Make it sturdy.

610
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,524
-Hang on, I'll go by slowly.
-Okay.

611
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,401
-Hang on, I'll go by slowly.
-Okay.

612
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,361
We should stay on our toes.

613
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,538
Is it done?

614
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,999
Careful.

615
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,838
Is it done? Wait, the sand…

616
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,383
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON

617
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:21,846
I was worried.

618
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,056
I felt a little anxious.

619
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,267
-I'll bring some more.
-Okay.

620
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,607
-Go, Seong-hyeok.
-Go.

621
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,859
Is it done? Wait, the sand…

622
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,867
BANG SEONG-HYEOK
TRAINER

623
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,619
I felt a little uneasy.

624
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,245
Careful, be calm.

625
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,166
To be honest,
since Seong-hyeok is quite big,

626
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,043
I expected it could be a problem.

627
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,128
It could be dangerous for him.

628
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,881
Go on.

629
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:58,966
Go.

630
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,436
Is it done?

631
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,149
One is mine up there, so wait.

632
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,067
One is mine.

633
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,528
As long as we move quickly

634
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,658
and do our jobs properly…

635
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,627
-Coming through.
-Yes, go through.

636
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,338
-Sorry, sit.
-Yes, go on.

637
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,673
Go on.

638
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,224
Crap, what was that?

639
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,642
The ones in the back fell.

640
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:56,148
It was a little scary.

641
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:06,659
Go.

642
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,128
There's no sand.

643
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,351
Awesome.

644
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,520
NIPPERT
BASEBALL PLAYER

645
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,983
Choo Sung-hoon thought
really quickly on his feet.

646
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,611
Crawling on my knees didn't look so great,

647
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,614
but if I ran, the planks would fall.

648
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,410
So moving like a baby was
much faster and less scary.

649
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,038
Let me get this out of your way.

650
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,252
-Take it.
-Take it.

651
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,492
Hey.

652
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,537
I felt rushed and I ran,
but then the bridge fell apart.

653
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,292
They fell off.

654
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,837
So I thought, "No, this is bad."

655
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,803
Without the bridge, we couldn't move sand,
so we filled in the holes one by one.

656
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,972
We fixed the bridge on the spot.

657
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,197
Quickly.

658
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,188
I'm coming.

659
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,442
-Got it.
-Don't jump.

660
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,318
You're rushing.

661
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,532
Yes, right.

662
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,491
Wrap the opening.

663
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,540
Stay calm. Go.

664
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,167
We can do this!

665
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,886
What the hell?

666
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:15,931
Three minutes.

667
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,518
Hey, you can't pour in sand anymore.

668
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,519
We have to go.

669
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,313
Tarzan, we have to go. It's not over.

670
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,984
I didn't understand the rules completely.

671
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,614
He thought it was over.
So I said, "No, Tarzan, it's not over."

672
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,241
I got a little flustered because of that.

673
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:36,911
Here, one more.

674
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:38,871
This one.

675
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,254
Use the pink bag.

676
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,589
-Only use the pink bag.
-Got it.

677
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,841
If this is done, go ahead.

678
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,387
-Hey, take the full ones.
-We don't have any.

679
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,472
Here's two.

680
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,391
-Give it to me.
-You can take these.

681
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,477
"We can't give up."

682
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,522
I kept telling myself that we could win.

683
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,361
-One minute.
-One minute left.

684
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,660
Let's do our best to the end.

685
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,577
Let's go!

686
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,081
A bit more. It's better to take this one.

687
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,040
No.

688
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,377
We have to play
like our lives depend on it.

689
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,295
Like our lives depend on it.

690
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,507
We need to bag more.

691
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,967
Don't rush.

692
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,385
Thirteen seconds, twelve.

693
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,011
Bag this one.

694
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,598
-Just this one.
-Ten seconds.

695
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,059
It's okay. Ten seconds.

696
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,404
A bit more.

697
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:55,281
Four, three, two.

698
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,490
-It's done.
-One.

699
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,033
It's over.

700
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,535
All right.

701
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,744
Well done!

702
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,373
At the end, with three seconds left,

703
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,084
he crossed the bridge
with three big steps.

704
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,003
I was surprised at the end.

705
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,921
I want us to win.

706
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,632
-Well done.
-Well done.

707
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,384
-Good job.
-Good job.

708
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,802
Well done.

709
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,474
Damn it.

710
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,728
Now that it's over, it's scarier.

711
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,482
We won, completely.

712
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,110
-Good job sticking to the plan.
-Yes.

713
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,572
My team did really well.

714
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,949
Like I said earlier, it was 50-50.

715
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,453
but the longer we played,
the higher our chances got.

716
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:48,083
Everyone on my team did their job
as best they could, and I'm grateful.

717
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:52,546
And I think our chance
of winning is 80 percent.

718
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,471
Physical: 100's second quest.

719
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,392
Team Choo Sung-hoon versus Team Tarzan.

720
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,563
The winning team is…

721
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:15,361
Wouldn't we naturally win
unless we did something too drastic?

722
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,655
I think our teamwork was perfect.

723
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,328
The winning team is…

724
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,141
-Good effort.
-Well played.

725
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,184
You all did well.

726
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,645
I think it was a sweeping victory.

727
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,313
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON
TEAM TARZAN

728
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,650
We got off to a good start

729
00:44:54,733 --> 00:45:00,364
and made up
for each other's small mistakes.

730
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,659
I think that's why we won.

731
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,704
They trusted me one hundred percent
and followed my lead.

732
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,542
I'm so thankful for that.

733
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,461
I'll treat you all to a nice meal.

734
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,301
I just feel so bad.

735
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,638
I want to say I did my best, but I…

736
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,434
But I don't think I tried hard enough.

737
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:34,356
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON

738
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:39,820
TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG VS TEAM KWAK MYUNG-SIK

739
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,617
I think they underestimated us,
and I don't care for that.

740
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,536
You chose the wrong people.

741
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,747
They looked like easy opponents.
That's what we thought.

742
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,083
It won't be easy to beat us.

743
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:57,504
Physical: 100's second quest.

744
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,340
Team Kwak Myung-sik
versus Team Jo Jin-hyeong.

745
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,968
The game will now begin.

746
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,471
We all came here to win,

747
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,307
but the winner will be
Team Kwak Myung-sik.

748
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,893
You might have thought
our team would be easy to beat,

749
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,352
but you'll regret your choice.

750
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,395
JUNG HAE-MIN
CYCLIST

751
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,774
Let's go.

752
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,443
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

753
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:22,863
Go straight up.

754
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,867
Shall we do the big ones first?

755
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:28,911
What's this?

756
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,954
This is…

757
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,838
What is this?

758
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,840
This is…

759
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,260
This is hard. This is difficult.

760
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,263
Go. Take this.

761
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,223
Carry them like this.

762
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,814
I was building the bridge,
and things were going well at first.

763
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,651
I thought I would finish the bridge first.

764
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,616
The opposing team was ahead of us,
and I felt nervous.

765
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:12,329
But working as a stuntwoman,
I learned a huge lesson about safety.

766
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,915
I thought that even if we lose,
we shouldn't get hurt.

767
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,792
So I tried to build it very thoroughly.

768
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,504
-Do you need more, Han?
-No, it's okay.

769
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,548
-I think we can go.
-Wait, one more.

770
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,343
Hey, tell them to come up!

771
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,638
Go.

772
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,806
TEAM KWAK MYUNG-SIK BRIDGE IS COMPLETE

773
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,723
Move aside.

774
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,600
Man, it's shaky.

775
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,145
Careful.

776
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,647
-The velcro came off.
-Careful.

777
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,402
TEAM KWAK MYUNG-SIK

778
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,736
-Leave it and go.
-Is it done?

779
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,946
Yes, leave it and go.

780
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,200
-Jin-hyeong, do I go up?
-Yes, go up.

781
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,416
-Are you going?
-Yes. Please go.

782
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,834
-Safely.
-Please go.

783
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,680
-Move aside.
-This is dangerous.

784
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,056
Slowly.

785
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,852
Careful.

786
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,312
Be careful.

787
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,605
This shakes much more than you think.

788
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,231
Wait.

789
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,528
Damn.

790
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,991
TEAM LEADER JO JIN-HYEONG
CAR DEALER

791
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,412
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast.
I hadn't gotten the feel of the game.

792
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,373
I was a little flustered then,
to be honest.

793
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,591
Hey, I'll fill the sacks.

794
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,721
Nice, we're doing well.

795
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:54,473
Let's go.

796
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,557
I'll go first.

797
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:56,850
Come on.

798
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,186
Come through.

799
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,071
We should cross one at a time.
It's too shaky.

800
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,076
Hey, move.

801
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,205
Gosh.

802
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,542
-We have to fix this properly.
-We should do it again.

803
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,878
-Fix it first.
-Do one plank.

804
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,508
I should have set up the bridge better.

805
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,051
Frankly, I was annoyed.

806
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,387
-Let's go!
-You can do it.

807
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,346
You got this!

808
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,681
Just go.

809
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,308
Hey, these…

810
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,143
Just go.

811
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,396
Hey, these…

812
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,439
They're falling down. They fell down.

813
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,902
My heart sank with a thud.
I felt really bad about that.

814
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,363
We tried to do well,

815
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,825
but we focused so much
on laying down the bridge quickly

816
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:58,286
that we didn't think of the fact
that the planks might fall.

817
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,204
Hold on.

818
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,206
I think we should fix this up first.

819
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,542
I looked at our opponents.

820
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:07,254
We were all running across,
and they were stuck.

821
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,340
Da-young had fixed our planks so well

822
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,009
that they didn't come loose once.

823
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,012
So that's when I started to think,

824
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,931
"I think we could win."

825
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:18,974
Go up.

826
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,893
-Go up again.
-I'm coming!

827
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,396
No, not this.

828
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,445
We should stop
spending time on this and just do it.

829
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,571
Let's do it.

830
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,407
I got really competitive.

831
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,119
We have to just persevere.
Do it as if our lives depend on it.

832
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,169
We can do it!

833
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,336
-Let's go!
-Damn.

834
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,258
Move.

835
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,018
Damn it.

836
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,352
Three minutes!

837
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,729
Three minutes!

838
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,149
Quick.

839
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,776
Quick.

840
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,612
What was that?

841
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,240
-This isn't tiring at all.
-Not at all!

842
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,618
We're almost done.

843
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,036
Nice, Hae-min.

844
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,456
-Third place in strong man!
-You're amazing!

845
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,708
There you go. You're Jung Hae-min!

846
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,667
Let's go!

847
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,419
-Yes, go quickly!
-Go, Hae-min!

848
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,804
Keep them coming. I'll keep coming back.

849
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,722
-We have to do it together.
-I'm not tired yet.

850
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,057
If you're tired, bag the sand.

851
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,517
-Okay.
-You can't rest.

852
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,477
-I'll bring four at a time.
-It's okay.

853
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,772
It's 50-50.

854
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,650
If we win, we survive.
If we lose, we're done.

855
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,069
So let's survive and go all the way.

856
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,156
Thirty seconds.

857
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,534
You have to go.

858
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,535
-Take two each.
-Okay.

859
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,245
Go slowly, it's the last run.

860
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,287
Cross the bridge.

861
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,622
-Slowly.
-It's the last one.

862
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,083
-It's the last run anyway.
-Right. Go slow.

863
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,251
-We have to take these.
-Slowly!

864
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,669
-Yes, take it slow!
-We got this!

865
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,170
-Just go, ten seconds!
-Move.

866
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,380
You have to come quickly.

867
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,382
Ten, nine, six…

868
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,217
-Han's the last one.
-Big bag first.

869
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,718
Dust off all the bags!

870
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,803
Dust them off.

871
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,596
Dust off all the bags!

872
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,556
Dust them off.

873
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,015
Is it over?

874
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,434
Game over.

875
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,895
I feel like we did well.

876
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:29,896
Well done.

877
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,690
-Well done.
-Good job.

878
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,316
-We did it.
-Good job, Da-young.

879
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,277
The game was 12 minutes long.

880
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,904
While we were doing it,
it was really hard work,

881
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:42,409
but once it was over,
I regretted not trying harder.

882
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,536
-Da-young was awesome.
-I did well, right?

883
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,329
This part was shaky,
but the rest was sturdy.

884
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,708
I had a good feeling about you
from the moment you joined our team.

885
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,084
You set it up so well.

886
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,545
-It was amazing.
-How did we not lose a single plank?

887
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,422
-You just have to be thorough.
-That was seriously awesome.

888
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,764
Physical: 100's second quest.

889
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,017
Team Kwak Myung-sik…

890
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,145
versus Team Jo Jin-hyeong.

891
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,776
The winning team is…

892
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,051
Good job.

893
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,852
TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG
TEAM KWAK MYUNG-SIK

894
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,945
TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG

895
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,698
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON

896
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:07,285
TEAM MA SUN-HO
TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG

897
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,497
TEAM JANG EUN-SIL

898
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,002
Nice.

899
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,506
-The winners get to relax.
-The winners get to relax.

900
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:23,760
I survived again
and got to return to this space.

901
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:27,889
It felt different to be a winner again
and go back there.

902
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:32,644
I thought that if I kept doing well,
I could even make it into the top ten.

903
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:36,272
I'm kind of hopeful
that I could even win the competition.

904
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,483
I hope one of us wins it.

905
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,484
That would be great.

906
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,820
There are definitely much fewer people.

907
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,613
Seventy-five have been eliminated.

908
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,573
Twenty-five left out of a hundred.

909
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,491
CHA HYUN-SEUNG
DANCER

910
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,618
Did you think we'd survive? Be honest.

911
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,578
-Honestly, sorry.
-Right?

912
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,873
I was surprised
that Jang Eun-sil's team won.

913
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,669
We all thought they'd lose
no matter which team they went against.

914
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,754
I was really surprised by your team.

915
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,007
We're writing a real-life drama over here.

916
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,634
Okay. Excuse me, everyone.

917
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,138
I see you're having jovial conversations
with your teammates.

918
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,599
We have a show host here.

919
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,435
-What a smooth host.
-He's a show host.

920
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,938
I think it would be nice
to warm up with a game.

921
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,190
First off, the Sargent jump.

922
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,361
It's elementary.

923
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,155
This isn't a team event.

924
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:28,408
Think of it as an activity
to show off your basic abilities.

925
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,577
Who here thinks they can do this well?

926
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,620
"I think I can beat this person."

927
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,581
All right.

928
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,583
-Don't be shy.
-Me?

929
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,546
Jump. Just land on top.

930
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,008
Okay, just take turns and show us…

931
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,012
What was that?

932
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,764
I was really surprised.

933
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,348
-Shall we all take turns?
-Let's.

934
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,350
Come on out. Just give it a go.

935
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,518
Come on, everyone. It's no big deal.

936
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,480
Come on over, everyone.

937
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,814
Nippert.

938
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,193
Unless you've had bad experiences
with this, everyone take turns.

939
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,321
Okay, nice.

940
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,614
-Very good.
-What if I can't do it?

941
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,616
If you can't… Nice.

942
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,493
It would be funny
if someone couldn't do it.

943
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,577
Yes, good.

944
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,997
You missed your chance to be funny.

945
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,916
Okay, very nice.

946
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,086
Good.

947
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,837
It seems easy for everyone.

948
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,547
-Let's make it a bit higher.
-I'll help you.

949
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,966
Okay, shall we start off with this much?

950
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:27,967
5 MATS ADDED
CURRENT HEIGHT 64CM

951
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,594
Come on, you have to add more.

952
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:32,013
No one wants to try?
You think this height is nothing?

953
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,431
Okay.

954
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,349
Let's move on.

955
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,600
It's getting higher.

956
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,060
5 MATS ADDED
CURRENT HEIGHT 74CM

957
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,603
5 MATS ADDED
CURRENT HEIGHT 84CM

958
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,106
-Is that even doable?
-This will do.

959
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,232
It's high now.

960
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,316
This is high.

961
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:44,400
It's a battle now.

962
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,902
Anyone who thinks
they can do it can come up.

963
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,278
-Okay.
-Iron Man can do it.

964
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,952
I knew that Yun Sung-bin
had a great Sargent jump record.

965
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,036
South Korea's…

966
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:02,001
-He got up there standing.
-He was just standing.

967
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:06,256
-He didn't even bend his knees.
-Who wants to challenge Iron Man?

968
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,173
Well?

969
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,424
Kang-min's good at this.

970
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,009
Nice, it's Kang-min Man.

971
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,265
That was light.

972
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:16,391
Physical: 100!

973
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,147
Ki-kwan Man.

974
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,190
-Ki-kwan Man?
-"Ki-kwan Man."

975
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,775
This is high.

976
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,695
It's almost at my chest. I can't do this.

977
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:29,737
It's quite high now.

978
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,740
-They're good.
-Ki-kwan Man!

979
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,576
Add 40cm.

980
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,077
Add a lot of them.

981
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,121
Hang on. It's so much higher.

982
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,207
-How many mats did you put?
-How do you jump onto that?

983
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,209
Okay, let's stop here. We'll give it a go.

984
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,252
I can't do this.

985
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,336
I should sit down now.

986
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,714
I'll give it a go.

987
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,466
-Kang-min.
-Okay.

988
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,553
-It's quite high now, Kang-min.
-Hang on.

989
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,432
He's surprised.

990
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:00,977
This is…

991
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:02,520
It is a bit high.

992
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,647
-Give it a go.
-Here I go.

993
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,861
My legs are my strongest body parts.

994
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,250
He has a nice spring.

995
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,169
You're cute.

996
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,131
It's high, though.

997
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,009
Ki-kwan Man.

998
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,303
This is no joke.

999
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,514
I expect to be the first to fail.

1000
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,849
"The first to fail is…"

1001
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,066
Ki-kwan Man.

1002
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:50,818
Ki-kwan Man.

1003
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,362
I barely made it.

1004
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,161
-"Who will be the first to be eliminated?"
-It is quite high.

1005
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,374
"The two teams will now be…"

1006
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,214
That was really awesome.

1007
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,131
He's amazing.

1008
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,841
-How do you do this?
-How is that possible?

1009
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,010
He's really Iron Man.
He goes up like this.

1010
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,054
I think he can jump on the whole stack.

1011
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,847
-We'll find the last man standing.
-Let's make it serious.

1012
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,974
The last man standing.

1013
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,058
Okay, Iron Man.

1014
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,520
Iron Man's got to show us.

1015
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,523
It's really high.

1016
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,067
A round of applause for Iron Man.

1017
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:46,332
-You have to raise it by 20cm.
-What is that?

1018
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,417
Is he a monster?

1019
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,252
You could add all of them on top.

1020
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,547
There are springs right here.
He has springs in his ankles.

1021
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,382
-Add some more.
-We'll add more.

1022
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,009
This is really…

1023
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,760
It's as tall as Da-young.

1024
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,095
This is high.

1025
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,180
-He couldn't do this.
-There's no way he can.

1026
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,348
Now it's tough.

1027
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,019
Let's cheer for Yun Sung-bin.
Go, Yun Sung-bin.

1028
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,896
-Yun Sung-bin.
-Yun Sung-bin.

1029
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,107
-It's doable.
-It's really high.

1030
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,318
-This is unheard of.
-It's really high.

1031
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,861
This is really high.

1032
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,154
I'm too scared to jump.

1033
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,658
I think he can do it.

1034
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,493
-It was crazy earlier.
-He'll make it.

1035
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,537
I think he'll make it.

1036
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,958
But it's really high.

1037
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:37,842
Be careful.

1038
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:45,516
That's crazy.

1039
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,064
That's crazy.

1040
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,483
He's amazing.

1041
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,402
That wasn't easy.

1042
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,404
His physique is no joke.

1043
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,574
As a fellow athlete,
I thought he was really nimble.

1044
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:05,787
If we were to become enemies,
it would be really tough.

1045
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,290
Okay. We have a second game prepared.

1046
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:11,084
It's thigh wrestling!

1047
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,255
MINI GAME: 2
THIGH WRESTLING

1048
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,216
Our everlasting star.

1049
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,927
Our hero we all respect.

1050
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,138
Choo Sung-hoon!

1051
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:33,690
Then the person I think
is the strongest here is…

1052
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,449
JO JIN-HYEONG
CAR DEALER

1053
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,119
I'd like to challenge him.

1054
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,537
I'm not that strong.

1055
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,957
-How much do you think he weighs?
-How much do you weigh?

1056
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,375
I weigh 127kg.

1057
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,710
How much do you weigh?

1058
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,961
-I weigh 90kg.
-Right.

1059
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,796
-Okay, 90kg versus 127kg.
-Wow. 90?

1060
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,216
Choo Sung-hoon has never seemed so small.

1061
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:01,467
-My knees go inside.
-Yes.

1062
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,885
-And open.
-I'll shut mine.

1063
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:03,803
-Okay.
-And then…

1064
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:05,388
Relax.

1065
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,141
How about a round of applause?

1066
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,019
Ready.

1067
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,896
Go!

1068
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:28,953
You little…

1069
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,748
Come on.

1070
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:44,802
He's so freaking strong.

1071
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,179
"Freaking."

1072
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:50,475
I mean, it felt…

1073
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,560
I felt good.

1074
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:55,521
Pure strength is different from fighting.

1075
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:58,941
Okay, that concludes the warm-up.

1076
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,652
Now the real games will begin.

1077
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,154
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

1078
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,114
Let's do this.

1079
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,292
We're back here.

1080
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,627
So many disappeared.

1081
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,754
It's down to just a few.

1082
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,297
There aren't many left.

1083
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,175
So many people are gone.

1084
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,803
There are still 24 other people.

1085
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,304
I don't feel great about that.

1086
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,056
What do we do here?

1087
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,098
Right?

1088
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,268
I didn't know what kind of game
we were going to play there,

1089
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,605
so I was as nervous as I was excited.

1090
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:38,940
What could it be?

1091
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,608
I hope they tell us.

1092
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,944
Physical: 100.

1093
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:44,237
What the heck?

1094
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,655
It's blabbering.

1095
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:50,284
After the second quest,
there are 25 remaining contestants.

1096
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,872
Those of you who survived
the fierce competition, welcome back.

1097
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,173
Before the third quest begins,

1098
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,552
an important fact will be revealed.

1099
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:08,719
What is it?

1100
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:10,137
-It's important?
-Important?

1101
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,473
Besides the contestants standing here,

1102
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,561
there are additional survivors
who will participate…

1103
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,562
-What?
-What?

1104
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,604
…in the next quest.

1105
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,772
Additional?

1106
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,651
How did they survive?

1107
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,571
Why would they bring them back?
I don't get it.

1108
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:29,699
The consolation match came too soon.

1109
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:33,619
We worked so hard to eliminate them.
Why bring them back?

1110
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,954
-They're tenacious.
-Yes.

1111
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,706
They'll do anything to survive.

1112
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,833
-It's unbelievable.
-I got goosebumps.

1113
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:43,004
The five additional survivors,
please come in.

1114
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,422
Oh, dear.

1115
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:57,685
