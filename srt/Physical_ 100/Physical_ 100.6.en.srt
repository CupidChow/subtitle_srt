1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,846
The five additional survivors,

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,181
please come in.

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,143
They're coming in from this way.

4
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,027
No way!

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,738
No way!

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,199
-What is this?
-This is crazy.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,038
This is crazy!

8
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,539
I got goosebumps.

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,583
I got goosebumps too.

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,127
So they're the survivors.

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,962
How did they survive? I'm so curious.

12
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,785
There are so many amazing people.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,579
I mean, everyone here is so strong.

14
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,164
I feel nervous again.

15
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,084
They look like corpses.

16
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,043
It's scary.

17
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,795
-They hung up our torsos.
-What?

18
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,588
-What the heck?
-This is so cruel.

19
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,298
-It looks gruesome.
-Is it all luck?

20
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,341
This is so gory.

21
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,760
-They look like dead bodies.
-What is this?

22
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,637
So this is the real main event today.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,055
PARK JONG-HYEOK
ILLUSTRATOR

24
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,474
It was bizarre and upsetting.

25
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,976
I can't believe they hung them.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,771
They're sending us home
in such a brutal manner.

27
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,648
This is really cruel.

28
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,400
What could it be?
Looks like a consolation match.

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,237
I'm screwed. This is a consolation match.

30
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,407
Let's get started quickly.

31
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:02,122
You have been eliminated
from Physical:100.

32
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
-Okay.
-Yes.

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,499
We know.

34
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,086
-That's right.
-You must now break your torso

35
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,213
and leave this place.

36
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,465
However,

37
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,885
you will be given one last chance…

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,803
What?

39
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,847
…to survive.

40
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,765
Nice.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:22,976
Let's go.

42
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,562
I could at least grasp at straws.

43
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,438
How do we protect it?

44
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:33,486
Hold onto the rope connected to your torso
and hold out to the end to survive.

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,404
Damn it.

46
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,156
The moment you let go,

47
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,284
your torso will fall and break,
and you will be eliminated.

48
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,702
Right, our weight.

49
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,537
That's why they weighed us in.

50
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,998
The weight of the torso you must hold up

51
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,419
were weighed to be 40 percent
of your body weight.

52
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,545
40% OF CONTESTANT'S WEIGHT

53
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,754
Forty percent.

54
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,672
Forty percent.

55
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,091
However, out of everyone here,

56
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,718
only five contestants…

57
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,720
That's tough.

58
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,348
…can preserve their torsos.

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,184
It won't be easy at all.

60
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
Eu-ddeum, let's survive this.

61
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,897
Let's do this.

62
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,275
I won't give up even if it kills me.

63
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,444
Opportunities must be seized
when they present themselves.

64
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,237
I will seize this one.

65
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,615
It would be a shame for me to leave now.

66
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,785
I'm confident about my abilities
to hold on and endure,

67
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,912
so I'm not afraid.

68
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,205
I'll do my best and get into the top five.

69
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,874
I must survive no matter what.

70
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,250
This is my last chance.

71
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,336
Everyone must think
they'll survive, right?

72
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,338
Because I think I will.

73
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,091
If this is an opportunity
given to me from the heavens,

74
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,719
I can't miss it.

75
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,352
The survival game will now begin.

76
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,898
25-PERSON SURVIVAL GAME

77
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,359
What?

78
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,119
PHYSICAL: 100

79
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,123
THE WEIGHT OF SURVIVAL

80
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,960
The survival game will begin.

81
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,923
25-PERSON SURVIVAL GAME

82
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,681
What?

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,766
Goodness.

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,851
Crap.

85
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,812
It was much heavier than I'd thought.

86
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:31,854
This is so heavy.

87
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,900
My body got dragged forward at first.

88
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,944
"This is so damn heavy. What do I do?"

89
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,237
This is tough.

90
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,405
It's over for me.

91
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,410
Wait. Is he out?

92
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,250
When my torso fell,
I thought, "Is this for real?"

93
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,711
I couldn't believe it
because I hadn't even begun.

94
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,462
NATIONAL TEAM BOBSLEIGH ATHLETE
KANG HAN OUT

95
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,851
It was so heavy that it dragged me along,
so I dropped it.

96
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,812
I don't believe this.

97
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,439
TRAINER BANG SEONG-HYEOK OUT

98
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,445
I'm losing it. I'm losing my grip.

99
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,738
PARK JI-SU
NATIONAL TEAM RUGBY PLAYER

100
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,948
-This is too damn heavy.
-You've got this.

101
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,908
It was so heavy.

102
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:29,078
I did feel like it was
too hard from the start,

103
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,080
so I think it was about willpower.

104
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,208
I had no choice but to just hang on.

105
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,419
I considered it a fight against myself,

106
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,796
so I closed my eyes and counted to 100.

107
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,799
Everyone here is physically so strong,

108
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,261
so I thought
I should focus on the mental side.

109
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,852
It's slipping.

110
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,438
Damn it.

111
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,733
CHEF LEE MIN-U OUT

112
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,198
Damn it.

113
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,414
Shit, it's so damn heavy.

114
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,124
I got dragged along.

115
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,085
Gosh.

116
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,753

BODYBUILDER AN DA-JEONG OUT

118
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,217
You can't do this for long.

119
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,512
I really wanted to hold on,
but it was too heavy.

120
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,933
Gosh.

121
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,644
CROSSFITTER HWANG BIT-YEO-UL OUT

122
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,312
I can't do this.

123
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,231
It was much heavier than I'd thought.

124
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,024
It's a real shame.

125
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,528
There goes my 300 million won.

126
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,491
Eu-ddeum might survive.

127
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,159
She's unwavering.

128
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,996
I really wanted to protect my torso.

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,666
So to keep my mind from wandering,
I counted to myself.

130
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,626
One, two, three…

131

TRAVEL YOUTUBER TARZAN OUT

132

-You can do it, Myung-sik.
-Myung-sik.

135
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,607
You got this.

136
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,573
It's okay, you did well.

137
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,116
My hands got so slippery.

138
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,951
Our team still did well.

139

MMA FIGHTER JOO DONG-JO OUT

140

They're all falling.

141
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,088
There aren't many left.

142
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,883
Let's do this!

143
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,092
Let's do this!

144
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,010
Let's go.

145
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,555
One, two, three, four, five…

146
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,599
Ye-hyun, you can do this.

147
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,434
There aren't many left.

148
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,898
I was their team leader,
so I cheered my teammates on a lot.

149
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,817
I wanted them to survive,
so I kept cheering for them.

150
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,776
It's so slippery.

151
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,488
There aren't many left. Please.

152
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,281
It's all about your willpower.

153
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,074
You can't give up now.

154
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:12,992
Don't give up.

155
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,286
There aren't that many left.

156
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,873
I want to root for anyone
who was on my team to win.

157
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,832
Go, JJANG JAE.

158
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,376
You're almost there.

159
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,046
You have to endure it.

160
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,257
It was before the pain of defeat
had washed away.

161
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,842
I'll just do my best.

162
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,427
Hold on, Ye-hyun.

163
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,890
Please, it's okay.

164
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,520
Get a fresh grip.

165
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,610
My form was good.

166
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,694
EX-FENCER KIM YE-HYUN OUT

167
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,029
-Almost there.
-Ten people.

168
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,406
Just five more people to beat.

169
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,783
You're almost there.

170
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,662
It's killing me.

171
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,330
Look at Eu-ddeum.

172
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,666
Eu-ddeum is seriously incredible.

173
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,463
Eu-ddeum was standing there
without any change in her expression.

174
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,215
She's a monster. She's insane.

175
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,760
I thought I couldn't beat her
no matter what, so…

176
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,890
RAPPER DBO OUT

177
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,309
Nine left.

178
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,853
You only have to outlast four people.

179
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,230
No, don't give up!

180
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,900
Don't give up.

181
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,110
You can do it.

182
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,447
It's coming down. You have to hold on.

183
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,581
-Just three left!
-Damn it.

184
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,375
UDT RESERVIST JJANG JAE OUT

185
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,336
I got eliminated
because my physique wasn't good enough.

186
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,379
Damn it.

187
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,049
Seven contestants remaining.

188
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,884
There aren't many left.

189
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,885
Two left.

190
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,431
Chi-hyun, don't give up.
You've come this far.

191
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,099
You still have strength left.

192
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,685
Let's not let go of the rope
and keep trying.

193
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,521
This was another chance to test my limits.

194
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,108
The guy who does this is doing well.

195
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,818
-Jun-myeong?
-The Jun-myeong guy…

196
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,902
Hold on.

197
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,487
LEE JUN-MYEONG
STREET WORKOUT ATHLETE

198
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:18,075
I got really competitive
and I was determined to survive.

199
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,327
Guk-young, you're almost there.

200
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,286
LEE GUK-YOUNG
MUSICAL ACTOR

201
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,663
I have to give it my all.

202
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,042
SON HEE-CHAN
SSIREUM WRESTLER

203
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,210
I was telling myself,
"Please, I have to hang on."

204
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,463
CHOI SUNG-HYUK
POLE SPORTS ATHLETE

205
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,467
I was really confident about
physical activities where I use my body,

206
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,594
so I thought I could get back in.

207
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,973
KIM SANG-WOOK
MMA FIGHTER

208
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,518
I will do my best to get a good result.

209
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,272
Shim Eu-ddeum never gives up that easily.

210
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,775
I was determined to hang on
even if my arms fall off.

211
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,984
I hope you survive.

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,153
They're all so good.

213
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,495
-He's done.
-It's over.

214
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,347
SSIREUM WRESTLER SON HEE-CHAN OUT

215
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,807
Six contestants remaining.

216
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,475
One person.

217
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,394
Let's go.

218
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,686
Let's go.

219
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,188
You're almost there.

220
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,153
A little more.

221
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,154
One person.

222
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,490
No!

223
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,743
Keep going, you're almost there.
Just one more to go.

224
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,788
You can't be that one person.
You're almost there.

225
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,959
Guk-young, you're almost there.

226
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,878
Seriously, just a bit longer.

227
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,923
Only one more to beat.
Hang on just a little longer.

228
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,260
-You've come this far. You can do it.
-Guk-young. Please.

229
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,428
No.

230
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,804
-No.
-No!

231
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,681
Hey, hold on.

232
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,266
-You got it.
-You can do it.

233
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,851
-Just a bit longer.
-You're almost there.

234
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,394
You're almost there.

235
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,605
You're nearly there.
They're shaking right now.

236
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,774
-They're all exhausted. Don't give up.
-You're doing well.

237
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,776
He's done. Guk-young.

238
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,279
-He's done, please.
-He's really done.

239
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,533
Look at this. You're almost there.
Just focus on your torso.

240
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,118
-Sung-hyuk.
-Sung-hyuk.

241
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,455
-Just a bit longer.
-Come on, hang on a little longer.

242
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,582
-Just a bit.
-Fix your grip.

243
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,167
Just a little more.

244
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,003
No, a bit more.

245
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,380
-Chi-hyun, not now. You've come so far.
-Seriously.

246
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,425
You're almost there,
so just focus on yours.

247
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,684
The survival game is over.

248
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,816
The five additional survivors,
please come in.

249
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,234
Oh, dear.

250
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,777
They're coming in from this way.

251
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,493
What the heck?

252
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,247
No way!

253
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,917
-No way!
-No way.

254
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,586
-What is this?
-This is crazy.

255
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,092
They must feel so good.

256
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,344
Seriously.

257
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,388
The consolation match was really scary.

258
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,015
It was so scary.

259
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,559
Six contestants remaining.

260
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,437
You're nearly there.
They're shaking right now.

261
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,523
He's done, Guk-young.

262
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,274
He's really done.

263
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,444
You're almost there,
so just focus on yours.

264
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,168
The survival game is over.

265
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,094
Thank you so much, guys.

266
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,012
The survival game is over.

267
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,436
A woman made it back? That's incredible.

268
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,188
She must be unbelievably strong.

269
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,024
It was thrilling.
I felt like the star of the show.

270
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,486
That's Eu-ddeum.
And Chi-hyun survived with his bad leg.

271
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,030
-Are you okay?
-Seriously, it was all tenacity.

272
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,448
The other side.

273
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,577
Arena A had a hill-like terrain.

274
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,788
I jumped from it and hurt my knee.

275
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:37,501
I wanted to show the others
that my leg is sturdy and I can do more.

276
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,712
So I acted a bit tough.

277
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,882
I survived and got back in,
so I felt good.

278
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,300
KIM SANG-WOOK
MMA FIGHTER

279
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,386
I got to be in the last five.
I'm so pleased.

280
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,430
I wanted to come back so badly.

281
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:55,394
They are survivors
who managed to protect their torsos.

282
00:14:56,812 --> 00:15:01,859
Including the 5 additional survivors,
a total of 30 contestants remain.

283
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,240
I wasn't happy at all
that there were more contestants.

284
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:12,369
There were still 24 other people left,
and 5 more came back,

285
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,038
so it didn't exactly feel great.

286
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,539
After all I did to get here,

287
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,624
it was infuriating.

288
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,293
The current surviving teams
are Team Yun Sung-bin,

289
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,462
Team Choo Sung-hoon,

290
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,589
Team Ma Sun-ho,

291
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,674
Team Jo Jin-hyeong,

292
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,093
and Team Jang Eun-sil.

293
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,971
A total of five teams.

294
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,141
Kim Sang-wook, Lee Jun-myeong,

295
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,602
Choi Sung-hyuk, Seong Chi-hyun,

296
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,103
and Shim Eu-ddeum

297
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:43,275
will automatically form a team
to compete in the next quest.

298
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,985
This is getting more interesting.

299
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,529
If that team ends up winning…

300
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,616
Exactly. They could advance.
That's why it's fun.

301
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,619
We'll write history once again today.

302
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,120
We have to write history again.

303
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,791
What could they have added
five more people for?

304
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,417
What could it be?

305
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,252
What will they make us do this time?

306
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,921
I'm getting chills. I'm nervous.

307
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:08,008
I basically came back from the dead.
I have nothing to fear.

308
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,137
The third quest is…

309
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,430
They're revealing it.

310
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,432
I'm so curious as to what we'll do.

311
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,017
Moving…

312
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,438
a 1.5-ton ship.

313
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,608
-What? 1.5 tons?
-We can do it.

314
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,944
How are we supposed to pull 1.5 tons?

315
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:27,987
We're done for.

316
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,280
Can we pull a 1.5-ton ship?

317
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,200
This is not an easy mission.

318
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm an expert at pulling.

319
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,954
I love it.

320
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,331
We've got a lot of experience
with moving things.

321
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,542
They seem to have forgotten about
the two strong man contest winners here.

322
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,211
When it comes to strength,
we rarely lose to anyone.

323
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:48,590
Teams will form alliances
for the third quest.

324
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,050
An alliance?

325
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,344
I never imagined an alliance.

326
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,596
An alliance?
It sounds like another fun game.

327
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,018
You will be measured on the time taken
to move the 1.5-ton ship to its berth.

328
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,686
Out of the three combined teams,

329
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,232
all ten members of the combined team
with the worst record will be eliminated.

330
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:07,818
What do we do?

331
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,781
Additionally, after the third quest,
there will be no more survival games.

332
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,825
If you're out, you're done.
No more survival games.

333
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,163
Therefore, you must choose
your alliance wisely.

334
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,874
Why not have
another consolation match after this?

335
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,958
This is so cruel.

336
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,252
They're making us
make such cruel decisions.

337
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,422
If we form a good alliance,
we stand a chance.

338
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:33,010
I wondered which team would be
the best to partner with.

339
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,012
It's so obvious.

340
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,140
I was thinking about Team Jo Jin-hyeong.

341
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,391
They're just so strong.

342
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:46,106
To move a ship, we need strength.
And they are all burly.

343
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,525
Jo Jin-hyeong's team,

344
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,110
Choo Sung-hoon's team,

345
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,862
and Yun Sung-bin's team.

346
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,574
Teams with strength
and explosive power with large builds.

347
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,701
I thought those teams would be good.

348
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,119
I'm really confident at pulling stuff.

349
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,498
I came first in the pulling event.

350
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,793
We had loyalty in mind last game,
but now we have to win.

351
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,712
For an easy win,
I wanted to team up with Sung-bin.

352
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,172
Because all of them are guys.

353
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,050
But everyone else
must be thinking the same way.

354
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,426
They have to be thinking
about the same team.

355
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,677
Jo Jin-hyeong's team might also think

356
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,762
-we're the best choice.
-Right.

357
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,972
-We might be the best team for this.
-We don't have any women.

358
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,809
We were the team with the most men, right?

359
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,020
Everyone on that team
is fundamentally strong.

360
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,690
Moving a ship requires
a tremendous amount of strength.

361
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,151
I thought that a team
that consists mostly of men

362
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,445
would be at an advantage.

363
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:39,034
So I thought we'd have good results
if we partnered with Yun Sung-bin's team.

364
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,954
Go butter them up a bit.

365
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,125
Sung-bin, let's do this together.

366
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,630
Don't you want to advance with us?
See, it's not a bad deal.

367
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,973
Can I take a closer look?

368
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,350
-I mean, this is…
-That's ridiculous.

369
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,562
The moment Kang-min showed us his thighs,

370
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,356
I knew we should team up with them.

371
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,860
I saw Kang-min's thighs.
They looked very reliable.

372
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,486
They just seemed to find me reliable.

373
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,741
-We just have to avoid those two teams.
-Right.

374
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,784
-They're mostly women…
-I mean…

375
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,245
-and he's got a leg injury.
-we just have to get in the top two.

376
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,748
-We could steer them to form a group
-Right.

377
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,417
-that would most likely come last.
-Okay.

378
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,544
I think they're already
forming an alliance.

379
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,174
They must not want to team up with us
because we have three women.

380
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,259
But we're not just any ordinary women.

381
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,927
You never know.

382
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,345
To pull a ship,

383
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,974
we need heavy body weight,
but our team is too light.

384
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,644
We need to team up
with a strong, heavyweight team,

385
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,230
so we wanted to team up
with Jo Jin-hyeong's team.

386
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,482
Shall we join up with them? Let's go.

387
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,442
Hello.

388
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,985
-Jin-hyeong, we're here.
-Right.

389
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,445
Aren't I your left-hand person?

390
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,238
-You saw us write history.
-Well, but…

391
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,781
You saw us write history.

392
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,909
-Didn't you see it?
-Our meeting isn't over yet.

393
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,286
We need to think about this because…

394
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,455
This is survival.

395
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,248
We need to advance to the next round, so…

396
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,374
TEAM LEADER JO JIN-HYEONG
CAR DEALER

397
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,918
That was really tough.

398
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,546
We have to survive as well,
so we can't just pick any team.

399
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,675
If we pick the wrong team,
we'll definitely end up going home.

400
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,803
Hak-seon went to Jin-hyeong
to convince him,

401
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,057
but he won't pick a weak team
if he wants to win.

402
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,601
We're not a weak team.

403
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,394
-We're quite strong.
-We're okay.

404
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,438
They only think we're weak
because of my injury.

405
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,065
The rest of you are really strong.

406
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,775
-And this isn't a running mission.
-Exactly.

407
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,860
-I'm confident about pulling.
-It's about strength.

408
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,445
We shouldn't gather around on our own.

409
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,281
We need to go and ask
if they have decided.

410
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,908
-Have you decided?
-Yes.

411
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,576
-We're not a bad choice.
-Well…

412
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,495
You know this isn't serious, right?

413
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,831
-I can drag with just one leg.
-I can't decide alone.

414
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,750
I have to talk to my teammates.

415
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,669
Your teammates are already on board.

416
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,672
I was a bit worried

417
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,341
about taking in someone with an injury.

418
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,885
Unfortunately, we would be better off

419
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,471
joining up with a team
without women or injured members.

420
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,223
-Have you made up your mind?
-No.

421
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,766
-You're still thinking?
-Yes.

422
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,019
-Join us.
-This is something we can decide on.

423
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,855
Advancing to the next round
is what really matters.

424
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,692
It doesn't matter
which team you team up with, I think.

425
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,237
It's a competition because no one
wants to work with that team.

426
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,905
-With our team?
-That team.

427
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,615
-The sixth team?
-Yes.

428
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,117
I'm going to go talk to them.

429
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,077
Let's go together.

430
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,747
I think it'll be faster
if the team leaders do the talking.

431
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,417
It'll be better
if only the team leaders discuss.

432
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,544
My team beat the strongest team.

433
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,171
I know that.

434
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,507
My team members are survivors.

435
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
And we survived by pulling.

436
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,886
You saw Kang-min's thighs, right?

437
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,472
This is so hard.

438
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,807
Then I will…

439
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,562
Which team should we go with?

440
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,190
I'll go with this team.

441
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,400
TEAM MA SUN-HO
AND TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN JOIN FORCES

442
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,445
I feel so good.

443
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,654
I'm on cloud nine.

444
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,990
Considering the overall balance,

445
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,201
I thought Ma Sun-ho's team
would be a good option.

446
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,412
We'll pull like our lives are on the line.

447
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,788
Let's be a good team.

448
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,666
-The bodybuilders have come together.
-That's right.

449
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,585
-At last, we're together.
-Hey.

450
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,171
Jin-hyeong, pick us.

451
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,132
But to advance to the next round,

452
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:26,345
we need men with strength
because this is all about strength.

453
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,556
-Do we look like ordinary women to you?
-No, you don't, but…

454
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,933
It's not that.

455
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,270
He kept avoiding my eyes.

456
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,190
He wasn't convinced at all.

457
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,068
-We survived by pulling.
-My head hurts.

458
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,236
-I know.
-So we're confident.

459
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,571
-I know you're strong.
-Yes.

460
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,032
But I have no choice. It's about survival.

461
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,659
I feel bad for them,
but I have no choice this time.

462
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,537
Just make the decision you want.

463
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,457
We're trying to win
because it's about survival.

464
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,002
It's survival.

465
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,713
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON
AND TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG JOIN FORCES

466
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,632
-I'm sorry, but I had no choice.
-There was no choice.

467
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,303
And Choo Sung-hoon's teammates
trust him 100 percent,

468
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,138
and mine trust me completely.

469
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,810
My team can take on any team,
so we're confident.

470
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,604
Let's get together.

471
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,356
-Okay.
-You have a strong upper body.

472
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,817
-We're here. It's okay.
-Let's do it.

473
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,276
Don't overdo it. Take it easy.

474
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,236
Don't overdo it.

475
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,405
We didn't want to team up with them,
to be honest.

476
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,909
The unchosen ten became a team.

477
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,289
To be really honest,
I thought they should know why.

478
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,959
If the weaker people remain,
the show will be boring.

479
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,920
So naturally,
the stronger teams picked each other.

480
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,256
-One, two, three!
-Let's go!

481
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,925
Don't even think about losing.
Let's fight to the end.

482
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,970
We have to win
because everyone is looking down on us.

483
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,097
If losing was an option,
I would have gone home.

484
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,057
Don't worry, don't think about losing,

485
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,684
and let's do our best to the end.

486
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,354
The combined teams
for the third quest have been decided.

487
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,026
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON
TEAM JO JIN-HYEONG

488
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,031
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN
TEAM MA SUN-HO

489
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,911
TEAM JANG EUN-SIL
TEAM KIM SANG-WOOK

490
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,206
All right.

491
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,043
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN AND MA SUN-HO

492
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,420
It's game time.

493
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,172
Let's just do as we planned.

494
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,382
We just have to try so hard

495
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,177
that we can't even talk afterward. Okay?

496
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,262
-Let's all faint.
-Okay, let's go!

497
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,221
Let's go!

498
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,807
Our team needs to survive.

499
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,601
I didn't want to get eliminated.

500
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
Not coming last is our first goal.

501
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,396
Let's do a team cheer.

502
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,314
Down?

503
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,231
We'll win.

504
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,734
We're here to win,
so let's write history today.

505
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,194
One, two, three.

506
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,196
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

507
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,407
I felt a bit of pressure as team leader.

508
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,452
But you never know until you try.

509
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,870
So I'll push to the end.

510
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,122
As if my life depended on it.

511
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,000
I will give my all to survive.

512
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,960
It's the same here.

513
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:04,878
TEAM CHOO SUNG-HOON AND JO JIN-HYEONG

514
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,463
Okay, let's do this!

515
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,089
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

516
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,967
-Let's go!
-Can you do it?

517
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:11,885
Let's go!

518
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,012
Hit each other on the back.

519
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,722
-Just whack them.
-Okay.

520
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,891
When else would you get to
hit Choo Sung-Hoon?

521
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,517
You're right. Hit me too.

522
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,603
Me too.

523
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,188
Everyone, get slapped.

524
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:24,940
Nice.

525
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,358
Man, you're huge.

526
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,651
Hard.

527
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,909
This is the last team quest,
so whatever the case,

528
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,285
I must win.

529
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,745
I'm confident we'll survive.

530
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,372
You're all dead!

531
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,253
What is it this time?

532
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,505
-What is this?
-Right, an upward slope.

533
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,553
Physical: 100's third quest.

534
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,889
Moving a 1.5-ton ship.

535
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,061
The third quest will now begin.

536
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,730
-You have to tie the ropes…
-In that case…

537
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,524
-I was right, Sung-hoon.
-There's no water.

538
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,692
We're using the logs.

539
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,236
-We use the wood to help us pull.
-It's what we talked about.

540
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,612
Putting wood underneath.

541
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,531
But the wood is heavy.

542
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,157
And then there's those things.

543
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,326
-Obstacles.
-Yes, they said there would be.

544
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,621
Physical: 100.

545
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,915
In this quest where you have to pull

546
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,252
a 1.5-ton-heavy ship to the finish line,

547
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,213
strength is the most important element.

548
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,841
I saw the huge ship.

549
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,593
When they said 1.5 tons,
I thought it would be smaller,

550
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,762
but the ship was bigger than I'd thought.

551
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,472
It looked heavier than 1.5 tons.

552
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,685
Here are the rules of this quest.

553
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,647
You will be measured on the time taken

554
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,818
to move the ship to the berth
as a combined team.

555
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,904
Your records will determine
whether you will survive or be eliminated.

556
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,281
-Where's the berth?
-How far?

557
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,241
-Up, okay.
-Up there?

558
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,159
Up there.

559
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,954
The two combined teams with
the fastest records will survive,

560
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,000
and the combined team with
the slowest record will be eliminated.

561
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,086
Scattered in front of you

562
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,382
are ten oak barrels
you must load onto the ship.

563
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,717
We need to load them onto the ship?

564
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,552
-What barrels?
-These.

565
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,680
-They look really heavy.
-I'll just pull them out.

566
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,518
When you hear the signal,
you must load all of them onto the ship.

567
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,147
-We need to unearth and load them.
-Load all of them?

568
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,110
However, one oak barrel
can only be obtained by finding a hammer

569
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,946
and smashing a crate with it.

570
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,618
You can only start to move the ship
once all ten oak barrels are on board.

571
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,330
To move the ship,
lay out the logs in front

572
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,541
and push the ship over them.

573
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,253
Once you reach the slope up to the berth,

574
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:57,926
attach the ship's rope to the pulley
and pull the ship up the slope.

575
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,307
Finally, the game will end
as you slide the ship's rope

576
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,518
over the iron stake.

577
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,898
-Where's the hammer?
-The hammer's in the back.

578
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,401
Then who wants to smash the chest?

579
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,860
Nippert could.

580
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,737
Do you want to break the box?

581
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,947
Nippert can smash it.

582
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,032
We should decide who's doing what
so that we can move quickly.

583
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,494
We also have to place the logs.

584
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:27,205
No, we can move the logs later.
The oak barrels come first.

585
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,582
We move them first, then move the logs.

586
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,960
So do we unearth them
and bring them all together?

587
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,878
-No, load them right away.
-Right away?

588
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,588
As soon as that's done,

589
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,798
-move the logs.
-Got it.

590
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,051
They seem to have forgotten about
the two strong man contest winners here.

591
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,262
We've got a lot of experience
with moving things.

592
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,014
Jin-hyeong took an active role
in leading us.

593
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,100
He told us what to do.

594
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,228
I think it's the know-how
that comes from his experience.

595
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,356
He came up with the most ideas.

596
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,858
Everyone.

597
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:57,110
Let's not rush.

598
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,946
-Okay.
-Remember the other teams back there?

599
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,115
-We're much stronger.
-That's right.

600
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,409
We just need to think straight.

601
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,326
Yes.

602
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,578
-Yes.
-Okay, let's go!

603
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,538
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

604
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,001
Now that we're one team,
we definitely need teamwork.

605
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,713
If someone uses up too much energy
because they think they're strong,

606
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,882
we can't work as one
and fully use our strengths.

607
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:24,971
So I told them to work in harmony
with that in mind. That was my plan.

608
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:29,100
That's when I started to get nervous.

609
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,644
It's like you're waiting
for your upcoming match.

610
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:36,941
I was standing in the back, and I thought,
"I really want to win today."

611
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:41,362
My goal wasn't survival in this round.
It was to come in first.

612
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,864
I was confident.

613
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,283
When it comes to strength,
we rarely lose to anyone.

614
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,660
We're definitely going to survive.

615
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,330
This is a competition, so we have to win,

616
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,415
but we also need to have fun.

617
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,083
Now,

618
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,797
the third quest will begin.

619
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,965
-It's on.
-Let's go!

620
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
-Are you ready?
-Let's go!

621
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,096
Let's go!

622
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,389
Go straight towards it.

623
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,810
Move them.

624
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,987
The logs weren't that heavy.

625
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,490
It was only tough because we were on sand.

626
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,618
I thought that all I could do

627
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,161
was keep my mouth shut
and use my strength.

628
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,267
This hurts so damn much.

629
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,145
I think we should stick to one side.

630
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,650
Let's dig here.

631
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,862
-Go.
-You can carry that on your own.

632
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,995
Out of the contestants here,
I am on the faster side.

633
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,789
I'm strong for someone of my build,
so I'm sure we can win.

634
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,878
-We can do it. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

635
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,468
One, two, three.

636
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,555
One, two, three.

637
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:34,559
Roll it over. Let's go.
It's heavier than I thought.

638
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,436
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

639
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,353
Wait.

640
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,481
I'm in pain. Give me a second.

641
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,692
To be honest, I thought it would be light,

642
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:46,321
-but it was hard for two men to manage.
-You go up there.

643
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,115
It's slipping.

644
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,870
I don't know how many kilograms,
but it was really heavy.

645
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,372
Wait.

646
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,131
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

647
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:09,844
This is just…

648
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,763
Is this ever going to end?

649
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,600
Here. Help them.

650
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,561
The oak barrel was so heavy.

651
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,646
Really heavy.

652
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,988
Drop that in and take this.

653
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,117
What's next? The logs?

654
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,078
-Move the logs.
-The logs.

655
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,205
-One of you, come help me.
-You go over there.

656
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,415
It's heavy. Let's go, Bo-mi-rae.

657
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,798
Keep them far apart. Put it down here.

658
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,428
This is heavier than I thought.

659
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,347
-Let's lift. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

660
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,057
-Careful.
-One, two, three.

661
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,810
One, two, three.

662
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:00,937
Untie it.

663
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,730
SHIP LOADED

664
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,650
The other side.

665
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,862
-Let's push.
-Let's push. Go over to that side.

666
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,657
-The other side. Let's go this way.
-Over here?

667
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,952
-Do I go to the other side?
-Over here.

668
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,578
One, two, three.

669
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,330
Not even close.

670
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,873
-One…
-We might have to lift it.

671
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,500
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

672
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,420
-Not even close.
-We might have to lift it.

673
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,754
-One…
-One, two, three.

674
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,466
We loaded everything and pushed the ship,

675
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,678
and I was so flustered.
It wouldn't move. It wouldn't even budge.

676
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,763
It was so much heavier than I thought.

677
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,641
Is this even possible?

678
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,769
It didn't move.
I wasn't even sure how to push it.

679
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,563
I thought maybe we had to pull it.

680
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,856
And the oak barrels were on it.

681
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,150
Their weight made it even heavier.

682
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,652
-Let's push. One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

683
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,864
-Not even close.
-We might have to lift it.

684
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,908
-Not even close.
-We might have to lift it.

685
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,578
-One, two, three. We should lift it.
-We need to lift and pull!

686
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,163
-It won't move.
-Let's lift and push.

687
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,289
-Lift.
-Lift on three.

688
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,915
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

689
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,503
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

690
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,382
SHIP SETS SAIL

691
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:15,470
Team Leader Choo Sung-hoon
had great leadership,

692
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,931
and it helped us work in unison.

693
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:23,686
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

694
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,440
I think everyone was flustered.

695
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,943
But we gathered ourselves
and worked together.

696
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,820
When it began to move,

697
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,615
we realized we had
to push at the same time.

698
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,077
It was definitely about teamwork.

699
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,914
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

700
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,627
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

701
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,004
This side, push.

702
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,006
Jin-hyeong, here.

703
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,341
We have to push this way.

704
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,427
One, two, three.

705
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,639
One, two, three.

706
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,099
-Okay.
-Okay.

707
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,060
He's so reliable. He's worth his build.

708
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,939
Go, let's go forward. One, two, three.

709
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,608
One, two, three.

710
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,905
Did it move? It moved.

711
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,989
Yes, no.

712
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,741
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

713
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,826
Wait.

714
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,536
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

715
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,495
Okay, we're here.

716
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,412
Watch your feet.

717
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,289
-Lay down the logs well.
-Get them out.

718
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,582
Okay, you can keep going.

719
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,168
My legs hurt.

720
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,086
The logs.

721
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,255
Push. One.

722
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,172
One, two, three.

723
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,259
-Someone lift with me from the bottom.
-Get the logs from the back.

724
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,176
-One, two, three.
-I'm holding it.

725
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,678
Wait, the log.

726
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,346
-Not yet.
-Okay.

727
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,264
The log.

728
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:42,932
Run.

729
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,934
-Run.
-One, two, three.

730
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:45,893
Wait.

731
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,353
-The log.
-Put it there.

732
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,980
-It's laid down.
-Right there. Look where you put it.

733
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,565
More, that'll do.

734
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,233
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

735
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,026
-Over here.
-Push!

736
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,529
-One, two, three.
-Keep pushing!

737
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,572
One, two, three.

738
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,865
Push!

739
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,825
-Bring the logs from the back.
-Wait.

740
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,493
Wait, bring the logs from the back.

741
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,452
How do we do that?

742
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,079
Get one more, quickly.

743
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,956
-Bring from the back.
-Can you take it?

744
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,624
-It's this way.
-One, two, three.

745
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,586
-Wait. Slowly.
-Space it out.

746
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,837
Lay it down.

747
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,839
You have to put them close to the ship.

748
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,424
-This…
-They can't spread out.

749
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,217
Hey, a bit to the left.

750
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,886
-Hae-min.
-Come to the back.

751
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:20,845
-We have to push.
-Stronger people need to be in the back.

752
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:21,762
What is this now?

753
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,639
One, two, three.

754
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,392
-Okay, we got it.
-Watch the log!

755
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,810
We got it.

756
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,730
Everyone did their job properly
in their position.

757
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,025
-Put it there. It's fine.
-Our teamwork was almost perfect.

758
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:35,985
In a team match,

759
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,947
teammates have to cooperate
and communicate well.

760
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,991
-I think we did those things well.
-The log!

761
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:43,951
Pull.

762
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,162
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

763
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,455
-That's it.
-Okay.

764
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,042
Keep going!

765
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,877
-A bit more.
-Just a bit more.

766
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,087
Almost there. One, two, three, pull!

767
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,340
-One, two, three.
-Hey, wait.

768
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,091
-Wait.
-What is it?

769
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,259
The log slipped out.

770
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,552
I'll do it.

771
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,179
-What slipped out?
-I'll push.

772
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,097
-I'll do it.
-One or two more pushes.

773
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,558
-One or two!
-This will be the last one.

774
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,559
Good.

775
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,478
-Put it there. Okay.
-All right.

776
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,479
Push straight ahead.

777
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,147
-Do we go at once?
-Let's go.

778
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,815
-Push.
-In one go.

779
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,651
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

780
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,028
-Let's go all the way.
-One, two, three.

781
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,030
Let's go all the way.

782
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:25,409
-Let's go.
-Keep going.

783
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,619
It's done.

784
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,163
-Let's go!
-Damn it.

785
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,585
I was right next to her,
and I thought her leg might snap.

786
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,962
I was so startled.

787
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,297
-Hurry! Her leg!
-Hey!

788
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,633
-I'm fine!
-Let's hurry.

789
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,177
-Let's go.
-Fortunately, it wasn't a big injury.

790
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,720
Keep pushing.

791
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,683
I tried to get her leg out,
and she said she was fine.

792
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,395
She told us to carry on.
I thought she was really tough.

793
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,481
-Let's go!
-Let's go, damn it!

794
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,150
Keep pushing!

795
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,027
ARRIVED AT BERTH

796
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,946
We need to untie this.

797
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,907
Untie this for me.

798
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,535
-Take it slow.
-Isn't this it?

799
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,536
Yes, this is it.

800
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,038
Push!

801
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,500
Pull and push.

802
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,628
One, two, three, pull!

803
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,505
One, two, three!

804
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,632
One, two, three. Damn.

805
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,217
Some of us have to push.

806
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,636
Let's push it from behind.

807
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,014
-Da-young!
-Yes.

808
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,183
-This can come loose, so you hold it.
-Okay.

809
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,311
-If the ship moves, this comes loose.
-Okay.

810
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,980
-We need to push.
-Okay.

811
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:37,898
Okay.

812
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,860
Everyone come to the back.
Hold onto the back.

813
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,611
One, two, three!

814
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,614
-Keep pushing!
-Push!

815
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,742
Keep going!

816
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,748
-Push!
-Keep pushing!

817
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,833
-Go!
-We're almost there!

818
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,084
Push!

819
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,085
-Okay.
-One…

820
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,004
two, three!

821
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,923
Two, three!

822
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:08,054
When we tried to get the ship up
the slope, it stopped moving.

823
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,515
We pushed, but it didn't seem to budge.

824
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,227
My mind went blank,
and I didn't know what to do.

825
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,480
What's going on? Are we not strong enough?

826
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,399
We pulled, but it wouldn't come up.

827
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,486
We were all exhausted.

828
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,073
It was so heavy.

829
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,866
Wait, take a break.

830
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,369
-No, we need to pull now.
-Take a break.

831
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,706
We'd moved it up a little,
but after that, it just wouldn't go up.

832
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,958
Because it was a slope
and there was friction.

833
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,876
If I'm being honest,

834
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,670
I thought we might not
be able to get it up.

835
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,923
I think we need someone
to push from behind.

836
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,633
Let's try pulling first.

837
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,884
-We have to pull now.
-Yes, pull it.

838
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,094
Pull. Push. Go up.

839
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:53,849
Over here.

840
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,518
Okay, take a deep breath.

841
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,770
Everyone, breathe.

842
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,897
We're still good, there's still time.

843
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:03,734
He suddenly took off his shirt and said,
"Breathe. Let's go again."

844
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,403
Okay, get ready.

845
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,906
-One, two, three!
-Rushing it wasn't going to work,

846
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,784
so he told us to take a break
and then push again.

847
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:16,163
That was when we calmed down
and managed to work together.

848
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,289
Our Captain Choo.

849
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,459
Okay, it's working!

850
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,629
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

851
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,299
One, two, three!

852
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,469
One, two, three.

853
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,394
Two meters.

854
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,312
-Two meters!
-Two meters!

855
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,733
We need someone strong back here
to lift it slightly as we move it.

856
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,235
Hae-min, lift with me.

857
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,820
Lift up!

858
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:50,448
Nice.

859
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:51,991
Hae-min, one more time!

860
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,412
-Now, let's do it at the same time!
-Yes.

861
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,496
Let's go.

862
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,747
One, two, three!

863
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,376
-One more time!
-Watch your back.

864
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,211
Let's go!

865
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,588
One, two, three!

866
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:08,883
That won't work.

867
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,759
-I'll do it.
-One more time!

868
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,011
One more time.

869
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,054
I'm watching it.

870
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,434
-Just a bit more!
-One more time! Hard!

871
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,858
I think we did it
purely with our willpower.

872
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,575
One, two, three, thirty centimeters!

873
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,327
I looked at the members.

874
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,953
They were all sweating like crazy

875
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:44,043
and they were putting in
every ounce of their strength.

876
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,086
I could feel it
as I looked down from above.

877
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,547
I definitely felt more confident.

878
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,717
I felt like we could do anything.

879
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,762
Wait, let's do it at the same time.
One, two, three!

880
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,515
A bit more!

881
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,351
Last 20cm, the last push!

882
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,810
One, two, three, use your strength!

883
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,525
-A bit more! One more time.
-One more time.

884
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,860
Okay, this is it. One, two, three!

885
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,447
We kept saying, "A bit more."
The ship didn't move much at a time.

886
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,284
All I could think of was,
"How much longer do we have to push?"

887
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,911
I pushed with all my might.

888
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,371
I was determined to get the ship up.

889
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,998
My shoulders, the ship…
One of them was bound to give out.

890
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,126
One last push. One, two, three!

891
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,296
-It's done!
-It's done!

892
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,882
-Yes!
-It's done!

893
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,218
-Yes!
-It's done!

894
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,971
QUEST COMPLETE

895
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:39,932
Damn.

896
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,142
Damn.

897
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,731
-That was so freaking heavy.
-We should have put these up.

898
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,024
My gloves are ripped apart.

899
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,777
-Seriously.
-We should have put them up.

900
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,866
My teammates followed my lead,
and I think we worked well together.

901
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,702
I'm really satisfied with our teamwork.

902
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:04,081
It was so hectic,
and I thought we took a really long time.

903
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,251
So I thought,
"Damn. I'm not so sure about the outcome."

904
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,461
"We might not win."

905
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,756
It was so tough.
Competing in the Olympics would be easier.

906
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,009
The Beijing Olympic Games
were easier for me.

907
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,885
I was less nervous.

908
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:21,557
The feeling was similar
to winning an MMA match.

909
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,184
I was so pleased
that we had great teamwork.

910
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,605
-I'm so thankful to them for keeping up.
-Good job.

911
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,565
It was such a happy moment.

912
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,694
Team Choo Sung-hoon
and Team Jo Jin-hyeong's game is over.

913
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,533
TEAM YUN SUNG-BIN AND MA SUN-HO

914
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,668
Yun Sung-bin and Ma Sun-ho's team
has so many strong people.

915
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,796
Just by looking at their physiques,
you can see how strong they are.

916
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,173
They're very athletic too.

917
00:43:54,757 --> 00:44:00,929
Endurance, strength, weight…
They have it all.

918
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,141
The two strongest teams joined together

919
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:08,312
and their synergy is much too powerful.

920
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:12,483
As a team, we're invincible.

921
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,693
I am nervous, though. It's still a game.

922
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,987
-I'm nervous.
-Me too.

923
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,781
This time, they told us the mission.

924
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,408
We pull a 1.5-ton ship,
so we need a strategy--

925
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,370
Even if we come up with a strategy,
once we get there,

926
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,205
we'll be all over the place like this.

927
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,044
We're all strong,
so I think it'll be fine.

928
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,338
There won't be any variables, will there?

929
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,257
This time, I think it'll go as we expect.

930
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,051
But we're leaning toward strength.

931
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,805
The strong guys we have
are Kang-min, Sik, and Sung-bin.

932
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,640
-Sung-bin.
-Me? I'm a strong guy?

933
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,225
You're in the strong guy group.

934
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,436
-Anyone over 90kg is a strong guy.
-Okay.

935
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,855
-He's a strong guy too.
-You too. Him included.

936
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,900
-About four people.
-About four. You saw Kang-min's thighs.

937
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,193
-Yes.
-Can we see them?

938
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,319
-My thighs?
-Yes.

939
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,865
-Crazy veins, right?
-That's crazy.

940
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,367
-They're so huge.
-Those hamstrings.

941
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,910
Shall we show our thighs too?

942
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,456
Now I feel like I should…

943
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:17,881
We consist mainly of people
who regularly train with heavy weights.

944
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,174
Are we confident? Yes.

945
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,592
Are we strong? Yes.

946
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,012
My goal is coming first.
To be on the safe side.

947
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,389
-To come first at any cost.
-Exactly.

948
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,723
-We need that mindset.
-You're right.

949
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,808
We need to be careful

950
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,144
-not to be arrogant.
-Don't be arrogant.

951
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,895
Just focus on coming first.

952
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,691
We need to go all-in
until we start foaming at the mouth.

953
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,568
-It'll be so much fun.
-Yes.

954
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,902
It'll be fun.

955
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:43,490
We will finish it with the fastest record.

956
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,993
I think we'll definitely come first.

957
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,204
We'll keep going
until we start foaming at the mouth.

958
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,583
Team Yun Sung-bin and Team Ma Sun-ho.

959
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,084
Please enter.

960
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,883
-There's sand.
-It's sand?

961
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,718
And there's a slope.

962
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:03,844
What should we do?

963
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,053
There are obstacles too.

964
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,389
We move those oak barrels over there?

965
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,934
We'll have to get these obstacles
out of the way first.

966
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,396
I looked at the ground
and got a rough grasp of the quest.

967
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,609
It seemed there were
various tasks to be taken care of

968
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,403
before we actually pulled the ship.

969
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,741
As soon as we heard the rules of the game,

970
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,368
we discussed what each of us should do.

971
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,662
First of all, what's important is,

972
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:35,042
we must get the logs in pairs
and lay them out here.

973
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,960
What do you think I should do?

974
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,714
You can move the oak barrels
that are close to you, got it?

975
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,883
We must work in pairs.
It's too heavy for one.

976
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,676
-In pairs?
-Then put them all on board.

977
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,514
I think Team Leader Ma Sun-ho
led us really well.

978
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,184
When we were planning,
he suggested a lot of ideas.

979
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,269
I will make us win no matter what.

980
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:55,604
We will come first.

981
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,190
We won't let our guards down,
and we'll give our all.

982
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,358
We'll take first place.

983
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,988
The third quest will now begin.

984
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,698
The pulling is important.

985
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,659
Let's do this.

986
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:16,875
Let's go!

987
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:21,713
Let's go!

988
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,183
-One, two, three.
-Put it on your shoulder.

989
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,101
Shoulder?

990
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,271
It's heavy.

991
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,106
Damn it, we have to dig it out.

992
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,317
It won't move.

993
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,486
It won't move.

994
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:51,827
I did lots of manual work in the military,
so I was used to using a hammer.

995
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,373
What's going on?

996
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,168
I was quite flustered.

997
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,725
When I saw A-reum lift the oak barrel
and put it on the ship,

998
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,477
I thought she was incredible.

999
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,396
Put it closer. A bit closer.

1000
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,814
Okay, it's done. Go.

1001
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,110
How do I lift this?

1002
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,488
Lifting the oak barrel…

1003
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,617
I was going to do it on my own
but even two people couldn't lift it.

1004
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,077
-Shall we roll it?
-Yes, let's roll it.

1005
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,918
I found one!

1006
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,051
Just like earlier.

1007
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,054
Okay, Miracle. One, two, three.

1008
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,599
How do we lift this?

1009
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,852
-I can't lift it on my own.
-The four of us can do it together.

1010
00:48:58,935 --> 00:48:59,936
-One, two, three.
-One, two…

1011
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,486
One, two, three.

1012
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,660
The logs!

1013
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,662
-Let's get the logs.
-All three of you.

1014
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,377
Let's go. Two, three.

1015
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,295
Sik, with me. Two, three.

1016
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:28,924
One, two, three.

1017
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,261
Are we done loading?
Tell me when you're done!

1018
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,638
-All done.
-All done.

1019
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,014
SHIP LOADED
1ST PLACE

1020
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,224
It's done.

1021
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,562
I think our tasks were
well-divided from the start.

1022
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,565
If everyone does their job properly,

1023
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,067
that team will definitely win.

1024
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,487
I think we moved the barrels very quickly.

1025
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,322
I thought we'd be first place.

1026
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,494
Take a breath.

1027
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,745
We're good. We're on a good pace.

1028
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,163
Good.

1029
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,082
I'll go in front. Get behind me, A-reum.

1030
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,209
We need to get close.

1031
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,002
Is everyone ready?

1032
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,672
-Ready.
-One, two, three!

1033
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:10,799
One, two, three!

1034
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,344
Lean right back. Two, three, lean.

1035
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,181
Two, three!

1036
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,683
-Damn it.
-One, two, three!

1037
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,812
Something was wrong.

1038
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,064
The ship was so heavy.

1039
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:30,444
It was a huge shock
because the ship didn't move at all.

1040
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,739
I think we thought
too lightly of a 1.5-ton ship.

1041
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,198
I wanted to smash the ship.

1042
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,743
I would have done anything
to make it less heavy.

1043
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,661
-Just pull.
-Let's pull.

1044
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,704
Let's pull.

1045
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,872
-From the front.
-Ready.

1046
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,000
-One, two, three.
-Push.

1047
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,918
-Two, three.
-Push.

1048
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,086
One, two, three.

1049
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,922
SHIP SETS SAIL
2ND PLACE

1050
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,632
Two, three.

1051
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:58,013
I thought pulling with our feet fixed
in the sand would be more advantageous,

1052
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,600
so we re-collected ourselves
and started pulling as a team.

1053
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,101
We pulled as if our lives depended on it.

1054
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,103
Then it began to move
a little bit at a time.

1055
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,521
Team Leader Ma Sun-ho

1056
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,859
did a great job boosting team morale
with his counting.

1057
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:15,947
He kept reminding us
of when to breathe and when to pull.

1058
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,741
Two, three.

1059
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:18,658
Good.

1060
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,576
Two, three.

1061
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,453
One, two, three.

1062
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,081
-Two, three. That's it.
-Okay.

1063
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,084
Even in that rough situation,
he kept shouting to cheer us on

1064
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,836
and counted us down.

1065
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,088
-We're doing well. This pace is good.
-Let's go.

1066
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,174
I think that's what encouraged us

1067
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,928
-and helped us do better.
-Two, three.

1068
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,054
Two, three.

1069
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,639
-Nice!
-We're doing it!

1070
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,392
Okay. One, two, three.

1071
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,310
Two, three.

1072
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,312
Two, three.

1073
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,148
-That's it.
-Okay. Two, three.

1074
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,526
-That's it.
-Okay. Two, three.

1075
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,362
-We're getting there.
-We are.

1076
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,113
-Let's get the logs.
-Let's go.

1077
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,615
We have to get the logs.

1078
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,952
The stronger guys can come over here.

1079
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,537
You hold this right here, Sung-bin.

1080
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,205
-I got it.
-Okay, Hee-dong, go to the back.

1081
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,998
-Watch your feet.
-Okay, watch your feet.

1082
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,083
Here.

1083
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,043
That's good.

1084
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,128
Let's go. Now we just have to pull it.

1085
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,380
-Grab it.
-Ready.

1086
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,257
One, two, three.

1087
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,800
Nice!

1088
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:20,971
-One, two, three.
-Nice!

1089
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,681
Good work!

1090
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,058
One, two, three.

1091
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,727
-Good.
-One more.

1092
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,063
-We have to lift the log.
-The log.

1093
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,481
Work together.

1094
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,904
Catch your breath.

1095
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,241
I could see everyone getting exhausted,
including myself.

1096
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,201
I think that was the hardest part.

1097
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,662
He was sweating like crazy.
I was tired too,

1098
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,915
but the way he was sweating
just stood out to me.

1099
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,126
Take a break after you put the logs down.

1100
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,294
We're good, okay?

1101
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,545
-Step aside, please.
-Okay.

1102
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,505
-Give it here.
-Grab it right there.

1103
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,882
Okay, it's done.

1104
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:57,799
Let's go for now.

1105
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:58,967
Now grab it.

1106
00:52:59,050 --> 00:52:59,968
Long pulls.

1107
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,928
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1108
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,931
One, two, three!

1109
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,810
-One more time.
-One, two, three!

1110
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,395
We're almost there.

1111
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:14,190
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1112
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:16,526
Nice!

1113
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,069
We can go farther this time.

1114
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,238
We can push almost to the end.

1115
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:25,535
Putting down the logs or picking them up
to move was so physically demanding.

1116
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,748
We had to pull holding short ropes,
which made it even harder.

1117
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:35,170
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1118
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,839
-Once more.
-Once more. One, two, three.

1119
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,758
-Let's go.
-We've got this.

1120
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,092
-Come on.
-One, two, three.

1121
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,261
-Stop.
-The log.

1122
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,097
-All right, we're almost there!
-Good!

1123
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,224
-Let's do this!
-Hey, this is nothing!

1124
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,392
Nice!

1125
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,311
-Hurry.
-Catch it from the other side.

1126
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,813
-It's done.
-Let's go.

1127
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,023
-Almost done!
-More.

1128
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,358
-Grab on!
-Go all the way.

1129
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,901
One, two, three!

1130
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,778
Once more. One, two, three!

1131
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:01,947
One, two, three.

1132
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,491
-It's done.
-One, two, three.

1133
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,619
Okay, we're done.

1134
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,371
A bit more.

1135
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,122
Let's go. One, two, three.

1136
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,708
A bit more. One, two, three.

1137
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,503
ARRIVED AT BERTH
2ND PLACE

1138
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,420
Let's go.

1139
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,757
-We're done. Breathe for ten seconds.
-Now grab on.

1140
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,051
-Breathe for ten seconds.
-Now grab on.

1141
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,304
Catch your breath.

1142
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,515
Catch your breath.

1143
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,892
Let's do this in one go.

1144
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,435
Let's all grab hold.

1145
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,520
Wait.

1146
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:37,524
-Hey, get that down.
-Where is it? Where is this?

1147
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:38,775
Do I take this?

1148
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,694
Let go.

1149
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:41,611
Slowly, it's fine.

1150
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,697
-No, it works.
-Okay.

1151
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,532
Let's go. Slowly.

1152
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,660
I think pulling with a rope will be hard.

1153
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,287
It's done. It's connected.

1154
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,040
-Come and hold onto this.
-Here.

1155
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,334
-Hold onto that part there.
-Hold onto this.

1156
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,254
Is it done? Now keep it tight.

1157
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,339
Let's go, grab hold.

1158
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,884
-One, two, three.
-Let's go. Two, three.

1159
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,387
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1160
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,140
Put your weight into it and look up.

1161
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,766
One, two, three.

1162
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,351
Again, one, two, three.

1163
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,770
Again, one, two, three.

1164
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,814
One, two, three.

1165
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,525
Wait.

1166
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,568
It's stuck.

1167
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,654
We're fast, it's okay.

1168
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,531
-We're doing well.
-Let's go.

1169
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:27,449
Grab it.

1170
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,366
Keep it tight.

1171
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,576
-One, two, three!
-Two, Three!

1172
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,119
Two, three.

1173
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,288
Two, three.

1174
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,206
Two, three.

1175
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,335
Two, three.

1176
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,546
-We're doing well!
-Two, three.

1177
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,423
-It's going up!
-Two, three.

1178
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,467
Two, three.

1179
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,510
Two, three.

1180
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,889
-Two, three.
-Switch places.

1181
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,224
Switch left and right.

1182
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,267
It was just…

1183
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,102
The slope was the hardest part.

1184
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,481
From the moment the ship
got onto the slope without the logs,

1185
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,941
it was hard to move it
even just one centimeter.

1186
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,569
This can't compare
with the quests we've done.

1187
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:09,949
It was by far the toughest,
and it was on a nonsensical level.

1188
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,493
I got so angry.

1189
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:14,871
The stress I've had about my strength
came rushing all at once.

1190
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:18,625
From start to finish,
it was all about tenacity.

1191
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,002
It was so damn exhausting.

1192
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,882
-We're almost there.
-We're almost done.

1193
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,008
Let's go!

1194
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,135
-Let's keep going!
-Let's go!

1195
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,804
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1196
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,555
One, two, three.

1197
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,473
Nice!

1198
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,266
-One, two, three.
-Hold on tight.

1199
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,520
-One, two, three.
-Nice! Hold on tight.

1200
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,772
Two, three!

1201
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,232
Let's check.

1202
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,069
-No?
-A bit more.

1203
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,321
Damn it.

1204
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,698
-Once more.
-Once more.

1205
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,870
Man, this is so tough. We're doing well.

1206
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,413
-We're doing well right now.
-All right.

1207
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,082
All right, let's work together.

1208
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:00,416
Put your weight into it.

1209
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,128
Let's go. Get ready.

1210
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,840
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

1211
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,299
-Hold on tight.
-One, two, three.

1212
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,843
One, two, three.

1213
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,178
One, two, three.

1214
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,264
One, two, three.

1215
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,432
One, two, three.

1216
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,184
-Should we push?
-I think we should.

1217
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,727
-Damn.
-No.

1218
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,147
It can't be helped.

1219
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,275
When you're in that situation,
you can't help but curse.

1220
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:29,821
We just couldn't get it
to move this much at the end.

1221
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,949
I thought,
"This is bad. Can we even finish?"

1222
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,578
Two, three!

1223
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,663
One, two, three.

1224
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,623
-Again.
-One, two, three.

1225
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,584
-Two, three!
-Two, three!

1226
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,880
Two, three!

1227
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,756
Two, three!

1228
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,425
All right. One, two, three.

1229
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:55,763
One, two, three.

1230
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,730
PHYSICAL: 100
