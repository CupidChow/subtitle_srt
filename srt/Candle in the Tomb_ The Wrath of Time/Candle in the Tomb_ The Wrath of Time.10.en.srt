1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb:the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 10=

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,160
Leader Chen.

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,960
Leader Chen.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,320
Leader Chen.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Stop shouting.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
Leader will come later.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,480
Let's talk about things quickly.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
Commander Luo needs to rest to get recovery.

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
Lieutenant Yang,

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,400
who are you yelling at?

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
A bedbug comes out while cracking melon seeds.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
It's the one who answered my word.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,440
I advise you

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,080
to be polite.

36
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
We are impolite.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
So what?

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
It was you guys who said dissolution.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
The spittle was spitted out.

40
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,240
Now you want to lick it back?

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,120
Since there was no one to teach you,

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
I will teach you for your boss.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,840
Come on.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,960
What are you doing?

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
We are brothers.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Put down the guns.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,640
Commander Luo,

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,720
sit down.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Brother Chen,

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
have a seat first.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
The things happened in urn city,

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,080
I have already heard that.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
It blamed on me.

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,200
For I failed to return back to Cemetery on time.

55
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,880
But this time I went out,

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,080
we did find the treasure

57
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,160
which can conquer the poisons of Bottle Mountain.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,640
So I want to ask you two

59
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
whether you really want to break up.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,880
If you wanted to break up,

61
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,760
let's say goodbye now.

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,920
Banshan Sect is used to being alone.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
Taking the treasure ourselves,

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,840
we can still go down the tomb.

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Hold on.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,040
I...

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Put it away.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
Brother Partridge Whistle,

69
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
don't be so anxious.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,320
Come here.

71
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
Let me see

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,520
what treasure you took back.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,640
This time we went to Miao Village to search for treasure.

74
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,200
Red Girl of Xieling Sect helped a lot.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,360
We could get the treasure

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,120
owing to the solidarity between our two sects.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,360
I asked her to go with you

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,320
in the purpose of helping you.

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,680
What kind of stuff is this?

80
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Commander Luo, it's a chicken.

81
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Get away.

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,320
Stop talking nonsense.

83
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,520
I know it's a chicken.

84
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Big brother,

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
you are kidding me.

86
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,920
This chicken looks ordinary,

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
but it's not.

88
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
It's called Nuqing Chicken.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We all know

90
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,000
that the eyelids of ordinary chicken grow from bottom.

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
But the eyelids of this chicken are more like human's.

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
They grow from top.

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400
It is a rare phoenix species in the world.

94
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Leader.

95
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
I did see the chicken in full swings.

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
I believe that this chicken is a holy creature made by god.

97
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,960
It's out of the ordinary.

98
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
It's just a dumb chicken obviously,

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,560
not the thing which can conquer poisons of Bottle Mountain.

100
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Who do you want to fool?

101
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,120
Partridge Whistle,

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
if you found it truly, you can say that.

103
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,640
If you did not, then just say the truth.

104
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,680
If you dare fool me, I will shoot you down.

105
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,200
Commander Luo.

106
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,520
What kind of Nuqing Chicken?

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,480
It's a dumb chicken, big dumb chicken.

108
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,840
The root of Skill of Digging Pangolin lies in four words

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,600
including creating, conquering, restraining and defusing.

110
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,960
The cock is the natural enemy of centipedes.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,120
Moreover, this cock is the phoenix species.

112
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
The crow of Nuqing Chicken

113
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,280
can conquer the evil and poisons.

114
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,360
It's exactly the poison-conquering treasure we're looking for.

115
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
It's great.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,920
Phoenix species.

117
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,000
Creating, conquering, restraining and defusing.

118
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,280
Excellent.

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Excellent.

120
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,560
Leader Chen.

121
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Leader Chen.

122
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,240
Leader Chen.

123
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,600
I apologize to you.

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,160
I lost one eye,

125
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,040
so I was mad yesterday.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,440
I annoyed you.

127
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,360
I was wrong.

128
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
You are such a tolerant man.

129
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,160
Don't be the same level as me.

130
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,560
Or you can scold me to relieve your anger.

131
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,680
Okay.

132
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,760
I'll kneel down to apologize to you.

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,920
Commander Luo,

134
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,240
we are friends.

135
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,040
We should protect and take care of each other.

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
I have done something wrong either.

137
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,280
I beg you pardon.

138
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,030
No...no.

139
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,960
Don't say that.

140
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,400
I...I respect you.

141
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,600
From now on,

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,840
let three of us all work together

143
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,640
to dig up treasures.

144
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
That's the most important thing, isn't it?

145
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,080
Congratulations to you two bosses
for finding such a good method.

146
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,240
Brother Partridge Whistle,

147
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
you have really done a hard job.

148
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Take rest early.

149
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,480
Tomorrow,

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
we will get into Bottle Mountain again.

151
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,920
Boss.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,440
It's time to take medicine. Get up.

153
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
Boss. Boss.

154
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,560
You should get up to take medicine.

155
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,040
What's the matter?

156
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
Nothing.

157
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,080
It's just that I missed Kunlun.

158
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,320
Now I extremely regret

159
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
why I was so anxious before

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,680
that I even can't wait for you coming back to discuss.

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,120
Boss.

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,840
When we get in Bottle Mountain again,

163
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
we must avenge Kunlun.

164
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
Avenge?

165
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,160
It depends on whether the Nuqing Chicken you brought back

166
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,760
can work out.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Let me tell you, boss.

168
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,080
This Nuqing Chicken is really different from the rest.

169
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,520
Look at its eyes.

170
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,800
It's hard to explain.

171
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,160
Partridge Whistle told me,

172
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,960
this chicken is a holy thing sent by god.

173
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,120
You have seen that.

174
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
It can't be defeated by only several people.

175
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
Partridge Whistle also said,

176
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,720
there was always one thing to overcome another,

177
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,080
and something about conquering or things like that.

178
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,400
Anyway, I didn't understand that too well.

179
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,120
But,

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,960
there is a popular folklore

181
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,200
which said that the cock

182
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,040
was the deadly enemy and unbeatable rival of centipedes.

183
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
Is it?

184
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,760
Yes.

185
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,000
There is always one thing to overcome another.

186
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,400
It's not important whether Nuqing Chicken was amazing.

187
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,640
I just felt,

188
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Partridge Whistle is quite amazing, isn't he?

189
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,960
He

190
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
is surly quite amazing.

191
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
Take the medicine now.

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
How dare you hit me.

193
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,000
Tomorrow when we get into Bottle Mountain,

194
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,840
a vicious battle will be inevitable.

195
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
Doing things with them is not the same with our own.

196
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,920
Don't be reckless in anything.

197
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,840
Have you heard me?

198
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,360
Elder Brother,

199
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,280
are you tired of saying that all the time?

200
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,520
My ears are cocooned.

201
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,920
I said this to you all the time,

202
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,960
for you are too impulsive in doing things.

203
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,800
What's the difference between impulsiveness and sense?

204
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,360
I think it is

205
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,240
the evils Zagrema Nationality brought on ourselves.

206
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,920
It's our destiny. We must accept it.

207
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,120
We will die sooner or later,

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,680
why are we scared?

209
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,160
What about being impulsive?

210
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
How many times have I told you

211
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,480
not to say that again?

212
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,440
We have been looking for Dust Bead for thousands of years.

213
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
Have we found them?

214
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,200
We can't even see the shadow of it.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Who knows

216
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
if there was Dust Bead in the world on earth?

217
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,880
Am I wrong?

218
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,120
I don't believe that you didn't think of that this way at all.

219
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,800
I think

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
there is no Dust Bead at all.

221
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,880
Say it one more time.

222
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,560
You just dare not face the reality.

223
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,640
Dust Bead must be found by us.

224
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,480
It's our mission.

225
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,200
As for the others,

226
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,560
they have nothing to do with us.

227
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Still awake?

228
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,240
I have left just few days.

229
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,760
And he was gone when I was back.

230
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,680
I haven't even seen him for the last time.

231
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
When Kunlun was alive,

232
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,200
everyone laughed at him

233
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,720
for he always could not eat enough.

234
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,240
I hope in that place,

235
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,880
he can eat enough

236
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
and never feel hungry.

237
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,600
What's more,

238
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,000
thank you.

239
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,560
During the day you said in front of everyone

240
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,240
that I helped a lot.

241
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,040
Actually, I have not helped much either.

242
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,680
I can't drink.

243
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,200
Owing to you

244
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,680
to slow the old herbalist down,

245
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
so I could have the chance to ask him questions.

246
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,560
I was too drunk that day

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,360
to say so many things about Banshan Sect.

248
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,520
Don't take them to heart.

249
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,680
Red Girl did not throw the flying knife to me.

250
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,000
It's already a mercy to me.

251
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
I wonder whether that big cock

252
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,600
was effective or not.

253
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
It's effective or not.

254
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
We'll see tomorrow.

255
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,560
I, Chen Yulou.

256
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,590
I, Luo Laowai.

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,240
I, Partridge Whistle.

258
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,070
Todday we three are united as one

259
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,880
with the same heart and virtue
to achieve great achievements.

260
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,830
Hereby we kill animals and cut bloods to swear to the god.

261
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,240
If someone violates the covenant,

262
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,640
he will be punished by god.

263
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,120
We take an oath here.

264
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,160
Every brothers.

265
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,680
This time we get into Bottle Mountain again,

266
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,200
major events can be expected.

267
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
I hope all of you could unite in a concerted effort

268
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,160
and return triumphantly

269
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
to comfort the souls of dead brothers.

270
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,160
A toast to our brothers.

271
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,080
A toast to our brothers.

272
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,200
Leader.

273
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,440
Let's go.

274
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,400
Yes.

275
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,760
It's a pity that both Banshan Sect and Xieing Sect

276
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,120
can't get the ability of Mojin Sect which can

277
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,680
observe hill shape outside
and inspect geographical vein inside.

278
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,080
In usual way of Xieling Sect,

279
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,640
we will find a weak position

280
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,400
at the ridge

281
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,680
to set blast holes.

282
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
Then we will blast out the underground palace.

283
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,000
I wonder what your opinion is.

284
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,120
Since we can't go inside through the top of the mountain.

285
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,920
What about going in through the bottom?

286
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,400
Brother Chen, look there.

287
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,640
The bottom of Bottle Mountain

288
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,200
has not seen sunshine for thousands of years.

289
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,520
It is exactly the shade place.

290
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
But the vines are densely covered inside.

291
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,520
So it's to say that in the root of the mountain

292
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,040
there are not so many rocks.

293
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:44,960
In my opinion,

294
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,320
it's easier to dig up from the dead corner in the bottom

295
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,960
than to dig down from the top.

296
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,240
Are you sure about that?

297
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,480
It's just a conjecture.

298
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
I am not sure about that.

299
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,600
Okay.

300
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,520
Let's branch out into two columns.

301
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Commander Luo and I will take people

302
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
to set blast holes at the ridge.

303
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,320
I'll send another team to look for

304
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,560
the entrance of underground palace with you
at the foot of hill.

305
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,240
How about we doing the two things at the same time?

306
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,480
Good.

307
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,640
Okay, it's great.

308
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,640
We can go there at the same time.

309
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Whichever team

310
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,000
finds the treasure,

311
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,760
everyone shares together.

312
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,560
Come here

313
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,960
to accompany the Chief of Banshan Sect looking for

314
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,480
the entrance of underground palace at the foot of hill.

315
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,240
Yes.

316
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,360
Elder Brother, it's enough to do this ourselves.

317
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
Leader,

318
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,080
for the sake of Leader and bothers of Xieling Sect,

319
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,800
I'd like to assist Banshan Sect.

320
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,920
Brother Partridge Whistle, what do you think?

321
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
Okay. Then.

322
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Then hope us

323
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,080
can unite in a concerted effort and succeed quickly.

324
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,080
Let's go.

325
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,400
Let's go.

326
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,080
Commander Luo.

327
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,720
Let's go.

328
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Follow up.

329
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,240
Go.

330
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,360
Go up the mountain.

331
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,120
This mountain has hung here slantingly

332
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,000
for perhaps thousands of years.

333
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,080
Comparing with this,

334
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
people are just like a drop in the ocean.

335
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
Through the ages, there were so many emperors and generals

336
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,480
as well as heroes.

337
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,240
They were all turning into nothing finally.

338
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
It's good for the people

339
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,480
to live without regret.

340
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,720
As for what would happen after our death,

341
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,640
leave that to the others to think about.

342
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,240
Let's go.

343
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,920
Leader Chen.

344
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,400
There must be something wrong with Red Girl recently.

345
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,200
When Partridge Whistle was here,

346
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
she required to go up the mountain with him actively.

347
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400
It's not like her way of doing things.

348
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,320
This little girl.

349
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,600
The old saying was right.

350
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,520
The woman loves money while the girl admires handsome.

351
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,480
Completely right.

352
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,320
It's true that Foreign monks can chant sutras easily.
[*A slang that one can accomplish something easily]

353
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
Such a pretty girl

354
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,600
was attracted by Partridge Whistle.

355
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,120
I figured it out.

356
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,320
What?

357
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,680
I figured out the place we should bury blasts and dig holes.

358
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,600
I thought you figured out

359
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,440
to betroth Red Girl to me.

360
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,720
Look.

361
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,480
What's going on?

362
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,880
What's going on?

363
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,760
Move away. Let me see.

364
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,560
Such a big snake.

365
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,480
It's alive.

366
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,560
Come to disembowel it.

367
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Take the snake gall to soak in the liquor for me.

368
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,800
Yes.

369
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,680
Move.

370
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,320
I have read a record in an ancient book

371
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,800
which said there were poisons human can't see in the world.

372
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,520
The foreigners call it fungus.

373
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,640
Once this kind of fungus

374
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,040
is parasitic in animals or humans,

375
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,720
it will fill the body quickly

376
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,760
to produce more fungi.

377
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,320
And then they will control the behavior of people.

378
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,600
So the snake seemed alive when you saw it.

379
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,640
Actually it died a long time ago.

380
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
It's just fungi who controls it to move.

381
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
Such profound knowledge.

382
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
As, as for the snake gall,

383
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,160
I can't soak it in liquor, right?

384
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,640
Of course not.

385
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,280
Come to burn it.

386
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Burn it.

387
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,800
In this whole big world,

388
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
nothing is too strange.

389
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,040
I never expected to see anything

390
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,640
recorded in ancient books here.

391
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,400
Bottle Mountain is full of strange things.

392
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Such deep water.

393
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,800
Elder Brother.

394
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,000
What shall we do with so many people?

395
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,680
The foot of the mountain is lying ahead.

396
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,520
We have to find a way to get through it.

397
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,160
Make rafts.

398
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes.

399
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,840
Both Banshan Sect and Xieling Sect
have their own unique skills.

400
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,480
With the damp environment in the cave,

401
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,560
the Skill of Soil-observation of Xieling Sect can not be taken.

402
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
Then Partridge Whistle took

403
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,080
the unique skill of Banshan Sect.

404
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,700
This is it.
