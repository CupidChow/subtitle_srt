1
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,980
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,340
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,260
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,980
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,860
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,060
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,140
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,500
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,620
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,540
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,100
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,780
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,220
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,380
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,460
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,500
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,220
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,500
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,660
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,780
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,340
=Episode 18=

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,900
We Zhagelama people

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,100
were cursed by the Guidong people 2000 years ago.

25
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,940
It is said that only the Dust Bead
can break the curse.

26
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
My father was in the Banshan sect too.

27
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,980
He died in the tomb and never came back.

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,940
And my mother,

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,740
she died because of the curse.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
How come your blood

31
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,980
is gold?

32
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,700
As we Zhagelama people grow older,

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,620
our blood will slowly
change from red into gold.

34
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,700
When it is completely gold,

35
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,300
we…

36
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,100
You what?

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,980
We will die soon.

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,300
None of our people

39
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,500
could make it past 40.

40
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,540
Ma Zhenbang.

41
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,900
You bastard!

42
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380
Commander Luo.

43
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,340
Calm down.

44
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,660
How's it going recently?

45
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,460
Where's your left eye?

46
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,580
Even if I lose my head,

47
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,460
it's just a bowl-sized scar.

48
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,180
I only lost one eye,

49
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,180
even I'm totally blind,

50
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,460
I can still see and think clearly.

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,300
You're right.

52
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,940
You already have a scar on your face.

53
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,380
Now you have a blind eye.

54
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,620
A bowl-sized scar

55
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,380
will be the icing on the cake.

56
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,260
Cut the bullshit.

57
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,020
I was negligent and fell into your trap.

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
Kill me or torture me,
whatever you like.

59
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,100
Just do it!

60
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
You will die anyway.

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,020
Why are you in such a hurry?

62
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,380
To kill a bug like you,

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,900
I don't even have to do it by myself.

64
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,740
Yang?

65
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,780
Indeed, man proposes,
God disposes, huh?

66
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,540
I definitely didn't expect that

67
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,300
you ingratitude jerk
are the one who betrayed us.

68
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,860
Commander Luo.

69
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,740
You've abused me for three years.

70
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,660
And I've put up with you for three years.

71
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,260
It's your last chance to abuse me today.

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,420
You ungrateful bastard!

73
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,300
If I could know this earlier,

74
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,340
I definitely wouldn't
take you in at that time.

75
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,100
You ungrateful cheap jerk!

76
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,780
I hate it the most when others call me cheap.

77
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,100
You bastard.

78
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,340
Cheap jerk.

79
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,180
Cheap!

80
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
I wasn't planning on arguing
with a dying person.

81
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
You have guts.

82
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,820
You have guts.

83
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,500
You asked for it.

84
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,500
Fine.

85
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,620
Brothers.

86
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,340
Whoever wants to follow me

87
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,380
will be treated nicely.

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,740
Whoever still wants to follow Luo Laowai,

89
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,660
I'll help you with that too.

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,220
Anyone?

91
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,460
- Me!
- Me!

92
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,500
- Me too.
- Me too.

93
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,700
Good.

94
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,180
Yang.

95
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
Back in the old days,

96
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,740
I explored Xiangxi single-handedly.

97
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,260
Today,

98
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,940
I'll leave without anything just as I came.

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,020
I won't be a burden on anyone.

100
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,180
Do it.

101
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
What are you waiting for?

102
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,368
Don't dillydally like a girl.

103
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,940
Come on.

104
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,660
Kill me.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,260
Do it now!

106
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,100
You bastard.

107
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,300
Frightened, huh?

108
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,020
Why are you so hesitant to kill him?

109
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,900
Just do it.

110
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,860
You've already had our loots,

111
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,820
tied us up.

112
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,380
Why do you have to kill us all?

113
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
Leader Chen.

114
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,940
You're my good brother.

115
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
I'm lucky enough

116
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,380
to have a sworn brother like you in my life.

117
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,300
I have no regrets anymore.

118
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
I'll go first.

119
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,580
See you in the Heaven.

120
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,740
Yang.

121
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,140
What are you waiting for?

122
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,380
Soldiers!

123
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,140
Yes!

124
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,460
Turn him around.

125
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,140
Yes.

126
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,100
Turn around.

127
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,940
Behave.

128
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,900
Turn around!

129
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,980
- Behave.
- Turn around!

130
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,900
Turn around!

131
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,340
If you dare,

132
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,460
shoot me in the face!

133
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,860
I want to see

134
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,180
how I die exactly.

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,712
You bastard! Damn you!

136
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Commander Luo!

137
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,740
Divisional commander Ma.

138
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,980
How about them?

139
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,820
If you ask me,

140
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,780
they are all skillful talents.

141
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,580
Two of them are even leaders
of Banshan and Xieling sects.

142
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,460
I always have a passion for talents.

143
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,660
If you don't mind,

144
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,300
welcome to my Dian military.

145
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,820
I want you to work for me so badly.

146
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,860
So badly!

147
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,900
No way!

148
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,940
We Xieling brothers

149
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,780
are definitely not afraid of death.

150
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,820
Leader Chen.

151
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,460
Never say never.

152
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Or you may be embarrassed later.

153
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,688
I know what you're thinking.

154
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,380
You've always been the leader.

155
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,460
It's always been you who give orders

156
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,580
or make decisions.

157
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,300
I completely understand.

158
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,060
But the situation is different now.

159
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,620
Their lives

160
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,900
should be decided by themselves.

161
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,980
Right?

162
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,980
Think about it.

163
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,420
Just answer me one word.

164
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,780
Me

165
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,020
or him.

166
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,860
Ever since I joined the Xieling sect…

167
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,020
Stop talking nonsense.

168
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,620
Never!

169
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,620
I… Get away from my brothers!

170
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,540
What about you?

171
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,780
Just kill me.

172
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,740
Stop.

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,060
Don't kill my brothers!

174
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
Kill me!

175
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,940
Behave yourself!

176
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,180
You scum!

177
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,780
Scum!

178
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,340
Human life means nothing to you!

179
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,300
You will get your retribution sooner or later!

180
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,420
I've got nothing to say

181
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,700
if God wants our Xieling people to die.

182
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm so sorry, my brothers!

183
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,740
You wanna be the hero here?

184
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,500
Then I will help you.

185
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,420
Boss!

186
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,460
- Leader.
- Leader.

187
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,660
Divisional commander Ma.

188
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,860
Are you really satisfied with these treasures?

189
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,700
The leader of Banshan.

190
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,780
What do you mean?

191
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,180
Banshan and Xieling have gone down
to the Bottle Mountain for three times.

192
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,500
Although we have suffered heavy losses
and gained little,

193
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,740
we've figured out that

194
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,300
there indeed are huge treasures
in the Bottle Mountian.

195
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
Now the bottleneck is collapsed.

196
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,820
The tomb hidden in the Bottle Mountain

197
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,220
must have fallen down
into the bottom of the Mountain.

198
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940
Those treasures

199
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,580
are the valuable ones that everyone wants.

200
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,260
Divisional Commander Ma.

201
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,660
Partridge Whistle is right.

202
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,460
Pull him up.

203
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,580
According to your opinion,
what will you do the next?

204
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
I'd like to cooperate with
the leader of Xieling again.

205
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,552
Whatever we get is yours.

206
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,460
You want to exchange all their lives

207
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,180
with such a heavy gift, right?

208
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,140
Exactly.

209
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,780
Divisional Commander Ma.

210
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,820
Partridge Whistle is telling the truth.

211
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,220
But we must not

212
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,900
let him cooperate with Chen Yulou,

213
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,420
so as not to create other problems.

214
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,100
I've heard the leader of Banshan sect
is extraordinary capable.

215
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,500
So, this time,

216
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,500
you just go alone.

217
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,940
Others stay here.

218
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,380
Or I would feel insecure.

219
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,540
I only need one more person.

220
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,260
Who?

221
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,300
Red Girl.

222
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,420
She is good at lock picking.

223
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,500
With her,

224
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,340
my chance of finding treasures will be higher.

225
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,780
Only a little girl?

226
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,380
Okay then.

227
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,900
Can you untie us

228
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,860
with your Moon sect skills?

229
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,220
That's easy.

230
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,340
It is said that in this forest, there are…

231
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,780
It's daytime. Be a man!

232
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,740
I think it's the sound of the Corpse King.

233
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,220
You two.

234
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,420
Lead the way ahead.

235
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,900
Hurry.

236
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,500
Follow them.

237
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
Stop.

238
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,220
Where are you leading to?

239
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm warning you.
Don't try to play any trick on me.

240
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Do you know any other way,
Lieutenant Yang?

241
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,860
Don't panic.

242
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,380
Follow them!

243
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,100
Go!

244
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,660
Follow them!

245
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,860
Who's there?

246
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,700
Who's there?

247
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,660
What's wrong?

248
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,700
Someone hit me with stones.

249
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,140
Sir!

250
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,024
I just saw a black shadow pass over there.

251
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,100
Don't talk rubbish in broad daylight!

252
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,300
Sir.

253
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,500
This is the Bottle Mountain.

254
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,460
It's the haunt of the Corpse King.

255
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,620
He eats people and livestock.

256
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,940
All the villagers nearby know about this.

257
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,620
He passed over there again.

258
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,100
I heard that the Corpse King is here indeed.

259
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,940
Go check it out.

260
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,540
You go.

261
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,420
Let's go together.

262
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,980
You two.

263
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,100
Stop frightening us in broad daylight.

264
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,380
Don't play tricks!

265
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,060
Follow up.

266
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,780
It's Violet Gold Coffin.

267
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,180
Could it be

268
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,260
the General of Yuan Dynasty's coffin?

269
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,180
How come…

270
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
The Violet Gold Coffin
must haven been shaken out

271
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,260
when the Bottle Mountain collapsed.

272
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,100
So that's…

273
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,860
That's the Corpse King!

274
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,500
The Corpse King?

275
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,620
Don't panic!

276
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,940
We've got so many people

277
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,180
and so many guns.

278
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,740
There's no need to be afraid of a dead body
which is hundreds of years old.

279
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,860
You.

280
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,340
Go check it out.

281
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,540
Stop staring at me!

282
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,820
Don't you think you should untie him first

283
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,500
if you want him to go and have a look?

284
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,380
You two.

285
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,100
Take him there.

286
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,820
Go!

287
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,340
Let's go, go.

288
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,300
Let's go, go.

289
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,060
Be cautious.

290
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,180
The corpse has come back to life.

291
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,940
It's alive!

292
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,220
Partridge Whistle.

293
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,460
Get your hands off me!

294
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,660
Get your hands off me!

295
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,340
Don't panic.

296
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,820
It's just a white ape.

297
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,060
It's okay, it's a white ape.

298
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,900
White ape.

299
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,300
Alright then.

300
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,540
It's just a white ape.

301
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,620
Get your hands off me!

302
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,420
I said, get your hands off me!

303
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,780
It's alright, regimental commander.
It's dead.

304
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,740
Corpse King of Xiangxi.

305
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,860
I finally got you.

306
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,700
It's alive!

307
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,580
It's alive!

308
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,260
It has come back to life!

309
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,340
- It has come back to life!
- It has come back to life!

310
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,860
What the hell?

311
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Use grenades!

312
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,660
Go and have a look!

313
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,940
- Got it.
- Got it.

314
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,540
What's this?

315
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,220
Regimental commander.

316
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,140
Regimental commander.

317
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,740
It's just a group of jungle monkeys.

318
00:25:57,328 --> 00:25:58,000
Damn it.

319
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,740
Just some jungle monkeys.

320
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,780
Regimental commander.

321
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,820
There are always groups of jungle monkeys

322
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,540
fooling around the Mengdong River basin.

323
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,220
These monkeys know that

324
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,580
the businessmen who travel here

325
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,780
always bring drinks and dry food with them.

326
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,220
So they'd hide in the jungle,

327
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,340
hit those businessmen with stones,

328
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,660
and rob their food

329
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,580
as well as their clothes and goods.

330
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,300
No wonder.

331
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,540
It must also be those monkeys

332
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,780
which attacked our men at the mountain last time.

333
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,460
The fur of this old ape has changed from gray to silver,

334
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,660
implying that it's normal anymore.

335
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,780
Look at what it did just now.

336
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,392
I guess it was no good in normal times.

337
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,860
This white ape

338
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,260
isn't faking his death, right?

339
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,820
Alright then.

340
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,020
I'll do a good deed today.

341
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,660
Let me kill this bastard.

342
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,380
The old ape is stuck under the coffin.

343
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,580
It won't live long.

344
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,940
You don't have to be so ruthless.

345
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,180
You can't even protect yourself.

346
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,940
Mind your own business.

347
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,700
Just save yourself some virtue, okay?

348
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,100
You…

349
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,980
Lieutenant Yang,

350
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,060
everything has its own rules.

351
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,380
We don't have to go against the nature.

352
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,220
What do you mean?

353
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,380
There are so many living things in this world.

354
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,980
If their longevity is too long,

355
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,740
then they will be annihilated by the God.

356
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,420
But if they could manage to escape
from all kinds of disasters,

357
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,020
then they can jump out of the samsara,

358
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,260
go to the Heaven

359
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,660
and become immortal.

360
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
This old ape wouldn't have been hit

361
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,460
if it were one step ahead

362
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,740
or one step back.

363
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,700
This unfortunate accident

364
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,140
was ruled by the God.

365
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,460
Whether it would be dead or alive

366
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,420
is decided by the God.

367
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,460
There is no need to bring troubles to ourselves.

368
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,180
Alright then.

369
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,700
For your sake,

370
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,420
I'll save a bullet today

371
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,460
and spare its life.

372
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,620
Brothers.

373
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,440
Take all the gold, silver, jade
and copper on the ground.

374
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,580
- Yes.
- Yes.

375
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,020
Come on.

376
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,500
Here.

377
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,780
Search carefully.

378
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,860
Here.

379
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,980
Come on, here.

380
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,060
The General of Yuan Dynasty

381
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,540
really is in that Violet Gold Coffin?

382
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,340
Come on, here!

383
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,300
The culture of the Western Region is unique.

384
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,460
Their funeral customs are different
from those of central China.

385
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,380
Depends on the pattern
and luxury level of this coffin,

386
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,820
the General is probably in there.

387
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,180
So the story of Corpse King of Xiangxin is true?

388
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,576
In the remote mountainous areas

389
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,824
of Hunan, Guizhou, Fujian
and Guangdong province,

390
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,900
there are always stories about
corpses coming back to life.

391
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,100
The revived corpse

392
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,140
would use its own coffin as the nest

393
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,740
and is covered with fur.

394
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,260
It often comes out and eats human beings

395
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,584
and livestock.

396
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,340
The folks call it

397
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,500
the Corpse King.

398
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,900
And there's another story about it.

399
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,380
It is said that the appearance
of the name of the Corpse King

400
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,260
is because the deceased
used to have a prominent status,

401
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,860
the funerary objects and the antiseptic objects

402
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
are all precious and secretive.

403
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,780
Once the corpse comes back to life,

404
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,620
it will definitely go crazy.

405
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,820
Common instruments, such as ecliptic paper

406
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,540
or mahogany swords,

407
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,900
won't work at all.

408
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,300
The Corpse King must be a nobleman
when he was alive.

409
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,220
If it's just an ordinary corpse coming back to life,

410
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,780
it wouldn't be called as the Corpse King.

411
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,460
So the Corpse King

412
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,540
is a kind of folk prejudice
of advocating power.

413
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,060
There is also a saying that

414
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,860
the reason why there is fur on the corpse

415
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,820
is due to the effect of mildew.

416
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,060
The corpse was in the sealed coffin
for thousands of years,

417
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,380
and the air was not circulating,

418
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,020
so when we open that coffin,

419
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,500
the thousand-year-old corpse

420
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,820
would look like a living person.

421
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,100
Check over there.

422
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,580
Be careful, everyone!

423
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,260
There.

424
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,008
Search carefully!

425
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,344
Let's do it.
