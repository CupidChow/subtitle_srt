1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 11=

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,760
Here it is.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
What is it?

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
Look at the water seepage.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Whirly and clogged.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,920
But the water here seeps down really fast.

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,560
It must be hollow inside.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
If I'm not mistaken,

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,320
we can dig a tomb hole from here,

31
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,800
and directly go to the Underground Palace.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
Commander Luo,

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
the mountain wouldn't collapse
if we keep bombing, right?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,840
Relax. I know what I'm doing.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I mean do we have enough explosives?

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,440
Looks like it's gonna last forever.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,200
Of course we do.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,920
The explosives are not the problem.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,480
Keep burying, keep bombing.

40
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,240
Got it!

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,480
Keep burying.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,880
Boss and his men have started.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
We shouldn't wait any more.

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
It's gonna take us a while to dig through the hole.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,440
We are short of men.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
Go up and get some help.

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Yes.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,760
Don't bother.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
You guys take a break.

50
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
What do you mean?

51
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
Bring me my Juezi pangolins.

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,480
Sure.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
What is a Juezi pangolin?

54
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,440
You are new, right?

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,600
Everyone has heard about the Banshan Fenjia skill.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
But people from Banshan sect

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
generally do not interact with outsiders.

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,680
So,

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,240
no one has ever witnessed a Juezi pangolin.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
It is so eye-opening today.

61
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,280
They're living things.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,864
- Are they Xueling pangolins?
- I've never seen them before.

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,240
You guys check it out.

64
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,400
Look.

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,680
Interesting.

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
Interesting.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,560
What are they doing?

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
They…they're transforming.

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,160
Look.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,040
The two little things.

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,360
Incredible.

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,280
Impressive.

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,840
Don't panic.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,000
- Their acupoints are all locked with copper rings.
- Come over here.

75
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,160
They can't escape even if they have
the strength to dig through the mountain.

76
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,840
Come over here.

77
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,640
They're quite docile.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
So your Banshan's so-called unique skill

79
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
is performed by these two little things?

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,920
Don't worry. The best is yet to come.

81
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,040
The Banshan sect always uses the Juezi pangolin
to dig tomb holes.

82
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,880
It's known as the Three Nails and Four Pangolins.

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
I've lived in Changshengshan Mountain for many years.

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
But I've never heard of it.

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,720
The Xueling Pangolin is one of the Four Pangolins.

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
Such a skill can only be used

87
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,720
within the Hunan, Guizhou, Fujian
and Guangdong province.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,320
But we can act according to local conditions

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,200
and use other Juezi pangolins.

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
This is the Qie Knack of the Banshan sect.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Old Foreigner.

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Alright.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,520
Come here.

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,000
Come here.

95
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:27,960
Let's go.

96
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,600
Come on.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,440
Let's go and have a look.

98
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
They are digging.

99
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,560
These two Xueling pangolins are digging up and down.

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
They dig separately but march through together.

101
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Digging the hard soil is just
as simple as digging tofu for them.

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,160
They dig into the mountain just like a duck to water.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Everyone here in Xieling

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,160
is shocked by the sight in front of them.

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
I've never seen this before.

106
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,960
Me too.

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
They're digging really fast.

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I've just heard it before.

109
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,200
It's still gonna take some time.

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,280
Let's take a break

111
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,800
and save some energy.

112
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,920
Interesting.

113
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,520
Step aside.

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
They're digging into the rocks again.

115
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,680
Look. They're going into the rocks again.

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Leader.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
Check it out.

118
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,120
You know what's this?

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,760
Bird droppings.

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,000
They're eatable.

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
There are some sayings about them.

122
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,400
Let me tell you.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,880
The first saying is about wild geese droppings.

124
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,760
If we pick some, bring them home and wash them out,

125
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
there may be

126
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,440
some wheat grains or corns.

127
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
If you get lucky

128
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
and just save a handful of them,

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,680
your families can have a pot of porridge.

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,080
The second one is about water bird droppings.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,760
Bluish white, but not stinky.

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,600
You can also bring some home and wash them out,

133
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,640
and then steam them,

134
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,600
which also can become a kind of food.

135
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
When I was 12 years old, there was a serious drought in my hometown.

136
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,080
Every family was short of food and had nothing to eat.

137
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,280
Wild vegetables, straws, corn stalks,

138
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,760
we ate all of them.

139
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
But we were still starving.

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,760
We could only search food from the bird droppings.

141
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,720
That day,

142
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
in Xiangyin County,

143
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,920
I happened to see you donate the grains for the poor.

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
I was just

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
quite moved.

146
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
And since that day,

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840
I began to

148
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,480
really admire you.

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,640
And the refugees

150
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,880
were so lucky.

151
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Thanks to a nice person like you,

152
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,840
they could have steamed buns and drink porridge.

153
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,000
So much better than I was.

154
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,520
When I was little,

155
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
my father passed away.

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
My mother raised me up by herself,

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,440
as well as my two brothers and two sisters.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,680
That was a hard time.

159
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,560
When I grew up a little bit,

160
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,080
my mother kicked me out of home

161
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,480
and asked me to go to Hunan province to visit my relatives.

162
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,640
Unexpectedly, they treated me like I was the god of plague,

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,800
they didn't want to see me at all.

164
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,360
It was truly a case of being left alone.

165
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,080
I almost starved to death on the street.

166
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,920
Do you know why they didn't want to see me?

167
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,560
There is a saying that,

168
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,880
poor people are afraid of meeting relatives.

169
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Just for one reason, I was poor.

170
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
If you were poor, you would be despised

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,200
and looked down upon.

172
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,200
So since that time,

173
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
I swore to myself,

174
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
I would definitely live a great life.

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,640
Someday, I'll let them know that

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,120
I, Luo Laowai, am somebody.

177
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,040
It's really hard for you to become who you are today.

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Exactly.

179
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,640
Leader.

180
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm a rough man.

181
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,040
I really appreciate that you think highly of me,

182
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,360
and are willing to work with me.

183
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,040
I'll never forget that in my life.

184
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,920
Also,

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that day in Urn city,

186
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,040
I did something wrong.

187
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
Instead of blaming me,

188
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
you saved my life.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,400
I'll remember that, too.

190
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
But,

191
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
I really have a bad temper,

192
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,120
no one can stop me when I lose my temper.

193
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,856
So,

194
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,360
the night before last, I yelled at you

195
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,640
and made you piss off.

196
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Now,

197
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,680
I want to apologize to you.

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,720
Get up.

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,520
Luo.

200
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,840
After all,

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,360
we are the sworn brothers.

202
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
Let bygones be bygones

203
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,910
This time,

204
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,320
we are going to do something big together.

205
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
No problem.

206
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
With your words,

207
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,640
I am so relieved.

208
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,840
Fire.

209
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,960
Sister Hualing.

210
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,120
About the Xueling pangolin,

211
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,840
why that Old Foreigner only caught the small one?

212
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
Wouldn't he be worried about the big one escaping?

213
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,680
That's impossible.

214
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,200
They will never leave the other.

215
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
They are so on intimate terms.

216
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,240
If we have one,

217
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
the other would not run away.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,680
By the way,

219
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,240
it just came to my mind that I've heard

220
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,680
that the occult skills of the Xueling sect

221
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,880
had already lost since Tang Dynasty.

222
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Why you Banshan guys still know how to do them?

223
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,360
Sister Red,

224
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,080
we Banshan sect has lots of occult skills.

225
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Then do you know how to do the skills?

226
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
No.

227
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,920
But my elder brother,

228
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,840
he can do all of them.

229
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,160
Really?

230
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,680
Of course.

231
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
We Banshan sect

232
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
has a history of more than two thousand years.

233
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,840
We have numerous capable people.

234
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,680
But my elder brother

235
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
can be counted as one of the very best.

236
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,520
Then your master must be very brilliant.

237
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,120
We don't have masters or apprentices.

238
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,080
Only the elder brothers
teach their younger brothers and sisters.

239
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Girl,

240
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
then why there are only a few people

241
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
in your Banshan sect?

242
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,760
Of course.

243
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,368
Not everyone can join us easily.

244
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,120
He has to pass the tests from our elder brothers.

245
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,040
Also,

246
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,040
he has to master at least one stunt.

247
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,680
Otherwise,

248
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
he can't join us anyway.

249
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,200
What kind of stunts do you have?

250
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Could you tell us?

251
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,280
Let us learn something.

252
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah. Tell us.

253
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,880
Please.

254
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
My elder brother

255
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,280
once asked me

256
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,480
to pick ten frost-light leaves within 2 hours.

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,640
The leaves are used as antidote.

258
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,480
They grow between the cliffs,

259
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,040
and is quite separate from each other.

260
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,360
You can imagine how hard it is.

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,600
What's more terrible was

262
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,080
we were asked not to use any tool.

263
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,880
I guess you picked them all.

264
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,160
Right.

265
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,360
But 15 minutes late.

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,400
Why?

267
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,200
Sister Red,

268
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,080
actually,

269
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,240
I could have gone back within 2 hours.

270
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,360
But I met a granny who sprained her ankle

271
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
on my half way back.

272
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,600
I applied some herb on her ankle. That's why I was late.

273
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
Based on the rules,

274
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,120
I absolutely couldn't join them.

275
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
But my elder brother,

276
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,760
he pushed aside all obstacles and difficulties and let me in.

277
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
So in fact,

278
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,640
throughout the Banshan sect,

279
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,880
except my elder brother Partridge Whistle,

280
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,400
I was the only exception.

281
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,960
Why?

282
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,080
Yeah, why?

283
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,600
Because my elder brother said

284
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,200
that one person

285
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,720
cannot live only with capabilities,

286
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,600
but also with good thoughts and good deeds.

287
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,080
Only by doing so can he

288
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,600
become a real Banshan Taoist.

289
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,240
Though

290
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,040
he usually is taciturn

291
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
and inflexible,

292
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
actually,

293
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,600
his thoughts

294
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,840
are quite different from most people.

295
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,120
What about the Old Foreigner? How did he join you?

296
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,240
Oh, he's so skilled at archery.

297
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,160
He can shoot through three sparrows with one arrow.

298
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,160
Three sparrows!

299
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,720
Incredible.

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,520
Right?

301
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,320
- So impressive.
- Brilliant.

302
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,040
Nice shot.

303
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,280
Just now, you said that your elder brother Partridge Whistle,

304
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
he's another one who joined the Banshan sect
by breaking the rules?

305
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Yes, he joined them when he was very young.

306
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,920
But at that time,

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,920
his elder brother didn't want to take him in,

308
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,200
because he was too young
and was in a bad condition.

309
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,680
But he wanted to prove himself.

310
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,200
So he had gone to the wolf valley all alone,

311
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,280
and didn't come back for three days and nights.

312
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,400
When people found him,

313
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,400
guess what happened?

314
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,680
- What? What?
- Tell us, please.

315
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,280
My elder brother,

316
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,560
he was covered all over with blood,

317
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,760
stood outside the wolf valley with a knife in his hand.

318
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
People went into the wolf valley and found that

319
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,720
he killed more than ten wolves.

320
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,240
Incredible.

321
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,960
Yes.

322
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,040
More than ten wolves.

323
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
But,

324
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,280
no matter who asks him about this afterwards,

325
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,200
he won't say a single word

326
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,160
about what happened that day.

327
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,480
But since then,

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,960
he had officially joined the Banshan sect,

329
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,920
and soon he became the leader.

330
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
Everyone is sincerely convinced.

331
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
How old was he when he joined the Banshan sect?

332
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
How could he go to the wolf valley alone?

333
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,680
Where were his parents?

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
Why are you so interested in the Banshan sect, Red Girl?

335
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,600
Yeah, why?

336
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
She's not just interested in the Banshan sect.

337
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,872
- Come on.
- Come on.

338
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,264
Here, have some betel nuts to refresh yourselves.

339
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,400
Who's there?

340
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,120
Come out.

341
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,160
I'll definitely kill you if I catch you.

342
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,000
Come out!

343
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,440
Oh, good.

344
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,920
Imported goods.

345
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
Brother Min. Brother Min.

346
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,440
You just rendered outstanding service.

347
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,760
Wait for your rewards.

348
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,720
Elder brother.

349
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,760
The cave of mountain ridge is broken through,

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,400
the prosperity grows like rising wind and water.

351
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,800
What does it mean?

352
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,000
The water means wealth or funerary ware.

353
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
The rising wind and water

354
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,000
means we found the Underground Ming Palace.

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,600
Great.

356
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,960
Now that the tomb hole is opened up,

357
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,680
Red Girl, could you please send someone to inform them

358
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,600
to come down and join us?

359
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,440
You two.

360
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,760
Go up to inform Leader quickly.

361
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
Yes.

362
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,280
Elder brother,

363
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,320
it's so inconceivable in here.

364
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,160
Let's go.

365
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
There's still a while before they get down.

366
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,200
Instead of just waiting here,

367
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,840
we'd better explore the Palace first.

368
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Okay.

369
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,560
You four follow me in.

370
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,880
Others stay here.

371
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,640
- Roger that.
- Got it.

372
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Let's go.

373
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,360
Careful.

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Take it easy.

375
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,160
Since this morning,

376
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,920
we have bombed more than 50 sites right?

377
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
I guess, if we keep bombing like this,

378
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
we just need another day

379
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,080
to search the Bottle Mountain through.

380
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,360
I don't think so.

381
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,920
The Bottle Mountain is quite hard and thick.

382
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,360
The soil gathers very tight.

383
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,760
If we bomb from the south,

384
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,360
we can't make it within one or two days.

385
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
That doesn't matter.

386
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,360
Add more explosives.

387
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,360
Add more explosives and keep bombing.

388
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,840
Leader.

389
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
Something's wrong.

390
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
What happened?

391
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,440
Over there.

392
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:35,840
What?

393
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,320
Commander Luo.

394
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,240
What happened?

395
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Leader. Look.

396
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
So many stones.

397
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,840
Trying to play guessing game with me?

398
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,280
Commander Luo.

399
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
I also just arrived here.

400
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,120
My subordinates report that

401
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,120
some of our patrolling brothers are missing.

402
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,480
We don't know where they are.

403
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,944
We just found these stones with blood.

404
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,120
Looks like our guys are attacked.

405
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,960
Of course.

406
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,200
I'm not blind, okay?

407
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
I can see the blood on the stones.

408
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm asking where the blood comes from.

409
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,560
And where our people are.

410
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Sorry.

411
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
We are in such a barren wasteland here.

412
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,640
Who the hell are you to come out and scare me?

413
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
Leader.

414
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,320
It is said that there is a Xiangxi Corpse King in Bottle Mountain.

415
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,720
Is it possible that…

416
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,640
No.

417
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
Even if there is a Corpse King,

418
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
how can he come out and attack people with stones

419
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
in the daytime?

420
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,560
What are you doing there?

421
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,440
Leader.

422
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
We just came back from the foot of the mountain.

423
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,920
What happened?

424
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
The Banshan sect has already dug through the hole there.

425
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
Elder brother, come here.

426
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,640
Come here.

427
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,880
Incredible.

428
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
It''s like a underground fairyland.

429
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,800
Elder brother.

430
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,160
It doesn't quite look like a tomb of Yuan dynasty,

431
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,560
but...

432
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,360
It's a Tao palace for making
pills of former emperors.

433
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
Making pills?

434
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,560
For immortality?

435
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,400
Immortality

436
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,960
is just a sweet dream of the Emperors.

437
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,840
When the country disintegrated,

438
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
these palaces

439
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,880
became the grave of this general of Yuan dynasty.

440
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,960
Hold on.

441
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
I think we should come back,

442
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,560
waiting for Leader Chen,

443
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,920
and then act together.

444
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,840
They're coming out.
They're coming out.

445
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,520
The Leader still hasn't arrived yet?

446
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,480
No.

447
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,840
Let's expand this hole

448
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,040
while the large group of them are not here yet.

449
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,600
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

450
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,160
I didn't expect that

451
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,000
the toy boy Partridge Whistle

452
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,440
can really do something.

453
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
Let's go and check it out.

454
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,480
- Got it.
- Got it.

455
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,960
I did hear about the Banshan Fenjia skill.

456
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
It's nothing new

457
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,640
and is unworthy of its name.

458
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
That's just some fraudulent tricks.

459
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
They just got lucky.

460
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,520
As for real skills,

461
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,080
it must be us, the Xieling sect.

462
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
We are the ones who work in a thoroughgoing manner,

463
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,120
and have made our way to now step by step.

464
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
Especially you, our Leader.

465
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,000
Stop it.

466
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,160
We're brothers who have drank
and burnt the yellow paper together.

467
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,280
We should make concerted efforts.

468
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,800
It is a joyful thing no matter who found it.

469
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,520
We should share our findings.

470
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,160
Don't say this nonsense.

471
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,680
You're right, Leader.

472
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,920
Sorry for my short sight

473
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,240
and narrow mind.

474
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,080
Hurry up, guys.

475
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,480
We have to finish expanding this

476
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,920
before our boss comes back.

477
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
Okay.

478
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,560
Come and eat.

479
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
Well done today.

480
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,000
This big meal is for you.

481
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
Come on, eat more.

482
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,960
So adorable.

483
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,800
Pass me the basket.

484
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,160
Red Girl,

485
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,360
do you have any questions?

486
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,760
If it's something about Banshan,

487
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,400
you can ask me directly.

488
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,760
You don't have to ask Hualing.

489
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,760
I know more than her.

490
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,520
If not,

491
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,840
I'll leave now.

492
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,680
I do have a question for you.

493
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,360
Go ahead.

494
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,200
I'm still thinking about it.

495
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,400
I'll ask you when I figure it out.

496
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,720
You can't eat it. You can't.

497
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
Elder brother.

498
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,160
I found the small one always bullys the big one.

499
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
Why?

500
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't know, either.

501
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,680
Where is the tomb tunnel?

502
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,880
Let me see.

503
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,440
Finally. My treasure.

504
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Brother Partridge Whistle.

505
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
- Brother Partridge Whistle.
- Where is he?

506
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,800
Brother Partridge Whistle.

507
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,040
It's awesome.

508
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,040
I've bombed the mountain for such a long time,

509
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,160
and found nothing.

510
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,320
You, you find out the tomb tunnel quietly.

511
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,800
Brilliant. You gained my respect.

512
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,240
Boss. Look.

513
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,320
I'm flattered, Commander Luo.

514
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,920
Don't be modest.

515
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,400
Brother Partridge Whistle.

516
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,480
This time, the Banshan Sect renders an extraordinary service.

517
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,240
Brilliant. Brilliant.

518
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,680
Bro,

519
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,040
we're all counting on you to find the treasures.

520
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,800
Brother Chen.

521
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,520
I've heard that the Banshan Sect is quite capable.

522
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,600
This is my eye-opening day.

523
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,680
Boss.

524
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,200
I thought he was just a Taoist before

525
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,160
who can only draw some fake ghost catchers

526
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,240
and be deliberately mystifying.

527
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,560
I didn't expect that

528
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,000
he really has some skills and courage.

529
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,320
Don't say that.

530
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,760
Partridge Whistle

531
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,720
is a wonderful young man after all.

532
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,720
Under his leadership,

533
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,520
the Banshan sect will develop
and glorify sooner or later.

534
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
It's very kind of you, Brother Chen.

535
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,000
I've heard that

536
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,080
it is your Juezi pangolins
that find out the tomb tunnel.

537
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,880
What are those wondrous things?
Can I see them?

538
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
These wondrous things.

539
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,600
They would bite you.

540
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,720
Careful.

541
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I didn't expect them to be living things.

542
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,320
Amazing. It's so amazing.

543
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,040
Brother Partridge Whistle.

544
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,240
Let's get back to the tomb hole.

545
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,440
Let's go back.

546
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,800
I know you are talented and intelligent.

547
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,360
You can break the sinister appearance
and expel the evil spirits.

548
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,040
I don't want you to die
as a nameless ordinary person.

549
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,160
So I saved you from the knife.

550
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,880
Today,

551
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,720
there must be a hard fighting of death and life.

552
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,320
What else you can do?

553
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,920
Call on all your skills.

554
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,840
Do not damage your reputation of the Nuqing Golden Rooster.

555
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,680
Big brother.

556
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,720
Can this Golden Rooster

557
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,680
really understand what you're talking about?

558
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,160
Leader Chen.

559
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,280
What are you waiting for?

560
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,600
Let's go into the tomb hole.

561
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,000
After you, Commander Luo.

562
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,520
No problem.

563
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,520
Let me take the lead.
I'll go inside first.

564
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,160
I'd like to see what does this general

565
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,120
of Yuan Dynasty look like.

566
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,840
Follow me.

567
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,800
Red Girl.

569
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
You stay outside the hole,

570
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,680
and watch them widening it.

571
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,320
Cripple Huama will follow me in.

572
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,520
Let's go.

573
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,540
Boss.
