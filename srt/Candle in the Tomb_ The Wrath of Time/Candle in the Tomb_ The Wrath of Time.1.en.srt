1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,720
Dust bead!

22
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,400
Brother, look at that.

23
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
No!

24
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,880
It's Corpse Freezing Pill.

25
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,520
Brother, here is an inlaid eyeball.

26
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,320
Don't touch it!

27
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,360
Run!

28
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:44,300
=Candle in the Tomb : the Wrath of Time=

29
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,180
=Episode 1=

30
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
The story says that,

31
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
Hu Bayi and Wang Fatty,

32
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,240
after returning from the Jingjue Ancient City,

33
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,320
found a ghost curse like an eye in their body.

34
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,520
In order to find clues to release the curse,

35
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,680
the two went to inquire with Shirley Yang.

36
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,960
After several twists and turns,

37
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
they finally found the former head of Xieling sect.

38
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Chen Yulou, a blind man.

39
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
After learning the intentions of the three,

40
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,320
he had a long sigh,

41
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,680
and groped for an old book on the table.

42
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,960
It mentioned the two sects, Banshan and Xieling,

43
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,280
and strange things happened
as they entered the Bottle Mountain.

44
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,600
Blind Chen described it vividly,

45
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,920
unfolding an earth-shattering

46
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,080
and magnificent story.

47
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,720
At that time, Chen YuLou was the head of Xieling,

48
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
leading tens of thousands of disciples.

49
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,640
He is born with a pair of night eyes, seeing things in the dark.

50
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,680
With the treasure-seeking talents inherited from his ancestors,

51
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,840
he was respected by all,

52
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,640
except his father.

53
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,280
However, with good wills,

54
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,560
he helps the poor with his own money.

55
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
At that time, warlords were fighting against one another,

56
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,720
and the people in Xiangxi were suffering.

57
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
When Chen Yulou saw this,

58
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,440
he ordered the opening of his own granary to release food.

59
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,360
The refugees were saved and respected him.

60
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,550
However, more refugees from other places rushed in,

61
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
and as the granary became empty,

62
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,320
he could hardly keep helping them.

63
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
Great!

64
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,120
Long did I sigh to hold back tears,

65
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,080
saddened I am by the grief of the people.

66
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,840
Leader Chen,

67
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,600
after years of not seeing you,

68
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
now

69
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,400
you have become a relief donor.

70
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
Isn't Commander Luo ever more prestige?

71
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,880
I heard that all the military power in Xiangxi

72
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,840
has been under your command.

73
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
That's unworthy of mentioning.

74
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,720
I'm just a leader of such small armies,

75
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,040
while you are

76
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,280
the head of the Xieling sect,

77
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
excelling in exploring treasures in the mountains.

78
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,840
So you must have heard about the treasures.

79
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,280
Won't you want to have a try?

80
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,960
Many forces are already coming for it.

81
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
In my opinion,

82
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,440
I'd rather do it early than late.

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,360
I have guns and persons,

84
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,920
and the explosives are well prepared for you.

85
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,160
Leader Chen,

86
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,600
you have the ability to explore the treasures,

87
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
and a lot of Xieling disciples to help you.

88
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
If we work together, great things will be achieved.

89
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Look, look!

90
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,480
Look at these refugees.

91
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,280
How pitiful they are!

92
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Leader Chen,

93
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,480
you have been offering them food for over a month!

94
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,240
It's really a good act.

95
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
I admire you, very much.

96
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,560
However,

97
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,720
I have to say,

98
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,160
it cannot last long.

99
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
Leader Chen,

100
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,640
now the world is too chaotic,

101
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,640
and refugees from other places are pouring into here.

102
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,040
If we do not protect ourselves,

103
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,920
sooner or later,

104
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,520
people here will become refugees too.

105
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
This time, I invited brother Chen

106
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
to explore treasures to enrich the military.

107
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,840
This is actually not for my own sake,

108
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,120
I just want to enhance my strength

109
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,080
to protect my people in Xiangxi

110
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
from foreign invasion.

111
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Leader Chen,

112
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,720
you will not watch the people

113
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,120
being displaced, will you?

114
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Or we can do this,

115
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,920
you and I will explore treasures together.

116
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,760
After getting the treasures,

117
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,160
you decide how to use them,

118
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,760
I will have no objection at all.

119
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,960
How about that?

120
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,000
Xiaoyangzi.

121
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,720
Here.

122
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,080
Tiger-headed circular plate with Basiba language.

123
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,560
A unique object of the Yuan Dynasty.

124
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,480
Good eye!

125
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,520
Good eye!

126
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,320
Brother Chen,

127
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
I will tell you honestly,

128
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
this treasure

129
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,280
is said to get from the area of the Old Bear Ridge,

130
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,560
a Miao Village.

131
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,880
How about that.

132
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,400
Would you like to

133
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
explore treasures with me?

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
You want to see me?

135
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,080
I would say you are overestimating yourself.

136
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,960
Old Bear Ridge is always a dangerous place.

137
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,040
People who went there never return.

138
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,200
I have never dared to go there in my life.

139
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,400
What qualifications do you have?

140
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,040
Not really.

141
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,120
What can't be accomplished by your predecessors

142
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,160
may be achieved by the successors.

143
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,520
I can't stop you from dying.

144
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
But for the people who don't matter,

145
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,400
you put yourself in danger.

146
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,160
It's very ridiculous.

147
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
After so many years,

148
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,400
you have no progress at all.

149
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,960
It's so disappointing.

150
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,880
Everyone has his own ambition.

151
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Now the times are in chaos, the people are displaced.

152
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,600
I also want to do something useful with my uselessness.

153
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,040
Bastard!

154
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,640
Do you want me to die because of anger?

155
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,200
Cripple,

156
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,840
what did I tell you?

157
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,840
I told you to help him,

158
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,480
and you helped him to death.

159
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,040
Old Leader, I鈥?

160
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,960
The son is not filial, you take care.

161
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,560
This bastard,

162
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,080
may die outside sooner or later.

163
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,240
Cripple.

164
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,360
Brothers,

165
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,480
our sect of Xieling begins with Chimei sect.

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,560
From the ancestors,

167
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,280
there is an act of using emperor's wealth

168
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,400
to help poor people.

169
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,720
World reincarnation.

170
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,480
Nowdays,

171
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,600
the people's lives are miserable.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,400
Most of you are born in poverty,

173
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,320
and thus should contribute to this world.

174
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,640
Now there is an area of treasures in Xiangxi

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,480
with countless golden jade,

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,800
which are all the blood and sweat of the people.

177
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,160
We can just follow the example of Chimei sect.

178
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,120
Inherit the ancestral training

179
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,240
and cooperate with Commander Luo

180
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
to take the treasures of the mountains and relieve the world.

181
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,240
Great!

182
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,280
Let's do it!

183
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,640
Red Girl and Kunlun.

184
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,120
Here.

185
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,080
I'm going to take you both first

186
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,200
to inquire the nearby Miao Village.

187
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,000
The big troops will follow us

188
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,080
and be on standby.

189
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,760
Ok!

190
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Go!

191
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,160
Wait a minute.

192
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,680
I'm wondering

193
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
if you can change your clothes,

194
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
it's easy to scare people.

195
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
You dressed neither like a woman nor a man.

196
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,680
It will affect me to do things, do you know?

197
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
What do you mean, my clothes?

198
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
You want me to change it myself?

199
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,600
Go!

200
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,320
Yes!

201
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Go!

202
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,160
Leader Chen,

203
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,440
in my opinion

204
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,280
let's get started immediately

205
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,760
to avoid being taken over by others.

206
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Commander Luo

207
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,720
don't worry.

208
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,600
Do you know why, for so many years,

209
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,320
no one can find this treasure of Yuan Dynasty.

210
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me.

211
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,440
This treasure of the Yuan has always been quite rich,

212
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,200
but when compared with the Central Plains,

213
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,680
it's still very different.

214
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Especially those underground palaces, it's very difficult to find.

215
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
What's more, it's located in

216
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,520
the Miaojiang section of Xiangxi.

217
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,320
It's very dangerous and very difficult to enter.

218
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,440
But fortunately you have me.

219
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,280
In this world

220
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,800
there is no road that I cannot find.

221
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,120
Ok!

222
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
With Leader Chen's words

223
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,880
I'm at ease.

224
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,120
Has everything been ready?

225
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Yes!

226
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,880
My engineering battalion and pistol battalion

227
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
follow behind

228
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,240
waiting to be dispatched at any time.

229
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,800
Commander Luo.

230
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,200
Leader.

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Kunlun.

232
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,960
Leader.

233
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,160
The Huama cripple also came

234
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,720
ordered by your father.

235
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,280
Look at you.

236
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,440
Am I so unreliable,

237
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,760
and need to be taken care of all the time?

238
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Red Girl,

239
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,080
you look better in women's clothes.

240
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,600
So pretty!

241
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,560
I almost can't recognize you.

242
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
The waist is so slender.

243
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,360
I like it.

244
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
You are a girl,

245
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,160
but always follow a group of men

246
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
to run around.

247
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,240
This is not good.

248
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
It's better to go with me

249
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,120
and I guarantee to let you enjoy great wealth.

250
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,560
That butt is so round, looks鈥?

251
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,120
Commander Luo,

252
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,160
Red Girl is a tough girl.

253
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,320
She was at the Moon Gate as a child,

254
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,400
and learned Kongfu.

255
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,280
At the age of 16,

256
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
she was liked by the bully in the village.

257
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,600
The bully wanted to take her as a concubine

258
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
and killed her father.

259
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,760
She destroyed the whole family of the bully in a rage.

260
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,520
The fire burned for three days and three nights,

261
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
a family of 17,

262
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
no one was left.

263
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
In Xieling Sect, none of thousands of men

264
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,920
dared to provoke her.

265
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
This hot temper,

266
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,360
I like it.

267
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,840
These people of Miao have complicated rules.

268
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
We must be careful when we go in.

269
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Ok!

270
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
What are you doing?

271
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,920
Get out, outsiders are not welcomed here.

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,400
Go! Go!

273
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,040
Brothers,

274
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
don't misunderstand.

275
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,400
We are just the traders
who exchange goods in the mountains.

276
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,440
Today we pass through this place,

277
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
and just want to exchange some mountain goods.

278
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,480
We hope you give us some convenience.

279
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,160
They are traders and want to exchange mountain goods.

280
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,920
Yes!

281
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,240
Come here, just take a look.

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Take a look.

283
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,680
Little brother,

284
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,920
your mandarin is good.

285
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,960
What's your name?

286
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,160
My name is Rongbao Yixiao.

287
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,840
So

288
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,280
I find that the people in your village

289
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,680
seem to dislike outsiders.

290
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,680
There have been several thieves in the stockade before,

291
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,360
so everyone teamed up

292
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,360
to protect the stockade.

293
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,720
I see.

294
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
What are you doing?

295
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,480
Don't move! Don't move!

296
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,800
Don't move!

297
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,920
Please don't misunderstand.

298
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,040
Come here, Old Luo, come here.

299
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,360
This is also the mountain goods we want to exchange.

300
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,760
This is a revolver made in USA.

301
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,720
Look at this handle, it's all made of ivory.

302
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,800
Take a look.

303
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,400
If you are going to shoot birds and rabbits,

304
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
it's as easy as taking something out of pocket.

305
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,480
Is this gun valuable?

306
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,280
Nonsense!

307
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,720
This gun is really American.

308
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,960
I don't want this.

309
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,440
We want salt.

310
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,480
This, what does it say?

311
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,720
This is a good thing.

312
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Betel nut, it's refreshing.

313
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
It's yours.

314
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Have a try.

315
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,560
You have helped us a lot, little brother.

316
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,400
It's yours.

317
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
Sister,

318
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,160
he can carry a cow, can't he?

319
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
Small in height is not necessarily small in strength.

320
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,400
Sister,

321
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,920
you are a woman.

322
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,840
In terms of strength, you are not as strong as I am.

323
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
What about the woman?

324
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,360
Come here, let's arm wrestle.

325
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Let's see who wins.

326
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,920
Little brother,

327
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,320
come here,

328
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,200
how old are you?

329
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,320
13.

330
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,760
If you compare with her,

331
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,080
you have a great chance to lose.

332
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,000
How about this.

333
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,560
If you win her,

334
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
I will give you the treasure I got recently.

335
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,480
What treasure?

336
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,040
What do you think?

337
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,160
What kind of rare treasure is this?

338
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,040
Many people in our stockade have it.

339
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,280
Is it also this pattern?

340
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,280
It's almost like this.

341
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,800
Where did you get it?

342
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,240
On the nearby Bottle Mountain.

343
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,080
People in our stockade enter the mountain to collect herb.

344
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
Sometimes they may find some.

345
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
Where is the Bottle Mountain?

346
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,200
So far.

347
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,240
Very far.

348
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,200
The Bottle Mountain is just like a bottle broken in half.

349
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,840
Except for our Old Bear Ridge,

350
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,640
it's a wonder that can't be seen anywhere.

351
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,160
I heard the people in the village say,

352
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
in the Bottle Mountain,

353
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,280
there is a grave of general of Yuan Dynasty.

354
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,920
It sounds like the Bottle Mountain is quite interesting.

355
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Since we are here, we will go there.

356
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,360
Or it will be a pity.

357
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,400
You can't go there,

358
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,200
it's enough to look at the Bottle Mountain from a distance.

359
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,000
I heard my mom say,

360
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
the Xiangxi Corpse King inside

361
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,920
often ran out to eat people.

362
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
Little brother,

363
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,520
what kind of Corpse King is there in this world?

364
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,240
It's true, I didn't lie to you.

365
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,160
It's also said that there are monsters in the woods,

366
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
and the bodies buried there are all gone,

367
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,560
leaving only the clothes and utensils.

368
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,720
Very scary.

369
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,320
How about this?

370
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,920
We only see it from a distance

371
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,400
and do not go to dangerous places.

372
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,800
Little brother,

373
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,480
would you like to be our guide?

374
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,680
If you want,

375
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I can give you a basket of salt.

376
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,840
What do you think?

377
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,600
Little brother,

378
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,800
if you take us there,

379
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,200
not only salt,

380
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,080
all my goods are yours.

381
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,920
What do you think?

382
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,440
The scenery of Old Bear Ridge is really wonderful.

383
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
Little brother,

384
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
what are the other legends in this mountain?

385
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,600
Legend says many emperors refined elixir in the mountain,

386
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,320
which attracted a lot of poisonous insects and monsters.

387
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
They are very fierce,

388
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,360
and a living person would become the dead
if they go there.

389
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,520
When I cried as a child,

390
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
my mom scared me with that story.

391
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,480
Ok, if you cry again,

392
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,040
the Xiangxi Corpse King will take you to the Bottle Mountain

393
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,280
and you will never come back.

394
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,520
Corpse King.

395
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
The Corpse King is a general of Yuan Dynasty.

396
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,520
He has killed many people,

397
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,600
very ferocious.

398
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,160
He was buried in the mountain when he died.

399
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,200
His body would come out to harm people.

400
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
Some courageous people in our stockade

401
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,360
went to the mountain to collect herb

402
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,640
and saw it with their own eyes.

403
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,880
Look, that is the Bottle Mountain.

404
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,720
Damn, we have finally arrived.

405
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Leader,

406
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,160
look, this mountain is really evil.

407
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,120
This fog is actually colored.

408
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,480
This is called the treasure spirit.

409
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,880
Treasure spirit, good.

410
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,680
This may also be monster spirit.

411
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,160
It's said that Corpse King was buried inside.

412
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,960
Really?

413
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,920
Good.

414
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,000
I finally find you.

415
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Everyone.

416
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
Let's take a look here,

417
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
and then go back.

418
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,800
Where are we going?

419
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,920
Where are we going?

420
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,040
The Bottle Mountain is the place I came for.

421
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,200
Everyone.

422
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,720
We can't go any further.

423
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
I should go home.

424
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,760
Come here.

425
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,320
Come here.

426
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,840
It hurts.

427
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,600
It hurts.

428
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
That's right.

429
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,840
You know who I am?

430
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,880
Have you heard about the homicidal Yama Luolaowai?

431
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,920
If you say going back again,

432
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,400
I will shoot you.

433
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Be honest and show me the way.

434
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,640
Come on.

435
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,960
Remember, homicidal Yama.

436
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,880
Everyone.

437
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,800
We really can't go any further.

438
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,720
The old men in our stockade said,

439
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
the Bottle Mountain is very dangerous,

440
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
and whoever go there will be dead.

441
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,920
The weather is going to change.

442
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,800
Little brother,

443
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,440
is there a place nearby to stay?

444
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,720
He is asking you.

445
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,440
Don't be afraid, speak.

446
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,560
Yes.

447
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,400
There is a cemetery,

448
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,360
but it's a place to put dead bodies.

449
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,640
We can't go there.

450
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,240
Besides, there is a mouse spirit inside which eats people.

451
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,400
Don't be afraid.

452
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,200
Show me the way.

453
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,960
Go.

454
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,800
How far is it?

455
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,120
It's there.

456
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,560
Go.

457
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
What are you doing?

458
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,520
Go.

459
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Kunlun,

460
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
take the transfer order of Commander Luo

461
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
and order Lieutenant Yang to bring the army here.

462
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Sister,

463
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,360
there is a mouse spirit inside,

464
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,200
it will eat heart and liver of people.

465
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,800
Sister, we can't go there.

466
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,560
Don't be afraid and follow me.

467
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,960
We pass through the barren hills,

468
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,000
and miss the lodging.

469
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
We will stay here for one night,

470
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
with no intention to disturb,

471
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,960
hoping for your pardon.

472
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,920
How many times have I told you!

473
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,280
There is no ghosts in the world.

474
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,600
It is said that monsters eat people in the mountains.

475
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,760
There are monsters.

476
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,480
Listen, listen.
