1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb : the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 2=

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
Look, you guys are freaking out.

24
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
It's just a cat.

25
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,800
Cripple Huama.

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,400
Look.

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
The cheap body given by parents.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,400
Who told you to shoot?

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,320
Fussiness.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,840
Help him.

31
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,760
Give him a full body.

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes, Leader.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
Leader,

34
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
this is not necessary.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,920
What are you doing meddling in this matter?

36
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,640
I estimate that

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,880
most of the bodies

38
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
are all businessmen from other countries.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,080
The Corpse Driving Man

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
only comes once every six months to transport the body.

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,800
In case of this kind of thing, you can help,

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
and let their relatives receive a full body.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,080
If you want me to say,

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
all of them are ghosts that nobody cares about.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
We have no use for this matter.

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,320
The Ancestral Discipline
of Xieling sect of Respecting the Dead

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,800
can't be broken off here.

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
Xieling has been living in Jianghu for so many years.

49
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
Are the matters of grinding bones to dust less?

50
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Those we did

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
are all high-ranking officials who bully the common people.

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,720
Most of the brothers in Xieling came from poor backgrounds.

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,880
I still respect the common people very much.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Leader.

55
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,760
You have read a lot of books.

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,040
Everything you say makes sense.

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,760
Make sense.

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
It rained so heavily.

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,400
This mountain road will be more difficult to walk tomorrow.

60
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,960
Commander Luo did not know

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,320
the art of exploring treasures

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
is nothing more than looking, hearing, asking and touching.

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,840
These four words are divided into eight methods.

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,000
Each method is divided into upper and lower, two ways.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,880
The upper way of the looking tactic

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,320
is watching the stars above and examining the earth below.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,440
The lower tactic

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
is observing mud mark and distinguishing color of grass.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,960
There is a big difference between the two,

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
but they both have their own ways.

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,440
Especially observing mud mark
and distinguishing color of grass.

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,160
After the heavy rain washed away,

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,840
it is easier to use.

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,400
There are still so many twists and turns.

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm a clown who doesn't understand these things.

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
Thanks to meeting Leader Chen, such a master.

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Otherwise,

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't know

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,480
how many wrong roads I will take in vain.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,120
When the main troops arrive tomorrow,

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
we can go to have a look.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,000
Ok.

83
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,840
I'll look in the backyard.

84
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
Help!

85
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
It's a monster!

86
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
Leader Chen, help me!

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Help! Help! Help! Help

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Leader Chen, there is a ghost!

89
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
Commander Luo, don't be afraid.

90
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,760
It's just a corpse.

91
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,600
You freaked me out.

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Commander Luo.

93
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
You're insane.

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,840
Corpse Cleaning Amulet.

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Mrs. Wu, who is Mr. Long's wife of Hubei

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,240
married at 30 years old,

97
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
and then moved to Nuqing.

98
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,200
And she became a widow after three years.

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
The orphan was only a hundred days old,

100
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
and died because of poverty.

101
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,480
Mrs. Wu was the only one left,

102
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,280
so she became a widow and died here.

103
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,800
She died at 49 years old.

104
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,520
She was the corpse keeper of this cemetery

105
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
and a Han Chinese married from far away.

106
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,440
She died less than three months ago,

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,680
and needs to stand stiff before entering the coffin.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,760
This place has a good environment.

109
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,720
Clean the place up.

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
We are going to spend the night here today.

111
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:56,840
Ok.

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Ok.

113
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,000
Sister,

114
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,080
the second aunt of the mouse is the mouse spirit.

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
We can't stay at this house.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
What are you afraid of?

117
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,640
I have a gun.

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
In my life,

119
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
I have slept countless women.

120
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,960
I didn't expect to stay with a woman corpse today,

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
under the same roof.

122
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
I feel bad just thinking about it.

123
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,600
It's nice to have a place to stay.

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,640
This cemetery was originally the residence
where dead bodies stayed.

125
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
It is us occupying the territory of them.

126
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,160
This is unpleasant to look at it.

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Leader,

128
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,240
in my opinion,

129
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
why don't we burn her body?

130
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,200
So we will not be frightened by her at night.

131
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,640
Commander Luo,

132
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,360
why bother with a dead body?

133
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm afraid you were just scared out of your wits.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,080
Scared out of my wits? You are kidding.

135
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
When I was a teenager,

136
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,920
I used to do the corpse business.

137
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,280
Now my head is in the waistband.

138
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,880
I risk my life in risk every day.

139
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,200
What situation haven't I seen?

140
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,520
I will not be scared out of my wits!

141
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,440
Leader Chen,

142
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
you know me well.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,040
Commander Luo is indeed well informed.

144
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,880
When I drove corpses,

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,880
the body was filled with smoke and dirt.

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Why is this?

147
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,040
Smuggling.

148
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,080
There are not so many strange things.

149
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
As far as I know,

150
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,760
many people have made a lot of money from this.

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,520
Sister,

152
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
the villagers said

153
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
the second aunt of the mouse is the mouse spirit.

154
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
It especially absorbs souls and eats guts of people.

155
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,520
Why are you crying?

156
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,760
I don't believe it.

157
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
No second aunt of the mouse and no mouse spirit.

158
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,400
What does she look like?

159
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
God forgive me...

160
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
I didn't mean to offend.

161
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,520
God forgive me...

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,520
God forgive me.

163
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,760
It was a big mouse that became a spirit.

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,400
It's all rumors spread by the villagers.

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,240
There are people who have abnormal faces in this world.

166
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,640
There is no need to make a fuss.

167
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
The second aunt of the mouse was born ugly.

168
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
It's even more difficult than those who are miserable.

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,920
It's really pathetic.

170
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,320
God forgive me...

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
Cat!

172
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Still dare to come.

173
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
My gun.

174
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
If I don't catch you today. I'll change my surname.

175
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,680
Leader.

176
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,920
Stay.

177
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,520
There is a sense of integrity between heaven and earth,

178
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,720
which gives everything a variety of shapes.

179
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
It is expressed as mountains and rivers in the below,

180
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,200
and expressed as sun, moon and stars above.

181
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,520
It is called noble spirit in the world.

182
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,040
It is filled in heaven, earth and the universe.

183
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,160
You were poisoned by the urine of leopard cat.

184
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,200
After a while,

185
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
your hands and feet can move.

186
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,280
This arrow

187
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,920
is for you to protect yourself.

188
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,640
Brother,

189
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,040
leaving him there alone

190
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,520
may be dangerous.

191
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,600
He is lucky to meet us.

192
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,320
Appearing in this place in the middle of the night,

193
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
he is also not a good person.

194
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
How do you know he is not a good person?

195
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,800
He can't move yet.

196
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,160
What if there was some kind of beast.

197
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,760
He should be on the same road with us.

198
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,440
His body smells like us.

199
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,200
He also comes to the Bottle Mountain.

200
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
Let's just do our own thing.

201
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,920
Don't pay attention to the rest.

202
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,920
Partridge Whistle.

203
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,400
Zhagelama Mountain Tribe.

204
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,120
The last descendant of Banshan sect.

205
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
He is known for good skill, accurate marksmanship

206
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,640
and being skillful in ventriloquism.

207
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,240
He is bold and courageous, lofty and aloof,

208
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
and has a good insight.

209
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
He knows the law of how strong and weak in nature overcomes each other.

210
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,760
He repeatedlly won by surprise moves.

211
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,440
To save the clansmen,

212
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,120
Partridge Whistle took younger brother, Old Foreigner,

213
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,560
and younger sister, Hualing

214
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,000
to cross the mountains and rivers,
wading in the rain and wind.

215
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,120
Despite difficulties and dangers,

216
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,280
he searched for the whereabouts of Dust Bead.

217
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,920
On this day,

218
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,160
after Hualing and Old Foreigner fell asleep

219
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,600
Partridge Whistle, on the notebook,

220
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,080
drew a mountain shape like an ancient bottle.

221
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,280
This is the latest clue to find Dust Bead.

222
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
Looking at the figure of the Bottle Mountain in his hand,

223
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,400
Partridge whistle rekindled new hope.

224
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,440
Why hasn't the boss come back yet?

225
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,760
Why don't we take a look?

226
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,160
Leader.

227
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,760
Boss, why did you come back so late?

228
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,880
Leader has returned.

229
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,560
I'm so worried.

230
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,360
I met ghosts

231
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,800
and went around the woods for half a night.

232
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,160
I didn't find the way back until I saw the light of sky.

233
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
Oh, this is the ear of the dead body.

234
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,040
Give her a full body.

235
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes, sir.

236
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,080
Give me a board.

237
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,680
Just to chase this lame cat,

238
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
I spent half a night.

239
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,880
The hair color is not right

240
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
and its head also turns bigger.

241
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It's a leopard cat.

242
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,280
Leopard cat.

243
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,600
Where's the cat?

244
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,320
The cat is in its belly.

245
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,040
Speaking of this monster, it has a bit of magical skill.

246
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,800
Use its own urine and saliva

247
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,040
to encircle an old grave.

248
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
All those who enter carelessly

249
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
will be lost their mind and be manipulated by it.

250
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,320
The cat just entered its trap.

251
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,200
Are you ok?

252
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,040
It can't hurt me.

253
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Little trick.

254
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,840
It's just a cover-up.

255
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,840
The skeleton is all scattered.

256
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
You are good, very good.

257
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,920
You chased the cat all night long,

258
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,680
and brought back the ears of the second aunt of the mouse.

259
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,120
I

260
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,760
had a good dream all night long.

261
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,960
Both of us have a meaningful night.

262
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
Commander Luo, please sit down.

263
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,240
Thanks for your good words.

264
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,440
Our brothers of Xieling sect

265
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,040
always behave with principles.

266
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,160
How can I ignore this?

267
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,080
Get up, little brother.

268
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,560
It's not worthy of mentioning.

269
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,440
I admire you very much.

270
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,480
I have been in Jianghu for so many years.

271
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,840
I have eaten a lot of delicacies

272
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,800
but never tried the meat of leopard cat.

273
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't know if it suits my taste.

274
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,000
Leopard cat meat is acid and tastes  bad.

275
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,560
But its bone can be used as medicine.

276
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,880
Specializing in the treatment of schizophrenia.

277
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,240
Let Kunlun peel off its skin for bones later

278
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
and grind it into powder.

279
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,800
So this leopard cat

280
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,280
can do something good after death.

281
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,160
Kunlun.

282
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,200
By the way,

283
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,960
Kunlun has been leaving for half a day.

284
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
It's time to come back.

285
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,880
It rained all night.

286
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,280
The road is definitely not easy to walk.

287
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,400
I estimated he is delayed.

288
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,640
Red Girl.

289
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,560
I'm hungry, get something to eat.

290
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,280
Step aside.

291
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,960
Sister,

292
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,680
are you a highwayman?

293
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,720
My mother said that highwaymen are all bad people.

294
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,280
Then look carefully,

295
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,880
am I a bad person?

296
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,960
I was confused.

297
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,080
I don't know if sister is a good person or a bad person.

298
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Bad guys may do good things.

299
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,080
Good people also can be bad sometimes.

300
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,600
Do you understand?

301
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Even more confused.

302
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,080
Sister,

303
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,360
when will you let me go home?

304
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
Please, please.

305
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,080
Wait till it is over.

306
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,880
Sister guarantees that you can go home safely.

307
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:22,920
Commander Luo.

308
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,200
Commander Luo.

309
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,760
Ok.

310
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,480
Leader.

311
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,760
Ok.

312
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,320
Leader.

313
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,960
I'm looking forward to you guys.

314
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,880
I slept with a dead body last night.

315
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,560
I was not feeling well after getting up.

316
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,600
It's alright now.

317
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,840
When I see the brothers coming,

318
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
I feel comfortable.

319
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,560
Leader.

320
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,280
Then let's go.

321
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
The brothers are tired of travelling.

322
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,480
Why don't we take a rest and make some adjustments?

323
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,720
They are trained to fighting.

324
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,640
In my opinion,

325
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
let's keep going ahead and don't stop.

326
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,080
Then we will not feel tired.

327
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,680
If we stop to have a rest,

328
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,120
it will be difficult to stand up again.

329
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,680
All right, we listen to Commander Luo.

330
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,040
By the way,

331
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
why don't you say something to encourage them?

332
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,160
Is this necessary?

333
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,760
To raise the spirits.

334
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,400
Ok.

335
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,000
Bastard!

336
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,360
Move!

337
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Move! Move!
