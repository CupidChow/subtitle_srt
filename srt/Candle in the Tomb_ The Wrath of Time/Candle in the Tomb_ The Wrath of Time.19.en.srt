1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 19=

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
Let's do it.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,680
Divisional Commander!

25
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,840
The Xieling people is revolting!

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,880
Why are you so frightened?

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
What can those pests do?

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,880
Alright.

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,320
I'll let them know

30
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
what is a real army.

31
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Got it!

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Go!

33
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,968
This way.

35
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:27,712
Save them first.

36
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,848
Got it.

37
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,840
This way.

38
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
Don't play your little tricks.

39
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,352
I just asked you one question,

40
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,280
yet you answered so much.

41
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,240
Are you trying to play a duet with me?

42
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
Now tell me,

43
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:08,840
whether the Corpse King of Xiangxi
would come back to life?

44
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
I really can't tell you the answer

45
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,720
before I see the real Corpse King.

46
00:06:19,824 --> 00:06:21,240
But look at all these treasures.

47
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,280
The funerary objects in that coffin

48
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
must be quite invaluable.

49
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Are you sure?

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Luxurious funerals were quite popular in Yuan Dynasty.

51
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,040
And this general

52
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,840
was the General Commander

53
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,560
who had suppressed the revolt
in 72 grottoes of the Old Bear Ridge.

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
His funerary objects

55
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
must be countless.

56
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Regimental Commander.

57
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,480
If we can get those funerary objects,

58
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,280
then it's gonna be another achievement

59
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,440
in front of Divisional Commander Ma.

60
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,288
Right?

61
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,520
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,200
A significant achievement.

63
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah, Regimental Commander.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Since you all think we should do it,

65
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,880
then who's willing to
go up there first and have a look?

66
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,720
Go ahead!

67
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
You two.

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,000
Go up there.

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,960
You've tied us like this,

70
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
we can't even open the coffin.

71
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,520
How can we check it for you?

72
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,800
You want us to bite the coffin?

73
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,640
Or you can untie us first.

74
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't play with me.

75
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,240
I need some men

76
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
to go up there and take that coffin apart.

77
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,360
Divisional Commander.

78
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,680
Cripple. Cripple.

79
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,160
Tell everyone to go into the Mortuary!

80
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
Go into the Mortuary!

81
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
- Got it.
- Got it.

82
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,992
Give me some noise.

83
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,200
On my command.

84
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,680
Fire!

85
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,720
I'd like to listen to the music.

86
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,160
Got it.

87
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Are you okay?

88
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
Just a scratch.

89
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Leader. You can use a gun?

90
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
You're a good shooter.

91
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,760
I just don't like guns.

92
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,160
But you, you wanna die here?

93
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,920
The Old Leader enjoined me over and over again.

94
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,280
He asked me to take care of you.

95
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,200
I can't let anything happen to you.

96
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,280
You two.

97
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
Go.

98
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,960
There's a muffled thunder sound,

99
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,440
dark clouds gather together in the sky.

100
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,200
Seems like there's a crack

101
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,120
dividing the sky into two.

102
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,240
'Lack of yang makes the sky crack,

103
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
excess of yin principle
leads to the ground movement'.

104
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
This is the legendary sky cracking.

105
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,288
Those soldiers are panicked,

106
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,680
even Partridge Whistle is a little worried.

107
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Everyone, go!

108
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Get out of here.

109
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,520
So many jewelries.

110
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,760
This is the tomb
of the General of Yuan Dynasty.

111
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,120
How many are there?

112
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,760
So many!

113
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,320
I've never seen this amount before.

114
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,200
We are so lucky this time.

115
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,760
So many treasures.

116
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,800
There are still many treasures under his body.

117
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,480
Look at that pot.

118
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,840
That's a golden wine pot.

119
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,600
Regimental Commander.

120
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
There's something in his throat.

121
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,760
Later,

122
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,600
you deal with Lieutenant Yang.

123
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,992
I will cope with his underlings.

124
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
Let's take a look?

125
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
Put your gun down.

126
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
Or I will use her to worship my gun.

127
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,000
You can have a try.

128
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
You really think I won't shoot her?

129
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,520
I'll count to five.

130
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,760
If you don't put your gun down,

131
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,760
I will kill her.

132
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Shoot him.

133
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,600
Catch them!

134
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,680
- Got it!
- Let's go!

135
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,520
Go get them!

136
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Partridge Whistle.

137
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
Partridge Whistle.

138
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Partridge Whistle.

139
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,760
Give me a rope!

140
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,040
Rope.

141
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,240
- Rope.
- Take the rope.

142
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,160
Get out of here!

143
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Get out of here now!

144
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,800
Search this place carefully.

145
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,480
Go search inside.

147
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,160
You!

148
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,280
Search over there.

149
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,640
Some of you go to the back.

150
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,360
Bring me all of them
no matter they're dead or alive.

151
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,200
- Got it.
- Got it.

152
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,599
Partridge Whistle.

153
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,079
Partridge Whistle.

154
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,480
Partridge Whistle.

155
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,320
Partridge Whistle.

156
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,080
Partridge Whistle.

157
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,880
Partridge Whistle.

158
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,960
Falling down from this place,

159
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,720
even he's still alive,
he must be disabled.

160
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
Shall we report to
Divisional Commander Ma immediately?

161
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,120
Report about what?

162
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,112
We got nothing!

163
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:10,840
If we go back,

164
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,752
what are we gonna tell him?

165
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,720
But we all saw that

166
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,760
the coffin fell down

167
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,200
together with the corpse.

168
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,480
That's why we should go down to find it.

169
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,600
Besides,

170
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,560
the two Xieling guys who came with us

171
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,000
are now gone.

172
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,280
The Divisional Commander
will definitely kill us.

173
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Shut up.

174
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,960
Go down there, all of you!

175
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,160
- Go down?
- Go down?

176
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,800
Now!

177
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
- Let's go.
- Let's go down there.

178
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,520
I am not criticizing you guys,

179
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,000
even that girl can jump down.

180
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,960
Look at you.

181
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,840
No wonder that Luo Laowai
achieved nothing.

182
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,000
Look at you!

183
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,760
Don't you dare say that again!

184
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
Of course I do!

185
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
Too much crap.

186
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,240
If we can't find the funerary objects,

187
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,400
no one can come back alive.

188
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,800
- Let's go.
- Let's go down there.

189
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

190
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,040
Come on.

191
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,360
Partridge Whistle.

192
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,400
Is it you?

193
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,840
Partridge Whistle.

194
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,240
Help me.

195
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
Help me.

196
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,880
Help me.

197
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,120
Partridge Whistle.

198
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,760
Partridge Whistle.

199
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,440
Partridge Whistle.

200
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
You can't die.

201
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,240
Partridge Whistle.

202
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,560
Partridge Whistle.

203
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,400
Partridge Whistle.

204
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
Partridge Whistle.

205
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,280
I thought you were dead.

206
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,120
Why are you crying?

207
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,880
I thought you were dead.

208
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm fine.

209
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,560
I thought you were dead.

210
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,040
Let's go.

211
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,920
Check over there.

212
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,704
Search carefully. Hurry.

213
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,360
Take them away.

214
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:51,600
Hurry.

215
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,320
Check if there's anyone alive.

216
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,200
Carefully.

217
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,920
Someone's here.

218
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,600
Here. Someone's alive!

219
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,840
Someone's alive here.

220
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,200
Where are you going?

221
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,160
Someone injured?

222
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
Bring the injured to that place.

223
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,040
Let me see the wound.

224
00:27:44,608 --> 00:27:45,312
Where?

225
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,888
I…

226
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Brother, brother.

227
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,320
Listen.

228
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,200
This money is gonna cover
the rest of your life.

229
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,960
We all live a hard life.
Let me go please.

230
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,840
Could you?

231
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,880
Let's go, thank you.

232
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
I can get myself a wife.

233
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,720
How's it going?

234
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,640
Regimental Commander, we didn't find them.

235
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,400
- Me neither.
- Regimental Commander, me neither.

236
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,080
Just leave that girl.

237
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,000
Brothers.

238
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
You see the funerary objects and treasures all around?

239
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,760
Take them all.

240
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,960
Don't miss anything.

241
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,120
- Got it!
- Got it!

242
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Divisional Commander,

243
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,040
we didn't find Chen Yulou's body.

244
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,360
But,

245
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,400
We lost some of our clothes.

246
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,240
Chen Yulou!

247
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,880
Listen up!

248
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
You'd better come out now.

249
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,520
If you come out now,

250
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,440
then we're good.

251
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
But if you don't come out today,

252
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,112
then your brothers will suffer a lot.

253
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,280
Do you hear me?

254
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't, don't.

255
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
Cripple Huama.

256
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,520
If I died,

257
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,760
you just lead others to escape.

258
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,880
Though you're our Xieling's leader,

259
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,720
you have to listen to me this time.

260
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,240
If you go there, you will definitely die.

261
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,080
The Xieling sect cannot live without its leader.

262
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,360
In the past,

263
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,000
I thought the money was the most important thing.

264
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,480
But now I finally understand that

265
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,080
without my brothers,

266
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm just nobody.

267
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,560
Do you hear me?

268
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,920
When you go back,

269
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,480
please tell the Old Leader,

270
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,480
you just tell him that

271
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,400
I let him down again.

272
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,560
Who's there?

273
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,160
Who are you?

274
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,200
Help me.

275
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,168
Don't you remember me?

276
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:28,560
You're Dafu?

277
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,200
- It's Dafu.
- Dafu.

278
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,680
- Dafu.
- He's Dafu.

279
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,400
What happened to you?

280
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,400
The Corpse King.

281
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,872
The Corpse King did this to me.
