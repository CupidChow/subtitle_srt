1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 12=

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,960
Careful.

24
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
So many.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
Load them all.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,840
Commander Luo.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
Okay, okay. Alright.

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Step aside.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,000
Does it hurt?

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm asking you if it hurts.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,360
It hurts.

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah, it hurts.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,640
Great.

34
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,880
I'm not dreaming, right?

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,680
Brother Partridge Whistle.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,240
My dear brother. Come here.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,080
It's… This is... is...

38
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
Is this the so called

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
Lingxiao Palace of the Jade Emperor?

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,600
This used to be an ancient palace
for making immortality pills by Emperors.

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,000
Look at those octagonal colored glaze lamps.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,920
These are jewelry and lamps
which have thousands of years history.

43
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,510
The lamp wicks are specially made,

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,840
and can last for thousands of years.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
Today,

46
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,960
I really entered into a whole new world.

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,160
Oh my gosh. The treasures inside must be very valuable.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
I've never seen

49
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,280
such a luxury and magnificent palace before.

50
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,800
Leader Chen.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Leader Chen.

52
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
Leader Chen. Where's Leader Chen?

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,120
I don't know.

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
The soil here is so hard,

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,080
and there are so many layers of rocks between them.

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
They dug through them anyway.

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,440
Yes.

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
Have you seen how they did it?

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,280
Yeah, we all saw that.

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,480
Those two Xueling Pangolins

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
just kept digging and digging.

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,320
Only in half a day,

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,000
they've dug a tunnel like this.

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Our men all said that

65
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,720
such mountain-digging skill is absolute genius.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,880
Leader.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,880
Leader. Here you are. Finally.

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,040
Look. Look at this.

69
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,800
Have you ever seen such a huge palace?

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,560
I haven't anyway.

71
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,000
It's really an eye-opening day for me.

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
This time, we finally find

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,040
the real treasures.

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,680
Congratulations, Commander Luo.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,000
You, too.

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
They're not for my own.

77
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Everyone here, you all have a share.

78
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
Commander Luo, please.

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Leader Chen.

80
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
You are the bellwether and backbone

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
of our team.

82
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,120
If you don't give an order,

83
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,360
no one dares to act rashly.

84
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,000
If someone does, I'll shoot at him immediately.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't say that.

86
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,480
What did I do?

87
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,800
It all owes to Xieling brothers' help.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,040
If anyone is willing to take my job,

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,800
I'd rather be a recluse in the mountains,

90
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,240
and become indifferent to wealth and fame.

91
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,040
Leader, that's not true.

92
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,400
In my opinion,

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
we should all cut the crap.

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
We can live without anyone in our team,

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,840
but we can't live you, our Leader.

96
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,640
Am I right?

97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
At your service, Leader.

99
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,440
Let's go inside and rob the bloody treasures.

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,120
Brothers,

101
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,080
we should all keep our eyes open.

102
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,240
First, we need a group of people

103
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,280
to build a bamboo bridge
at the bottom of the mountain

104
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
to ship the treasures out.

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,600
And we need another group to explore the way ahead.

106
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Do be careful.

107
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, Leader.

108
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,480
Let's go.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,040
Let's go.

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Brother.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
Do you think there might be

112
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
any gimmick here?

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,880
It shouldn't be a trap of fake tomb or grave.

114
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,000
But we shouldn't act rashly.

115
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
To be honest,

116
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,480
we've suffered great losses at the battle in Urn city.

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,640
I still haven't gotten over it.

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,280
Don't worry, Brother Chen.

119
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,320
How about this?

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I'll go first.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
You just follow me with other guys.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,000
That's not fair.

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,720
It's quite hard for you to find this hole.

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Just leave the exploring work for me.

125
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,560
Don't worry about it, Brother Chen.

126
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
Leader.

127
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,320
Follow me.

128
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
You guys,

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,880
Leader always brings Red Girl with him.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,880
What happened this time?

132
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,720
Is she out of favor?

133
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
What?

134
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
Don't talk nonsense.

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,160
Red Girl is no longer young.

136
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,200
Maybe this time, she falls in love

137
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:12,560
and wants to have a relationship with that guy.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,760
That guy?

139
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,160
You idiot.

140
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Partridge Whistle.

141
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,280
Right?

142
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,240
But Red Girl is so hot-tempered.

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
Last time, she hit me in the mouth,

144
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,560
and I couldn't open my mouth the entire night.

145
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,200
I can't imagine whether it's a bless or a curse

146
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,360
for the man who marries her.

147
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,800
Come. Come here.

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,560
Come here.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Elder brother.

150
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
The Rooster is awake.

151
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,920
You two follow me.

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,240
Follow me closely.

153
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,080
Hey, you. Did you hear that?

154
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,520
Got it, elder brother.

155
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,560
Leader Chen.

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,800
Leader Chen.

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,640
What's this?

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,640
It's an octagonal colored glaze lamp.

159
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Colored glaze lamp?

160
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
It must be valuable.

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Of course.

162
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,920
Lieutenant Yang.

163
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,360
Yes.

164
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,120
Tear it down and take it with us.

165
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,760
No hurry.

166
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,320
We can keep it for lighting now.

167
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,640
It's not too late to take this

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,120
when we've moved everything else.

169
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,920
You're right.

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,120
Yang.

171
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,760
Yes?

172
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,640
When we've moved everything,

173
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,560
and before we leave,

174
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
no matter the lamp or the light stand,

175
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
take them both.

176
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,640
Got it.

177
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Careful.

178
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,120
Everyone, be careful!

179
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,960
Don't shoot at my treasures.

180
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,400
They mean money to me.

181
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Dust the lime powder.

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,360
Help him!

183
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Old Foreigner.

184
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,720
It's impressive.

185
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,680
Yeah.

186
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,880
- Great.
- Great.

187
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,160
Thanks to it.

188
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,040
Right.

189
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,360
What a wonderful Rooster.

190
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,360
Leader Chen. Brother Partridge Whistle.

191
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,320
You two really amazed me.

192
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
I admire you both.

193
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,440
Ask your people

194
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
to dust all our lime powder
throughout the palace

195
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,720
to prevent these poisonous things.

196
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,640
Got it.

197
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Dust the lime power.

198
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,600
Yes!

199
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,200
Lieutenant Yang.

200
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,880
Yes?

201
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
Light up.

202
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,720
Got it.

203
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,440
Light up.

204
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,560
- Yes.
- Yes.

205
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,520
How much are

206
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,080
the jewels on the pillar worth?

207
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,840
All the treasures here

208
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
are of the top grade used by royal households.

209
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,240
They are priceless.

210
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,400
Plus, it's quite vivifying and full of vigor here.

211
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,040
These antiques still look like new ones,

212
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,680
which makes them worth even more.

213
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
Awesome.

214
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,160
It's time for us to make a fortune.

215
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,200
It's troublous times now.

216
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,680
You have guns and you are the king.

217
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,080
If we get these treasures,

218
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,520
then thousands of British fast guns

219
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
and dozens of British cannons

220
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,400
can be bought soon.

221
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,040
Commander Luo.

222
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,040
You have to send more soldiers

223
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,360
to open a mountain road

224
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,880
for mules to transport the treasures.

225
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,560
Okay.

226
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,360
Lieutenant Yang.

227
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:42,800
Yes?

228
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,600
Brother Cripple.

229
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,880
You two are in charge of this area.

230
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
Tear them down and take them all.

231
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,040
I want everything.

232
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,000
- Okay.
- Also,

233
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,280
the mountain road must be heavily guarded.

234
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,680
If anyone

235
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,800
tries to steal treasures and escape,

236
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,590
just shoot him on the spot.

237
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,350
Yes.

238
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,800
My brothers.

239
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,480
Listen up.

240
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,000
If you make down-to-earth efforts,

241
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,680
you will have a handsome reward.

242
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,110
The one who tries to play tricks on me,

243
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
I'm gonna give him a hard time.

244
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
Understood?

245
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,960
- Roger that.
- Roger that.

246
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,120
Now get back to work.

247
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,040
Commander Luo.

248
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
Do you know that

249
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
the most valuable treasures here actually

250
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,760
were already robbed by the Yuan troops?

251
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,680
The left ones are not that valuable.

252
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,240
But we can think this way,

253
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,560
hundreds of years have past,

254
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
these antiques now become treasures again.

255
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,680
I just regret that

256
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,760
I wasn't born

257
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,840
hundreds of years earlier.

258
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,880
You don't have to care about it so much,
Commander Luo.

259
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,960
I guess there must be countless treasures

260
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,640
in the tomb of the general of Yuan Dynasty.

261
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
There must be a great meal waiting for us.

262
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,360
I can't wait.

263
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,280
I want to go inside and take a look right now

264
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,720
to find out what exactly
are there waiting for us.

265
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Leader.

266
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,480
Our guys found a stone gate.

267
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
You stay here and watch the gate.

268
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,720
I'll go inside and check it out.

269
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,120
Alright.

270
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,280
Be careful.

271
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
Be careful when you're
dealing with the treasures.

272
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Be careful.

273
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,520
Focus on your work.

274
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,960
What happened?

275
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,120
Brother Cripple.

276
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I was taking out the jade on the wall,

277
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,760
and he just roughly smashed the wall with chisels.

278
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,600
Several jades were damaged.

279
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,000
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen and even hit me.

280
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,560
How I take out those jades

281
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,880
is none of your Xieling people's business.

282
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,800
Don't you dare say it again. Say it again!

283
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,600
Shut up!

284
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,560
What happened?

285
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
Two guys

286
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,440
quarreled because of several jades.

287
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,040
Put your guns away.

288
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,920
Brother Cripple.

289
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,440
You see...

290
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,960
It looks like that my guy

291
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,320
hit yours.

292
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,640
How about this?

293
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Let me apologize to him for my guy.

294
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,496
- Brother Cripple, he hit me first.
- Shut up.

295
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,160
You chiseled the jade?

296
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,320
How can you be so careless?

297
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,520
They all belong to Commander Luo.

298
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
Don't you know that?

299
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
Keep pedaling.

300
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,760
Generate electricity. Hurry up.

301
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,160
Brother Cripple.

302
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,800
You guys are right.

303
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
It was my people's problem.

304
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,160
Please forgive us.

305
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,720
We are all brothers.

306
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,360
Just be careful the next time.

307
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,560
Yes, of course.

308
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,000
We don't need those fake, polite greetings.

309
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,240
So, it's over now?

310
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,280
It's over.

311
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,560
Get out of here and go back to work.

312
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,320
Get back to work.

313
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,400
Let's go.

314
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,080
Lieutenant Yang.

315
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
With all due respect,

316
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,360
we Xieling sect has our own methods of

317
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,280
digging jades and gold.

318
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,800
I'm not an expert,

319
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,400
but how about I teach you guys our methods

320
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,200
so as not to destroy these jades

321
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,720
or waste any of them.

322
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
Brother Cripple.

323
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,200
Xieling sect's unique skill

324
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,920
is all that we could wish for.

325
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Thank you, Brother Cripple.

326
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,760
You guys,

327
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,360
learn the skill from Xieling brothers.

328
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,320
Understood?

329
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,440
- Got it.
- Got it.

330
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Get back to work.

331
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,560
Hualing.

332
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,800
I found that this Rooster is like you.

333
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
Eat and sleep every day.
Live a careless life.

334
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,240
You are the careless one.

335
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,160
Who is the sleepyhead of us, eh?

336
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,160
How dare you talk to me like this?

337
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,040
You should learn from the Rooster.

338
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
You are the Rooster.

339
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,040
Elder brother.

340
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,120
What's this?

341
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,840
Don't touch it.

342
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
Careful.

343
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,080
What's this?

344
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,080
What's going on inside?

345
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,800
Inside?

346
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,120
They are digging treasures now.

347
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
Where's the Leader?

348
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,976
I don't know.

349
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,256
It looks like that
he's going further into the tomb.
