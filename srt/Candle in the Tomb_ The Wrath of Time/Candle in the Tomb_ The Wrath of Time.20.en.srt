1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 20=

23
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,700
The Corpse King.

24
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,940
Chen Yulou!

25
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,540
Come out!

26
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm here!

27
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,220
I'm back.

28
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,500
Don't fire. Don't fire.

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,512
Don't fire.

30
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,700
Brother, my dear brother.

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
Lord Ma. Lord Ma.

32
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,860
Lord Ma. I'm so sorry, Lord Ma.

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,460
You really come back!

34
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,780
Lord Ma.

35
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm back, Lord Ma.

36
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
I'm sorry. I surrender.

37
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,420
Please don't kill me.

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,820
You are the most
generous person in the world.

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,300
I admire you.

40
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,540
I'm here to apologize to you, Lord Ma.

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,500
You were so right yesterday.

42
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,060
If you wanna be the hero,

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,180
you have to pay the price.

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,820
I've already paid mine.

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,780
What a heavy price.

46
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,380
Some of my men died, and some wounded.

47
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,740
Just a few left.

48
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,220
Lord Ma, I'm begging you.
Please don't kill me.

49
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,620
Let me live, please.

50
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,180
I finally understand this time.

51
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,620
What am I fighting for?

52
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,740
People in my business

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,340
just wanna get fed up.

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,940
So it doesn't matter whom we work for.

55
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,460
I've lost my backer now.

56
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,580
So I'm here for a shelter

57
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
and beg you to take me in.

58
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,380
As long as you don't kill me,

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
even if you treat me like shit in the future,

60
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,940
I'm totally okay with that.

61
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,980
What do you say, Lord Ma?

62
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,808
You're smart to think that way.

63
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,900
If you did this earlier,

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,380
then you don't have to be like this.

65
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,140
Right?

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Yes, of course.

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,100
It's all my fault.

68
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,260
I was so stupid.

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,540
Alright, let him go.

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,580
Thank you so much, Lord Ma.

71
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,340
Thank you.

72
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Come here.

73
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,740
Crawl, please.

74
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,740
No problem.

75
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,820
Why did you run earlier?

76
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,060
Yesterday,

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,980
I was scared to death by you.

78
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,740
I thought if I didn't run,

79
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,740
you would kill me.

80
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,940
I really shouldn't play those petty tricks.

81
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,660
I made you such a big mess here.

82
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,300
I'm here to join you wholeheartedly.

83
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
I will follow you
and serve you forever.

84
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,180
You may rest assured.

85
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,500
Lord Ma.

86
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,900
If you take me in,

87
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,976
I will definitely do
whatever you say, Lord Ma.

88
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,860
What can you do for me?

89
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,460
I… I…

90
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,620
I have night eyes.

91
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,100
Everyone knows. Just ask them.

92
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,416
My eyes are really unique in this world.

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,180
I can identify all the fakes.

94
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,500
If anyone wants to present
a fake treasure to deceive you,

95
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,780
that definitely won't work.

96
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,940
I am useful to you.

97
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,860
Besides, all my Xieling brothers will follow you.

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,260
Just spare my life!

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm absolutely useful to you, Lord Ma.

100
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm begging you, Lord Ma.

101
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,980
That's true.

102
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,900
Yeah, yeah.

103
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,180
Anyway,

104
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,340
you are a leader after all.

105
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,100
I trust you.

106
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,780
Be an obedient underling,

107
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,340
I will treat you nicely.

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,220
Thank you.

109
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,500
Thank you so much, Lord Ma.
Thank you.

110
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,780
Alright.

111
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,260
Stand up.

112
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,220
Thank you, Lord Ma.

113
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,460
Thank you, Lord Ma.

114
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,900
Alright.

115
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,408
Gather all the brothers here.

116
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,660
Don't move.

117
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,420
What are you doing?

118
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,180
Back off!

119
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,688
Back off! All of you!

120
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:43,712
Put down your guns!

121
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,780
Back off!

122
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,860
Back off!

123
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,980
Chen Yulou.

124
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,060
You were putting on a show to me, huh?

125
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,500
I'm telling you, I've experienced a lot.

126
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,260
If I intend to kill you,

127
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,019
it's gonna be easier than kill a bug.

128
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,500
Look at all these soldiers.

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,339
Do you really think
you can get out of here alive?

130
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm telling you, Ma Zhenbang.

131
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,020
Don't you like Xiaoshenfeng?

132
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,140
I'll use it to kill you today.

133
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Now that I'm back,

134
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,940
I have no intention of leaving.

135
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,460
So do we.

136
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,020
Come at us!

137
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,700
Come on!

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,780
Who told you to come back?

139
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,500
We never planned on leaving!

140
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,140
-Yeah!
- Come on!

141
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,220
Listen up.

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,224
Ma Zhenbang has extorted excessive taxes

143
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,520
and killed so many people.

144
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,340
The people of Yunnan are miserable.

145
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,740
We Xieling sect has never feuded with you.

146
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,900
If you wanna perish together with us,

147
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,380
then I can give an order,

148
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,220
all my brothers will
detonate the explosives immediately.

149
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,504
Brothers, don't listen to him!

150
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,740
Take care of the wounded guys.

151
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,580
I'll go and look for Partridge Whistle.

152
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,980
- Rope!
- Rope!

153
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,340
- Rope!
- Give me the rope!

154
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,460
The Corpse King is resurrected.

155
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,620
- Pull the rope!
- Hurry!

156
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,380
The Corpse King has come back to life!
He's resurrected!

157
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,300
The Corpse King?

158
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,700
Let's get out of here.

159
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,180
How… how about them?

160
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,100
Forget about them!

161
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,140
Save yourself first! Run!

162
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,860
- Run!
- Let's go!

163
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,660
- Pull the rope!
- Pull the rope!

164
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,220
- Pull the rope!
- Come on!

165
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,740
If we let it keep sucking blood like this,

166
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,060
it will become a disaster.

167
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,820
No one can control it then.

168
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,020
What should we do?

169
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,340
We need to figure out a way.

170
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,180
You stay put, don't go anywhere.

171
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,300
No.

172
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,100
I must go with you.

173
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
It's more important to save their lives.

174
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,700
You have to listen to me.

175
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
Open the door! Open the door!

176
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,940
I command you to open the door!

177
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,780
Open it!

178
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,659
Cousin! Get out of my way!

179
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,856
- Let my cousin in.
- What are you doing?

180
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,864
- Open the door!
- Step aside.

181
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,780
What are you doing?

182
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,220
Stop!

183
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,780
What are you doing?

184
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,580
Open the door!

185
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,380
Step aside. My cousin is still out there!

186
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,872
Your cousin is gonna get all of us killed.

187
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,980
Do you want that to happen?

188
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,460
My cousin is still out there.

189
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,460
Please.

190
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,460
If you want to die, don't get us in trouble.

191
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,180
Yeah.

192
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,780
Back off.

193
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,220
Open the door!

194
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,220
Brothers.

195
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,660
I'll give you all my treasures.

196
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,580
Open the door! Open the door!

197
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,940
Open it!

198
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,640
- What are you doing?
- Brothers.

199
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,016
- Money means nothing when you're dead.
- You can have all my money.

200
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,580
- Open the door.
- And if they're all dead,

201
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,740
- then all the treasures are ours.
- Open it!

202
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,580
He's right.

203
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,860
Do you understand?

204
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,940
Brother, stop crying.

205
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,020
A living dog is better than a dead lion.

206
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,300
Come here. Hold the door.

207
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,980
He just died like that.

208
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,620
Brother, brother.

209
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,220
Why are you staring at me?

210
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,380
What are you doing? Stop, stop!

211
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,900
You wanna die?
Hold the door, come on!

212
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,820
Hold the door.

213
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,580
Open the door!

214
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,900
Open the door!

215
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
Open the door!

216
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,360
Open it!

217
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,860
Are you okay?

218
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,340
I'm fine.

219
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,540
Watch out!

220
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
How about you?

221
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,380
Don't worry about me.
Go get the Bead.

222
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,860
Elder brother, it's the Dust Bead!

223
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,700
You still haven't found that Dust Bead?

224
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,260
We all count on you

225
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,740
to find the Dust Bead.

226
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,580
Who knows if there is such a thing
as the Dust Bead in this world?

227
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,660
Elder brother, do you believe we can find it?

228
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,980
The Dust Bead doesn't exist at all.

229
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,912
Everything's gonna get better.

230
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,180
Elder brother.

231
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,180
You've been looking for the Dust Bead
for half of your lifetime.

232
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
You can have a rest now.

233
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,500
Partridge Whistle's closest relatives died one after another.

234
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,260
Now he's battered because of this.

235
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,940
Partridge Whistle!

236
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,900
He feels that sadness is welling up inside.

237
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,140
Suddenly, his mind wanders,

238
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,260
and he loses his spiritual support.

239
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,300
Partridge Whistle.

240
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,300
Partridge Whistle.

241
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,620
Partridge Whistle.

242
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,740
Partridge Whistle.

243
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,940
Partridge Whistle.

244
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,780
Boss.

245
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:42,100
What? Still alive?

246
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,060
Get down.

247
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:44,560
Let me blow him up.

248
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,820
How do you feel? Are you okay?

249
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,300
Luckily, you got here in time.

250
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,940
Careful.

251
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,180
Careful.

252
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,260
How about you?

253
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,060
Careful.

254
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,140
How do you feel?

255
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,460
Brother Partridge Whistle,
are you alright?

256
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,660
How come you are here?

257
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,260
That bastard Ma Zhenbang.

258
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,736
I killed him.

259
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,168
What's that?
