1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,820
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,180
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,820
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,700
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,900
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,980
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,340
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,460
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,380
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,940
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,620
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,060
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,220
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,300
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,340
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,860
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,060
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,340
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,500
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,620
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,180
=Episode 15=

23
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,580
Leader, what's wrong?

24
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,700
What happened?

25
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,140
Have you found him?

26
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,980
Where's the centipede?

27
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,780
And where's brother Partridge Whistle?

28
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,220
What happened exactly?

29
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,780
I didn't expect that

30
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,580
the cover of this platform can be turned over.

31
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,580
When we were fighting,

32
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
brother Partridge Whistle fell down with the centipede

33
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,220
in order to save me.

34
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,140
Where the hell is this machinery?

35
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,500
How can we open it?

36
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Ask Red Girl to help.

37
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,060
Let her check it out.

38
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,940
Red Girl is in coma.

39
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,580
We blow it.

40
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,540
No.

41
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,100
It's the mountain ridge here.

42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,700
We're all gonna die down here
if the ridge collapses.

43
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,340
Then tell our men to look around here.

44
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,980
Search for other entrances.

45
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,500
No matter what happens,

46
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,900
we have to find brother Partridge Whistle!

47
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,340
Yes, hurry up!

48
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,220
What are you standing here?
Go search for him!

49
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,540
- Got it!
- Got it!

50
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,380
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

51
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,860
Where's my elder brother?

52
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,940
Elder brother is still in there.

53
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,140
They'll come out in a moment.

54
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,180
You just relax and wait here.

55
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,700
Hualing.

56
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,140
You must remember that

57
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,100
no matter how hard it is in the future,

58
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,060
you must help our elder brother

59
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,380
to find the Dust Bead.

60
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,128
No.

61
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,460
We had a deal.

62
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,660
We must find it together.

63
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,100
I'm tired of looking for the Bead.

64
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,900
Look at the Palace.

65
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,580
So spacious.

66
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,140
So nice.

67
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,620
I really wanna have a good rest here.

68
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,540
Shut up.

69
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,540
Don't you ever say that again.

70
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,060
Don't talk to your elder brother like this.

71
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,020
You still remember
you are my elder brother?

72
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,540
You just can't behave
even at this moment, right?

73
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,620
Don't cry.

74
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm not crying.

75
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,220
I won't cry.

76
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,180
- Leader.
- Leader.

77
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,060
How is she?

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,180
She just suffered a hard hit.

79
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,540
I guess she'll wake up soon.

80
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,020
See?

81
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,300
My blood is still red.

82
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,500
But when it turns gold,

83
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,380
I'm gonna die anyway.

84
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,080
Shut up.

85
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,460
Elder brother.

86
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
Elder brother.

87
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,380
Elder brother.

88
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,420
I will never…

89
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,660
…never talk back to you.

90
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,860
I will listen to you whatever you say.

91
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,020
I will always respect you.

92
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,260
I will definitely

93
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,060
call you elder brother obediently.

94
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,780
Decocting medicinal herbs?

95
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,740
Is this really my younger sister talking?

96
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,100
Take care of yourself, okay?

97
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,940
You have to stay safe before I come back.

98
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,420
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be fine without you.

99
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,460
Leader.

100
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,500
Look at the Rooster.

101
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
Bury it properly.

102
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,740
Yes.

103
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,020
Search carefully.

104
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,460
Is that it?

105
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,340
I don't think so.

106
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,540
Search over there.

107
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,220
Search carefully.

108
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,500
Not this one.

109
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,500
It doesn't even have a gap.

110
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,340
Not this one, either.

111
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,380
Where could it be?

112
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,740
Look at this.

113
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,260
No.

114
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,180
Keep searching.

115
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,060
I don't think it's here.

116
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,900
Leader.

117
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,060
The centipedes are all cleaned up.

118
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,300
According to my opinion,

119
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,780
we should all go out

120
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,740
and search for funerary objects.

121
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,460
No.

122
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,420
We have to find Partridge Whistle first.

123
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,780
But we can't find him,

124
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,620
and we can't find the entrance either.

125
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,740
If you ask me,

126
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,340
I think he probably is…

127
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,500
Fine.

128
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,220
You just keep looking here.

129
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,500
I'll take my men out.

130
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,300
Let's go. Follow me.

131
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

132
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,500
Chen Yulou is so girly

133
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,380
and so impulsive.

134
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,860
We shouldn't waste our time

135
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,300
on someone who's probably already dead.

136
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,940
Yang.

137
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,660
Yes?

138
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,620
Commander Luo.

139
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,860
Come closer.

140
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Send more men

141
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,260
to find the tomb as soon as possible.

142
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,180
This is the real business.

143
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,664
Understood?

144
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:16,140
Just go!

145
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,580
Got it, I'll do it now.

146
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,100
Follow me!

147
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,712
Yes.

148
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,060
Leader.

149
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,980
It's really not because we are demoralized,

150
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,340
we've already searched every corner of this Palace.

151
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,380
Not to mention the Palace,

152
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,460
we've even searched
all the places outside the Palace.

153
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,340
But we still couldn't find the machinery.

154
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,900
We've done our best,

155
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,820
but we really couldn't find the entrance.

156
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,580
What do you say…

157
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,580
I have to find him,

158
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,020
no matter he's dead or alive.

159
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,300
Extend the scope and keep searching.

160
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,700
Got it.

161
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,620
Leader.

162
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,980
You say you wanna save Partridge Whistle

163
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,340
and I'm fine with it.

164
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,100
He's our brother, indeed we should save him.

165
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,380
But you know,

166
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,856
we both have so many men
waiting outside the gate.

167
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,460
We've already searched for him for a long time
and find nothing.

168
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,424
We're wasting our time here.

169
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,140
Yang.

170
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,740
Yes.

171
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,980
What time is it now?

172
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,300
Commander Luo.

173
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,260
It's already past one o'clock in the morning.

174
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,780
See? It's already past one o'clock
in the morning.

175
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,980
Leader.

176
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,220
We found a gap at the empty pond under the bridge.

177
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,300
But we don't know where it leads to.

178
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,580
Let's check it out.

179
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,540
Mother.

180
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,940
Mother.

181
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,700
I miss you so much.

182
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,620
Mother.

183
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,660
My boy.

184
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,660
Mom's here.

185
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,352
Mom.

186
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,340
I've been looking for the Dust Bead
for so many years

187
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,580
and I still couldn't find it.

188
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,660
I'm exhausted.

189
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,340
Could you please tell me

190
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,340
if there is such a thing
as the Dust Bead in the world?

191
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,020
What should I do?

192
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,620
I know you've been
working hard all these years.

193
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,300
Everything will get better

194
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,020
in the future.

195
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,860
Brother.

196
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,220
Brother.

197
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,980
Elder brother.

198
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,460
Elder brother.

199
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,900
Elder brother.

200
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,260
Hualing, he's here.

201
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,780
Elder brother.

202
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,420
Elder brother.

203
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,140
Is he alright?

204
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,060
It's weird.

205
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,580
It doesn't look like

206
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,300
he's poisoned by that huge centipede.

207
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,300
He is pale.

208
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,100
His lips are blue.

209
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
His pulse is irregular,
yet his breathing is regular.

210
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,620
It looks like that he might have
eaten some kind of herbal medicine.

211
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,180
Could it be the elixir in this bottle?

212
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,540
I don't think so.

213
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,540
Elder brother.

214
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,220
Go, go, let's go.

215
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,620
Get out of my way.

216
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,260
- Cripple Huama.
- Let me…

217
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,740
Check if there's any antidote around here.

218
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Okay.

219
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,340
Leader.

220
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,460
Brother Partridge Whistle is here!

221
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,380
My brother.

222
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,420
Brother.

223
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,060
What happened to him?

224
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,900
Sister Hualing.

225
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,260
Don't cry.

226
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,620
Don't cry, don't cry.

227
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,980
I'm here for you, don't cry.

228
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,780
Leader.

229
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,060
What the hell is this place?

230
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,660
I think we're in the Elixir Well
of the Elixir Palace of Bottle Mountain.

231
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
The Elixir Well?

232
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,980
What could an Elixir Well do?

233
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,540
This well was built for making elixirs.

234
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,900
The fire would go up when making elixirs,

235
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,540
so the well was needed.

236
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,540
Then how about the coffins
which scatter all over here?

237
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,100
They were secretly dug
from all places by the alchemists

238
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,860
and used for making guiding medicinals
which could enhance the efficacy of elixirs.

239
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,460
People in the ancient times believed that

240
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,180
mummy's meat could be used as medicine,

241
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,580
which were called Menxiang.

242
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,660
They thought the reason why
mummies wouldn't rot

243
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
was because they took the
dragon's essence qi from the ground.

244
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,740
But we know the dragon's essence qi
is impalpable and invisible,

245
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,340
so they thought,

246
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,620
they could extract it by boiling the mummies.

247
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,980
Damn!

248
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,220
What the hell?

249
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,260
How could they think of such a dirty trick?

250
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,580
Using mummy's meat to make elixirs?

251
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,140
Places for making elixirs are supposed to be blessed.

252
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,220
But I didn't expect that

253
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,140
there was such an ignorant
and absurd story hiding in here.

254
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,340
No wonder it's so gloomy here in the Bottle mountain.

255
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,740
I didn't expect that

256
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,740
though here's an Elixir Well
for making elixirs for the imperial families,

257
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,180
it's so dirty inside!

258
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,140
So unscrupulous and so inhuman.

259
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,780
Elder brother, wake up.

260
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,420
Elder brother.

261
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,460
Elder brother.

262
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,020
Elder brother.

263
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,500
Elder brother.

264
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,740
Elder brother.

265
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,620
Elder brother, please wake up.

266
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,340
Elder brother. Could you wake up?

267
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,140
Elder brother.

268
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,780
Don't leave me alone.

269
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,900
Elder brother.

270
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Elder brother, wake up!
Please, elder brother.

271
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,780
Elder brother.

272
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,380
Old Foreigner died.

273
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,460
I don't want to be alone.

274
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,940
I'm so scared.

275
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,140
I don't want to be alone here.

276
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,540
Sounds nice.

277
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,540
Brother Cripple.

278
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,660
Is this valuable?

279
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,460
Looks like it was made in Qin or Han Dynasty.

280
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,420
Qin or Han Dynasty?

281
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,140
Such a big one. Awesome!

282
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,500
Yang.

283
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:30,820
Yes?

284
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,740
Get me two groups.

285
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,220
One is for cleaning the remaining of the corpses.

286
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
The other one

287
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,380
is for picking up the treasures.
Hurry up!

288
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,100
- Got it.
- Got it.

289
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,700
Go get corpse-poking poles
and fishing nets prepared

290
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
to prevent the mummies coming back to life.

291
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

292
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,420
Fishing nets?

293
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,060
Some of the mummies are dead but not rotten.

294
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,288
After absorbing yang qi,

295
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
they may come back to life
and attack the people they meet.

296
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
If we do come across a huge mummy,

297
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,300
even water, fire, swords and guns
might fail to kill it.

298
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,860
So we have to poke the mummies,
wrap them with fishing nets

299
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,900
and stuff their mouths with big black donkey hooves.

300
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,020
So many profound secrets, huh?

301
00:29:57,104 --> 00:29:58,420
Interesting, interesting.

302
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,460
Brother Cripple.

303
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,660
It would be awesome

304
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,060
if we can move this out.

305
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,860
Commander Luo.

306
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,300
It weighs about 1102 pounds.

307
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,820
Easy.

308
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,580
We just break it,
and move it out one by one.

309
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,100
If we break it,

310
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,500
it's worthless.

311
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,900
That's true.

312
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,180
Alright.

313
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,660
Elder brother.

314
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,820
Why his body is so cold?

315
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,420
It's not right.

316
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,740
He was warm a minute ago.

317
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,500
Elder brother.

318
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,820
Elder brother, wake up.

319
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,420
Leader Chen.

320
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,620
You are experienced and knowledgeable.

321
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Could you please do something about it?

322
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,020
Elder brother.

323
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:25,740
Elder brother.

324
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,780
You've been looking for the Dust Bead
for half of your lifetime.

325
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,500
You can have a rest now.

326
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,860
Elder brother.

327
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,260
You've been looking for the Dust Bead
for half of your lifetime.

328
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,420
You deserve a good rest.

329
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,980
Elder brother.

330
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,220
Elder brother.

331
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,140
How do you feel?

332
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:24,860
Elder brother.

333
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,580
He's awake?

334
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,260
Brother.

335
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Elder brother.

336
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,140
Are you alright?

337
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,940
Elder brother.

338
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,980
Elder brother, you finally woke up.

339
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,820
I was so scared.

340
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,940
As long as you're awake.

341
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,580
Brother, if you never wake up,

342
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,100
how am I supposed to live my life?

343
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,700
I was in a critical condition.

344
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,860
I had to do so.

345
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,980
I hope you don't mind.

346
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,180
You waking up is better than anything.

347
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,420
You didn't know.

348
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,620
When you were in the coma,

349
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,260
the Leader and I

350
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,380
were so worried about you,

351
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,900
especially me.

352
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,180
I immediately gave an order.

353
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,900
I said, Yang,

354
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,020
find a way to open the wellhead

355
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,980
as soon as possible.

356
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,260
We have to rescue brother Partridge Whistle.

357
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,620
Brother.

358
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,020
How are you feeling right now?

359
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
Strangely enough,

360
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,860
I feel that my qi and blood in the chest flow really well,

361
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,060
and I feel peaceful,

362
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,580
and even more more strength
and power than usual.

363
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,380
Why is that?

364
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,900
Maybe,

365
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,580
it's because of the internal elixir
of the hexapterous centipede I ate.

366
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,460
What?

367
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,460
You mean,

368
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,260
the centipede had made
an internal elixir inside its own body?

369
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,220
Yes.

370
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,980
I robbed the elixir over

371
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,060
when the centipede was curing itself

372
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,060
by swallowing and spitting the internal elixir.

373
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,060
An internal elixir?

374
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,340
I never know there is such a good thing.

375
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,380
What is an internal elixir exactly?

376
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,500
Could you get me one?
I want to strengthen my body too.

377
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,100
It looks like that being afraid of death

378
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,700
is not just the nature of mankind,

379
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,260
all living creatures long for immortality.

380
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,180
The way they seek for longevity

381
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,740
is nothing more than internal and external elixirs.

382
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,500
The external elixirs are made
by herb, mercury, gold and stone.

383
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,580
And internal elixirs are more mysterious.

384
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,620
Some of them are made through
expiration and inspiration.

385
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,820
Some are made through yin and yang filling skills.

386
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,940
I think the centipede must have swallowed

387
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,420
the guiding medicinals of elixirs
left in this Underground Palace,

388
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,580
and cultivated an internal elixir inside its body

389
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
by absorbing the essence
of the sun and the moon.

390
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,540
That makes sense.

391
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,380
Brother Partridge Whistle.

392
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,740
Could you tell me about it?

393
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,300
How did you kill that centipede all alone

394
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,180
and survive

395
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,140
after you falling down into the well?

396
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,580
Tell me about it.

397
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,580
Luo.

398
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,140
Brother Partridge Whistle just woke up.

399
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,300
Let him have a good rest.

400
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,380
Yeah, yeah. You are right.

401
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,540
Sorry for being a pepperbox.

402
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,380
Where's Old Foreigner?

403
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,100
How is he?

404
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,220
Elder brother.

405
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,416
Old Foreigner is…
