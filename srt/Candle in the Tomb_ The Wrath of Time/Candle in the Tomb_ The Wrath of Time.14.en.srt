1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,820
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,180
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,820
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,700
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,900
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,980
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,340
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,460
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,380
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,940
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,620
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,060
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,220
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,300
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,340
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,860
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,060
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,340
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,500
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:39,620
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,180
=Episode 14=

23
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,460
Red Girl.

24
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,460
Are you flirting with me?

25
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,020
I like it.

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,100
I like it.

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,020
Leader Chen.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,100
Just now…

29
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,260
Gunshots.

30
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,060
Something's wrong.

31
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,980
Commander Luo, shall we shoot?

32
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,208
No.

33
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,660
Our boss and Red Girl are still in there.

34
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,700
Are you alright?

35
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,500
Get out of here! Hurry up! Hurry!

36
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,020
Be careful.

37
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,460
Fire!

38
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,220
I don't think

39
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,060
you can escape from my Revolver!

40
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,180
We've killed so many little centipedes
and centipede eggs.

41
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,300
This one must be the ancestor of those centipedes,

42
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,140
sending its sons and grandsons

43
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,900
to get back at us.

44
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,820
What should we do?

45
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,140
I have an idea.

46
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,792
We Xieling sect once used the Dragon-Stripping Tactic
when we were on the mountain

47
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,700
to kill a bucket-thick anaconda.

48
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Dragon-Stripping Tactic?

49
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,780
Dragon-Stripping Tactic is using sharp knives
to cut bamboos

50
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,220
to make thousands of sticks in different sizes

51
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,820
and put them on the entrance of the anaconda's cave.

52
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,700
Each stick is as thin as a steel needle,

53
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,296
and is buried into the soil,

54
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:00,544
only a tiny bit is exposed
when inserted into the soil

55
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,700
Then we set them one by one every other step,

56
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,260
paving in the direction of the anaconda crawling.

57
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,860
And the sticks get longer and sharper along the way

58
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,740
with anesthetic on the tip.

59
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,660
That is to say,

60
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,380
we let the anaconda crawl along the sticks by itself?

61
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,100
Exactly.

62
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,580
When the anaconda crawls out of the cave,

63
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,420
its abdomen has already been cut by the sticks.

64
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,540
As its skin is thick,

65
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,020
the anaconda will keep going without knowing the wounds,

66
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:28,176
and the sticks get longer and sharper.

67
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,420
The anaconda only moves forward

68
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,180
and anesthetic starts to take effect.

69
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,980
So when the anaconda realizes something,

70
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,540
it's already too late.

71
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,128
The anaconda's skin will be torn up
within three to five hundred steps

72
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,140
and then dies on the ground.

73
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,900
Brilliant.

74
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,340
It's a good idea.
Sounds gratifying.

75
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,580
Brother Partridge Whistle.
What do you think?

76
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,540
The anaconda's abdomen is soft and thin,

77
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,420
while the centipede has hard shell all over the body.

78
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,500
I really don't know whether it would work or not.

79
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
The carapace of centipede is hard indeed.

80
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Otherwise it wouldn't be bulletproof.

81
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,260
But I think,

82
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,500
the centipede's weakness is the abdomen.

83
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,820
That's why Old Foreigner can hurt it by arrows.

84
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,740
Besides, in order to kill it,

85
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,980
we definitely can't use bamboo sticks.

86
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,340
All our Xieling brothers

87
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,700
have short swords,

88
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,140
they're made of high-quality steel and are extremely sharp.

89
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,940
So I think,

90
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,540
it's gonna be quite easy

91
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,980
to cut it open.

92
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,020
But I think there's something wrong with this idea.

93
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,420
The Dragon-Stripping Tactic
succeeded on the anaconda's way home.

94
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
But anacondas only have one way to their caves.

95
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,980
It was indeed easy for you to catch it.

96
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,100
But as for that huge centipede,

97
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,220
it doesn't have an certain route.

98
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,820
How will you know where it comes from

99
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,660
and where it goes?

100
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,340
We can use the arch bridge outside the Palace.

101
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,620
It's long and narrow.

102
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,100
which is the most suitable place for deploying the tactic.

103
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,620
You mean,

104
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,180
we can lead the centipede to the arch bridge?

105
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,540
We could use the Nuqing Rooster.

106
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,660
Just now, the hexapterous centipede

107
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,380
was pissed off by the sound of the Nuqing Rooster.

108
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,340
And rooster is a natural enemy of the centipede.

109
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,860
And the Nuqing Rooster has eaten so many little centipedes.

110
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,780
I believe the hexapterous centipede wants to kill it.

111
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
We can use this

112
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,740
to draw it out.

113
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,180
No.

114
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,060
What if your idea doesn't work

115
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,980
and the Rooster gets hurt?

116
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,460
The reason why we get the Nuqing Rooster

117
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,740
is to use it to cope with poison animals, right?

118
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,940
You're right, brother Chen.

119
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,100
But this centipede is huge,

120
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,700
and its propensity and temper

121
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,820
are so different from normal ones.

122
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,260
So we can't deal with it in a normal way.

123
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,060
We need an extra plan.

124
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,420
I have an idea.

125
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,664
In the past,
when we were hunting in the forest,

126
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,620
there was a method we'd always use.

127
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,020
Simple but effective.

128
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,740
I'm all ears.

129
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,140
First, we'll trick the centipede into this Palace.

130
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,140
Then Old Foreigner, Hualing and I

131
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,460
will use the Sky-Reaching Chain to tie it up

132
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,260
and hang it in the air.

133
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,500
Then you guys

134
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,220
shoot it in its weak spots,

135
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,940
and as Brother Chen said before, its abdomen.

136
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,580
Based on our experience, it might work.

137
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,900
With one more idea,
our chance of winning may be bigger.

138
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,060
It's also a good idea.

139
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,020
Let's act separately.

140
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,820
No problem.

141
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,740
Elder brother.

142
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,940
I don't think Xieling sect's idea could work.

143
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,140
They're too naive.

144
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,460
They gotta count on us.

145
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,340
You're a last minute helper.

146
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,620
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

147
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,820
How can you talk to
your elder brother like this?

148
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,060
Talking straight to his face

149
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,460
would embarrass him.

150
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,060
Only the result matters.

151
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,140
Cut the cackle.

152
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,700
Get back to work.

153
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,420
Got it.

154
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,780
The centipede could be here any minute.

155
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,220
Hurry up, you guys.

156
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,260
- Okay.
- Got it.

157
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Leader.

158
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,620
Why are you here?

159
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,740
I heard from others that

160
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,980
Leader is going to
use the Dragon-Stripping Tactic.

161
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,100
I once helped you with that before.

162
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,020
I can help.

163
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,660
Alright then.

164
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,140
Leader.

165
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,340
I've brought a group of my pistol company from outside.

166
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,060
Listen up.

167
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,700
You people, ambush at the bridge end.

168
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
And you people,

169
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,620
go to the Palace to help Partridge Whistle.

170
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,460
When he hangs up the centipede,

171
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,020
you just shoot the centipede in the abdomen.

172
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,060
There's a prize for whoever kills the centipede.

173
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,220
Understood?

174
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,448
- Yes!
- Go ahead.

175
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,380
Red Girl.

176
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,740
Which idea do you think is better?

177
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,380
Ours or Banshan sect's?

178
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,140
I think each of them

179
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,900
has its advantages.

180
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
What if you have to choose one?

181
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,940
You'd choose Partridge Whistle's, right?

182
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,500
Leader.

183
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,780
You're talking about the idea

184
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
or the person?

185
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
Shut your mouth.

186
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,700
I'll go get more short swords.

187
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,860
What a girl.

188
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,140
I like her.

189
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,580
Listen, put it here.

190
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,580
See?

191
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,140
Leader.

192
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,220
Tell me about it.

193
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,620
What are you gonna do

194
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,180
to trick the hexapterous centipede
onto the bridge?

195
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,180
I'll be the bait myself, big deal.

196
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,420
No way.

197
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,900
There are swords and poisons all around here.

198
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,300
You're too important to us.

199
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,860
Don't joke about this.

200
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,180
We all have to rely on you later.

201
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,980
Let me be the bait.

202
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,900
Deal.

203
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,220
Deal.

204
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,220
I'll definitely kill you when you come out,

205
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:14,576
you bastard.

206
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,020
Leader Chen.

207
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,580
I've been thinking about one thing.

208
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,832
Finding treasures

209
00:17:24,896 --> 00:17:26,540
is our ultimate goal, right?

210
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,100
Then why do we have to

211
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,340
battle with this centipede?

212
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,740
It's wasting our time.

213
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,180
Is it really necessary?

214
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,700
We've already hurt it badly,

215
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,620
and it'll never let us pass through easily.

216
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,860
Instead of waiting for it to eat us,

217
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,340
I'd rather take the initiative.

218
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,860
Besides,

219
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,860
are you willing to give up

220
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,380
all the treasures inside?

221
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,100
Of course not.

222
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,980
I believe the treasures must be in there.

223
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,620
We just need to find other exits.

224
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,540
And if we keep the centipede alive,

225
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,220
it'll become the barrier for us
sooner or later.

226
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,100
Exactly.

227
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,620
Leader, the trap is ready.

228
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,820
The Dragon-Stripping Tactic is ready.

229
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,940
Chen Yulou is determined and confident.

230
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
He must kill that hexapterous centipede

231
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,380
with his short sword Xiaoshenfeng.

232
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,300
It's coming.

233
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,940
Get ready.

234
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,860
Leader.

235
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,780
Boss.

236
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,380
Red Girl.

237
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,580
Rooster, bro!

238
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,060
Red Girl.

239
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,180
Leader.

240
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,020
Red Girl.

241
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,060
Red Girl.

242
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,340
Red Girl.

243
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,060
Take her to a safe place. Hurry up.

244
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,700
Fire!

245
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,780
Don't shoot just like this.

246
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
What if you kill our own people?

247
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,740
Elder brother.

248
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,700
Elder brother.

249
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,620
I'm fine.

250
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,060
Elder brother.

251
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,820
Fire! Aim at the centipede!

252
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,900
Aim at the centipede!

253
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,900
Old Foreigner.

254
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,260
Hang in there.

255
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,060
Press on his wound.

256
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
Old Foreigner.

257
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,340
Old Foreigner.

258
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,140
Elder brother.

259
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,580
Elder brother.

260
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,100
Elder brother.

261
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,100
Elder brother.

262
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,340
Elder…

263
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,060
Elder brother, you hang in there.

264
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
You stay here
and try to stop the bleeding for him.

265
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,420
Hang in there.

266
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,260
Elder brother, hang in there.

267
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:04,992
Come out!
