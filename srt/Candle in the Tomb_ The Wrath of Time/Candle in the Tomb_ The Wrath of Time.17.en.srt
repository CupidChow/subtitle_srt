1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 17=

23
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,780
Leader.

24
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,260
Don't blame yourself so hard.

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
This is our fate.

26
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,980
You were poisoned

27
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,700
and you couldn't control yourself.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,460
If the leader of Banshan sect
is a reasonable person,

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,620
he wouldn't blame this on you.

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,740
The people of Xiangxi

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,420
are still suffering.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,020
They are in urgent need of our help.

33
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,900
Leader, it's not the right time
for being emotional.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,820
Boss.

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,740
Partridge Whistle goes up the mountain alone.

36
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,580
He said the tomb of Yuan Dynasty
is on the top of mountain.

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,820
The body of the Bottle Mountain
looks like a calabash.

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,700
The mountainside is as hollow as
a bottle's stomach.

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,100
The Elixir Palace was built inside.

40
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,140
People who tried to find the tomb

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,780
all focused on the grottoes,

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
but ignored the opening of the bottle
which is at the top of the mountain.

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,580
Mausoleums were always built underground
since ancient times.

44
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,160
Even if they had to plough the mountain
into the shape of a coffin

45
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,860
or break stones,

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,900
they'd hide the mausoleum
into the deepest part of the mountainside.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,300
We really can't explore
the tomb of the Bottle Mountain

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,780
in a normal way.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,780
They should put the mausoleum
on the top of the mountain

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,300
and place a fake tomb at the foot

51
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,340
to distract people.

52
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,900
It looks like that the reason why
people from Yuan Dynasty

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,540
changed the Elixir Palace into a tomb

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,780
was to suppress the cave here.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,580
This is called the Suppressing Sorcery.

56
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
Using mausoleums to suppress the evil things

57
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,780
is really rare.

58
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,900
Besides,

59
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,220
the Suppressing Sorcery
of the Hmong Village nearby

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,860
is also carried out at the topmost of their house.

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,940
In this way,

62
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,180
the tomb must be on the mountaintop.

63
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:07,056
Alright.

64
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,820
Now that we know the specific location of the tomb,

65
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,860
we should set off right away.

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,180
He's right, boss.

67
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,620
Partridge Whistle went up alone,

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,020
we can't catch up with him
if we don't start off now.

69
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,460
Let's go.

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,820
Sister Hualing.

71
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,500
Commander Luo.

72
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,552
You stay here.

73
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,352
What?

74
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,060
Your eye hasn't recovered yet.

75
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,780
You just stay here
and keep an eye on everything.

76
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,220
But I… I…

77
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,060
You guys, follow them.

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,860
- Got it.
- Got it.

79
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,900
Elder brother.

80
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,580
Elder brother, it's done.

81
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,620
Elder brother, be careful when you go down there.

82
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Why don't you worry about me?

83
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,180
What could happen to you?

84
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,620
Don't talk to your elder brother like that.

85
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Stop it.

86
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,860
You both need to come back safely.

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,740
That's my good sister.

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,460
Stop it.

89
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,540
Elder brother, let's go.

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,020
Leader.

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,980
Do you believe that guy of Banshan sect?

92
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,980
You think the entrance of the tomb
of Yuan Dynasty is really here?

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,540
Let's find out.

94
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:12,940
Hurry up.

95
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,740
- Got it.
- Yes.

96
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,860
Hurry.

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,220
Don't loaf on your work.

98
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,340
Got it!

99
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,900
Hurry up, hurry.

100
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,860
Hurry up, hurry.

101
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,180
Hurry up!

102
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,220
You guys come here.

103
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,460
Get this out of here.

105
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,380
- Got it.
- Got it.

106
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,060
Let's go.

107
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,540
Leader.

108
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,620
What's that smell?

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,780
It's a cold fragrance from herbs.

110
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,060
It's Jiulongpan's smell.

111
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,100
Partridge Whistle.

112
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,460
Are you alright?

113
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,900
It looks like that he also has recognized

114
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,700
a fishy smell of tomb
through the cold fragrance.

115
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,580
Over there.

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,940
This herb is called Maoeryan.

117
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,900
It only grows near the tomb.

118
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,700
There must be a tomb here.

119
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,900
There's so many good stuffs
on this herbal wall.

120
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,580
They can all fetch a good price.

121
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,860
Be careful, everyone.

122
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,580
Boss.

123
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,780
Shall we follow them?

124
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's go.

125
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,220
Careful.

126
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,220
Be careful.

127
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,700
Come on, we need some help here!

128
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,980
Watch your step! Watch your step!

129
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,620
- Come on!
- Come on!

130
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
Watch your step.

131
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,060
Lend me a hand.

132
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,500
Take it easy.

133
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,380
Careful. Watch your back.

134
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,660
What are you doing?

135
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,380
Hand it over!

136
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,260
Don't sling mud at me!

137
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,380
I clearly saw you

138
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,180
put something into your pocket.

139
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,700
Hand it over!

140
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,660
What did I take?

141
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,460
You thief! Give it to me!

142
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,300
Hand it over!

143
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,420
Hand it over!

144
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,100
You thief!

145
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,100
Give it to me!

146
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,380
Hand it over!

147
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,940
Hand it over!

148
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
What are you quarreling about?

149
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,060
He hid something into his pocket.

150
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,380
What did you hide?

151
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,740
Sir, he is slinging mud at me!

152
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,180
Last time,
it was also him who asked for trouble.

153
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,420
Me? Asking for trouble?

154
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,300
Do you have guts
to show us what you stole?

155
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,940
Wait! Watch out for the machinery.

156
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,260
Brother.

157
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,380
No! Brother Partridge Whistle, stop!

158
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
Mind your own business.

159
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,340
What happened?
Why is the mountain shaking?

160
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,780
Is it an earthquake?

161
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,260
Boss.

162
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,700
What's going on?

163
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,460
Brother.

164
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,500
You were so scared before.

165
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,460
Did you wet yourself?

166
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,140
Shut up.

167
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,540
If you were here,
you would wet yourself too.

168
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,580
If I fell down from here,

169
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,780
I would crash into pieces.

170
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,380
Partridge Whistle, it's too dangerous here.
Don't go in there.

171
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,860
Let's go.

172
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,180
Let's get out of here.

173
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,580
Brother.

174
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,900
It's too dangerous.
Let's go out.

175
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,220
Partridge Whistle.

176
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,020
Let's get out of here.

177
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,380
Go!

178
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,100
Hurry up!

179
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
Run!

180
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,420
- Run!
- Run!

181
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,740
Get out of here!

182
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,860
Hold on.

183
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,820
Cripple Huama.

184
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,620
Ask our men to jump across the mountain!

185
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,100
Hurry up!

186
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,740
Now! Or you will die!
The mountain is falling down.

187
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,540
Stop looking back.

188
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,060
We can search for the Dust Bead anytime.

189
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,980
You wanna die here?

190
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,100
Let's go!

191
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,780
If you won't leave,
then I'll stay here with you.

192
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:25,380
Leader!

193
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,540
Leader! Don't… Leader!

194
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,140
Leader!

195
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,020
Leader!

196
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,780
Leader!

197
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,620
Let go of me.

198
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,300
Let go of me!

199
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,180
One is better than none.

200
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,740
You are the only one left of Banshan sect.

201
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,740
You have to live…

202
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,700
No, I can't let you die!

203
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,660
How are you feeling?

204
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,740
Can you move?

205
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,620
If not, climb on my back.

206
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,540
Don't run. Come back.

207
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
Pick them up.

208
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,820
Pick them up.

209
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Come back.

210
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,740
Pick them up.

211
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,180
Let's go.

212
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,540
Hurry! Or we will all die here!

213
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,060
Hurry up!

214
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,140
Get out of my way!

215
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,700
Let me leave first. Come on!

216
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,860
Come on! All of you!

217
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Which way?

218
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Here! This way!

219
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,700
Run!

220
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,220
Run!

221
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,900
Run!

222
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,860
Leader!

223
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,500
My dearest Leader.

224
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,820
You are still alive.

225
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,260
Great.

226
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,660
That's great!

227
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,940
The mountain fell down.

228
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,500
Some of my men died, and some escaped.

229
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,700
Most of the treasures

230
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,540
were buried in the cave.

231
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,260
We suffered a double loss this time.

232
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,140
What should we do?

233
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,700
It's all my fault.

234
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,660
What?

235
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,180
I shouldn't have come.

236
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,300
It's all my fault.

237
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,380
My fault.

238
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,180
So you don't know what to do either.

239
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,940
Commander Luo.

240
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,340
We'd better go back to the Mortuary first

241
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,500
and then discuss what to do the next.

242
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,260
Chen Yulou watched huge rocks falling down,
killing so many people.

243
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
He is so frustrated and painful.

244
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,580
He is pale
and suddenly is filled with anger.

245
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,940
It seems like that all his desire to succeed

246
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,060
has fallen down together with the Bottle Mountain.

247
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,140
The entire Xiangjiang River cannot cover his failure.

248
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,568
He regrets deeply and blames himself so hard.

249
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,928
All his ambitions are blasted.

250
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,552
He ignored Luo Laowai and other people,

251
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,180
directly staggering away.

252
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,820
I'm sorry.

253
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,740
I shouldn't have been so mean to you.

254
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,420
It's not your fault.

255
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,060
What happened just now

256
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,620
reminds me of the past.

257
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,980
My father told me something

258
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,980
before he died.

259
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,180
He asked me to live a good life.

260
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,900
At that time,

261
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,460
I watched my father

262
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,620
get killed by those bullies.

263
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,540
I know about your past.

264
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,220
You then set fire to burn all those bullies.

265
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,260
That was not me.

266
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,340
But everyone believed it was me

267
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,940
who killed the bully's entire family.

268
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,100
They thought I wanted to take revenge.

269
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,900
Actually,

270
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,740
they just caught in a fire accidentally.

271
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,740
The God was punishing them.

272
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,140
But I really wish

273
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,820
it was me who avenged my father.

274
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,860
Only I was too young at that time,

275
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,740
I wasn't brave enough.

276
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,900
Just let them die easily like that.

277
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,820
My poor father.

278
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,780
No matter what happened yesterday,

279
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,340
tomorrow is always full of hope.

280
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,900
Just like the sun.

281
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,220
The sun falls every day,

282
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,460
but tomorrow,

283
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,580
it will rise up again.

284
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:13,980
Commander Luo.

285
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,660
Leader Chen is…

286
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,500
Man proposes, God disposes.

287
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,540
Who could have foreseen
that the Bottle Mountain would collapse?

288
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,980
I think that

289
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,100
we can't rely on anyone else

290
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,620
but ourselves.

291
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,180
Yang.

292
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,300
We should go there again.

293
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,232
We two must carry on.

294
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:42,300
We can't accept failure just like that.

295
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,060
Commander Luo.

296
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,540
Don't worry.

297
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,700
I definitely won't let you down.

298
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,100
Good.

299
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,700
Cripple Huama.

300
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,060
Red Girl.

301
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,580
The leader of Banshan sect…

302
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,980
You both made it!

303
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,060
Where's Leader?

304
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,340
He thought you were…

305
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,900
He was distressed and regretful.

306
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,060
And he was quite depressed.

307
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
When he came back, seeing our men suffer heavy losses,

308
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,460
he was even more defeated,

309
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,580
and couldn't forgive himself.

310
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,500
Let me go check on him.

311
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,780
That won't work.

312
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,220
I've already tried to talk him out of it.

313
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,740
But he's been like this since he came back.

314
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,940
He wouldn't even say a word.

315
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,940
You're still alive?

316
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
That's awesome.

317
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,620
Red Girl.

318
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,380
Go pack your things.

319
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,380
Let's get out of here when you're done.

320
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,060
And you too.

321
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,300
Let's leave here.

322
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,660
Leave here.

323
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,860
Chen Yulou!

324
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,060
You junk!

325
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,140
Our Banshan sect has had failures for thousands of years

326
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,500
since we started to search for the Dust Bead.

327
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Countless people have died
from generation to generation.

328
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,420
If we were all like you,

329
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,180
then our Banshan sect is long gone.

330
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,580
I failed.

331
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,440
Failed!

332
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,260
Don't you understand?

333
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,660
You have to accept it.

334
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,900
I thought

335
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,900
the leader of the Xieling sect was a real man.

336
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,980
But it turns out you are also a coward.

337
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,700
You're right.

338
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm a coward.

339
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
I didn't think I was one.

340
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,704
But now I know.

341
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,820
I am a coward, so what?

342
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,620
Then how about the people who died inside?

343
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,580
Were they cowards?

344
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,700
They died for nothing?

345
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,100
Yeah, they died for nothing!

346
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,900
What do you want?

347
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,700
You want me to die for them?

348
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I don't care.

349
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,980
I'm just a cheap dog.

350
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,300
Indeed, your life is nothing.

351
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Nothing!

352
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,980
But you've still got your men.

353
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,700
You have to finish the missions waiting for you.

354
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,220
Or the Xieling sect will become a joke in the Jianghu

355
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,340
and never get to rise again.

356
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,420
Which one is more important?

357
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,860
Think it over.

358
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Does it hurt?

359
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,100
Hold on.

360
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,940
I still owe you a question.

361
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,980
What question?

362
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,620
You asked Hualing how old I was
when I joined the Banshan sect.

363
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,260
How old were you?

364
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
13.

365
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,140
The elder brother of Banshan
thought I was too weak.

366
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,100
In order to join the Banshan sect,

367
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,420
I had to prove my capabilities.

368
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,900
So,

369
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,300
you went to the wolf valley all alone.

370
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,860
There were a dozen of wolves there.

371
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,140
I used little wolves as baits

372
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,020
to seduce big wolves one by one,

373
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,380
and then killed them all.

374
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,500
You were only 13 years old.

375
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,020
Weren't you afraid that you couldn't
walk out of the wolf valley alive?

376
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,140
If I couldn't,

377
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,460
it meant that I was not capable enough.

378
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,220
I wouldn't be able to save my mother

379
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,300
and I couldn't join the Bansan sect.

380
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,460
Then I deserved to die there.

381
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,060
Parents in the world

382
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,860
all hope their children

383
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,020
can live a good life.

384
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
We Zhagelama people

385
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,300
were cursed by the Guidong people 2000 years ago.

386
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,140
It is said that only the Dust Bead
can break the curse.

387
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,180
My father was in the Banshan sect too.

388
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,220
He died in the tomb and never came back.

389
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,184
And my mother,

390
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,976
she died because of the curse.
