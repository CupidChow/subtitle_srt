1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 13=

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,840
Leader.

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,080
We've already explored the way ahead.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
Nothing unusual.

26
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,600
But there are murals on both sides.

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,800
I don't know what those are about.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,760
Leader.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
Murals are all over here.

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,040
Let me see.

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,040
Light up.

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Beauties.

33
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,000
Leader.

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,080
Could you tell me

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,440
what do they mean?

36
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,160
After the First Emperor of Qin
had united the whole country,

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,320
he was deeply affected

38
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
by the yin-yang, five elements,

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
Taoist ideas and immortals.

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,040
When he was alive,
he looked for immortals.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,840
After he died, the atmosphere of
elaborate funeral became prevalent.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,400
Han Dynasty followed Qin Dynasty's law system.

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,840
In Han Dynasty,

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
the Emperors were more absorbed

45
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,440
in the words from those immortals and alchemists

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
and the magic skills for longevity.

47
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,480
So, these murals of Qin and Han Dynasty

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,880
are all about expelling evil spirits
and getting rid of diseases

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,880
or the propitious omens of becoming immortal.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,200
Expelling evil spirits?

51
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,200
It's a burial ceremony of Han Dynasty,

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,360
which aims to protect the dead people

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,200
from the intrusion of the gremlin of forests.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,440
Those Nuo rituals
(Nuo means exorcising evil spirits)

55
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
actually carry on the customs of Nuo rituals

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,240
by Fangxiangshi in Qin Dynasty.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Brother Partridge Whistle.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,720
You are so knowledgeable.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,120
Could you tell me

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,400
whose wives these beauties are?

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
The one who's holding the ganoderma

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,680
is an immortal guiding the tomb owner's spirit to the heaven.

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,720
In this mural…

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,200
Elder brother, it's the Dust Bead!

65
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,080
The Dust Bead?

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,640
Elder brother.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,600
Elder brother.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
It really looks like the Dust Bead.

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
But where is this place?

70
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,320
Looks like it's in this tomb of Yuan Dynasty.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,520
Elder brother, doesn't this man look like
the general of Yuan Dynasty?

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
They do look alike.

73
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,840
If only the Bead is in this tomb.

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,560
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,640
What if it's still not the Dust Bead?

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,760
We just got a clue.

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Would you please stop being negative?

78
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm telling the truth.

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,440
The truth is always unpleasant.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
So you mean I'm not telling the truth?

81
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,760
How many paintings like these have we seen before?

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,800
Did we find the Bead?

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm telling you.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,920
Even if we only have one clue,

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
we have to keep searching.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,560
I also wish it's the Dust Bead.

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,368
- Then why…
- That's enough. Stop.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,360
You kids.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,280
Just couldn't stop quarreling.

90
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,520
You've got me a headache.

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,560
If you ask me,

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,880
just search the tomb

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,032
to make sure whether the Bead is here.

94
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Stop fighting!

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Why are you shouting?

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,080
Commander Luo, help me!

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,240
Help.

98
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,360
Help.

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,400
Everyone stays away from him.

100
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,360
Help me.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,320
Help me. Help me.

102
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Help me. Help me.

103
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,320
Help.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,160
Help.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,080
Please help me!

106
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Turn back!

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,976
- Help.
- Hurry!

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,128
- Turn back.
- Elder brother.

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,120
Go. Let's go.

110
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,070
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

111
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,120
Run.

112
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,440
Hurry. Hurry up.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,720
Leader, why did you come out?

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,120
You!

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm fine.

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,560
I just feel uncomfortable when I look at him.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,720
You'd better take aim before shooting.

118
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,960
Old Foreigner. Hualing.

119
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,440
Come here.

120
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,160
Okay.

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,640
It turns out that the mucus in the tunnel

122
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
actually are centipede eggs.

123
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,440
Looks like that they use human bodies as hosts

124
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
and absorb their blood and essence.

125
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,080
When the timing is right, they'll break out.

126
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,040
That is to say,

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,440
as long as these eggs don't get into the skin
or five sense organs,

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
we're safe.

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,432
Let me see.

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,080
How am I supposed to go inside

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,560
with so many eggs in the tunnel?

132
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Commander Luo.

133
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,000
Go away.

134
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,280
Elder brother.

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,680
The Rooster is still sleeping.
I can't wake it up.

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,320
Stop sleeping.

137
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,000
Wake up, wake up.

138
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,720
Can you wake it up or not?

139
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Go ahead if you can do it.

140
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,360
Stop making noise.

141
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,920
You'd also be sleepy if you eat too much, right?

142
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,000
Leave me alone.

143
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,200
Get up.

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,320
Cripple Huama.

145
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
Tell everyone to use fire

146
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
to burn all the eggs in the tunnel

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,600
and then spread lime powder in all the gaps.

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Got it.

149
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Yang, understood?

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,560
Go get as many torches as possible.
Burn them all!

151
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Go get torches.

152
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,480
- Yes.
- Got it.

153
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
What happened?

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,680
There's a kind of centipede egg

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,480
which can pierce through the skin.

156
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,360
This man

157
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
was attacked by the eggs.

158
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,040
So he…

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,400
How about our Leader and other people?

160
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,600
Some of our brothers are dead.

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,520
The Leader is fine.

162
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
Elder brother.

163
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,280
Are you still thinking about the mural?

164
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,720
Since there are some clues,

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,880
we wouldn't make this trip in vain.

166
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,880
As long as we have a single clue,

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,720
no matter how difficult it is,

168
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,840
we will go together to find it out.

169
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:35,488
Don't you feel frustrated

170
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
that we couldn't find the Dust Bead the whole time?

171
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,160
Elder brother,
do you think it's possible for us to find it?

172
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,360
I only trust my elder brother in this world.

173
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
If you think so,

174
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
then I think so, too.

175
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,760
Leader.

176
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Leader.

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,560
We've already cleared them up.

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The tunnel is safe now.

179
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,800
Are you sure?

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
Elder brother, the Rooster…

181
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Elder brother.

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Leader.

183
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
You stay here.

184
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,320
Commander Luo.

185
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,160
It's very dangerous inside.
Let me explore it for you.

186
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,072
You stay here, behave yourself

187
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:53,720
and keep an eye on it.

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,640
Elder brother.

189
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,400
Elder brother.

190
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Elder brother.

191
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
Elder brother.

192
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
Let's go.

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,960
Look. Look.

194
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,200
Jades everywhere.

195
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,040
You two,

196
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,360
go and explore the way ahead.

197
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,720
Boss.

198
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,240
Didn't I ask you to stay outside?

199
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
Why are you here?

200
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,680
I saw so many people were carried out

201
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm worried about you.

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
You're worried about me?

203
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
Red Girl.

204
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,560
How about me?

205
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:53,320
Back off.

206
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Be careful.

207
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Chen Yulou slowed down

208
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,960
and looked around.

209
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,720
He saw an empty pond under the bridge in front of the Palace.

210
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,240
He felt it was suspicious,

211
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,760
and had a little ominous presentiment.

212
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
What does this mean?

213
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,080
The Wuliang Palace.

214
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
We've never seen the coffin of the tomb owner.

215
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,520
This must be it.

216
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,160
If we take off the clothes of the beauty one by one,

217
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,080
her body will soon be seen.

218
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
If…

219
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,120
…the coffin of the tomb owner is here,

220
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,640
then the Corpse King must be here too.

221
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,000
Be careful, everyone.

222
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,000
Be careful.

223
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,560
You too.

224
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,720
Leader.
There's nothing strange ahead.

225
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,560
And there's another tunnel on the side of this Palace.

226
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,680
But we don't know where the tunnel leads to.

227
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,520
Okay.

228
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,640
From the shape of this mountain,

229
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,536
that tunnel

230
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:33,280
leads to the back Palace we've been to before.

231
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,440
That's right, boss.

232
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,000
It's almost that position.

233
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
If you ask me,

234
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,320
we'd better go there and check it out.

235
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,560
Let's go.

236
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,080
This is a dog-head lock of Song Dynasty.

237
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
The lock's teeth are closed just like the canine teeth.

238
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
And it's quite difficult to open it

239
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,360
without the key.

240
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,360
I don't think so.

241
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,560
It's made from gold.
Are you really willing to break it?

242
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Pure gold?

243
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,800
Then, hell no.

244
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,840
Hair can unlock it?

245
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,280
Unlocking machines
is the unique stunt of Moon sect.

246
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,840
Only Red Girl can solve the problem.

247
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,000
You really did it.

248
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,160
Is it a human being or a ghost?

249
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,440
It's a paper man.

250
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,840
Paper man?

251
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Who put it here?

252
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
Kind of creepy.

253
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
We haven't found anything we want,

254
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,120
yet there are a lot of things we don't need.

255
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,400
Don't worry.

256
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
We have some brothers exploring outside.

257
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,400
This place is too big.

258
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,720
In order to save time,

259
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,880
brother Partridge Whistle,

260
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
I'll explore here.

261
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,120
Please take some people with you

262
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,920
to the side tunnel
to find out where it leads to.

263
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,040
Okay.

264
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,080
Elder brother .

265
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,640
It's already night.

266
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,200
Elder brother.

267
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,400
Didn't that bro

268
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,320
use his divine power over there last time?

269
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,960
Keep it well.

270
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,960
Wanna have a drink?

271
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Let's go.

272
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,200
Brother Cripple.

273
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Have you heard about

274
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,080
tombs for living people?

275
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,160
Tombs for living people?

276
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,000
My mom's got a tomb,

277
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
but she's not dead yet.

278
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,320
The doctor said her days are numbered.

279
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,360
She's got tympanites.

280
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,880
It's a disease

281
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,320
which costs a lot

282
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,040
and is quite painful.

283
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,760
Birth, death, illness and aging.

284
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,840
No one can escape those.

285
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,184
Even those Emperors

286
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,240
who search for immortality all around the world

287
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,800
cannot escape the fate of death.

288
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,840
You really know something.

289
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,200
You've been to school?

290
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah, when I was little.

291
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,480
My mom has always wanted me to study hard

292
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,200
and become somebody.

293
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,880
She has lived a hard life.

294
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,920
When she was little,
she was a servant girl in a wealthy family,

295
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,360
and was assaulted by the young master.

296
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,520
She was driven out at New Year's eve,
and then I was born.

297
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,000
When I was a little boy,

298
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,800
others would throw stones at me.

299
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
My mom covered me with her body.

300
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,560
She was so thin,

301
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,240
just like a firewood.

302
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,280
My mom sacrificed her entire life

303
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
and got nothing but such a disease at last.

304
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,960
I can't let her die like this.

305
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,520
So I choose to work for Commander Luo,

306
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,560
because I want to earn more money.

307
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
I wish I could find a good doctor for my mom.

308
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,840
Brother Cripple.

309
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,720
If my mom dies,

310
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
I'll definitely get her a luxurious funeral

311
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,360
and let her be a very rich woman

312
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,400
in the other world.

313
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,280
So those subordinate ghosts

314
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,440
will never dare to bully her.

315
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,360
It's really hard for you.

316
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,920
You are such a filial son.

317
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,760
How does Commander Luo treat you?

318
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,320
What's this?

319
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,840
Let's inform our Leader.

320
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,200
Let's go, go.

321
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,000
It looks like that

322
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,960
this Wuliang Palace was just a place
for immortals to practice Taoism.

323
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,040
What are these carved on the columns?

324
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:04,960
Are they valuable?

325
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,240
Since ancient times, there are many alchemists.

326
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,120
They would desert their wives
and children, home and business,

327
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
spending all their lives to make pills of immortality,

328
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,360
so that they can fly to the heaven

329
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,560
and become immortal some day.

330
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,960
And then they can live with the heaven and the earth.

331
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,160
Well, if you ask me,

332
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,280
I think these ancient people
just had too much leisure time.

333
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,800
Boss.

334
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,360
Leader Chen.

335
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,080
Red Girl.

336
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,920
Are you flirting with me?

337
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,528
I like it. I like it.

338
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:03,680
I like it. I like it.
