1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,180
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,540
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,460
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,180
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,060
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,260
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,340
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,700
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,820
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,740
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,300
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,980
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,420
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,580
but for elixir.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,660
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,700
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,220
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,420
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,700
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,860
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,980
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,540
=Episode 21=

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,900
It's tomb miasma.

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,900
Let's go.

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,512
Come on.

26
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:02,340
Hurry!

27
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,500
Come on.

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,260
We gotta seal the hole.

29
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,820
Blow it up!

30
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,460
Let's go.

31
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,180
What is tomb miasma exactly?

32
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,220
The Yuan General probably

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,500
nitrified his body

34
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,020
with the nostrum of Western Regions.

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,060
And?

36
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,140
In Yuan Dynasty, the body
would be soaked into Wuducao juice

37
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
before putting into the coffin.

38
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,700
Once anyone bypasses the machinery weapon

39
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,500
and opens the coffin,

40
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,980
the nostrum within the body will spread out

41
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,100
and become a toxic gas source,

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
spreading hallucinogenic smog.

43
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,020
This is the so called tomb miasma.

44
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,260
So, we were also poisoned by tomb miasma

45
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,824
and had illusions?

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
A small amount of tomb miasma
may cause hallucinations.

47
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,900
And if a living person
inhales a little more, he could die

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,620
and would become a part of tomb miasma.

49
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,140
One infects ten,

50
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,820
ten infect a hundred,

51
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,100
till there's no living creatures

52
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,100
within a hundred feet around.

53
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
This is the most poisonous miasma.

54
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,260
No wonder you said that

55
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,060
we should blow the tomb up.

56
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,500
You are afraid that this tomb miasma

57
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,660
might kill all the creatures nearby, right?

58
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,020
I have only heard about it.

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,460
This sorcery was passed
from Arab Empire to central China.

60
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,900
But only a few people throughout dynasties

61
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,580
knew the nostrum of tomb miasma.

62
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,700
I saw it for the first time today.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,860
The nostrum of tomb miasma

64
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,888
is really scary.

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,380
Brother Partridge Whistle.

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,728
I think it's not just the hallucination
made by tomb miasma.

67
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,180
Just now, when were you taking down his vertebra,

68
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,220
I found there were countless sticky filaments

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,800
inside his body.

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,820
When we were on our way to the Bottle Mountain,

71
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,940
I saw a wired snake.

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,580
It was knotting and twisting on the ground.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,380
So I cut it open,

74
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,340
and I found the same filaments inside its body.

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
A large amount

76
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,580
of thin, complicated and sticky filaments.

77
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,460
If you ask me,

78
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,904
it might be a kind of mycoparasite
from the Western world

79
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,776
which can control men and animals' behaviors.

80
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,120
The Corpse King of Xiangxi
must have been controlled by it too.

81
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,980
Also, the local villagers keep spreading the wrong story.

82
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,824
That was how
the Corpse King of Xiangxi originated.

83
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,020
So you mean,

84
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,300
the Corpse King is someone resurrected,

85
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,060
but is controlled
by some kind of mycoparasite.

86
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,020
I think so.

87
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,580
Let's go back.

88
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,480
- Let me help you.
- Come on.

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,340
Did the mycoparasite control you too?

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,648
I can't believe you hit me!

91
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,020
Shut up. Do you want to go or not?

92
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,860
Okay, okay.

93
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,060
By the way, my…

94
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,820
Just now, my vertebra…

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,728
Sorry, brother Partridge Whistle,

96
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,620
I need your help too.

97
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,460
My vertebra is so…

98
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,100
My waist…

99
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,740
Be careful!

100
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,900
Don't hurt her vertebra!

101
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
Lieutenant Yang.

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,460
What's in the hurry?

103
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,860
Let me give you a ride.

104
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,220
Brother Cripple.

105
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,420
Brother Cripple.

106
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,968
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

107
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,940
Brother Cripple.

108
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,420
Brothers, take them.

109
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,540
Take them.

110
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,300
Brother Cripple.

111
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,660
These are for your brothers.

112
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,180
Could you let me go?

113
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,048
Do you think

114
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,300
that's possible?

115
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,340
Brother Cripple.

116
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,740
I don't know how you think of me,

117
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,976
- but I always treat you like a brother.
- Brother?

118
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,460
Not everyone can be my brother.

119
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,820
Fine.

120
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:50,460
I give up.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,552
Brother Cripple.

122
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:56,820
Please.

123
00:08:58,224 --> 00:08:59,504
I've only got my mom in this world.

124
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Please take care of her for me.

125
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,580
And please tell her,

126
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,460
her son became a Regimental Commander,

127
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,700
he didn't disgrace the family.

128
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,300
I've already set you broken bone.

129
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,140
But you still can't move now,

130
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,180
or your wound may worsen.

131
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,620
I don't care.

132
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:51,232
I know.

133
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,580
Hurry.

134
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,120
Hurry up.

135
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,620
Keep going.

136
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,380
Leader.

137
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:40,976
Kneel down.

138
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,220
You traitor.

139
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,700
You betrayed your former leader
for fame and fortune.

140
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,660
You are unforgivable.

141
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,460
It was the God's plan

142
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,420
for us to catch you today.

143
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,300
In all conscience,

144
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,020
how did Commander Luo treat you?

145
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,140
You know it clearly.

146
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:57,460
You betrayed all of us.

147
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,180
So many Xieling Brothers
wounded or died because of you.

148
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,860
I'll feel guilty for all my dead brothers

149
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:02,976
if I don't kill you today.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,280
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

151
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

152
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Bring me my gun.

153
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,420
Commander Luo.

154
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,100
I'll avenge you today.

155
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,980
You can rest in peace now.

156
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
You're still up?

157
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,180
The three of us

158
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,540
set off for the Bottle Mountain
with missions together.

159
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,300
But now we are leaving,

160
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,580
I'm the only one alive.

161
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,020
As for the Dust Bead,

162
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,940
I still don't know where it is.

163
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,740
We have to finish our missions.

164
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,620
That's your words.

165
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,820
What's your plan?

166
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,940
Brother.

167
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,980
If you haven't decided yet,

168
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,700
how about going to Xiangyin with me
and take a break.

169
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,580
I happen to have something

170
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,540
to discuss with you.

171
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,500
Alright then.

172
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,700
Hurry up.

173
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,940
Hurry up, hurry.

174
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:35,860
Leader.

175
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,540
We've already packed up.
We are ready to go.

176
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,528
Red Girl, why are you so childish?

177
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,808
He is the leader of the Banshan sect.

178
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:42,620
I…

179
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,580
How about you carrying me?

180
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,500
No problem.

181
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:55,340
Come on.

182
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,220
Be careful.

183
00:14:59,456 --> 00:14:59,968
Is this okay?

184
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,888
I hurt my waist before.

185
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:14,920
I can't carry you.

186
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:17,060
I can't do anything with my wounded waist.

187
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:21,840
The trick of faking waist pain

188
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,280
was already used by me yesterday.

189
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,888
You'd better change one.

190
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,060
Leader.

191
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,480
I hurt my arm.

192
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,504
It's still in pain.

193
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,180
Brothers.

194
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,220
We suffered great losses

195
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,660
during the battle of the Bottle Mountain.

196
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,620
I'm so sorry.

197
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,060
Those who are alive will be rewarded.

198
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,180
As for my dead brothers,

199
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,840
I will take good care of their families.

200
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:10,300
Also,

201
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,984
I will give all the treasures I found to the refugees,

202
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,700
so that they can settle down.

203
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:18,080
Leader.

204
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,464
- Thank you, Leader.
- Thank you, Leader.

205
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:29,920
- Thank you, Leader.
- Thank you, Leader.

206
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,740
- Leader.
- Leader.

207
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:43,568
You want to see me?

208
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,660
You want to see me too, right?

209
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,500
I've heard about your journey
to the Bottle Mountain.

210
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,740
Instead of finding many funerary objects,

211
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,900
you lost many men.

212
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,020
Most of the mistakes

213
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,820
were caused by your impulsiveness

214
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,900
and being emotional.

215
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,140
What did you say before you left?

216
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
This trip, Xieling sect lost so many brothers,

217
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,100
but only with a little gain.

218
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,260
I was responsible for it
and should be punished by family law.

219
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,740
You will definitely be punished.

220
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,500
But,

221
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,780
I've seen those brothers outside,

222
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,340
I know it's not all your fault.

223
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,380
I heard this time,
when you were in the Bottle Mountain,

224
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,940
you asked them to kill you

225
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,300
to save your brothers.

226
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,020
If you want to blame me,
you can just throw it on my face.

227
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,860
They sincerely respect you this time,

228
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,900
not just by your power as a Leader.

229
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,980
I hadn't fully gained their respect

230
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,500
until I was almost 50 years old.

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
An old man is just like this tobacco pipe.

232
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,780
Not useful anymore.

233
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,860
Maybe someday,

234
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,420
it will just suddenly burn out.

235
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm tired, you can leave now.

236
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,900
From now on, whatever happens,

237
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,940
you can make your own decision,

238
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,340
you don't have to report it to me anymore.

239
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,700
Yes.

240
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,060
Father.

241
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,104
Cheers, my brother.

242
00:20:17,104 --> 00:20:18,320
- Brother Chen.
- To you.

243
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,220
Brother.

244
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,820
Even since we met,

245
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,460
it's the first time we've sat down
to have dinner.

246
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
We Banshan three brothers
run around everywhere,

247
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,060
exposing to cold and wet on our journey.

248
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,700
But as long as we felt as ease,

249
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
it was a good meal for us.

250
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,860
You indeed live a free and easy life.

251
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,540
But,

252
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,300
if you people wanna have a family,

253
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,980
will you still run around like before?

254
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
There are three forms of unfilial conduct,

255
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,140
of which the worst is to have no descendants.

256
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,380
Finding the Dust Bead

257
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,620
is not a one-day thing.

258
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,180
You have to have children.

259
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,020
Brother.

260
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,100
I have a sister, she's still single.

261
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,100
I'm thinking of letting her be your wife.

262
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,940
What do you say?

263
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,020
Thank you for your kindness, brother Chen.

264
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,580
Wait.

265
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
Brother Partridge Whistle,
could you at least let me finish first?

266
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,660
If she says yes,

267
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,180
then that's all I want.

268
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,660
Why did you agree with this so readily?

269
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,380
Why? Do you have
anything else to tell me?

270
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,980
It's just you promised so fast,

271
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,700
I don't know what to say.

272
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,540
Do you know how many sisters I've got?

273
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,860
You have more than one sister?

274
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,740
I can have more than one sister.

275
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,180
Alright, I'm joking.

276
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,340
Red Girl

277
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,860
has lived a miserable life.

278
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,300
I've always treated her as my real sister.

279
00:22:07,088 --> 00:22:08,512
This time, she made through it,

280
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,780
I really hope that she can marry a good man.

281
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,460
If she really marries you,

282
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,260
I will feel assured completely.

283
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,020
Red Girl, a toast to you.

284
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,540
Red Girl, you're so beautiful today.

285
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,500
So gorgeous.

286
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,460
Her beauty is not for us,

287
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,580
but for someone else.

288
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:57,248
What a pity.

289
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,180
She's gonna marry an outsider.

290
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,140
Do you guys wanna get beaten up?

291
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,100
Drink it.

292
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
I… Let's drink, cheers.

293
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,220
Pour some wine.

294
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,340
Pour some for me.

295
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,860
Pour some for Red Girl.

296
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,020
It's a toast to you..

297
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

298
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,140
Let me use water as wine

299
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,580
to propose a toast to you.

300
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:28,740
Great.

301
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,900
Brother.

302
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,460
Have a seat.

303
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,380
Brother.

304
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,540
We live in the troubled times.

305
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,300
It's the time for heroes
to make contributions.

306
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,140
There's saying that whoever
understands the time is a great man.

307
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,580
How about staying here with me?

308
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,700
We can work together

309
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,180
and do something big.

310
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,728
We can also be officials

311
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:18,860
and leave our glorious names in the history.

312
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,620
I'm not like you, brother Chen.

313
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,620
I'm not that ambitious.

314
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,500
I only want to find the Dust Bead

315
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,060
to save my people.

316
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,780
Then I will leave the Jianghu,

317
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,100
with no regrets at all.

318
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,700
Then I have no choice but to respect you.

319
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
I didn't get you to work with me
and even lost my Red Girl.

320
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,860
What did you say?

321
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,180
Well, I said,
there's still a long journey ahead of us.

322
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,700
A long journey.

323
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,340
Brother. My toast to you.

324
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,820
Okay.

325
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,700
Who's there?

326
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm telling you,

327
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,888
if anyone dares to tease me one more time,

328
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:27,100
I'll definitely beat you up.

329
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,780
Oh, it's you.

330
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,380
I thought it was my brothers.

331
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
What's up?

332
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,180
Nothing.

333
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Just come and check
whether your leg is getting better.

334
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,460
Much better.

335
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,420
It's fine now.

336
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,700
Good.

337
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,980
Have a good rest then.

338
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,260
Are you okay?

339
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm fine.

340
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,536
The doctor told me that

341
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,056
my wounded bone and muscles
need a hundred days to recover.

342
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:23,568
So I can't move my leg too much
in the following three months.

343
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:24,816
Oh, it hurts!

344
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:27,700
It's okay, I just need to sit down for a while.

345
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,100
You sit down too.

346
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,620
Okay.

347
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,060
If you have anything to say, just go ahead.

348
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:50,944
Today,

349
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,020
Leader Chen proposed a marriage to me.

350
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,220
I know it's a little sudden,

351
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,448
but if you don't want to marry me,

352
00:27:04,464 --> 00:27:05,580
- then I…
- I do.

353
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,460
I do.

354
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,380
Well…

355
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Do you?

356
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,540
I…

357
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,980
Then…

358
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,980
Will you keep looking for the Dust Bead?

359
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,820
Yes.

360
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,700
But I don't have any clue now.

361
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,140
And I don't know when I can find it.

362
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,700
Thousands of years have passed.

363
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,256
Does anyone know
what that Dust Bead looks like?

364
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,620
I only saw it in a picture.

365
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,768
It looks like a human eye.

366
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,620
A human eye?

367
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,780
Why?

368
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,420
When I was in the forest
of the Bottle Mountain,

369
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,180
I was looking for you at the bottom
of the Corpse King's tomb.

370
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,880
I saw a picture on the mural
which had a bead on it.

371
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:38,848
And that bead really
looked like a human eye.

372
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,980
What else?

373
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,392
And…

374
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,580
And some Black…

375
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,220
Partridge Whistle.

376
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,380
Partridge Whistle.

377
00:28:57,264 --> 00:28:58,688
Black Water City of the Western Xia.

378
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,100
And there was a temple nearby.

379
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,352
Did you see the place clearly?

380
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Is this the one you saw?

381
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,100
I think so.

382
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,460
Black Water City.

383
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,740
Thank you Red Girl.

384
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,620
Why are you here today?

385
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,220
Looking for the Bead.

386
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,100
Then how about…

387
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,500
You can hit me.

388
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,660
I won't escape.

389
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:06,940
I'll wait for you.

390
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,100
Black Water City.

391
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:32,976
I've heard that Black Water City of the Western Xia

392
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:34,672
was buried under the sand a long time ago.

393
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,360
Finding an ancient City under the desert

394
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,780
is extremely difficult.

395
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:42,736
Our Xieling and Banshan skills

396
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:45,344
are gonna be useless there.

397
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,980
Black Water City was buried by quicksand,

398
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,500
our Banshan's Sea-Filling Skill is useless indeed.

399
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,620
But it is said since ancient times that

400
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,220
the Mojin sect could find the dragon
by searching the mountain,

401
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,940
and find a tomb with a compass.

402
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,300
And their Star Fengshui Skill
from Dragon Hunting Knack

403
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,740
can observe constellation
and examine the geographical position.

404
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,620
If I can learn this skill

405
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,780
or get help from the Mojin sect first,

406
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,940
and then go to find the historical site

407
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,580
of Tongtian Buddha Temple
in Black Water City,

408
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,020
it's gonna be as easy as winking.

409
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,460
It is said that

410
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,600
there were only three Mojin symbols left

411
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,340
when the Mojin sect was passed to
Lord Zhang in the late Qing Dynasty.

412
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,900
And no one knows where they are later on.

413
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,020
Where can we find such talents?

414
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,060
The lives of my people

415
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,660
are all on this Dust Bead.

416
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,780
As long as there is a slight chance,

417
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,220
I'll give it a try.

418
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,420
Don't bother to see me out.

419
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,340
Brother.

420
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,700
The way to Black Water City is quite a long journey.

421
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,008
Take care of yourself.

422
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,460
If you get into trouble,

423
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,060
just come to me.

424
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,540
Brother Chen, you are a born leader

425
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,104
who can get the big picture.

426
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,100
Take care of yourself too.

427
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,380
Take care.

428
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,820
Goodbye.

429
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:04,032
Three months later,

430
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:05,744
plague took over the Xiangyin County.

431
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:08,048
Red Girl got infected and died.

432
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,140
She didn't get to see
Partridge Whistle before she died.

433
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,420
Later on, Chen Yulou got himself
into danger in Yunnan province.

434
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:15,840
He not only lost some of his brothers,

435
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,264
but also lost his eyes.

436
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:20,272
So he concealed his identity
and disappeared in the Jianghu.

437
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:22,384
People call him Blind Chen ever since.

438
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,864
Partridge Whistle found Liaochen,
the descendant of Mojin sect,

439
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,128
and acknowledged him as his master.

440
00:33:26,288 --> 00:33:28,672
He learned the skill of finding a tomb with a compass.

441
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Later, he got into trouble
in Black Water City of the Western Xia.

442
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,480
He lost one arm and survived at last.

443
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,008
And when he got to know
that Red Girl died of a plague,

444
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,744
he was so depressed and downhearted.

445
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,992
Then he traveled across the oceans
with an American priest,

446
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,400
and never came back.

447
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,872
As time went by,

448
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,176
the earth-shattering events

449
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:55,872
of Banshan and Xieling sects
were slowly forgotten by the world.

450
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,232
And then, the stories of the Mojin sect began.
