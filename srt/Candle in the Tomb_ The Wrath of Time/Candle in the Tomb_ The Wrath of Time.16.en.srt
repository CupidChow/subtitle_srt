1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,100
Rumor has it there were four mysterious sects in the Jianghu.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,460
According to motivation, skills and sects, they are divided into

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,380
Mojin, Faqiu, Banshan and Xieling.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,100
Faqiu and Mojin are jointly called Mojin Captain.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,980
They are good at seeking treasures and the Book of Changes,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,180
while the Banshan and Xieling sects are rarely recorded

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,260
who are more mysterious.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,620
It is said that the Xieling sect depends on strength.

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,740
Thousands of its disciples work together

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,660
and they can move a mountain to explore treasures.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
So it is called Xieling.

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
The Banshan sect depends on skills.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,340
They are not seeking for treasures

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
but for elixir.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,580
For thousands of years
Banshan has been seeking for the Dust Bead

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,620
to lift the curse of their clansmen.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,140
Originally, Xieling and Banshan each goes their own way.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,340
However, the fate brings them together

19
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,620
risking lives in the mysterious and dangerous Bottle Mountain

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,780
to perform an earth-shattering act.

21
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,900
=Candle in the Tomb: the Wrath of Time=

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,460
=Episode 16=

23
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,240
Careful.

24
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,200
Lift it up.

25
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
Careful.

26
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,760
Yang.

27
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,320
Yes?

28
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,040
Come here.

29
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,640
Partridge Whistle is awake now.

30
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
We have searched all around here,

31
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
and there's not even a trace of the treasures.

32
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,400
Commander Luo.

33
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Don't worry.

34
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,760
Good stuff is worth waiting.

35
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,800
Don't worry?

36
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,480
We will all starve to death later.

37
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Got it.

38
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,360
Go to work! Hurry!

39
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Are you a human or a ghost?

40
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,960
What happened?

41
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Step aside.

42
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
Back off.

43
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Back off.

44
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,760
Could it be the Corpse King in the Bottle Mountain?

45
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,680
He wears black clothes
and black riding boots,

46
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
which doesn't look like the people
from Yuan Dynasty.

47
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
When we used to watch operas,

48
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,320
black ghosts were all dressed like this.

49
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,720
If you ask me,

50
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,200
those opera lines

51
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,000
were all bullshit.

52
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,160
I don't believe

53
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
he is stronger than my gun.

54
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
Commander Luo. Commander Luo.

55
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,920
We don't know who he is.

56
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,800
We'd better wait for the Leader.

57
00:06:27,872 --> 00:06:28,840
Shut up.

58
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,920
There's nothing to be afraid of.

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
If anything goes wrong,

60
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,360
I'll take responsibility, let's go.

61
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
Death cannot be reversed.

62
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,960
I'm sorry for your loss.

63
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,520
I used to have a brother too.

64
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,000
He grew up very fast and ate like a horse.

65
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,760
So he was always starving.

66
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,840
When I met him,

67
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,360
he hadn't had anything for five days.

68
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,120
So I offered him a big meal,

69
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,480
after that, he just followed me
into the jaws of death

70
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,960
for 12 years.

71
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,160
When he died,

72
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,560
I, the so-called elder brother,

73
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,360
couldn't even collect his whole body.

74
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,280
What does it say?

75
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,880
Seems like Guanshan Grand Guardian.

76
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,200
Guanshan Grand Guardian.

77
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,120
It's quite heavy.

78
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,480
Yang.

79
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,640
Hold it.

80
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,080
Yes.

81
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,640
Brothers.

82
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Search this corpse and check
if there are any precious things.

83
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,280
- Got it.
- Got it.

84
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,080
Hurry.

85
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,320
Leader. Can I have a word?

86
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,640
Where are they?

87
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,600
We found a weird male corpse.

88
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Commander Luo wouldn't listen to us.

89
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
He just checked the body directly.

90
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,440
I'm not sure if it's okay,
so I'm here to tell you.

91
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Why do you think it's weird?

92
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,880
Though it's a corpse, it's not rotten.

93
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
And it looks really strange and unusual.

94
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
He's wearing a black robe and a black hat

95
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,640
with boots on his feet.

96
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,160
Looks exactly like the Soul-Absorbing Ghost
in those operas.

97
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
What does he look like,
any features?

98
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
He's tall and fat, sitting cross-legged.

99
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,720
Oh, yes.

100
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,800
It looks like that

101
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
he is making a strange gesture with his fingers.

102
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,280
Leader, do you think it's normal?

103
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,480
Let me take a look first.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,840
Old Foreigner had never believed that

105
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
we could find out the Dust Bead.

106
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,640
We had quarreled about this

107
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,600
for so many times.

108
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,600
Maybe he was right.

109
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,360
We have sacrificed too much for it.

110
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
Really doesn't worth it.

111
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
Elder brother.

112
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,600
Is it worth it

113
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
if we keep looking
for the Bead like this?

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
If there's no Dust Bead

115
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
in the world at all,

116
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,360
what should we do?

117
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
Commander Luo, look.

118
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,760
Look.

119
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,480
Where are the treasures?

120
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,440
Guanshan Grand Guardian.
What a poor bastard.

121
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,640
Yang.

122
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,040
Yes.

123
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,880
Burn it.

124
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,920
Got it.

125
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Come here.

126
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
You three, get it burned quickly.

127
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,120
What are you doing here?

128
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
Didn't you hear me?

129
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,880
Commander Luo.

130
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,400
It's me.

131
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm Yang.

132
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
It's me. Yang.

133
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,800
Commander Luo.

134
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I was almost choked to death, but you!

135
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You ran away quickly.

136
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
I was trying to find you.

137
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,560
What happened to them?

138
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,880
Why are they going mad all of a sudden?

139
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
They… they…

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,200
How could I know?

141
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
They are all bewitched.

142
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,280
What are you doing? Hold them!

143
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,520
Leader is here.

144
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,360
It's gonna be interesting.

145
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,440
Commander Luo.

146
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,920
We' d better wait here for a little longer.

147
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,960
Don't go out now.

148
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,160
No.

149
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,480
We have to go out and help them.

150
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
Just wait for a little longer.

151
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,920
Kill them, kill them all.

152
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,080
Chop that bastard!

153
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
How can they kill our own men?

154
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,200
So cruel.

155
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,280
Hualing.

156
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,520
Let's bury Old Foreigner

157
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,960
outside the Bottle Mountain.

158
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,080
Alright.

159
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,320
Old Foreigner would have wanted that too.

160
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,800
At least it's a quiet place.

161
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,800
Hurry. Hurry up!

162
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,640
Stop him. Hurry!

163
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Stop him now! Hurry up!

164
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,360
Leader.

165
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Leader.

166
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,640
Hualing.

167
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,200
And you guys, do something!
Stop standing there!

168
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,520
Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.

169
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Elder brother.

170
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,200
Be careful when you go down there.

171
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,000
Why don't you worry about me?

172
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,400
You both need to come back safely.

173
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,200
That's my good sister.

174
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,920
Shut up.

175
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,920
We'll eat hot pot today.

176
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,240
You liar. That's still porridge!

177
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,480
Don't talk to your elder brother like that.

178
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,200
This is hot pot.

179
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,280
Here's a big drumstick.

180
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Beef.

181
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,840
Shrimps.

182
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,920
Look.

183
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Here's even a big crab.

184
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,800
It's freezing outside.

185
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
We three

186
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,000
sit around the fire

187
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,240
and have our hot pot.

188
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
When we get warm,

189
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,400
we'll move on tomorrow.

190
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
Delicious.

191
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,216
- Red Girl is awake.
- Red Girl.

192
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,640
Brother Cripple, Red Girl is awake.

193
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,080
Are you alright?

194
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
Help me get up.

195
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,240
Red Girl.

196
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,560
You're finally awake.

197
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,120
Where's Boss?

198
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,120
And where are the Banshan guys?

199
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,880
You mean,

200
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
the waist tag said
Guanshan Grand Guardian?

201
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,320
Exactly.

202
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,040
Things about Guanshan Grand Guardians
have always been mysterious.

203
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,600
Originally, it's just a fictitious tale.

204
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,200
It's unexpected that

205
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,240
Guanshan Grand Guardians from Ming Dynasty are real.

206
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,920
It is said that they are skillful at Puppet Sorcery,

207
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,320
and they can use that to expel worms and ants.

208
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,560
They can control paper men to steal things.

209
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,480
They might have something to do

210
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,800
with the paper woman of Ming Dynasty

211
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,440
we found just now.

212
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,880
So the ptomaine

213
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,680
really is that powerful, huh?

214
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,040
Guanshan Grand Guardians
would infuse drugs into their bodies

215
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,040
to prevent the bites
from poisonous creatures in the mountains

216
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,360
Over time, the drugs would turn into poisonous purulence.

217
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,160
The one whoever touches it

218
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,600
will lose his mind.

219
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,560
How is he?

220
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,424
He's burying his younger brother
and sister outside.

221
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,480
I think we should leave him alone for a while.

222
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,360
Poor Hualing is dead too.

223
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,200
He's the only one left of the Banshan Sect.

224
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
I don't know when Boss would wake up.

225
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,520
We don't even know if he could wake up.

226
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,320
And also, he…

227
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Would he be crazy after waking up?

228
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,200
We don't know.

229
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,520
Guanshan Grand Guardian is a tale after all.

230
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,040
No one knows that for sure.

231
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,880
He's awake.

232
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,840
Leader.

233
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,920
Boss.

234
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,520
Why am I tied up?

235
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,720
What happened?

236
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,160
Untie me now.

237
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,160
Hurry up.

238
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,400
Hurry, hurry.

239
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,120
Hurry, hurry up.

240
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:56,768
Help Boss get up.

241
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:02,920
Leader.

242
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,640
Boss.

243
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,160
What the hell happened?

244
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Talk to me!

245
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,680
Leader Chen.

246
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,000
You…

247
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,120
You really didn't remember anything?

248
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,160
Step aside.

249
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,840
You don't get to say anything, get out.

250
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:34,480
I only remember that

251
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,800
we were at the Elixir Well.

252
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,760
But that's all.

253
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,240
The Elixir Well?

254
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,720
I stood by the Well and looked down,

255
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,440
it was so dark

256
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,800
and I could see nothing.

257
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,280
I didn't know what happened to my men,

258
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,480
they just started to kill each other.

259
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,264
But why can't I remember what happened after that?

260
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Leader.

261
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,560
You

262
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,240
got poisoned by the ptomaine
of Guanshan Grand Guardian.

263
00:28:18,352 --> 00:28:20,200
You totally lost control,

264
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,280
and tried to kill everyone you saw.

265
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,720
Guanshan Grand Guardian.

266
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,960
Leader.

267
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
Is there still anything wrong with your body?

268
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,512
So I was…

269
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
…poisoned?

270
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,360
Leader.

271
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Just tell me!

272
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
What exactly happened?

273
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,880
Luo, you tell me.

274
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,560
I…

275
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,480
Alright.

276
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,800
This is…

277
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,120
It's really hard to…

278
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,840
Alright, I gotta tell you myself.

279
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
It's all my fault.

280
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,400
I touched the Guanshan Grand Guardian's body.

281
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,640
But I didn't expect to bring out the ptomaine.

282
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,000
And you,

283
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,200
you lost your mind then.

284
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,400
You were chopping everyone
around you, everyone!

285
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,040
But it's not your fault.

286
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
'Cause if you didn't chop them,

287
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
they would chop you.

288
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,200
Commander Luo.

289
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Stop it.

290
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
The words are on the tip of my tongue.

291
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,240
How can I hold them?

292
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,680
We can't keep this from him.

293
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,080
If brother Partridge Whistle

294
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
wants to revenge for his younger sister.

295
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,080
Let him come to me.

296
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,160
Commander Luo.

297
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,680
What does he mean?

298
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,040
Brother Partridge Whistle.

299
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,920
I owe Hualing my life.

300
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,640
I'll die for her.

301
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,720
Boss.

302
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,400
What are you doing?

303
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,240
Look at you two.

304
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,440
One is half crazy, one is half dead.

305
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
How can you achieve something big?

306
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
Even if you kill yourself,

307
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,880
sister Hualing won't come back to life.

308
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,000
I feel horrible for sister Hualing's death too.

309
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
Then what? We all kill ourselves?

310
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,560
I've become sworn brothers with you two,

311
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,360
why?

312
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,600
Because you both are brave men.

313
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,520
When we die,

314
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:17,248
we brave men also gotta look like real men!

315
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,840
But what's this?

316
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
Aren't you afraid
that sister Hualing would laugh at you?

317
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,376
You got poisoned and lost your mind.

318
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:32,752
It's not your fault.

319
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,200
What are you doing?

320
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,400
Hey.

321
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,720
Where are you going?

322
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:52,384
The tomb of Yuan Dynasty is up there.
