205
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,114
JEFF: Hi, guys.

206
00:20:07,434 --> 00:20:09,354
JEFF: I was here last season.

207
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,634
JEFF: I'm JEFF SATUR.

208
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,434
JEFF: So I...

209
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:15,714
JEFF: I am a producer, singer,
actor in Thailand, and...

210
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,274
JEFF: I know that you have
a lot of pressure today.

211
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:21,594
JEFF: But just have fun
during this journey.

212
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:23,274

213
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:27,714

- BAMBAM: That's good.

215
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:32,274

Let's go.

216
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,234

225
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:58,034

00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:11,434
YAYA: I am a mentor of CHUANG ASIA S2.

230
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:13,274
YAYA: It's YAYA.

231
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,954
YAYA: Nice to meet everyone,
and please be kind to me.

232
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:22,154
LIZI: Bravo.

233
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:23,474
HU YETAO: She spoke very well.

234
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:26,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Today on the stage,
besides us,

235
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:29,594

there will be a special Guest Mentor.

236
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:30,914
GORDON: Who is it?

237
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,074
HU YETAO: Who is it?

238
00:21:33,954 --> 00:21:35,794
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Actually,
today is also

239
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the first time she participates
in such kind of show as well.

240
00:21:38,754 --> 00:21:41,634
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Please welcome
the handsome guy harvester ARIEL LIN.

241
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:42,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): ARIEL LIN.

242
00:21:43,154 --> 00:21:49,920
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Her classic works were very popular
among Asian countries.

243
00:21:51,754 --> 00:21:52,874
Welcome Guest Mentor,

244
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:55,554
ARIEL LIN.

245
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:58,474
TRAINEES: Wow.

246
00:21:58,514 --> 00:21:59,554
TRAINEES: ARIEL LIN.

247
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,994
- KK: YUAN XIANGQIN.
- JUNHAN: YUAN XIANGQIN.

248
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:07,674
ARIEL LIN: That's nice.

249
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,794
ARIEL LIN: Hello everyone,
I'm ARIEL LIN.

250
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,234
ARIEL LIN: At the same time, I am also
YUAN XIANGQIN from Class F in the past.

251
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:15,114
ARIEL LIN: Today,
I am very happy to be here.

252
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:17,194
ARIEL LIN: I'm hoping to
meet many JIANG ZHISHU

253
00:22:17,274 --> 00:22:18,954
ARIEL LIN: in Class A.

254
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:23,354
ARIEL LIN: I can't wait to see
all of your stunning performances.

255
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:25,354
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Thank you, ARIEL LIN
for the honor of joining us.

256
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:28,274
HU YETAO: What surprised me the most
is Mentor ARIEL,

257
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:31,994
HU YETAO: because it was really unexpected,
like crossing dimensions.

258
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,154
HU YETAO: It took me back
to my childhood.

259
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:35,554
HU YETAO: A character from the TV show
steps out in front of you.

260
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,594
TRAINEES: Oh, my God,
I've been watching her since childhood.

261
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,794
BAMBAM: So, the GRAND AUDITION
is about to begin.

262
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:44,394
BAMBAM: This year,
things are a little bit different.

263
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:48,514
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The right to judge
the first performance of CHUANG ASIA S2

264
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:50,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): will once again
be in the hands of the mentors.

265
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:55,594
HIKARI: I feel a little
scared and nervous.

266
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:56,954
HIKARI: It's unpredictable.

267
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:58,794
DAVID: It feels just like
taking an exam.

268
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:00,554
JELLY: There will be
a feeling of pressure.

269
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:04,714
NINJA: Personally, I think it'd be better
for the mentors to evaluate.

270
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:08,074
NINJA: If the mentors evaluate,
they will see things that we don't,

271
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,754
NINJA: because of their experience and

272
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:12,914
NINJA: various factors that allow them
to see what we can't.

273
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:16,154
WEIZHI: Yes, their perspective
is likely more professional.

274
00:23:16,314 --> 00:23:18,434
BAMBAM: And one more thing is...

275
00:23:18,514 --> 00:23:21,794
BAMBAM: I notice something different
about the mentors' seating today.

276
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:24,986
BAMBAM: JEFF, you notice
the difference from last year?

277
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:29,866
JEFF: Yes, actually, last year,
we had to sit separately.

278
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,026
JEFF: This season, we all sit...

279
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,346
JEFF: I think, in pairs, right?

280
00:23:35,186 --> 00:23:36,426
WUXUN: The mentors are in pairs.

281
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,706
LIZI: Two people make one group.

282
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:40,546
PLENGTHAI: Singing,
dancing, acting, right?

283
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,226
TIA RAY: I am a singer.

284
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:45,706
TIA RAY: Therefore, I put importance
on those who sing well.

285
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:49,146
ARIEL LIN: YAYA and I are actors,

286
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:51,746
ARIEL LIN: so we are interested in
how to attract the audience.

287
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:55,386
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
BAMBAM and I are boy band idols,

288
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:57,466
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
and we gradually grew to become artists.

289
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:01,626
BAMBAM: I have enough experience
to give another people advice.

290
00:24:01,746 --> 00:24:03,866
BAMBAM: If two pairs
give the same grade,

291
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:05,866
BAMBAM: that will be your final grade.

292
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:09,386
BAMBAM: But if all three pairs
have different opinions,

293
00:24:09,586 --> 00:24:15,066
BAMBAM: me and XU MINGHAO (THE 8)'s team
is gonna be the final opinion to decide.

294
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,530
LIZI: It's different
from the previous CHUANG.

295
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,130
HU YETAO: To be honest,
I'm getting nervous.

296
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,930
YUCHEN: I'm completely
drenched in sweat.

297
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,050
HU YETAO: Each aspect
has its professionals.

298
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,930
HU YETAO: Each mentor will be
responsible for their area of expertise.

299
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,770
HU YETAO: It will be more professional.

300
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,490
HU YETAO: The mentors' decisions
will also be more fair.

301
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,969
OMAR: All aspects

302
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:35,810
OMAR: will be considered.

303
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,930
OMAR: This way, the mentors

304
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,730
OMAR: can give us better guidance.

305
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,970
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Each trainee will be
divided into levels based on GRAND AUDITION.

306
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,290
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
There'll be A, B, C, F.

307
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,970
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Class A is
not limited in number of people.

308
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,170
PEAT: Oh, my God.

309
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,370
TRAINEES: Oh.

310
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,490
TRAINEES: Class A has no limit.

311
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,930
- YUCHEN: Previously there was a limit.
- GOU YI: Yes, it can even be 20 now.

312
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,370
BAMBAM: Now let's reveal
the debut lineup for CHUANG ASIA S2.

313
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,050
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Nine people debuted in the first season.

314
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,210
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Will the number
of debut members be the same?

315
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,130
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Let's see.

316
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,330
TRAINEES: I wanna be there.

317
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,569
TRAINEES: I wanna be there.

318
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,250
TRAINEES: One, two, three, four, five.

319
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,890
TRAINEES: Twelve? I guess not.

320
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,930
TRAINEES: Ten positions.

321
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,490
TRAINEES: A lot.

322
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:29,650
TRAINEES: What?

323
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,930
TRAINEES: Seven places?

324
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,450
- TRAINEES: Seven people.
- TRAINEES: Seven people.

325
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,130
- TRAINEES: Seven people.
- TRAINEES: Seven people.

326
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,530
TRAINEES: Many lights were set up,
but only seven are lightened up.

327
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,730
BAMBAM: Okay, like what you guys see,

328
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,890
BAMBAM: the debut group
for CHUANG ASIA S2

329
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,930
BAMBAM: will be only seven people.

330
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,050
TRAINEES: Seven people, the smallest number
since there has ever been, right?

331
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,330
SENA: It was announced
that there would be seven.

332
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,330
SENA: Honestly, I thought
there would be more people.

333
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,690
OMAR: It's very difficult.

334
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,010

336
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,330
- YUCHEN: Okay.
- WUXUN: Okay.

337
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,050
YUCHEN: Reducing the debut spots,
I feel that

338
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,050
YUCHEN: the trainees
who are selected and debut

339
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,770
YUCHEN: must have been screened
better than before.

340
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,010
XIONG: The difficulty must be greater
than the previous season for sure.

341
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,010
XIONG: I will try
to be in that position.

342
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,170
RICKY: There are exactly
seven of us standing in our line.

343
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,850

345
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,210

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,090
LIZI: The white seat?

347
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,570

how it's gonna be like here.

395
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,210

396
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,002

402
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:42,362

403
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,082
YUCHEN: DUY is amazing.

404
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:45,922
WHYLUCAS:
I like HONG JIN's falsetto voice,

405
00:30:45,962 --> 00:30:48,281
WHYLUCAS: GORDON's chorus
and also DUY's chorus.

406
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,522
WHYLUCAS: For me, DUY sings very well.

407
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,161
WHYLUCAS: It impresses me a lot.

408
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,122
HIKARU: Speaking of singing,

409
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:54,962
HIKARU: seriously, I think

410
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:57,182
HIKARU: if it's just about singing,

411
00:30:57,183 --> 00:30:59,401
HIKARU: I think I definitely
can't beat this group.

412
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,241
DAVID: All the singing is A-grade.

413
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,922
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The first stage

414
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,561
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
exceeded my expectations.

415
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:05,442
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Yes.

416
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:10,722
TIA RAY: I think each one of you
has a very unique voice, a sound.

417
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,401
TIA RAY: That was a really good opening.

418
00:31:15,402 --> 00:31:16,322
GORDON: Thank you very much.

419
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:17,841
GORDON: Welcome to our show.

420
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,841
TIA RAY: You did catch our attention.

421
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:22,562
TIA RAY: And especially

422
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:23,881
TIA RAY: HONG JIN.

423
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,522
- TIA RAY: HONG JIN, right?
- HONG JIN: Yes.

424
00:31:25,562 --> 00:31:27,162
TIA RAY: When you hit the high notes,

425
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,002
TIA RAY: that was so surprising.

426
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:37,322
TIA RAY: Maybe it wasn't perfect,

427
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,961
TIA RAY: but the motion and the energy

428
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:42,402
TIA RAY: was so surprising and so good.

429
00:31:44,482 --> 00:31:48,002
ARIEL LIN: You have a very good texture
of your voice.

430
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,802
ARIEL LIN: Okay,
stop looking at me like that.

431
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:56,642
ARIEL LIN: Keep going.

432
00:31:57,562 --> 00:31:59,882
TIA RAY: Me too, I think he's very cute.

433
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,522
ARIEL LIN: So cute.

434
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,681
TIA RAY: GORDON,
I think your voice and your pitch,

435
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,961
TIA RAY: everything is really good.

436
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:18,522
TIA RAY: Can we have a solo performance?

437
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,801
YAYA: Yeah, I would like to see
GORDON perform as well.

438
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,922
TIA RAY: I kind of want to hear you sing too

439
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:24,362
TIA RAY: because I know
you come from Berkeley.

440
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:26,362
TIA RAY: Fighting.

441
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,802
PEAT: Fighting.

442
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,922
GORDON: Thank you very much.

443
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,641
TIA RAY: Oh, my God.

444
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:17,762
- KK: He handled it very well.
- DAVID: Yes, it's excellent.

445
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:20,281
XIAONIAN:
His voice trembled, a bit nervous.

446
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:22,761
JEFF: You sang it very beautifully.

447
00:33:22,762 --> 00:33:24,201
GORDON: Thank you very much.

448
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,522
JEFF: Just one thing to encourage you.

449
00:33:27,802 --> 00:33:30,802
JEFF: I noticed that you keep looking at

450
00:33:31,282 --> 00:33:32,602
JEFF: the floor.

451
00:33:33,362 --> 00:33:34,562
JEFF: Lost the connection.

452
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:38,322
GORDON: I feel like I wanted
to keep the song to myself.

453
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:40,442
GORDON: I want to give

454
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:42,642
GORDON: the expression

455
00:33:43,202 --> 00:33:46,402
GORDON: and keep the sad part to myself.

456
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:48,562
JEFF: Okay.

457
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:51,802
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): All members,
please come to the stage.

458
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:55,402
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Mentors,
let's discuss and give the scores.

459
00:33:55,682 --> 00:33:57,162
JUNHAN: They're giving the score.

460
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:59,962
DAVID: He looks so nervous.

461
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,562
TIA RAY: Singing wise,
I think he's better than him.

462
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,378
TIA RAY:
But I think these two are similar

463
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,530
- TIA RAY: to me.
- JEFF: Oh, okay.

464
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,586
TIA RAY: Right?

465
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,582
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If not dancing,

466
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,802
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
then it can't be evaluated.

467
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,682
- BAMBAM: That's true.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): How can you debut?

468
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,482
TIAN QI: Their standards are different.

469
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,722
TRAINEE: One is for vocals, one
is for dance. One is expressiveness.

470
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,450
YAYA: I think my favorite
was definitely this guy.

471
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,466
- YAYA: The one in the pink shirt.
- ARIEL LIN: Yes, me too.

472
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,202
YAYA: He is very charming.

473
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:37,281
YAYA: I feel that I might not be able
to evaluate their dancing or singing.

474
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:41,002
YAYA: But I can feel how much
their performance can communicate

475
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:42,322
YAYA: their emotion

476
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:44,498
YAYA: through the camera

477
00:34:44,498 --> 00:34:45,746
YAYA: to reach the audience.

478
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,922
BAMBAM: Let's start with...

479
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,082
BAMBAM: HONG JIN.

480
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,082
BAMBAM: Are you ready?

481
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,082
JUNHAN: Why am I more nervous
than they are?

482
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,682
XIONG: He should get an A, I think.

483
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:08,002
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

484
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:13,681
BAMBAM: Grade B C C.

485
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:14,682
BAMBAM: Alright.

486
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,002
DAVID: How will they finalize the score?

487
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:21,841
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Two mentors gave you C.

488
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,362
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So, you are C.

489
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:26,146
YAYA: You're cute.

490
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:27,802
HONG JIN: Cute.

491
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,530
BAMBAM: a Cutie.

492
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:33,626
BAMBAM: And the next one is KOHI.

493
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,066
- BAMBAM: Go on.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): KOHI.

494
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,426
BAMBAM: KOHI.

495
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,306
BAMBAM: So, you're C.

496
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:46,706
BAMBAM: And next is DUY.

497
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:52,786
- OMA: I think it's an A.
- PEAT: The difference is...

498
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:53,946
PLENGTHAI: A?

499
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,826
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

500
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:57,386
BAMBAM: It's A.

501
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,866
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

502
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:04,626
YUCHEN: DUY seems very nervous.

503
00:36:04,986 --> 00:36:06,626
BAMBAM: B.

504
00:36:08,146 --> 00:36:10,745
- HU YETAO: To go to Class A, you must get two As.
- YUCHEN: Yes, it takes two As.

505
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:11,466
TRAINEES: A.

506
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:13,706
TRAINEES: A.

507
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:14,866
TRAINEES: A.

508
00:36:15,426 --> 00:36:16,226
BAMBAM: B.

509
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:18,746
BAMBAM: You got the B grade.

510
00:36:19,482 --> 00:36:23,386
BAMBAM: I think the way you sing
on stage is very stable.

511
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,545
BAMBAM: I look forward in the future
to what you're gonna bring us.

512
00:36:25,546 --> 00:36:28,426
- BAMBAM: Thank you.
- DUY: Thank you so much.

513
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:30,026
BAMBAM: GORDON.

514
00:36:30,682 --> 00:36:32,626
HU YETAO: Will GORDON get an A?

515
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,042
YUCHEN: I think it's possible.

516
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,738
TADALEE: An A, right?

517
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:37,146
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

518
00:36:37,146 --> 00:36:38,626
BAMBAM: Here we go.

519
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:40,706
TRAINEES: A.

520
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:41,586
SICHEN: A.

521
00:36:44,826 --> 00:36:46,066
LIZI: C?

522
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:47,425
DAVID: I think GORDON gets an A.

523
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:51,106
HU YETAO: I would say probably an A.

524
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,706
BAMBAM: A C B.

525
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:03,545
DAVID: If this is the case,

526
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:04,786
DAVID: then it's A B C.

527
00:37:05,146 --> 00:37:07,826
YAYA: One of the reasons why
we decided to give you an A is that

528
00:37:07,866 --> 00:37:11,865
YAYA: we kind of had the impression
that you're the team leader.

529
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:14,786
YAYA: We wanted to give you an A
for effort.

530
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:16,650
ARIEL LIN: We focused on the humanity.

531
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,386
- ARIEL LIN: It's like an encouragement.
- YAYA: Yes.

532
00:37:19,426 --> 00:37:21,745
ARIEL LIN: But you still
have a very good voice.

533
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,186
- YAYA: Yes.
- GORDON: Thank you very much.

534
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:26,442
JEFF: For me, it's...

535
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:27,338
JEFF: quite good.

536
00:37:27,338 --> 00:37:29,290
JEFF: But you just sing,
you don't perform.

537
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,545
JEFF: It'd be better if you perform
from the first note.

538
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:33,986
GORDON: Thank you very much.

539
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:38,426
BAMBAM: I feel like you're not so real.

540
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:41,802
BAMBAM: You said you wanted
to keep this song for yourself.

541
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:43,626
BAMBAM: It's like
you've already planned it.

542
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,746
BAMBAM: Like you knew if you really
think that song is for you,

543
00:37:46,906 --> 00:37:48,026
BAMBAM: you don't need
to say it out loud.

544
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,066
BAMBAM: Just when you sing it,
you will feel it.

545
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:57,386
TIA RAY: Actually, I think the most
important thing for you is to let go.

546
00:37:57,386 --> 00:37:58,346
TIA RAY: Relax a little.

547
00:37:58,346 --> 00:38:00,945
TIA RAY: Don't try to

548
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:01,834
TIA RAY: please everyone.

549
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:02,922
TIA RAY: Do you understand what I mean?

550
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:04,826
TIA RAY: You have to be natural.

551
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,066
GORDON: The advice given to me
by the mentors

552
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,146
GORDON: makes me start to think that

553
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:12,665
GORDON: I've placed too much importance
on singing skills,

554
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,545
GORDON: which neglects
some emotional expression.

555
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,025
GORDON: I feel that this is a point
I need to keep in mind for the future.

556
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:18,122
GORDON: And it's a point
that can be developed.

557
00:38:18,122 --> 00:38:21,265
BAMBAM: Just let it go naturally
on the stage.

558
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,786
BAMBAM: That's why I think C
is perfect for you right now.

559
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,546
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Having heard
the opinions of the mentors,

560
00:38:29,626 --> 00:38:31,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): next, we will be making

561
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:33,098
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the final decision.

562
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,818
BAMBAM: Okay.

563
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:37,386
HU YETAO: They have the final say.

564
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:38,106
WUXUN: Yes.

565
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:42,346
BAMBAM: We listened to other mentors' opinions too.

566
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,146
BAMBAM: So, we've decided to give you

567
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,530
BAMBAM: B. Alright.

568
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,426
BAMBAM: Thank you so much.

569
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:53,386
- DAVID: It seems the criteria are strict.
- KK: Very strict.

570
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,858
TRAINEES: It is not good for the trainees
who are only good at one thing.

571
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:59,578
TIAN QI: If these are
the ranking standards,

572
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:01,258
TIAN QI: in fact,

573
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,978
TIAN QI: you will not always
gain the favor of both groups.

574
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,538
TIAN QI:
I don't think they are being fair.

575
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:09,546
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Because by a boy band's standard,

576
00:39:09,626 --> 00:39:11,706
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your performance
didn't really impress me.

577
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:15,066
BAMBAM: In CHUANG Asia, they will become
an international boy group, right?

578
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,306
- TIA RAY: Right.
- BAMBAM: So...

579
00:39:17,066 --> 00:39:19,626
BAMBAM: I'm just gonna keep that standard
and we'll see...

580
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:21,706
BAMBAM: But right now, they're more like
a band and ballad.

581
00:39:21,746 --> 00:39:24,586
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): From our perspective,
to be debuting as a boy group,

582
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:27,346
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you must have the
beauty of performance. You must dance.

583
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:29,306
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But now,
their performance lacks any dancing.

584
00:39:29,346 --> 00:39:30,666
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Even though

585
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,426
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
they have high singing ability.

586
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,746
TIA RAY: I understand, okay.

587
00:39:33,906 --> 00:39:38,266
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Because in the first
performance we didn't see your dancing.

588
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,906
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): At least for me,

589
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,786
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
the ranking criteria may be

590
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:43,266
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): a bit reserved.

591
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:44,666
OMAR: To get an A, at the very least,
you need

592
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:46,706
OMAR: performance
and improvement in dancing ability.

593
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,306
HU YETAO: You sing well
then go to a show that focuses on singing.

594
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,866
HU YETAO: If you dance well, then go

595
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:53,066
HU YETAO: to a street dance competition.

596
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:54,586
HU YETAO: This one is about
looking at the overall picture.

597
00:39:54,866 --> 00:39:58,386
THI-O: They want someone
who excels at both dancing and singing.

598
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:02,106
THI-O: In my opinion, giving grades
involved very high expectations.

599
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:03,666
YUCHEN: Getting an A is very difficult.

600
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:05,666
WUXUN: Getting two As.

601
00:40:06,426 --> 00:40:07,426
YUCHEN: You must get two As.

602
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:10,474
BAMBAM: Alright, so, the second group.

603
00:40:10,514 --> 00:40:11,634
BAMBAM: I like the name.

604
00:40:11,754 --> 00:40:12,994
BAMBAM: FIRST BLOOD.

605
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,314
ARIEL LIN: FIRST BLOOD.

606
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,514
BAMBAM: Where are you guys?

607
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:22,034
WUXUN: XIONG.

608
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:24,354
TRAINEES: They're getting into the vibe.

609
00:40:30,714 --> 00:40:31,914
XIONG: Hello, we are

610
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:33,314
TRAINEES: FIRST BLOOD.

611
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,514
XIONG: The song for our performance
this time is BITE ME.

612
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,594
XIONG: So, what we aim to achieve
from the GRAND AUDITION is

613
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:39,994
TRAINEES: the first drop of blood.

614
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,714
YUCHEN: Fighting!

615
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,994
XIONG: Hello, I'm a trainee
who has been training for 25 months

616
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:47,953
XIONG: and this is the first time
I'm wearing an in-ear microphone on stage.

617
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:48,634
XIONG: It's XIONG.

618
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,114
HU YETAO: So handsome.

619
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:51,914
HIKARI: XIONG!

620
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,114
KOHI: Very handsome.

621
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:57,554
SHEN: Hello, I am a trainee who joined
ORIGINAL PLAN company since I was 12

622
00:40:57,634 --> 00:40:59,474
SHEN: and this is my first time
participating in a competition. I am SHEN.

623
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:02,234
KK: As for me, I have performed
in live houses over 400 times.

624
00:41:02,314 --> 00:41:04,113
KK: Independent trainee, KK.

625
00:41:04,114 --> 00:41:05,234
YAO ZIHAO: KK.

626
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:09,394
DAVID: Hello, I am a trainee
who wrote songs for this show.

627
00:41:09,474 --> 00:41:11,674
DAVID: A student from
SHANGHAI THEATRE ACADEMY, I'm DAVID.

628
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:12,994
YAO ZIHAO: DAVID!

629
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:17,034
DAVID: I feel like the four of us have

630
00:41:18,274 --> 00:41:19,154
DAVID: that kind of

631
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,114
DAVID: indifferent,

632
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:20,874
DAVID: godly,

633
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:21,754
DAVID: solemn,

634
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:22,474
DAVID: and world-weary

635
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:23,754
DAVID: vibe.

636
00:41:24,074 --> 00:41:25,914
DAVID: This guy XIONG is very

637
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:28,354
DAVID: cool already.

638
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:30,994
DAVID: Just by looking at him,
you can tell he's a trainee

639
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:33,314
DAVID: who has trained for a long time,
with very good facial expressions.

640
00:41:35,634 --> 00:41:38,034
XIONG: I've been to SM,

641
00:41:38,074 --> 00:41:39,514
XIONG: YG,

642
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:41,394
XIONG: and also STARSHIP.

643
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:43,674
XIONG: I want to debut here.

644
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,914
KK: I think XIONG is very handsome.

645
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:48,954
KK: He's like a man who would walk
out of Harper's BAZAAR.

646
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:49,754
KK: And then...

647
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:52,434
KK: SHEN...

648
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,234
KK: He's a little boy.

649
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:00,754
SHEN: Umm...

650
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:04,754
SHEN: I have a bit of a fanbase.

651
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:10,114
SHEN: And another thing.

652
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:11,914
SHEN: I'm also quite tall.

653
00:42:12,114 --> 00:42:13,114
SHEN: About 183 cm.

654
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,114
DAVID: The four of us have similar heights.

655
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,754
DAVID: Our looks
are also quite balanced.

656
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:21,234
DAVID: I feel that our first stage
will definitely not be bad.

657
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:22,754
TRAINEES: Fighting, everyone.

658
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:23,554
DAVID: Fighting.

659
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,354
TRAINEES: Let's go.

660
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:29,154
TIA RAY: Oh, they're dancing too.

661
00:42:30,954 --> 00:42:33,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): They look
like trainees already.

662
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:35,714
BAMBAM: Really? Yeah, it's true.

663
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,074
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
And the last guy looks very cool.

664
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,554
BAMBAM: True, handsome, right?

665
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:41,114
TRAINEES: Fighting.

666
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:42,154
STAFF: Get ready.

667
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:20,914
TRAINEES: BITE ME, BITE ME, BITE ME.

668
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,354
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

669
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:25,274
TRAINEES: Sexy boy.

670
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:26,314
TRAINEES: I am stunned.

671
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:27,514
TRAINEES: Main dancer.

672
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:29,554
TRAINEES: After the main vocal
comes the main dancer right away.

673
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:31,514
KOHI: Love you, XIONG.

674
00:44:36,434 --> 00:44:37,874
WUXUN: Excellent job.

675
00:44:38,034 --> 00:44:39,274
BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

676
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:40,394
BAMBAM: Bite me please.

677
00:44:41,874 --> 00:44:44,314
ARIEL LIN:
They all look like noble vampires.

678
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:44,994
BAMBAM: Yeah.

679
00:44:45,074 --> 00:44:46,514
TRAINEES: Team Vampire Count.

680
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:50,554
YAYA: Honestly, I feel like
I didn't blink for one minute.

681
00:44:50,914 --> 00:44:53,994
YAYA: I couldn't stop looking
between all of you.

682
00:44:54,154 --> 00:44:55,954
YAYA: That was amazing.

683
00:44:56,034 --> 00:44:56,874
YAYA: I had to...

684
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:58,674
ARIEL LIN: Me too.

685
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:00,714
TRAINEES: Thank you, mentors.

686
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:04,874
ARIEL LIN: And just now, I could hear
the sound of your leather shoes throughout.

687
00:45:04,954 --> 00:45:07,153
ARIEL LIN: The rhythm
was very synchronized, excellent.

688
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:09,074
ARIEL LIN: Very powerful.

689
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:11,074
TIA RAY: There is unity.

690
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:13,954
TIA RAY: Especially XI...

691
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:17,114
TIA RAY: XI... um.

692
00:45:19,674 --> 00:45:20,874
TIA RAY: XIN XIONG.

693
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:22,713
- DONGDONG: XIONG.
- TIA RAY: Yes, yes, XIONG.

694
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:23,434
- TIA RAY: Right?
- JELLY: Oh, XIONG.

695
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:24,314
DONGDONG: Xiong.

696
00:45:25,834 --> 00:45:27,274
TIA RAY: Yes, I think

697
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:28,513
TIA RAY: your eyes

698
00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:30,154
TIA RAY: are... very beautiful.

699
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:34,754
- TRAINEES: It's very enticing.
- TIA RAY: Very beautiful.

700
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:38,474
TIA RAY: And it also...

701
00:45:38,914 --> 00:45:41,594
TIA RAY: makes me unable
to look away at all.

702
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:46,594
TIA RAY: You have
so much charm on stage.

703
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:47,834
XIONG: Thank you.

704
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:49,914
- WUXUN: Really.
- YUCHEN: Really.

705
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,434
WUXUN: No wonder he's the one I chose.

706
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:55,194
WUXUN: A god among gods.

707
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:56,354
OMAR: Very handsome.

708
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:57,554
XIN: To what extent?

709
00:45:57,674 --> 00:45:58,913
OMAR: Better than me.

710
00:45:58,914 --> 00:46:00,554
KEVIN: XIONG has
a lot of idol qualities.

711
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:03,834
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay.
First, thank you for your performance.

712
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:07,114
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
From the performance,

713
00:46:07,154 --> 00:46:08,754
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): it makes me feel

714
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:12,274
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
the expectations and ambitions

715
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:15,234
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): that you all have
towards the boy group and debuting.

716
00:46:15,354 --> 00:46:17,394
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think this is also

717
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,002
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
setting a standard for

718
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:20,954
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
the following trainee teams.

719
00:46:21,754 --> 00:46:22,954
TRAINEES: The standard has been raised.

720
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:25,314
TRAINEES: The standard of a main dancer.

721
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:28,154
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you
want to debut, at least you should

722
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:32,514
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
perform this way on stage.

723
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:34,713
TRAINEES: It's straight up
boy group standard.

724
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:36,674
TRAINEES: I think these four
can debut right away.

725
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:39,153
HIKARI: XIONG, KK, DAVID, and SHEN.

726
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:40,914
HIKARI: This is clearly a boy group.

727
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:42,914
HIKARI: How should I put it?
The group's balance is good.

728
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:45,394
HIKARI: And each person
has a standout character too.

729
00:46:46,234 --> 00:46:47,434
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
There's another point I want to make

730
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,594
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
about facial expressions.

731
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,234
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Don't overkill it.

732
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:55,594
WUXUN: Huh?

733
00:46:55,634 --> 00:46:56,634
TRAINEES: What does that mean?

734
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,353
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
I can sense that you all are very eager

735
00:46:58,354 --> 00:46:59,874
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
and want to express yourselves,

736
00:46:59,914 --> 00:47:02,834
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): but this is something
that needs to be gradually practiced.

737
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:04,834
TRAINEES: I think it's perfect.

738
00:47:05,514 --> 00:47:06,834
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Is there anyone
you would like to see?

739
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:09,194
- ARIEL LIN: I want KK to sing.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): KK.

740
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:11,113
ARIEL LIN: He performs vocal music.

741
00:47:11,114 --> 00:47:12,674
TIA RAY: I want to hear DAVID sing.

742
00:47:13,354 --> 00:47:16,114
TIA RAY: He wrote an original song
for the show, right?

743
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:19,634
JEFF: XIONG, you really caught
my attention.

744
00:47:19,914 --> 00:47:21,514
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
So let's start with you first, XIONG.

745
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:23,634
XIONG: May I please remove my mic?

746
00:47:24,514 --> 00:47:26,513
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Then, while removing the mic,

747
00:47:26,514 --> 00:47:27,354
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): KK, please.

748
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,474
KK: Mentor, I would like
to have a handheld mic, please.

749
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,434
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Oh, then please get ready first.

750
00:47:32,554 --> 00:47:34,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then DAVID,
could you perform right away please?

751
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:35,714
DAVID: I also need a handheld mic.

752
00:47:36,514 --> 00:47:37,834
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Then please prepare yourself first.

753
00:47:40,754 --> 00:47:41,794
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then...

754
00:47:41,834 --> 00:47:43,874
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): XIONG, KK, DAVID,

755
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,754
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): prepare yourselves.

756
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:48,833
TIA RAY: Um, SHEN?

757
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:53,874
TIA RAY: SHEN, what do you think?

758
00:47:57,114 --> 00:47:58,153
SHEN: Definitely feeling sad.

759
00:47:58,154 --> 00:47:59,434
SHEN: But anyway,
the camera has already captured me.

760
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:00,114
SHEN: I don't want to

761
00:48:00,474 --> 00:48:02,114
SHEN: keep saying that I'm okay.

762
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,113
SHEN: But actually, I'm a little sad.

763
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:08,714
TIA RAY: Is there anything you want to say?
Or have you prepared for a performance?

764
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:11,753
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Do you need to
prepare if it's a solo performance?

765
00:48:14,074 --> 00:48:15,153
SHEN: I can perform right now.

766
00:48:16,114 --> 00:48:17,434
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then come on.

767
00:48:18,754 --> 00:48:20,314
GORDON: Very smart, handsome.

768
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:21,474
GORDON: Very smart indeed.

769
00:48:21,874 --> 00:48:23,113
GOU YI: Let's go.

770
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:24,314
ARIEL LIN: Seize the opportunity.

771
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:26,554
SHEN: I'd like to say something.

772
00:48:27,634 --> 00:48:29,914
SHEN: I am a trainee at ORIGINAL PLAN

773
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,554
SHEN: and the company
just sent me alone.

774
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:36,394
SHEN: I hope our songs can go beyond China

775
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,394
SHEN: to reach a global level.

776
00:48:38,554 --> 00:48:41,153
SHEN: I mean,
I want to sing our company's songs.

777
00:48:41,154 --> 00:48:42,714
SHEN: I hope our company becomes more famous.

778
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:45,314
SHEN: More people get to know our trainees,

779
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:48,354
SHEN: which means we could meet
on a bigger stage than before.

780
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:55,114
(Cycling)

781
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,914
SHEN: Very bad.

782
00:49:15,074 --> 00:49:16,354
SHEN: At the beginning,
I even went off-key.

783
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,754
SHEN: It was very...

784
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,394
SHEN: very embarrassing. It was
very embarrassing for the company.

785
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:22,154
(ORIGINAL PLAN)

786
00:49:22,234 --> 00:49:23,913
SHEN: But during the chorus,

787
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:25,634
SHEN: the people up there
were dancing along with me.

788
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:39,553
SHEN: I think I've achieved
my small goal.

789
00:49:55,674 --> 00:49:56,674
TIA RAY: Thank you very much.

790
00:49:57,874 --> 00:49:59,754
TIA RAY: You are so tall.

791
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:03,434
SHEN: Yes, just a little bit tall.

792
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,834
TIA RAY: How do you get so tall at 18?

793
00:50:06,674 --> 00:50:08,314
XIN: How do you get so tall at 15?

794
00:50:09,034 --> 00:50:11,713
SHEN: The genetics at home aren't good.
So, my mom made me do high jumps every day.

795
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,914
SHEN: I have to jump 2,000 times a day
and drink milk as well.

796
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:15,473
SHEN: And there are many
traditional medicines as well.

797
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:17,154
TIA RAY: Can you please share with me?

798
00:50:17,954 --> 00:50:19,154
TIA RAY: It's probably too late now.

799
00:50:20,034 --> 00:50:20,874
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay, thank you.

800
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,714
BAMBAM: So, next is KK.

801
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,834
(Buried in snow)

802
00:51:03,314 --> 00:51:04,754
JEFF: Nice.

803
00:51:05,634 --> 00:51:07,713
TIA RAY: The voice is very clean.

804
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:09,314
TIA RAY: A pleasant surprise.

805
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:12,633
BAMBAM: Yeah, you know, when you
make people feel something that's...

806
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:13,514
BAMBAM: Sometimes, it's

807
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,394
BAMBAM: even more important than just talent.

808
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:17,154
- BAMBAM: You know what I mean? Yeah.
- JEFF: Yes. Yes.

809
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,114
JEFF: Watching solo shows, really.

810
00:51:19,154 --> 00:51:23,754
JEFF: So it makes it seem like we judge
based on what they are truly confident in.

811
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,113
JEFF: Some people choose
the Safe Zone that's like

812
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:27,594
JEFF: stepping out of their Safe Zone.

813
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:55,194
DAVID: Thank you, mentor.

814
00:51:55,234 --> 00:51:56,514
DAVID: Actually, I'm quite nervous.

815
00:51:57,354 --> 00:51:58,753
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): First of all,
I think

816
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:00,954
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your singing
is amazing.

817
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:03,274
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But the dancing

818
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:04,513
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): in your performance

819
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:05,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): lowered
your score a lot.

820
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:09,834
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Your strength
won't be magnified.

821
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:11,754
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It will make
your weaknesses more apparent.

822
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,154
DAVID: Yes, thank you, mentor.

823
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:15,713
WHYLUCAS: Dancing and singing
in front of professionals in this field

824
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:17,114
WHYLUCAS: must be difficult.

825
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:21,114
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Let's go straight
to your original dance performance.

826
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:22,594
TRAINEES: Keep going.

827
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:23,753
TRAINEES: XIONG, XIONG!

828
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:24,554
BAMBAM: He's like LUHAN, isn't he?

829
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:27,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): At the moment,
I think the most likely to debut is him.

830
00:53:13,954 --> 00:53:14,954
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

831
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:16,034
WUXUN: This XIONG.

832
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:17,674
WUXUN: When I see him, I feel

833
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:20,594
WUXUN: he is far beyond the level
of CHUANG, because I can picture that

834
00:53:20,954 --> 00:53:23,473
WUXUN: if I were watching this show
with him dancing at the front,

835
00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:24,154
WUXUN: it would be very cool.

836
00:53:25,154 --> 00:53:26,354
WUXUN: I want him to

837
00:53:26,394 --> 00:53:27,914
WUXUN: stand as the center dancer
for the show's theme song.

838
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,834
LIZI: I think he deserves an A.

839
00:53:33,354 --> 00:53:34,873
DONGDONG: I feel like he's got an A.

840
00:53:34,874 --> 00:53:35,314
JELLY: Yes.

841
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:37,314
GOU YI: XIONG should change his outfit
before dancing to this song.

842
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,234
GOU YI: With this outfit,
the dance moves aren't clear.

843
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:43,274
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Firstly, I feel that
your dancing is very flexible.

844
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,234
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But you didn't exert
enough effort to reach the best point.

845
00:53:48,634 --> 00:53:51,954
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Another thing is that
I think you need to find your frame.

846
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:53,514
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's too rigid.

847
00:53:53,554 --> 00:53:54,673
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And some angles

848
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:56,194
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): are not the most
suitable for you.

849
00:53:56,554 --> 00:53:57,673
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): From your body
proportions,

850
00:53:57,674 --> 00:53:59,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): if you want
to dance well,

851
00:54:00,034 --> 00:54:00,914
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): it will be
very beautiful.

852
00:54:00,954 --> 00:54:03,713
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): In this part,
you have to practice well.

853
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:05,393
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But, the emotion
you convey is quite good.

854
00:54:05,394 --> 00:54:06,674
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I hope
you will keep trying.

855
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:08,514
XIONG: Okay, thank you, mentor.

856
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:09,514
ARIEL LIN: But I think

857
00:54:09,515 --> 00:54:11,194
ARIEL LIN: he has listened
to your suggestions.

858
00:54:11,594 --> 00:54:13,994
ARIEL LIN: Actually, his facial expressions
are much more relaxed this time.

859
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:16,274
ARIEL LIN: He corrects it right away.

860
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:20,993
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's more relaxed,
but I think

861
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:22,274
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): he still needs
to try more.

862
00:54:23,474 --> 00:54:24,754
XIONG: Okay. Thank you, mentor.

863
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:26,034
TIAN QI: Actually,

864
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:27,873
TIAN QI: the dancer and the rapper
in the middle

865
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:29,674
TIAN QI: from two big boy groups

866
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:31,434
TIAN QI: are stricter about these things.

867
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:32,793
TIAN QI: Those on the sides are more lenient.

868
00:54:34,234 --> 00:54:35,114
ARIEL LIN: Yeah, maybe.

869
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:37,274
JEFF: A or B?

870
00:54:38,194 --> 00:54:39,673
MYST: I think he's really good, but...

871
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:41,114
MYST: He needs to have
like his special qualities.

872
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:42,834
- WHYLUCAS: Yes, yes.
- MYST: Something special.

873
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:45,994
DUY: Do you think XIONG gets A
and the others get B?

874
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,194
GORDAN: They are really looking for

875
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:48,194
GORDAN: the vocals.

876
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:50,434
GORDAN: I don't think they will
actually give a score for the vocals.

877
00:54:50,794 --> 00:54:53,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The singing is nice,
but once on stage...

878
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:55,554
BAMBAM: It's not wowing, right?

879
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I still don't see
him as more remarkable than the others.

880
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:00,954
BAMBAM: But KK really
seems to be like that.

881
00:55:04,354 --> 00:55:06,113
JEFF: I think KK, for me, is A.

882
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:07,034
TIA RAY: KK?

883
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:08,354
ARIEL LIN: And what about this one?

884
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:10,714
YAYA: I really like it. It was so good.

885
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:13,434
- YAYA: I feel like he looks comfortable,
- BAMBAM: Okay.

886
00:55:13,874 --> 00:55:15,114
YAYA: which is important.

887
00:55:15,234 --> 00:55:16,354
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay, ready?
- YAYA: Yeah, ready.

888
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:17,554
- TIA RAY: Ready?
- BAMBAM: Alright.

889
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:22,202
BAMBAM: The right decision
for the grade of you guys, so...

890
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:23,274
BAMBAM: DAVID.

891
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:25,554
BAMBAM: Okay, you ready?

892
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:27,074
BAMBAM: Here we go.

893
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:31,514
BAMBAM: B C B.

894
00:55:32,034 --> 00:55:33,154
BAMBAM: You've got B.

895
00:55:33,434 --> 00:55:34,434
BAMBAM: SHEN.

896
00:55:34,794 --> 00:55:36,594
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Your grade
this time is C.

897
00:55:37,074 --> 00:55:39,154
BAMBAM: So, next is KK.

898
00:55:42,194 --> 00:55:43,473
BAMBAM: You've got B.

899
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:44,514
BAMBAM: Congratulations.

900
00:55:45,194 --> 00:55:45,914
BAMBAM: B.

901
00:55:46,154 --> 00:55:46,914
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): B.

902
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:51,994
BAMBAM: Okay.

903
00:55:52,034 --> 00:55:53,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then, XIONG,
step forward.

904
00:55:55,674 --> 00:55:57,514
TRAINEES: Please look forward
to the first A.

905
00:55:58,234 --> 00:55:59,794
OMAR: I think XIONG is A.

906
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:02,393
- PEAT: I think XIONG got an A.
- OMAR: Yeah, yeah.

907
00:56:02,394 --> 00:56:03,914
YUCHEN: I think if XIONG
doesn't get an A, then...

908
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,274
YUCHEN: it would make it unconvincing.

909
00:56:06,202 --> 00:56:07,282
BAMBAM: Are you ready?

910
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:09,002
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay, XIONG.

911
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:11,602
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The final
grade is...

912
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:13,562
YAO ZIHAO: A.

913
00:56:13,722 --> 00:56:14,722
YAO ZIHAO: A.

914
00:56:17,482 --> 00:56:19,962
BAMBAM: B, B, B.

915
00:56:20,042 --> 00:56:21,162
BAMBAM: Oh, all B.

916
00:56:21,642 --> 00:56:23,842
BAMBAM: XIONG, you've got B.
Congratulations.

917
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:24,522
BAMBAM: B.

918
00:56:25,922 --> 00:56:27,442
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

919
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:30,562
- YUCHEN: Why?
- TRAINEES: Congratulations.

920
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:31,562
YUCHEN: Why?

921
00:56:31,842 --> 00:56:33,562
TRAINEES: Is it really this strict?

922
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:34,402
BAMBAM: B.

923
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:38,762
BAMBAM: Yeah, XIONG, for me, he...

924
00:56:39,282 --> 00:56:40,562
BAMBAM: You've got a facial.

925
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:44,642
BAMBAM: Actually, you did
quite good in the group song.

926
00:56:44,842 --> 00:56:46,282
BAMBAM: But when you do a solo,

927
00:56:46,482 --> 00:56:48,282
BAMBAM: we start to see your weakness,

928
00:56:48,682 --> 00:56:50,562
BAMBAM: your weak spot.
This what's I'm saying.

929
00:56:50,642 --> 00:56:55,122
BAMBAM: Solo is not always
a good opportunity for this show.

930
00:56:57,082 --> 00:56:59,442
TIAN QI: So, special performances
aren't necessarily a good thing.

931
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:02,481
TIA RAY: Actually, special performances
are a double-edged sword.

932
00:57:02,482 --> 00:57:04,402
TIA RAY: If they reveal flaws,

933
00:57:04,442 --> 00:57:08,082
TIA RAY: it may cause them
to lose that opportunity.

934
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:10,922
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): This is something
I want to say to

935
00:57:11,122 --> 00:57:13,122
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): every trainee here,

936
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:15,081
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): that you must avoid
your own weaknesses.

937
00:57:15,082 --> 00:57:16,842
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Know yourself well.

938
00:57:17,282 --> 00:57:19,481
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): When you know
what your strength is,

939
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:22,081
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you have to amplify
it as much as possible on stage.

940
00:57:22,082 --> 00:57:23,882
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And deliver it
to those who like you.

941
00:57:24,282 --> 00:57:25,522
XIONG: Got it. Thank you.

942
00:57:25,802 --> 00:57:27,082
XIONG: I will keep learning
from the mentors.

943
00:57:29,082 --> 00:57:30,402
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think that he

944
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:31,722
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is very talented,

945
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:34,042
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): but a B suits
his current abilities better.

946
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:35,881
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's just that he
also somewhat makes me remember him.

947
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:38,922
YUCHEN: I think that their performance
is definitely at level A.

948
00:57:39,002 --> 00:57:41,248
YUCHEN: For me, they have done the best

949
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:44,224
YUCHEN: with this much training time.

950
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:48,322
YUCHEN: I think the purpose of CHUANG
is to look for talented individuals

951
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,082
YUCHEN: or outstanding trainees.

952
00:57:51,282 --> 00:57:53,922
YUCHEN: To bring them in and watch
them grow gradually.

953
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:55,282
BAMBAM: Thank you for your show.

954
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:56,322
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Thank you.
- BAMBAM: Keep going.

955
00:57:56,323 --> 00:57:57,602
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you.

956
00:57:58,882 --> 00:58:00,722
BAMBAM: XIONG has almost got A.

957
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:03,922
BAMBAM: But he shouldn't do
the solo stage.

958
00:58:04,122 --> 00:58:05,122
TIA RAY: You guys...

959
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:07,802
BAMBAM: I think our standards may be
too high of a level, but...

960
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:09,042
BAMBAM: Yeah, not yet.

961
00:58:09,658 --> 00:58:11,578
BAMBAM: Please welcome the next team.

962
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:17,898
TRAINEES: This team looks very cool.

963
00:58:18,898 --> 00:58:20,018
WHYLUCAS: CAO YUCHEN!

964
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,578
WHYLUCAS: CAO YUCHEN!

965
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,218
WHYLUCAS: WUXUN!

966
00:58:23,978 --> 00:58:24,698
TRAINEES: Yeah.

967
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,658
BAMBAM: It's easy on the eyes.

968
00:58:27,898 --> 00:58:28,778
YUCHEN: Hello.

969
00:58:28,978 --> 00:58:30,298
YUCHEN: Please enjoy.

970
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:32,178
TRAINEES: It's going to rain tonight.

971
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:34,058
TRAINEES: The weather forecast.

972
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:37,458
YUCHEN: I'm like a clear sky
with lots of clouds, YUCHEN.

973
00:58:37,498 --> 00:58:39,978
YUCHEN: Because my image

974
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,658
YUCHEN: looks lively
and very extroverted,

975
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:43,578
YUCHEN: but every time I sing,

976
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:45,178
YUCHEN: it makes the whole world

977
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,258
YUCHEN: calm down.

978
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:51,177
JINGYU: Hello, I am
the light drizzle JINGYU.

979
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:53,738
JINGYU: I hope my singing can
remind everyone of

980
00:58:54,178 --> 00:58:55,458
JINGYU: the afternoon,

981
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,298
JINGYU: the campus,

982
00:58:56,378 --> 00:58:57,058
JINGYU: what's outside the window,

983
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,178
JINGYU: the cicadas,

984
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:59,778
JINGYU: and a quiet light rain.

985
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:01,698
WUXUN: Yo, what's up?

986
00:59:01,778 --> 00:59:03,698
WUXUN: This is the rainstorm WUXUN.

987
00:59:03,778 --> 00:59:04,898
WHYLUCAS: What's up?

988
00:59:04,978 --> 00:59:06,978
WUXUN: If I have the chance
to show everyone my work,

989
00:59:07,018 --> 00:59:09,338
WUXUN: I will let everyone
feel the sound

990
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:10,778

during a storm.

the gentle breeze JUNHAN.

JUNHAN: I hope when everyone
hears my voice, you can remember

994
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:23,898
JUNHAN: the hot summer, the seaside
of Thailand, and that gentle and cool breeze.

995
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,978
GUANMING: Hello, I am
the first snow GUANMING.

996
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:28,698
GUANMING: Because I was born in winter,
and I hope my singing

997
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:31,178
GUANMING: can be like the first snow,
bringing romance to everyone.

998
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:33,578

HU YETAO: This group is so relaxing.

1006
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:03,936
(Tonight, it will rain)

1007
01:01:11,818 --> 01:01:13,418
TIA RAY: Wow, that was very perfect.

1008
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:40,138
TRAINEES: Wow, very
heart-warming. It's like

1009
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:41,634
TRAINEES: they've just
performed a drama.

1010
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:43,098
TRAINEES: Five MMCs?

1011
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:45,378
TIA RAY: I think the whole performance
is all very fresh.

1012
01:01:45,778 --> 01:01:48,538
TIA RAY: There are two vocals.
One is YUCHEN.

1013
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,378
TIA RAY: One is GUANMING.

1014
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:53,578
TIA RAY: I think both of your voices
just now captivated me.

1015
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,298
JEFF: Just one thing that
I wanna say to WUXUN.

1016
01:01:59,378 --> 01:02:00,618
JEFF: The show is great, but

1017
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:03,858
JEFF: I love the thing
you do before the show.

1018
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:04,978
WUXUN: Let's go.

1019
01:02:05,378 --> 01:02:06,898
JEFF: All of you are kind of nervous,

1020
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:09,658
JEFF: and what you do is like,
you break the ice.

1021
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:11,738
JEFF: You try to make everyone, like, calm.

1022
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,938
JEFF: It's just chill.

1023
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:13,818
JEFF: Very good.

1024
01:02:13,978 --> 01:02:16,018
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Just now
when you talked

1025
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:18,738
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and when you performed,
you're like two different people.

1026
01:02:19,738 --> 01:02:20,938
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): You caught
my attention.

1027
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:23,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): This performance
gave me

1028
01:02:23,778 --> 01:02:24,698
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the biggest surprise.

1029
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:25,858
WUXUN: Thank you, mentor.

1030
01:02:28,138 --> 01:02:29,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then I look

1031
01:02:29,778 --> 01:02:32,377
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): at your background.
LONG TAO ENTERTAINMENT.

1032
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:34,338
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): A musician
of the new generation.

1033
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:36,738
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Known as
HUANG ZITAO's favorite artist.

1034
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:39,018
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): What do you think
your boss, HUANG ZITAO,

1035
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:40,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): likes about you?

1036
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:42,658
WUXUN: My sincerity.

1037
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:46,258
WUXUN: And we both are Taurus,
so we're both straightforward.

1038
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:48,778
WUXUN: I think my personality
is quite similar to my boss's.

1039
01:02:48,818 --> 01:02:50,338
WUXUN: That is being straightforward.

1040
01:02:50,418 --> 01:02:51,418
WUXUN: Relaxed.

1041
01:02:53,778 --> 01:02:55,018
STAFF: We need more energy, please.

1042
01:02:55,098 --> 01:02:56,178
WUXUN: Energy, you say?

1043
01:02:56,338 --> 01:02:56,978
WUXUN: Bring it on.

1044
01:02:57,954 --> 01:02:58,818
WUXUN: Let's go.

1045
01:02:59,394 --> 01:03:00,218
WUXUN: Let's go.

1046
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:01,178
YUCHEN: Let's go!

1047
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:04,298
GUANMING: Fire it up!

1048
01:03:04,578 --> 01:03:06,377
WUXUN: I like to play
with the vibe like my boss.

1049
01:03:06,378 --> 01:03:08,338
WUXUN: I myself will try to
imitate him, because

1050
01:03:08,378 --> 01:03:10,818
WUXUN: he does have an impact on me.

1051
01:03:10,898 --> 01:03:12,418
HUANG ZITAO: Call me.

1052
01:03:13,442 --> 01:03:16,738
STAFF: Did he give you any advice
or suggestions before you come?

1053
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,858
HUANG ZITAO: Long time no see, WUXUN.

1054
01:03:20,178 --> 01:03:24,818
HUANG ZITAO: I wish you shine
on the CHUANG ASIA stage. Go for it.

1055
01:03:25,338 --> 01:03:26,618
WUXUN: He just told me to go for it.

1056
01:03:27,418 --> 01:03:29,018
WUXUN: A man doesn't need to talk much.

1057
01:03:29,938 --> 01:03:32,738
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I actually just
want to hear WUXUN sing.

1058
01:03:32,858 --> 01:03:34,578
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I want to see
his solo performance.

1059
01:03:35,658 --> 01:03:36,858
YUCHEN: Go for it, WUXUN.

1060
01:03:39,178 --> 01:03:41,098
(Love tape)

1061
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,642
AGUANG: I think WUXUN must get an A now.

1062
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,114
WHYLUCAS: WUXUN might be the first.

1063
01:04:58,114 --> 01:04:59,330
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Awesome.

1064
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:03,538
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Can you dance?
I want to see some of your dance.

1065
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:06,338
GUANMING: Sure thing.

1066
01:05:06,338 --> 01:05:08,706
WUXUN: I am quite confident with singing

1067
01:05:08,706 --> 01:05:10,722
WUXUN: because I've been writing songs for seven years.

1068
01:05:10,722 --> 01:05:12,338
WUXUN: And then...

1069
01:05:12,338 --> 01:05:13,538
WUXUN: Regarding dancing,

1070
01:05:13,538 --> 01:05:15,658
WUXUN: one month.

1071
01:05:15,658 --> 01:05:16,674
WUXUN: I've just been
dancing for one month.

1072
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:19,074
WUXUN: Er... I mean... What
should I dance?

1073
01:05:19,074 --> 01:05:19,938
ARIEL LIN: Whatever you like.

1074
01:05:19,938 --> 01:05:22,754
ARIEL LIN: Why is it completely
different from when you sang?

1075
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:24,482
- DAVID: Don't be afraid.
- TRAINEES: Bring it on.

1076
01:05:24,482 --> 01:05:25,346
TRAINEES: Keep going.

1077
01:05:25,346 --> 01:05:27,138
HUANG ZITAO: Just do it.

1078
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:28,258
WANXIN: Keep going.

1079
01:05:28,338 --> 01:05:29,218
WUXUN: Let's go.

1080
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,658
XIAONIAN: Isn't there a background song?

1081
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,746
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Immersive dancing.

1082
01:05:35,746 --> 01:05:37,938
TIA RAY: That's so cute.

1083
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:43,978
TRAINEES: Go on.

1084
01:05:44,018 --> 01:05:45,058
TRAINEES: Go on.

1085
01:05:45,058 --> 01:05:46,146
WUXUN: I'm so embarrassed.

1086
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:47,618
WUXUN: Because dancing is
really not my strength.

1087
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:50,306
WUXUN: I can't help it.
It really pushes me to the edge.

1088
01:05:50,402 --> 01:05:52,226
WUXUN: I really want to find
a hole to crawl into.

1089
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:54,850
WUXUN: My toes are curling up
in embarrassment.

1090
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:56,866
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay, thank you.

1091
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,658
TRAINEES: This part is quite stiff.

1092
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,818
TIA RAY: Actually, I think they all
did very well.

1093
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:07,266
TIA RAY: But who I really
want to hear is YUCHEN.

1094
01:06:07,266 --> 01:06:09,618
TIA RAY: Go ahead and show your talent.

1095
01:06:10,018 --> 01:06:10,938
YUCHEN: Hello, mentor.

1096
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,658
YUCHEN: I mean, before this, I was

1097
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:15,058
YUCHEN: a musical actor.

1098
01:06:15,658 --> 01:06:18,098
YUCHEN: Today, I will perform a part
for everyone.

1099
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:20,618
YUCHEN: It's a musical piece
that I have performed.

1100
01:06:22,538 --> 01:06:23,338
TRAINEES: I really like it.

1101
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:24,538
DAVID: CAO YUCHEN

1102
01:06:24,658 --> 01:06:25,954
DAVID: graduated in Musical Theatre
from SHANGHAI CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC.

1103
01:06:25,954 --> 01:06:29,314
SICHEN: I've seen the musicals
of YUCHEN before.

1104
01:06:29,314 --> 01:06:31,738
SICHEN: Actually, I've always
wanted to perform with them all along.

1105
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:36,538
YUCHEN: I have performed in musicals
in total, about

1106
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:37,658
YUCHEN: 5 plays already.

1107
01:06:37,818 --> 01:06:39,498
YUCHEN: That makes 100 stages.

1108
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:41,817
YUCHEN: The reason I came
to this show is one,

1109
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:43,698
YUCHEN: I want to experience
the stage of idols,

1110
01:06:43,898 --> 01:06:45,978
YUCHEN: and on the other hand, I want to

1111
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:47,938
YUCHEN: promote Chinese musicals.

1112
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:52,018
YUCHEN: I have a story

1113
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:54,658
YUCHEN: of a boy, and that's me.

1114
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:58,457
YUCHEN: He was abandoned
since he was a child

1115
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,417
YUCHEN: and grew up in an orphanage.

1116
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:05,258
YUCHEN: I want to share
this story with everyone.

1117
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:07,898
TIA RAY: Keep going.

1118
01:07:09,504 --> 01:07:10,228
Ready.

1119
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:15,680
(Color)

1120
01:09:01,258 --> 01:09:03,257
ARIEL LIN: That's very touching.

1121
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:04,178
BAMBAM: Wow.

1122
01:09:04,538 --> 01:09:06,338
ARIEL LIN: It's a performance
that really reaches the heart.

1123
01:09:07,778 --> 01:09:09,218
PEAT: I don't know what he was singing

1124
01:09:09,258 --> 01:09:11,578
- PEAT: but I'm...
- LIZI: Yeah, touching.

1125
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:14,138
TIA RAY: I would like to ask
for one thing, please.

1126
01:09:14,178 --> 01:09:17,178
TIA RAY: If I return to Shanghai,
may I come to see your musical show?

1127
01:09:18,218 --> 01:09:20,138
YUCHEN: Yes. I just watched your live house performance.

1128
01:09:20,178 --> 01:09:21,618
YUCHEN: The jazz in Shanghai...

1129
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:22,818

YUCHEN: I'm too excited.

1132
01:09:26,858 --> 01:09:28,057
YUCHEN: I've been listening to
your songs since you

1133
01:09:28,058 --> 01:09:30,338
YUCHEN: went on THE VOICE.
I've been watching all along.

1134
01:09:30,498 --> 01:09:33,378
YUCHEN: Now that I meet you
in person today, I can't...

1135
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:34,578
YUCHEN: I really can't control it.

1136
01:09:34,578 --> 01:09:37,446
♪I guess you also want to get closer♪

1137
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:43,405
♪Until my eyelashes
lightly brush your cheeks♪

1138
01:09:44,034 --> 01:09:46,178
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

1139
01:09:46,338 --> 01:09:47,818

TIA RAY: I really like you a lot.

1143
01:09:53,218 --> 01:09:54,778
YUCHEN: I like... Oh!

1144
01:09:57,056 --> 01:09:57,538
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Oh my.

1145
01:09:57,696 --> 01:09:59,010
TIA RAY: I really like you a lot.

1146
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:00,858
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): You can
go talk outside.

1147
01:10:00,858 --> 01:10:03,018
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Is
ten minutes enough?

1148
01:10:04,834 --> 01:10:07,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Alright,
let's start the evaluation.

1149
01:10:08,578 --> 01:10:10,098
HU YETAO: YUCHEN might get an A.

1150
01:10:10,218 --> 01:10:12,458
KK: Because his singing is so touching.

1151
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:15,778
WEIZHI: I think YUCHEN and WUXUN
should get an A

1152
01:10:15,818 --> 01:10:18,298
WEIZHI: because of their voices, and...

1153
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:19,418
WEIZHI: their charm.

1154
01:10:19,578 --> 01:10:20,578
BIANURA: I agree.

1155
01:10:20,818 --> 01:10:21,818
WHYLUCAS: But he never dances.

1156
01:10:22,658 --> 01:10:23,658
WHYLUCAS: He hasn't danced at all.

1157
01:10:24,258 --> 01:10:25,698
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So, our first one is

1158
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:26,418
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): WUXUN.

1159
01:10:27,698 --> 01:10:29,138
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Are
the mentors ready?

1160
01:10:29,698 --> 01:10:31,378
TRAINEES: It's an A.

1161
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,657
- JACKSON: A.
- PRAY: A.

1162
01:10:32,658 --> 01:10:33,378
JACKSON: A.

1163
01:10:36,538 --> 01:10:37,978
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): All mentors
give a B.

1164
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:41,578
PLENGTHAI: What?

1165
01:10:43,778 --> 01:10:45,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): JUNHAN gets a C.

1166
01:10:45,578 --> 01:10:46,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): GUANMING gets a C.

1167
01:10:47,058 --> 01:10:48,258
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): JINGYU gets a C.

1168
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:52,298
OMAR: That's it.

1169
01:10:53,938 --> 01:10:55,018
DONGDONG: Wow.

1170
01:10:55,098 --> 01:10:56,978
DONGDONG: This is too strict.

1171
01:10:57,658 --> 01:10:58,458
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): YUCHEN.

1172
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,418
HU YETAO: CAO YUCHEN!

1173
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,818
HU YETAO: CAO YUCHEN!

1174
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:05,018
HIKARU: A, A, A, A.

1175
01:11:05,498 --> 01:11:06,618
TRAINEES: There should be one, no?

1176
01:11:06,658 --> 01:11:07,938
TRAINEES: The hope of the entire team.

1177
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:11,938
DAVID: Come on, A.

1178
01:11:17,658 --> 01:11:18,658
BAMBAM: Oh.

1179
01:11:19,218 --> 01:11:20,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The final
rating is B.

1180
01:11:22,418 --> 01:11:23,698
GOU YI: What?

1181
01:11:26,938 --> 01:11:29,058
BAMBAM: I was thinking about A too.

1182
01:11:29,138 --> 01:11:30,458
- TIA RAY: Right?
- BAMBAM: Yes, but then

1183
01:11:31,738 --> 01:11:33,178
BAMBAM: MINGHAO has
a very good point, so

1184
01:11:33,258 --> 01:11:34,658
- BAMBAM: I can't deny.
- TIA RAY: Okay.

1185
01:11:35,218 --> 01:11:38,177
BAMBAM: I think it wouldn't hurt
if YUCHEN got an A.

1186
01:11:38,178 --> 01:11:39,138
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): A?

1187
01:11:39,139 --> 01:11:40,217
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But he can't dance.

1188
01:11:40,218 --> 01:11:41,618
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): We cannot give an A.

1189
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:44,898
BAMBAM: It's possible.

1190
01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:46,434
BAMBAM: I think he has
a lot of potential.

1191
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:48,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's true that he
has charm, talent, and sings very well.

1192
01:11:48,898 --> 01:11:50,698
BAMBAM: But he can't dance. Okay.

1193
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:52,417
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you debut
as a group,

1194
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:53,418
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): dancing is

1195
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:54,617
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): really
very important.

1196
01:11:54,618 --> 01:11:57,138
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Because there might
not be many singing parts for you.

1197
01:11:57,218 --> 01:11:59,338
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Most of it
would be dancing.

1198
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:01,418
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): There are
five of you now.

1199
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:04,298
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): No one can dance

1200
01:12:04,378 --> 01:12:05,778
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): with such confidence.

1201
01:12:06,938 --> 01:12:09,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you just
stand and sing,

1202
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): then you should
pursue a solo singing career.

1203
01:12:12,138 --> 01:12:13,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Wouldn't that
suit you better?

1204
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:17,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So, from my
perspective, I can't give you an A.

1205
01:12:25,418 --> 01:12:27,378
WEIZHI: Don't tell me no one gets an A.

1206
01:12:27,898 --> 01:12:29,698
AGUANG: Oh, my God.

1207
01:12:29,898 --> 01:12:32,218
PRAY: I think that Class A is not
limited to a certain number of people.

1208
01:12:32,258 --> 01:12:33,858
PRAY: Because no one
can make it to Class A.

1209
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:37,418
TRAINEES: What should we do?
We're doomed.

1210
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,098
YUCHEN: I think

1211
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:46,258
YUCHEN: even if I get an A today,

1212
01:12:46,418 --> 01:12:48,498
YUCHEN: I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

1213
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:51,538
YUCHEN: I feel like
I don't deserve an A yet.

1214
01:12:51,618 --> 01:12:52,898
YUCHEN: But I have a question

1215
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:57,098
YUCHEN: about my good friends, XIONG,

1216
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,098
YUCHEN: and also DAVID.

1217
01:12:59,106 --> 01:13:01,618
YUCHEN: In my heart,
they are definitely A.

1218
01:13:12,418 --> 01:13:15,338
YUCHEN: I just want to know
what the standard

1219
01:13:16,218 --> 01:13:17,538
YUCHEN: for A is, exactly.

1220
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:18,978
HIKARU: Fantastic.

1221
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:23,458
TRAINEES: Actually, this is also
a question we've been pondering.

1222
01:13:26,858 --> 01:13:27,658
YUCHEN: Yes.
