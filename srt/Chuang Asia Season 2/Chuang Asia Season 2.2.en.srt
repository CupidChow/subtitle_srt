00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:41,298
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): together

170
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:42,338
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): to create this team?

171
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:43,498
HU YETAO: I chose them.

172
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:45,298
HU YETAO: I feel their styles

173
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,458
HU YETAO: are somewhat like mine.

174
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:48,818
HU YETAO: And their appearance

175
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:50,018
HU YETAO: is beautiful,

176
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:52,698
HU YETAO: very good-looking.

177
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,418
ARIEL LIN: That's true.

178
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,298
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But if you
compare with

179
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,178
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): general boy groups,

180
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:00,258
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): how do you present

181
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,178
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your own style?

182
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,898
HU YETAO: I think being
an international boy group

183
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,938
HU YETAO: shouldn't be limited
to just ordinary boy groups.

184
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:12,498
HU YETAO: I joined this show in 2021 and
said a boy group has no definition.

185
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:14,338
HU YETAO: 3 years have passed.

186
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,418
HU YETAO: We've seen boy groups with same styles.
Why should we be stuck in that same box?

187
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:18,578
MENTOR: Wow.

188
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,098
HU YETAO: So, we shouldn't create
the same old boy group anymore.

189
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,338
- BAMBAM: Good answer.
- YAYA: I love it.

190
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,578
- BAMBAM: Good answer.
- TRAINEES: HU YETAO!

191
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,578
HU YETAO: From
a traditional perspective,

192
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,298
HU YETAO: I don't even look like
a person who would be an idol.

193
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,858
HU YETAO: The reason I can stand
on this stage with confidence

194
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:35,858
HU YETAO: is because

195
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:38,058
HU YETAO: I just want to be on stage.

196
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:40,578
HU YETAO: After CHUANG 2021 ended...

197
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,538
MENTOR: Goodbye, everyone.

198
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,778
HU YETAO: Actually, the chances
for me to get on stage are very rare.

199
00:10:45,818 --> 00:10:48,898
HU YETAO: If anyone misses out, comment here.

200
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,818
HU YETAO: If you didn't get it, I will...

201
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,698
HU YETAO: Are you ready?

202
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:52,778
HU YETAO: All viewers,

203
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,538
HU YETAO: move your fingers a bit.

204
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:58,058
HU YETAO: Whether
it's posting short videos or

205
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:00,178
HU YETAO: posting dances
on social media,

206
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:02,098
HU YETAO: sometimes renting
locations for filming.

207
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,218
HU YETAO: Several artists
have filmed videos at this stage.

208
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:06,538
HU YETAO: We've invested quite a lot.

209
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,538
HU YETAO: But things like that

210
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,858
HU YETAO: can't compare with a stage with lights, costumes,

211
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:13,778
HU YETAO: the audience and applause.

212
00:11:14,378 --> 00:11:15,058
HU YETAO: For me,

213
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:17,498
HU YETAO: what I desire the most
is to stand on a real stage.

214
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:21,058
HU YETAO: I didn't have many performances
back in CHUANG 2021.

215
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:23,738
HU YETAO: Honestly, I've watched
every performance over a hundred times,

216
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,898
HU YETAO: maybe more than a hundred.

217
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,058
HU YETAO: So, I think
I can't give up yet.

218
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:29,218
HU YETAO: I think I still have a chance

219
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,658
HU YETAO: to continue standing on stage

220
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:33,458
HU YETAO: in order to pursue
what I dream of.

221
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:35,578
HU YETAO: Another thing is the fans.

222
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:36,778
HU YETAO: All this time,

223
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:38,058
HU YETAO: for many reasons,

224
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,618
HU YETAO: I haven't given

225
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,698
HU YETAO: what is called

226
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:43,698
HU YETAO: pride to them.

227
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:45,258
HU YETAO: So, I feel regretful.

228
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:47,698
HU YETAO: This time,

229
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:48,858
HU YETAO: I have quite
some expectations.

230
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,778
HU YETAO: Suddenly, I felt like crying.

231
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:04,338
HU YETAO: I like it best

232
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:05,938
HU YETAO: when I see myself
in an attractive image.

233
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:06,938
HU YETAO: But I think
only being on stage

234
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:08,578
HU YETAO: will be my best image.

235
00:12:10,978 --> 00:12:14,098
HU YETAO: I want to have
such wonderful moments

236
00:12:14,098 --> 00:12:14,938
HU YETAO: and memories

237
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:18,098
HU YETAO: for my future self
to come back and watch again and again.

238
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:22,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Actually, I really
want to see HU YETAO's solo performance.

239
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,498
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I really
want to watch it.

240
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:24,898
HU YETAO: I'll go change clothes first.

241
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:25,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Sure.

242
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,058
HU YETAO: Thank you.

243
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,338
YUCHEN: We have to go all out.

244
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,778
PRAY: I wonder what kind
of performance it will be.

245
00:12:40,538 --> 00:12:41,418
TRAINEES: So stunning.

246
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:43,618
TRAINEES: Changed to a limited-edition
skin for Season 2.

247
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,018
BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

248
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:47,498
TIA RAY: Eh, you're going to be
too beautiful.

249
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,138
TRAINEES: Like an angel.

250
00:12:49,178 --> 00:12:50,338
TIA RAY: What are you going to do?

251
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,618
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): You can start
the performance now.

252
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,618
- TRAINEES: Wow.
- TRAINEES: Look at that pose.

253
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:58,778
TRAINEES: It's started.

254
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:19,018
TRAINEES: Truly beautiful.

255
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:21,378
TRAINEES: It's like watching an anime.

256
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,538
TRAINEES: Like a fox.

257
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:24,698
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

258
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:37,778
TRAINEES: TAO TAO!

259
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,298
WANXIN: I cannot praise the flowers,
nor can I praise you.

260
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,538
BAMBAM: I'm done.

261
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:20,018
JEFF: Nice.

262
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:23,938
PRAY: I got goosebumps all over.

263
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:24,738
WUXUN: Very similar

264
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,618
WUXUN: to the posture of a fox.

265
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,418
JELLY: When he took off the mask,
I thought it was

266
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,738
JELLY: the nine-tailed fox, Daji.

267
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:34,698
DORN: As soon as it started,
I couldn't take my eyes off.

268
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:35,738
WHYLUCAS: Seeing HU YETAO over there
makes me like this.

269
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,338
YAYA: You know exactly
what weapons you have,

270
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,898
YAYA: and you know exactly
how to, like bang,

271
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:45,698
YAYA: like you know how to hit
everyone so well.

272
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:46,698
YAYA: That's incredible.

273
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,178
ARIEL LIN: I think he was truly
born for the stage.

274
00:14:50,218 --> 00:14:52,058
ARIEL LIN: Even as a woman,

275
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,778
ARIEL LIN: I still feel
fascinated by you.

276
00:14:54,818 --> 00:14:56,898
WUXUN: I don't even want to blink.

277
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,538
WUXUN: I just want to watch it.

278
00:14:57,578 --> 00:15:00,338
ARIEL LIN: I think the greatest thing
you've gained from this stage is that

279
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,338
ARIEL LIN: seeing people
from all over the world

280
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,418
ARIEL LIN: will help you
appreciate the special

281
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,778
ARIEL LIN: and uniquely valuable
qualities you have.

282
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,018
ARIEL LIN: Keep it safe.

283
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,258
ARIEL LIN: This is CHUANG.

284
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:11,738
ARIEL LIN: CHUANG,
which means creativity.

285
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,778
HU YETAO: Yes, Mentor.

286
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,858
ARIEL LIN: I believe there is
a beauty within him

287
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:19,258
ARIEL LIN: that is inseparable
from both male and female aspects.

288
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:20,218
ARIEL LIN: That beauty,

289
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,138
ARIEL LIN: many years ago

290
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:24,658
ARIEL LIN: or even now in many places,

291
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:27,978
ARIEL LIN: is still not
understandable or acceptable.

292
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:30,938
ARIEL LIN: But this world
is becoming more

293
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:32,778
ARIEL LIN: diverse, and

294
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:34,218
ARIEL LIN: we can accept diverse beauty.

295
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:38,218
BAMBAM: One thing I want to say is

296
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:39,698
BAMBAM: HU YETAO,

297
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,218
BAMBAM: you actually

298
00:15:41,658 --> 00:15:42,978
BAMBAM: are "nothing" to me.

299
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:47,738
MYST: What?

300
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:51,498
BAMBAM: Because

301
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:53,458
BAMBAM: "nothing" lasts forever.

302
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,058
BAMBAM: You get it?

303
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:10,218
YUCHEN: He's talking sweetly.

304
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,618
JINGYU: Like flirting.

305
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:15,018
BAMBAM: This is the first time
in my life, I feel like

306
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:16,738
BAMBAM: man is

307
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:18,018
BAMBAM: attractive.

308
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,698
YAYA: Nothing wrong in that.

309
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,258
YAYA: Nothing wrong with that.

310
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:25,538
JEFF: I just wanna say that

311
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:27,338
JEFF: you belong on the stage.

312
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:28,698
JEFF: Nowhere else.

313
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:30,618
BAMBAM: No, you belong to me.

314
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:37,618
TIA RAY: We belong together.

315
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:40,778
JEFF: I...

316
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:41,818
JEFF: Funny.

317
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:42,658
JEFF: That's it.

318
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:44,138
JEFF: It's just that BAMBAM...

319
00:16:44,818 --> 00:16:45,818
JEFF: he's really fallen in love.

320
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,458
TRAINEES: Wow, they're so close.

321
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,578
TRAINEES: They're about to meet.

322
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,658
BAMBAM: He looks even prettier
when closer.

323
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:10,618
TIA RAY: Stop it.

324
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:11,658
TIA RAY: Stop it.

325
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:12,818
JEFF: HU YETAO.

326
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,698
JEFF: We have to...

327
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:16,698
BAMBAM: HU YETAO?

328
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:19,978
JEFF: Okay.

329
00:17:20,258 --> 00:17:20,938
JEFF: What?

330
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:21,698
JEFF: How?

331
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:22,578
JEFF: How?

332
00:17:23,498 --> 00:17:24,098
JEFF: How?

333
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,978
- JEFF: I'm leaving.
- BAMBAM: Come back. Come back.

334
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,738
BAMBAM: Let's vote.

335
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:34,058
SHEN: I ship them.

336
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,538
GUANMING: You ship everyone,
you may get hurt.

337
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,858
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay, we will give

XU MINGHAO (THE 8): represented

364
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:38,178
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the unique charm
you possess.

365
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,538
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I have emphasized it
from the beginning.

366
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,658
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Hope everyone

370
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:54,138
TIA RAY: But now it's time
for you to see the world.

371
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,378
TIA RAY: Welcome to CHUANG.

372
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:57,298

373
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:58,298
HU YETAO: Thank you, everyone.

374
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,058
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then, HU YETAO,

375
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,698
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): please proceed
to the Class A seat.

376
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:06,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): HU YETAO,

377
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,938
XU MINGHAO:
he has his own style,

378
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,698
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and the ability
to present that style.

379
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:11,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Therefore,

380
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,218

his charm to the audience on the stage

381
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:16,298
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is very important.

382
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,858
DONGDONG: In reality,
an idol's path nowadays

383
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,698
DONGDONG: is not limited to one style.

384
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:22,778
DONGDONG: but rather
how you discover yourself

385
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:25,218
DONGDONG: and showcase your best side

386
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,338
DONGDONG: and let it shine.

387
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,058
DONGDONG: Make everyone like you.

388
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:29,658
KOHI: A real star

389
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:31,858
KOHI: must amaze both those
who hate us and like us

390
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:33,378
KOHI: with our performance.

391
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:35,258
BAMBAM: I'm done.

392
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:36,098
KOHI: That is why

393
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:38,978
KOHI: people call us stars.

394
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,418
BAMBAM: So beautiful.

395
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,498

396
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:50,418
BAMBAM: Here we go.

397
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:51,858

398
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,938
RYAN WINTER: Hello, everyone.

399
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,418

RYAN WINTER / BIANURA: APPLE MINT.

402
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,058
RYAN WINTER: My personal charm

403
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:00,698
RYAN WINTER: is piano

404
00:20:00,738 --> 00:20:01,418
RYAN WINTER: and my singing

405
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,058
RYAN WINTER: is my confident skill

406
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:04,618
RYAN WINTER: that people can remember me

407
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:06,178
RYAN WINTER: that a man
who can play the piano.

408
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,458
TRAINEES: Hello everyone,
we are FRIDAY AT.

409
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,658
WANXIN: What I want to give everyone is

410
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:12,258
WANXIN: relaxation

411
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,418
WANXIN: and happiness.

412
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:14,018
TRAINEES: Hey, guys.

413
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,618
TRAINEES: We are 5 STARS.

414
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): He struck
a cool pose right away.

415
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,578
HIKARI: My charm is,

416
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:25,618
HIKARI: among all the trainees,

417
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,298
HIKARI: I'm the only one with red hair.

418
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:29,258
HIKARI: In Chinese, HIKARI means

419
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:30,138
HIKARI: light.

420
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,258
HIKARI: Do you believe in light?

421
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:35,938
TRAINEES: Hello, everyone.

422
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,458
TRAINEES: We are 4EVER.

423
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:43,898
B: Someone once told me that

424
00:20:43,938 --> 00:20:46,578
B: my smile makes the world brighter.

425
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:50,338
KAO: And I believe that
my smile can change the world.

426
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:54,058
JEFF: KAO, did you ever play a role
in the same series with YAYA?

427
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,178
KAO: Yes, I did.

428
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,698
YAYA: Yes, yes, you played
as young Mark, right?

429
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:58,898
YAYA: Yes, yes.

430
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:02,338
KAO: Back then,
I was around 13-14 years old.

431
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:06,378
JEFF: Are you still
13-14 years old now, right?

432
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,018
KAO: Of course, staying young forever.

433
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,458
JEFF: Come on.

434
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:12,618
BAMBAM: Okay, this stage is yours.

435
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,578
WEIZHI: WANXIN's necklace...

436
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:56,058
WEIZHI: He danced halfway
and then spun around.

437
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,378
WEIZHI: Then his necklace got tangled
with the headphones.

438
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,978
WEIZHI: And then, he had to
deal with the headphones.

439
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,898
WEIZHI: Only the two of us
were dancing there.

440
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,298
WEIZHI: I felt like he abandoned us.

441
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:08,898
WANXIN: What I want to give everyone is

442
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:10,298
WANXIN: relaxation and happiness.

443
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,378
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you.
It's a bit tiring, right?

444
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:55,938
YAYA: I think you guys
have a good chemistry.

445
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,978
YAYA: It's obvious that
you know each other.

446
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:01,618
YAYA: But I feel like you don't
really have a clear focus.

447
00:23:01,658 --> 00:23:02,778
YAYA: Like your eyes are doing...

448
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:10,298
JEFF: If you don't know where to look,

449
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:11,738
JEFF: look at YAYA.

450
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,818
YAYA: In the future,
maybe find a focus point,

451
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:17,738
YAYA: so you're not like looking around.

452
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,218
YAYA: That's a little bit distracting.

453
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:39,618
YAYA: Just being cute alone

454
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:43,258
YAYA: on a stage with a lot of audience,

455
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,058
YAYA: sometimes it might not be enough.

456
00:23:45,378 --> 00:23:50,058
YAYA: You might need to add
more strength in other areas.

457
00:23:51,618 --> 00:23:52,578
YAYA: Keep going.

458
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:53,698
BAMBAM: Keep going.

459
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:20,378
TRAINEES: Handsome.

460
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:29,378
TRAINEES: Nice.

461
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,098
- TRAINEES: Thank you
- EARTH: Thank you.

462
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,018
BAMBAM: Thank you. Thank you.

463
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:42,138
BAMBAM: Take your time.
Breathe, alright?

464
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,218
BAMBAM: So, first is

465
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:46,578
BAMBAM: HIKARI.

466
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,778
BAMBAM: From Japan, 24 years old.

467
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:51,738
BAMBAM: HIKARI is...

468
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,018
BAMBAM: C.

469
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,458
YAYA: You have some kind of fire in you.

470
00:24:56,738 --> 00:25:00,738
YAYA: And on stage, we could see that
you were trying very hard.

471
00:25:00,858 --> 00:25:03,378
YAYA: But sometimes
when you try too hard,

472
00:25:05,618 --> 00:25:07,418
YAYA: you lose your charm.

473
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,058
BAMBAM: Next is KOSHIN, SUNNY.

474
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:12,738
BAMBAM: Grade C.

475
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,858
BAMBAM: Next, EARTH.

476
00:25:14,858 --> 00:25:15,658
BAMBAM: SENA.

477
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:17,538
TRAINEES: Both F.

478
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:19,938
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Lastly,
I want to talk about

479
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,658
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the overall problem.

480
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,778
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): First, I feel that

481
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,378
XU MINGHAO:
you getting lower grades

482
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:30,138
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is because
you are each dancing on your own.

483
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:32,538
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And there are people

484
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:34,498
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): dancing
a little too fast.

485
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,378
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The move isn't finished,
yet you're already onto another one.

486
00:25:38,418 --> 00:25:40,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): That makes me feel
a sense of chaos.

487
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:44,498
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Therefore,
with the overall performance,

488
00:25:44,538 --> 00:25:46,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): even if
you have strengths,

489
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,778
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): we still
can't seem to see you.

490
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:50,618
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I don't know
who to look at.

491
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:53,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Also you
seem to not understand well

492
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:55,498
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): about teamwork.

493
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:57,258
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It ends up
highlighting your weaknesses,

494
00:25:57,298 --> 00:25:58,818
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): completely
overshadowing the strengths.

495
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,698
HIKARI: Teamwork is essential
no matter what.

496
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:04,498
HIKARI: Our team

497
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:07,018
HIKARI: is a team that includes
trainees from different countries.

498
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:08,658
HIKARI: So, the communication
among each other

499
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:09,698
HIKARI: needs to be reviewed again,

500
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:11,498
HIKARI: and we need to place
more importance on it.

501
00:26:12,378 --> 00:26:13,978
BAMBAM: See you guys on the next round.
Thank you.

502
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:15,138
SUNNY: Thank you.

503
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:16,018
- HIKARI: Thank you.
- EARTH: Thank you.

504
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:16,858
SUNNY: Thank you.

505
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:17,898
SUNNY: Thank you to all the mentors.

506
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,018
TRAINEES: Keep going.

507
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:26,698
BAMBAM: So, let's go to the next group.

508
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:28,098
BAMBAM: Here we go.

509
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:32,458
XIAONIAN: Original groups?

510
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:36,578
HIKARU: To put on a performance,

511
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,858
HIKARU: to appear as

512
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,098
HIKARU: a united team,

513
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:41,738
HIKARU: I think

514
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:43,178
HIKARU: it's not that easy.

515
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:44,938
HIKARU: We have been together for

516
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,778
HIKARU: a couple of years now.

517
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:48,618
HIKARU: Of course, we have

518
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:49,898
HIKARU: trust in each other as a team.

519
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:51,418
RICKY: He's very talented.
Just let him be.

520
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,338
- RICKY: We just do as usual.
- DONGDONG: We are different.

521
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:55,578
RICKY: Advantage? It's very simple.

522
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:58,018
RICKY: We have been training
together for two years.

523
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,698
TRAINEES: Hello, we're RACEBACE.

524
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:05,378
TRAINEES: RACEBACE.

525
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,658
JELLY: Hello everyone.
I am JELLY who joined this show

526
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:11,458
JELLY: and have to become the senior

527
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:12,898
JELLY: both in age and skill.

528
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:17,178
RICKY: Hello, my weight is 65 kilograms,

529
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,858
RICKY: but my stubbornness
is 65.5 kilograms. I'm RICKY.

530
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,458
DONGDONG: Alright, you guys
introduced yourself very briefly.

531
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,938
DONGDONG: Then I will introduce myself
with a short rap.

532
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:32,858
DONGDONG: I used to weigh 90 kilograms
but changed until now.

533
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:35,618
DONGDONG: They said I look like
a celebrity. Maybe it's a compliment.

534
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:37,098
DONGDONG: Shy personality.

535
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,538
DONGDONG: Blushing with shyness.

536
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:40,258
DONGDONG: Let me show you the difference

537
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:42,098
DONGDONG: when I am on stage,
vroom vroom.

538
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,418
BAMBAM: Vroom vroom.

539
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:46,178
PEAT: Vroom vroom.

540
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:48,458
DONGDONG: Hello everyone, I am DONGDONG.

541
00:27:48,738 --> 00:27:49,658
BAMBAM: DONGDONG.

542
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:50,778
TRAINEES: DONGDONG.

543
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:52,698
BAMBAM: From vroom vroom to DONGDONG.

544
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,298
TRAINEES: They're very strong.

545
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:55,778
LIZI: RICKY and DONGDONG

546
00:27:55,938 --> 00:27:57,218
LIZI: participated in another show.

547
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,938
LIZI: They are experienced seniors.

548
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:05,618
RICKY: Actually, the three of us...

549
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:08,378
RICKY: Comparted to those
in the training in China,

550
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:11,298
RICKY: our training period
is quite long.

551
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:12,338
RICKY: So...

552
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:20,258
- RICKY: So...
- DONGDONG: It's hard to have the chance

553
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,378
DONGDONG: to form a group like this.

554
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,698
RICKY: We have been training
together for over two years.

555
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:26,898
RICKY: We understand each other.

556
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,458
RICKY: Of course, our compatibility

557
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,938
RICKY: is above other groups.

558
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:31,898
DONGDONG: This time we hope
to make C-POP

559
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:33,458
DONGDONG: become known,

560
00:28:33,498 --> 00:28:34,738
DONGDONG: because we feel that, in fact,

561
00:28:34,778 --> 00:28:36,578
DONGDONG: in our country,
there's not much space to showcase.

562
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,738
DONGDONG: So, we brought
our debut song to this show.

563
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,298
DONGDONG: It's a chance that allows
everyone to see us more.

564
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,138
WEIZHI: Wow, they are so synchronized.

565
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:47,298
TRAINEES: DONGDONG is
extremely outstanding.

566
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:50,218
TRAINEES: DONGDONG.

567
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:54,658
DAVID: They are holding wireless mics,

568
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:56,698
DAVID: singing live in such harmony.

569
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:58,858
DAVID: Not to mention how united

570
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,098
DAVID: their legs are
with that dance move.

571
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,458
DAVID: They are very skilled.

572
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:05,338
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I can really feel
that they came with genuine sincerity.

573
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:06,258
TIA RAY: Yes, yes, yes.

574
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:08,258
XU MINGHAO:
The performed song is

575
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:09,738
XU MINGHAO:
the pre-debut single, right?

576
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:10,578
JELLY: Yes, yes.

577
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,858
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Then may I ask,

578
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:13,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): since you are
about to debut in 2025,

579
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,938
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): why did you change
the original plan

580
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:19,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and come here
instead? What is the reason?

581
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:21,618
JELLY: Because we are about to face

582
00:31:21,938 --> 00:31:24,018
JELLY: a market with hundreds
and thousands of boy bands.

583
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:26,298
JELLY: If we, who are
among these sixty people,

584
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,938
JELLY: are still unknown,

585
00:31:27,978 --> 00:31:29,218
JELLY: in that case,

586
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,658
JELLY: going outside would probably
make no difference.

587
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:32,978
JELLY: Therefore, we

588
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,898
JELLY: came here to find
an opportunity to prove ourselves.

589
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,298
JELLY: Came here to test ourselves.

590
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:38,858
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And what if...

591
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,338
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): You planned
to debut in 2025.

592
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:42,738
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So what if

593
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:43,938
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): only one of you

594
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:45,978
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): makes his debut here,
while the other two are left out.

595
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:48,418
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): What would you do?

596
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,818
JELLY: What should we do?

597
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:54,618
KEVIN: If two people fell into the water,
who would you save first?

598
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:56,098
KEVIN: It's like this question.

599
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,058
RICKY: It's fate.

600
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:00,298
- JELLY: It's...
- DONGDONG: I think

601
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,578
DONGDONG: no matter the outcome,
it's the best.

602
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,218
DONGDONG: If he debuts here

603
00:32:04,218 --> 00:32:07,378
DONGDONG: and has a good future,

604
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:10,098
DONGDONG: I think we should be
genuinely happy for him.

605
00:32:11,818 --> 00:32:13,458
KEVIN: The success of one person

606
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,578
- KEVIN: is better than the conflict of three people.
- WANXIN: Is better than the conflict of three people.

607
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,418
JELLY: The three of us have
very different personalities.

608
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:23,978
JELLY: Besides, we have been disbanded

609
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:25,818
JELLY: and then reunited.

610
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,818
JELLY: Finally, we became RACEBACE.

611
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,658
JELLY: This owes to
our shared determination.

612
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,258
JELLY: Besides being a boy group,

613
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,818
JELLY: we don't want to do anything else.

614
00:32:34,258 --> 00:32:36,858
DONGDONG: We met for the first time
at the boss' studio.

615
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,418
DONGDONG: At that time, they only saw
a rough draft,

616
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:42,018
DONGDONG: yet still dared to sign
a contract with the company. It's

617
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:43,778
DONGDONG: kind of trust.

618
00:32:43,898 --> 00:32:45,858
RICKY: Because they made
empty promises very convincingly.

619
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:47,258
STAFF: What promises?

620
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:50,618
JELLY: The perfect plan for us

621
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,418
- JELLY: that we would
- DONGDONG: It's our intention

622
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,778
JELLY: be a world-class boy group.

623
00:32:53,778 --> 00:32:56,218
RICKY: They made
a very good presentation.

624
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,818
RICKY: That made me believe.

625
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:58,898
RICKY: Then, I signed
the contract right away.

626
00:32:59,258 --> 00:33:00,738
RICKY: I didn't even read the contract.

627
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,738
RICKY: After joining the company,

628
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:03,778
RICKY: we trained privately.

629
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:08,218
JELLY: We practiced 66 hours a week

630
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:09,258
JELLY: day after day,

631
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:10,858
JELLY: year after year.

632
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,338
JELLY: No activities.

633
00:33:13,378 --> 00:33:14,938
JELLY: No opportunity to perform.

634
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:18,138
JELLY: At that time,
we really had no opportunity.

635
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,898
JELLY: The first opportunity that
came close was probably when

636
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,098
JELLY: we got to participate

637
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:25,858
JELLY: TONY's birthday live.

638
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,658
JELLY: We had an opportunity
to be the dancers for him.

639
00:33:27,698 --> 00:33:29,378
JELLY: But at that time we wore masks.

640
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,418
JELLY: At that time,
we thought to ourselves that

641
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:33,738
JELLY: we really wanted
to stand in the center.

642
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,898
JELLY: We wanted to take off the masks
and let others see our faces.

643
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,218
JELLY: That feeling was very strong.

644
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,258
DONGDONG: Because of that,
actually, the past six years,

645
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:42,578
DONGDONG: the three of us
have dreamed of debuting

646
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,458
DONGDONG: and worked very hard for it.

647
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,298
STAFF: What's the reason for wanting to debut?

648
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:50,418
DONGDONG: Age.

649
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:51,818
JELLY: Yes, he expressed
exactly what I feel.

650
00:33:51,858 --> 00:33:53,258
JELLY: It's my age.

651
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,778
JELLY: Nothing to hide.

652
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:55,978
JELLY: 27.

653
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:58,698
JELLY: Next year I will be 28.

654
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:02,098
JELLY: If not debuting now,
should I wait until I'm old?

655
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,418
JELLY: I can't wait anymore.

656
00:34:04,818 --> 00:34:07,538
DONGDONG: My age as well.
Actually, right now,

657
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:09,298
DONGDONG: I can hardly see

658
00:34:09,618 --> 00:34:11,978
DONGDONG: a 24-year-old
still being a trainee.

659
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:18,298
DONGDONG: Suppose if someone
debuts in this show,

660
00:34:18,538 --> 00:34:20,858
DONGDONG: it might not be a bad thing.

661
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:21,978
DONGDONG: Who knows,

662
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,058
DONGDONG: in a few years,
we might reunite

663
00:34:24,058 --> 00:34:25,418
DONGDONG: as RACEBACE,

664
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:28,098
DONGDONG: and create a new spark
that is different.

665
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,138
JELLY: Hope that the three of us

666
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:31,618
JELLY: would help each other,

667
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:33,778
JELLY: walk on a bright path together,

668
00:34:33,818 --> 00:34:35,538

671
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,810
DONGDONG: Okay.

672
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:45,970
TIA RAY: Because I think he

673
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,730
- TIA RAY: seems to have some charm.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Right.

674
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,930
DONGDONG: I want to introduce
the other two members.

675
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,130

676
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,170

677
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,730

- JELLY: Okay.

680
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,250
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): ZHANG GUODONG,
please go first.

681
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,250
JELLY: Okay.

682
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,130

683
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,090
PRAY 杨浦睿: When he stood up,
it was very cool.

684
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,570
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think just now

685
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,530
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the way you did
the contemporary dance

686
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,130
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is much better
than when you sang.

687
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,810
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Just now,
when you were on stage,

688
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,730
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think
the control of your facial expressions

689
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,690
XU MINGHAO:
might need improvement.

690
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,530
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But during the dance,

691
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,410
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you were fully
immersed in it.

692
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,250
XU MINGHAO:
Every movement of yours

693
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,130
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): harmonized with
the music and body.

694
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,930
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Great job.

695
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,330
JELLY: Okay. Thank you, Mentor.

696
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,850
JEFF: So, you said that

697
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,050
JEFF: you were forced by your mom
to go on a blind date,

698
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,690
JEFF: and you made a deal with...

699
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,130
JEFF: with your mom to debut
within the year.

700
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,330
JEFF: Is it related?

701
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,290
JELLY: Well,

702
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,850
JELLY: I'm at the age
where I should be getting married.

703
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,730
JELLY: My parents

704
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,610
JELLY: often rush me to get married,

705
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,690
JELLY: find a job, something like that,
and then...

706
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,850
BAMBAM: I want to go on a blind date.

707
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,130
- JEFF: You?
- TIA RAY: You?

708
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,170
- JEFF: Why?
- TIA RAY: Why?

709
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,170
BAMBAM: I'm 27 too. I need to marry.

710
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,930
TIA RAY: Okay.

711
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,650
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So,
if you don't debut,

712
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,650
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): do you have
to go back and get married?

713
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,810
JELLY: I don't think so.

714
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,610
JELLY: Because I still want
to pursue my dreams.

715
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,770
TIA RAY: But I don't think
they conflict.

716
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,210
TIA RAY: After getting married,

717
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,210
TIA RAY: you can also perform.

718
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,890
BAMBAM: Yes.

719
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,570
BAMBAM: Be the first idol who

720
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,770
BAMBAM: marry and debut.

721
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,330
BAMBAM: Make a new standard.

722
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,690
JELLY: It's okay. I don't want

723
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,410
- JELLY: to marry that much.
- BAMBAM: Oh, it's okay.

724
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,850
BAMBAM: Alright, DONGDONG,
let's go with your solo stage.

at opposite ends.

00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,730
STAFF: How many years
have you been a trainee?

835
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,690
SHOYA: The first time I

836
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:27,650
SHOYA: became a trainee

837
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,330
SHOYA: was being a trainee
in a Japanese audition show.

838
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,490
SHOYA: After appearing on that show,

839
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,650
SHOYA: I and the trainees
who were eliminated

840
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,250
SHOYA: made a debut together.

841
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,050
SHOYA: Currently still active in Japan

842
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,410
SHOYA: as part of the MAISON B band.

843
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,370
SHOYA: But as for myself,

844
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:45,810
SHOYA: I still can't see hope from our continuous group activities.

845
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,450
SHOYA: Therefore,

846
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,850
SHOYA: participating in CHUANG ASIA S2

847
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,210
SHOYA: participating in CHUANG ASIA S2

848
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,530
SHOYA: I strongly feel that

849
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,810
SHOYA: I don't want to do
anything halfway.

850
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,290
SHOYA: Let's go.

851
00:42:58,810 --> 00:42:59,810
HIKARI: Fight on!

852
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,570
SUNNY: Keep going!

853
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,370
TRAINEES: Do your best!

854
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,410
TRAINEES: Fighting!

855
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,810
WHYLUCAS: I'm most looking forward
to their performance.

856
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,650
WHYLUCAS: Japanese.

857
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:24,930
BAMBAM: Okay.

858
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,970
BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

859
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,250
BAMBAM: Waacking.

860
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,890
TRAINEES: Oh, my God.

861
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,170
TRAINEES: MAISON B.

862
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,050
TRAINEES: Very handsome.

863
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:04,490
BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

864
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:06,010
BAMBAM: Who made the dance?

865
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,570
BAMBAM: The choreography is very good.

866
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,930
BAMBAM: I feel like three of you guys
together combine really well.

867
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:19,650
BAMBAM: So, you know, it's very easy for us
to see each character, all of you guys.

868
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,650
BAMBAM: So, I think that's
a really good sign to source a group.

869
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,170
HIKARU: Thank you so much.

870
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,970
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Sister, you laughed

871
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,930
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): ever since
he walked in.

872
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,410
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I wonder...

873
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,690
ARIEL LIN: I'm not just
looking at faces, okay?

874
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,330
ARIEL LIN: Yes, you.

875
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:37,010
- HIKARU: Yes.
- ARIEL LIN: HIKARU is very eye-catching.

876
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,450
ARIEL LIN: I really want to see
his extra show.

877
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:41,330
JEFF: Okay.

878
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,170
- HIKARU: I would appreciate your guidance.
- BAMBAM: I would appreciate your guidance.

879
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,610
WHYLUCAS: HIKARU, keep going!

880
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,010
The Spring of the Northern Land

881
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:03,610
TRAINEES: Why does he use this song?

882
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,570
JACKSON: An old classic song pops up.

883
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,050
JACKSON: I'm surprised too.

884
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:31,010
JACKSON: Each idol
mostly sings and dances.

885
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,770
JACKSON: He knows
how to use his abilities

886
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,450
JACKSON: to attract more attention.

887
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,810
HIKARU: Thank you for listening.

888
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,130
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): He immersed
himself a lot.

889
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,450
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): He went all in.

890
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,130
SUNNY: Yeah.

891
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:05,850
HIKARI: Very cool.

892
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,610
BAMBAM: Well, I like this.

893
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,330
TIA RAY: You know, I feel like
I'm watching INCEPTION.

894
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,130
TIA RAY: You know like a MATRIX.

895
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:17,130
BAMBAM: Yes, so unexpected.

896
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,010
BAMBAM: First, you don't
really look Japan.

897
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:22,810
BAMBAM: Second, didn't know you're gonna
sing this kind of style.

898
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,170
BAMBAM: Man, you know
how to play this game.

899
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,130
HIKARU: Japanese, all people love Enka.

900
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,850
HIKARU: I listen to Enka a lot.

901
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:38,290
HIKARU: In Japan, I worked
at Senior Care Center to four years.

902
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:42,730
HIKARU: One day, an old lady asked me,

903
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:47,210
HIKARU: "Can you sing
my favorite Enka before I die?"

904
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:52,530
HIKARU: I said,
"No, no, no. Don't say that."

905
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:55,730
HIKARU: "You will live
healthy and long."

906
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:58,330
HIKARU: So, this is that song.

907
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,130
HIKARU: From there,

908
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,650
HIKARU: I started working
a part-time job

909
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:10,250
HIKARU: at a nursing home
in the same neighborhood as my house

910
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,050
HIKARU: in my own hometown.

911
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:15,810
HIKARU: I worked
as a caregiver for seniors.

912
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:18,210
HIKARU: At that time, I was also
active as an idol

913
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,530
HIKARU: of the MAISON B band.

914
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,090
HIKARU: I was also an idol
at the nursing home.

915
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,210
SHOYA: Regardless of our efforts
and expectations,

916
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,450
SHOYA: results do not appear right away.

917
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,530
SHOYA: So, I want to do a part-time job

918
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:34,450
SHOYA: and live my own life as well.

919
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,410
LYU: There are times when

920
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,530
LYU: it's hard to do both
at the same time.

921
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,850
LYU: But because of that,

922
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,650
LYU: now the three of us

923
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,130
LYU: can challenge such shows like this.

924
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,170
LYU: I want to try hard.

925
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,970
LYU: I want to ensure that
the efforts made so far

926
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,490
LYU: aren't wasted.

927
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,450
LYU: This includes so many people
who have always been supporting me.

928
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:57,650
BAMBAM: Oh, I like three of you guys.

929
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,690
BAMBAM: I wanna give everyone an A.

930
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,210
BAMBAM: But I know that's impossible.

931
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,330
BAMBAM: So, let's see.

932
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,010
BAMBAM: Let's go all together. Why not?

933
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,170
BAMBAM: Let's start with HIKARU.

934
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,410
BAMBAM: Go.

935
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:29,730
BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

936
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,290
BAMBAM: A, A, B.

937
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,730
TIA RAY: I'll teach you a Chinese saying
about what he just did.

938
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,970
TIA RAY: "Out of the blue."

939
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:46,330
TIA RAY: But, we are looking forward
to more of your performances.

940
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,650
HIKARU: Thank you so much.

941
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,850
HIKARU: Thank you so much.

942
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,770
YAYA: I feel a little bit bad,

943
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:53,770
YAYA: because ARIEL LIN
wanted to give you an A.

944
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:54,970
- TIA RAY: Really?
- YAYA: Yep.

945
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,090
YAYA: But just from my point of view,

946
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,890
YAYA: I just... I think I want
a little bit more like

947
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,090
YAYA: eye contact, you know.

948
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,490
- YAYA: So...
- JEFF: But you can't.

949
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,770
JEFF: You have a fiancé.

950
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,850
YAYA: Eh, he's not here, isn't he?

951
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,650
TIA RAY: I can, I can.

952
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,890
YAYA: I'm kidding.

953
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,890
YAYA: So, like during the performance,
if I can just get a little bit more.

954
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,410
YAYA: Just a little more.

955
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,370
YAYA: Because you're so charming already,
just standing there on your own, you know.

956
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,130
YAYA: Yep.

957
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,570
HIKARU: Thank you so much.

958
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,490
HIKARU: Absolutely,
the mentor is so beautiful

959
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:33,370
HIKARU: that it excited me.

960
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,770
STAFF: Who are you referring to?

961
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,770
HIKARU: Ms. YAYA.

962
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,450
HIKARU: Ms. YAYA is a wonderful person.

963
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,730
HIKARU: Ms. YAYA is like...

964
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,930
HIKARU: I find it really hard
to look at her.

965
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,890
BAMBAM: Alright, and next is

966
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:52,850
BAMBAM: SHOYA.

967
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,530

971
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,930

gonna sing a Christmas song.

979
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,650
TIA RAY: It's like...

980
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,330
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think this is
the charm of the audition show.

981
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,930
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Some people
have trained hard for many years

982
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,570
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): for this opportunity.

983
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,010

start new dreams

984
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,690

this chance.

992

1000
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:36,650
TRAINEES: We are WHY NOT.

1001
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,410
IVAN: Hello, I'm IVAN
from WHY NOT, dancing.

1002
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,730
TZI XUAN: Hello, I'm TZI XUAN
from WHY NOT, Class A.

1003
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,530
TZI XUAN: And I'm from Sabah, Malaysia.

1004
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:48,930
XIAONIAN: Hello to all Mentors.

1005
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,850
XIAONIAN: I'm XIAONIAN, Nian Hua Doll,
the center of WHY NOT.

1006
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,450
AGUANG: Hello, I'm AGUANG
from WHY NOT, debut.

1007
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,730
AGUANG: I came from the esports stage.

1008
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,810
AGUANG: I switched to the idol stage

1009
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,210
AGUANG: as a beginner level trainee.

1010
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:01,890
AGUANG: Thank you.

1011
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:03,010
TRAINEES: AGUANG.

1012
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,330
AGUANG: We are called WHY NOT

1013
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,610
AGUANG: because all of us don't sing

1014
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,090
AGUANG: or dance well.

1015
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:10,890
AGUANG: But we believe that

1016
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,370
AGUANG: we will do our best
to reach the top.

1017
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,730
BAMBAM: Alright, good luck to you guys.

1018
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:17,210
BAMBAM: This stage is yours.

1019
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,250
TRAINEES: Three, two, one.

1020
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,170
TRAINEES: Keep going.

1021
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,210
AGUANG: We are ready, Mentors.

1022
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,650
AGUANG: Hope you are ready

1023
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,330
AGUANG: for our amazing
performance as well.

1024
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:26,890
AGUANG: Okay?

1025
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:30,410
HU YETAO: An amazing performance.

1026
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:42,626
BAMBAM: Cute.

1027
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:45,106
TRAINEES: AGUANG.

1028
00:54:50,106 --> 00:54:51,826
WUXUN: AGUANG really made it.

1029
00:54:51,866 --> 00:54:54,346
WUXUN: When he joined CHUANG,
he really couldn't do anything at all.

1030
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:57,826
WUXUN: But now he has improved a lot.

1031
00:54:57,866 --> 00:55:00,426
WUXUN: I'm really stunned.
Is this the right word to use?

1032
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:05,506
BAMBAM: You know,
I think the energy is good.

1033
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,226
BAMBAM: I think they're really cute.

1034
00:55:09,626 --> 00:55:10,626
XIAONIAN: Thank you, Mentor.

1035
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:13,026
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): How long have you
practiced this performance?

1036
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:14,586
AGUANG: Less than 20 days.

1037
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:17,386
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think
in a span of 20 days,

1038
00:55:17,386 --> 00:55:18,986
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): from beginner level

1039
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:20,186
XU MINGHAO:
to performing on stage,

1040
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:23,506
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): it must take
a lot of efforts.

1041
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:24,906
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I can really feel it.

1042
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:26,826
TRAINEES: Keep going, AGUANG.

1043
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:28,666
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): AGUANG, you are

1044
00:55:28,706 --> 00:55:31,346
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the gold medalist
of Peacekeeper Elite,

1045
00:55:31,386 --> 00:55:33,026
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Esports
Asian Games Hangzhou.

1046
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,106
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Why did you join

1047
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:37,586
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): CHUANG during
the peak of your career?

1048
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:39,986
AGUANG: The reason I am here,

1049
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:41,866
AGUANG: first of all,
it's because of my love for dancing.

1050
00:55:42,026 --> 00:55:44,186
AGUANG: Because when I was 17 years old,

1051
00:55:44,226 --> 00:55:48,426
AGUANG: due to an uncontrollable event,
I was unable to attend the audition.

1052
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,466
AGUANG: I have loved dancing since then.

1053
00:55:50,826 --> 00:55:53,586
AGUANG: But I hadn't studied for long.

1054
00:55:53,586 --> 00:55:55,826
AGUANG: Mostly, I was only staying
in the practice room,

1055
00:55:56,306 --> 00:55:57,786
AGUANG: learning basic moves.

1056
00:55:57,946 --> 00:55:59,786
AGUANG: Besides dancing,
I also played the guitar.

1057
00:56:01,986 --> 00:56:03,666
AGUANG: My mom liked it a lot, too.

1058
00:56:03,706 --> 00:56:06,986
AGUANG: Like when I played guitar well,
my mom liked to listen.

1059
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:09,746
AGUANG: But there was less than a week.

1060
00:56:09,786 --> 00:56:11,986
AGUANG: Then it was time
for practice sessions,

1061
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:15,346
AGUANG: and during the practice sessions
until the time I got the gold medal.

1062
00:56:15,386 --> 00:56:17,626
AGUANG: Until now,
I finally got the chance

1063
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,306
AGUANG: to learn on this stage.

1064
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:22,706
AGUANG: That's why I want to have
my own growth experience

1065
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,826
AGUANG: on this stage.

1066
00:56:25,146 --> 00:56:27,906
PD: Deep down, about singing and dancing,

1067
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:29,266
PD: do you like it?

1068
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,466
AGUANG: Yes, I think that those

1069
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:31,706
AGUANG: dance moves are really cool.

1070
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:33,986
PD: You think others look cool
when they dance.

1071
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:36,506
PD: So have you tried dancing?

1072
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:44,546
AGUANG: I tried, but everyone said

1073
00:56:44,786 --> 00:56:46,306
AGUANG: If you're itchy, take a shower.

1074
00:56:47,586 --> 00:56:49,906
AGUANG: But learning to sing and dance

1075
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:51,546
AGUANG: makes me feel accomplished.

1076
00:57:03,026 --> 00:57:03,666
STAFF: Go a bit lower.

1077
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:04,746
STAFF: Lower.

1078
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:15,826
STAFF: Don't sing with your throat.

1079
00:57:18,426 --> 00:57:20,346
AGUANG: If I don't use my throat to sing,
what else can I use to produce sound?

1080
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:24,666
AGUANG: All this is due to insufficient
practice. No matter how difficult it is,

1081
00:57:24,706 --> 00:57:26,786
AGUANG: as long as I practice enough,

1082
00:57:26,826 --> 00:57:27,826
AGUANG: everything is possible.

1083
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:30,586
AGUANG: The show is filmed 24 hours
and I'm good at staying late.

1084
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:31,666
AGUANG: If you're tired, take a break.

1085
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:33,066
AGUANG: If you're not tired,
continue practicing

1086
00:57:33,106 --> 00:57:34,106
AGUANG: If you're not skilled,
practice a lot.

1087
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,786
AGUANG: Because I know
my own ability well,

1088
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:42,386
AGUANG: I am just a beginner
who have learned for less than a month.

1089
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,946
AGUANG: Compared to

1090
00:57:44,986 --> 00:57:47,666
AGUANG: the seniors who
have learned for many years,

1091
00:57:47,706 --> 00:57:49,466
AGUANG: I still probably won't catch up.

1092
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:53,586
AGUANG: Just doing my best is enough.

1093
00:57:54,866 --> 00:57:56,386
AGUANG: If an idol becomes

1094
00:57:56,426 --> 00:57:57,586
AGUANG: an eSports athlete,

1095
00:57:57,586 --> 00:57:58,506
AGUANG: the eSports athlete

1096
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:00,946
AGUANG: can also join the idol shows.

1097
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:04,146
TRAINEES: AGUANG, fly forever.

1098
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:07,706
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): AGUANG,
it seems like your team's theme song

1099
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:10,706
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is especially famous,
so can you sing it for us?

1100
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:11,706
AGUANG: Sure.

1101
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:12,666
TRAINEES: Let's go.

1102
00:58:12,946 --> 00:58:14,706
WUXUN: AGUANG.

1103
00:58:14,746 --> 00:58:15,346
WUXUN: Let's go.

1104
00:58:15,386 --> 00:58:17,906
AGUANG: This song is called
"Break the Limit".

1105
00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:19,986
AGUANG: It's our team's theme song.

1106
00:58:20,266 --> 00:58:22,546
AGUANG: It represents

1107
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,226
AGUANG: an era of Chengdu AG.

1108
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:26,786
AGUANG: I dedicate it
to all the seniors here.

1109
00:58:27,946 --> 00:58:29,106
TRAINEES: Go. Go.

1110
00:59:03,346 --> 00:59:07,066
AGUANG: I think I gradually
climbed higher step by step

1111
00:59:07,106 --> 00:59:08,346
AGUANG: until I won a championship.

1112
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:10,106
AGUANG: Now that I'm here,

1113
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,186
AGUANG: and I want to challenge myself,

1114
00:59:12,226 --> 00:59:13,906
AGUANG: because I have started
from scratch.

1115
00:59:13,946 --> 00:59:16,586
AGUANG: But I'm still confident
in my abilities

1116
00:59:16,746 --> 00:59:19,146
AGUANG: I want to write
my own legend again.

1117
00:59:19,186 --> 00:59:20,186
AGUANG: Break my own limits.

1118
00:59:26,906 --> 00:59:28,946
TRAINEES: Let's go.

1119
00:59:29,786 --> 00:59:30,666
AGUANG: Go for it.

1120
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:31,906
YAO ZIHAO: Go for it.

1121
00:59:32,146 --> 00:59:33,266
HIKARU: Go for it.

1122
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:34,146
YAO ZIHAO: Go for it.

1123
00:59:34,186 --> 00:59:37,426
ARIEL LIN: AGUANG, how long have you
spent on eSports?

1124
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,586
AGUANG: About...

1125
00:59:40,746 --> 00:59:41,906
AGUANG: About five years.

1126
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:45,418
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So, I wonder whether
you want to continue engaging

1127
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:52,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): in esports
or aspire to be an idol in the future?

1128
00:59:55,378 --> 00:59:57,698
AGUANG: As for being an idol,

1129
00:59:57,698 --> 01:00:00,658
AGUANG: I think I had better let it be.

1130
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:05,778
AGUANG: No matter how the outcome is,
I'll continue esports with my abilities.

1131
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:08,338
AGUANG: And I will lead
the team to success.

1132
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,058
TRAINEES: AGUANG.

1133
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:17,218
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think
you have reached the peak

1134
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:19,018
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): of your career,

1135
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:20,018
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and joined us here.

1136
01:00:20,058 --> 01:00:22,138
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Maybe
the mentors here

1137
01:00:22,178 --> 01:00:24,538
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): might not be
as brave as you.

1138
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,170
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But now

1139
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,690
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): There is no way
to judge you

1140
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,090
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): with standards
for a boy group.

1141
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:36,730
BAMBAM: Alright, then I think
we already decide.

1142
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:39,570
BAMBAM: So, AGUANG.

1143
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,490
BAMBAM: If you're ready,
then one, two, three.

1144
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,290
BAMBAM: Okay, it also F, F, F.

1145
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:49,010
- AGUANG: Thank you, Mentor.
- BAMBAM: Yeah, thank you so much.

1146
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,450
- AGUANG: Thank you.
- TRAINEES: Keep going.

1147
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:51,730
WEIZHI: Keep going.

1148
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,850
TRAINEES: Keep going.

1149
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,410
BAMBAM: And the next one is

1150
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,890
BAMBAM: TZI XUAN, XIAONIAN, and IVAN.

1151
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:00,010
BAMBAM: It's a F.

1152
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:04,330
BAMBAM: But you know,
I want you guys to understand.

1153
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,970
BAMBAM: You know, you guys
really practiced not too long.

1154
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,210
BAMBAM: Everyone needs time.

1155
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:10,130
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): We are not denying

1156
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,090
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your dreams.

1157
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:13,370
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's just that
in today's performance,

1158
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,690
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): as for the standards

1159
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,890
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): for a boy group,

1160
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,170
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): this is the best
result we can provide.

1161
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:22,770
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you
truly love this stage,

1162
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,930
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I hope
in the future you will

1163
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,850
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): gradually develop
step by step,

1164
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,370
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and keep improving.
- AGUANG: Right.

1165
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,530
AGUANG: Thank you, Mentor.

1166
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:31,650
TRAINEES: That's good.

1167
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,970
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): To be honest,
when I want to play

1168
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,570
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Peacekeeper Elite,
don't forget to invite me.

1169
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,170
AGUANG: No problem, sure.

1170
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,450
AGUANG: I think the ones
in Class F, C, and B

1171
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:41,890
AGUANG: have the opportunity to improve.

1172
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,810
AGUANG: The strongest Class F
in the history.

1173
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:45,690
AGUANG: This is the beginning.

1174
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,330
BAMBAM: For the GRAND AUDITION,
the last team,

1175
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:52,370
BAMBAM: HEART STEALERS.

1176
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:00,890
TRAINEES: You know, what's up, boys?

1177
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:03,410
NINJA: WHYLUCAS.

1178
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,810

Ladies and gentlemen.

1179
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,610
- WHYLUCAS: We are...

1182
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,610
- REXY/PRAY: HEART STEALERS.

1183

01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:16,650

WUXUN: Excellent.

1192
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,530
YUCHEN: Awesome.

1193
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:34,650
REXY: Hello everyone.

1194
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:37,610
REXY: I am REXY HUANG YIXIANG
from HEART STEALERS.

1195
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:41,090
WHYLUCAS: Hello everyone.
I am WHYLUCAS from HEART STEALERS.

1196
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:42,650
WHYLUCAS: Why LUCAS?

1197
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,850
BAMBAM: You guys are the ending.

1198
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,810
BAMBAM: So, you all have to be
freaking good, okay?

1199
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:49,690
WHYLUCAS: We're gonna kill it.

1200
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:50,450
WHYLUCAS: Let's go.

1201
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,890
BAMBAM: Oh, that's perfect for ending.

1202
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:28,930
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1203
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:32,450
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1204
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,570
BAMBAM: PRAY,

1205
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,010
- PRAY: Yes.
- BAMBAM: REXY,

1206
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,450
BAMBAM: and WHYLUCAS.

1207
01:04:37,970 --> 01:04:41,250
BAMBAM: Let's see WHYLUCAS's solo.

1208
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,210
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1209
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,050
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS performs the finale.

1210
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,250
TRAINEES: Best finale.

1211
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,010
BAMBAM: WHYLUCAS, such a weird name,

1212
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:51,850
BAMBAM: but I like it.

1213
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,050
WHYLUCAS: Maybe because
I'm the only one from Singapore.

1214
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:00,170
WHYLUCAS: Maybe because

1215
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:01,810
WHYLUCAS: I am from
National University of Singapore,

1216
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,770
WHYLUCAS: as a sophomore
in Faculty of Business Administration.

1217
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,130
WHYLUCAS: Maybe because

1218
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,130
WHYLUCAS: I'm not very good at dancing.

1219
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,090
WHYLUCAS: But maybe because
I sing quite well.

1220
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:13,290
WHYLUCAS: Maybe as I play guitar well.

1221
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,770
WHYLUCAS: I used to have
some sponsored performances,

1222
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:27,450
WHYLUCAS: and make some pieces of music.

1223
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,210
WHYLUCAS: A few years ago, there was
nothing new in my circle at all.

1224
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,730
WHYLUCAS: So, I was quite exhausted.

1225
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,410
WHYLUCAS: I came to this show

1226
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:39,010
WHYLUCAS: to meet people and learn new things

1227
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,330
WHYLUCAS: For instance, I would get
to learn dancing every day.

1228
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:43,610
WHYLUCAS: Dance every day
for 7-10 hours.

1229
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:47,330
WHYLUCAS: I came here to learn
how to be an idol

1230
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,530
WHYLUCAS: So I am very excited.

1231
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,770
BAMBAM: Oh la.

1232
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,570
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1233
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,770
TRAINEES: The guy with the biggest
muscles on the show.

1234
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:07,010
TRAINEES: Big muscles.

1235
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,850
WANXIN: Those muscles must be
from push-ups.

1236
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,690
GUANMING: Wow, who wouldn't be envious?

1237
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:12,770
SHEN: Do you have them?

1238
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:15,490
GUANMING: If I had them,
why would I wear a shirt like this?

1239
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:19,730
BAMBAM: Oh.

1240
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:21,530
JEFF: He can play.

1241
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:22,490
TIA RAY: Right.

1242
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:23,170
JEFF: He can play.

1243
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,170
BAMBAM: Sexy.

1244
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,330
WHYLUCAS: Let's go.

1245
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:31,250
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1246
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:32,450
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1247
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,450
TRAINEES: Wow, Latin music.

1248
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,730
TIA RAY: Okay.

1249
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,810
WHYLUCAS: Everybody claps.

1250
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,450
WHYLUCAS: Thank you.

1251
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,450
NINJA: JOHN MAYER of Singapore.

1252
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:52,170
WHYLUCAS: Okay.

1253
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:54,810
YAYA: More.

1254
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,970
- YAYA: More. More.
- TIA RAY: More. More.

1255
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,170
TIA RAY: I want more.

1256
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:00,170
WHYLUCAS: You more? More originals?

1257
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:16,690
WHYLUCAS: Sorry.

1258
01:08:40,882 --> 01:08:42,722
MYST: With that kind of atmosphere
he creates,

1259
01:08:42,762 --> 01:08:45,642
MYST: it makes people
want to support him.

1260
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,082
WHYLUCAS: Thank you.

1261
01:08:54,122 --> 01:08:55,122
TADALEE: Awesome.

1262
01:08:55,562 --> 01:08:57,962
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Did you compose
the song just now yourself?

1263
01:08:58,002 --> 01:08:59,322
WHYLUCAS: Yes, I wrote
both songs myself.

1264
01:08:59,362 --> 01:09:01,402
WHYLUCAS: I composed and produced
everything myself.

1265
01:09:01,442 --> 01:09:05,962
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think you're
talented as you can create your own music.

1266
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:09,082
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you
have to join a group,

1267
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:12,122
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): it might overshadow
some of your shine.

1268
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,442
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): What do you
think about this?

1269
01:09:13,602 --> 01:09:15,762
WHYLUCAS: I think that
it might be a challenge that...

1270
01:09:15,802 --> 01:09:17,642
WHYLUCAS: However, I might be
overshadowed a bit,

1271
01:09:18,122 --> 01:09:20,802
WHYLUCAS: I feel like the person
who's the center is better than me

1272
01:09:20,842 --> 01:09:22,242
WHYLUCAS: in singing,
performing and dancing.

1273
01:09:22,282 --> 01:09:23,962
WHYLUCAS: Then, prop them,
but I really got to work.

1274
01:09:24,002 --> 01:09:27,802
WHYLUCAS: Because to me, I feel that
I can always achieve something as long as I put endeavor.

1275
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:28,642
WHYLUCAS: That's why I'm here.

1276
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:32,922
WHYLUCAS: Thank you, Mentor,
for even thinking about that for me.

1277
01:09:35,162 --> 01:09:38,162
TIA RAY: You know, like he's good
at guitar and then...

1278
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:39,322
BAMBAM: You guys...

1279
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:40,122
BAMBAM: it's hard, huh?

1280
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:41,282
TIA RAY: It's hard.

1281
01:09:41,282 --> 01:09:41,682
BAMBAM: Yeah.

1282
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:47,762
TADALEE: Very talented.

1283
01:09:57,242 --> 01:09:58,602
TRAINEES: He's starting to blush.

1284
01:09:59,602 --> 01:10:01,042
GORDON: WHYLUCAS, where is the toilet?

1285
01:10:01,082 --> 01:10:02,642
- TRAINEES: Where is the toilet?
- TRAINEES: Where's the toilet, LUCAS?

1286
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,162
BAMBAM: Okay, alright,
I think we have decided.

1287
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:11,962
BAMBAM: PRAY, B B B.

1288
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:14,802
BAMBAM: REXY, triple Cs.

1289
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,402
BAMBAM: WHYLUCAS,

1290
01:10:17,562 --> 01:10:19,002
BAMBAM: I know why it's WHYLUCAS now.

1291
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:19,922
WHYLUCAS: Why?

1292
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,762
BAMBAM: Because, dude, you're good, man.

1293
01:10:21,882 --> 01:10:22,482
WHYLUCAS: Thank you. Thank you.

1294
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:23,322
BAMBAM: Sexy.

1295
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:23,802
WHYLUCAS: Thank you.

1296
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:25,882
BAMBAM: You've got all the charm
and charisma. That's good.

1297
01:10:26,082 --> 01:10:27,442
BAMBAM: So, WHYLUCAS.

1298
01:10:28,362 --> 01:10:29,882
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

1299
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:30,882
BAMBAM: Let's go.

1300
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:34,282
BAMBAM: B A A.

1301
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:41,842
WUXUN: The last card.

1302
01:10:41,882 --> 01:10:43,562
- NINJA: Great, WHYLUCAS.
- TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1303
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:44,570
TIA RAY: WHYLUCAS,

1304
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:47,010
TIA RAY: When you do solo
without the instrument,

1305
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,050
TIA RAY: I still feel
you're a little weak.

1306
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:51,610
TIA RAY: and you're trying to catch
the audience's attention

1307
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:53,610
- TIA RAY: to cover the weakness.
- WHYLUCAS: I got you.

1308
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:55,650
TIA RAY: So, that's the part I can tell.

1309
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:57,770
TIA RAY: And then practice more singing.

1310
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:58,690
WHYLUCAS: Yes, Mentor.

1311
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:01,090
BAMBAM: You guys are the last team
for the GRAND AUDITION.

1312
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,970
BAMBAM: So, we got the last A.

1313
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,410
BAMBAM: And Congratulations, guys.

1314
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:05,450
WHYLUCAS: Thank you, everybody.

1315
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,050
WHYLUCAS: I've always felt that

1316
01:11:08,050 --> 01:11:10,450
WHYLUCAS: I'm like Alex,
the lion in MADAGASCAR.

1317
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:13,930
WHYLUCAS: We all want to perform
on a big stage.

1318
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:17,570
WHYLUCAS: I'm very happy that today
I've taken another step toward that goal.

1319
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:19,290
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1320
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,970
TRAINEES: WHYLUCAS.

1321
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,130
