199
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:10,370
BAMBAM: All right, cool.

200
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,903
BAMBAM: Hi, guys.
I'm CHUANG ASIA S2 producer, BAMBAM.

201
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:15,437
BAMBAM: And you know,
nice to see you guys here.

202
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,770
BAMBAM: Let's have some fun, all right?

203
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:18,570
(HOST) BAM: BAMBAM.

204
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:20,337
JEFF: Hey, yo.

205
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:21,737
JEFF: This is me, JEFF.

206
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:26,403
TIA RAY: What's up? This is your TIA RAY.

207
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:29,903
YAYA: Hi, everyone.

208
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:30,837
YAYA: It's YAYA.

209
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,890
(HOST) BAM: Yes, thank you, guys.

210
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,570
(HOST) BAM: So you guys have been
with them since day one.

211
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,303
BAMBAM: Absolutely.

212
00:16:38,303 --> 00:16:39,337
(HOST) BAM: Day one. I'm sure

213
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:41,770
(HOST) BAM: you've seen
a lot of progress in their journey.

214
00:16:42,203 --> 00:16:43,437
(HOST) BAM: They have been through

215
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,203
- (HOST) BAM: so, so many experiences.
- BAMBAM: Absolutely.

216
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:47,137
- BAMBAM: Yeah.
- (HOST) BAM: Absolutely.

217
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:50,103
(HOST) BAM: And as mentors,
you must have had a lot to share.

218
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:53,137
(HOST) BAM: But if you have to
sum it up in one word...

219
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,937
BAMBAM: One word?

220
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:55,437
(HOST) BAM: I know it's kind of hard.

221
00:16:55,437 --> 00:16:57,337
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- (HOST) BAM: You got to sum it up in one word.

222
00:16:57,337 --> 00:16:59,937
(HOST) BAM: What would you
describe the trainees?

223
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:03,137
BAMBAM: One word for all the trainees.

224
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:06,337
BAMBAM: I think
it's gonna be "challenge" for me.

225
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:06,903
(HOST) BAM: Challenge.

226
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:08,643
BAMBAM: Yeah, because you know, every...

227
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:09,737
BAMBAM: you know, process...

228
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,817
BAMBAM: You know, the journey for them,

229
00:17:11,817 --> 00:17:13,277
BAMBAM: for CHUANG ASIA S2,

230
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,603
BAMBAM: is all challenging.

231
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:16,897
BAMBAM: You know, facing new experience

232
00:17:16,897 --> 00:17:18,537
BAMBAM: and the new test all the time.

233
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,037
BAMBAM: So I think,

234
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,647
BAMBAM: challenge is the perfect word

235
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:21,903
BAMBAM: for... you know, to describe them.

236
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:25,047
(HOST) BAM: I like that word "challenge"
from producer BAMBAM. JEFF?

237
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:28,170
JEFF: I think it would be "unexpected."

238
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,337
JEFF: Because, you know,

239
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:33,637
JEFF: everything is unexpected
in the show when you do

240
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,603
JEFF: a performance, when you grow.

241
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,337
JEFF: There's a challenge, and also

242
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,956
JEFF: everything is so unexpected.

243
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:40,737
(HOST) BAM: I like that. Unexpected.

244
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:41,337
(HOST) BAM: TIA RAY?

245
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:42,770
TIA RAY: Mine is passion.

246
00:17:43,203 --> 00:17:44,537
- (HOST) BAM: Passion?
- TIA RAY: yes.

247
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:45,949
TIA RAY: Because without passion and love,

248
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:48,970
TIA RAY: nothing means... you know,

249
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,303
TIA RAY: nothing is meaningful.

250
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,737
TIA RAY: So I think everyone
on the stage and also here,

251
00:17:55,137 --> 00:17:56,903
TIA RAY: and also in front
of the camera...

252
00:17:56,903 --> 00:17:58,637
TIA RAY: I think everybody...
because of the passion,

253
00:17:58,637 --> 00:18:01,237
TIA RAY: because you have love,
then we all get together.

254
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,137
- TIA RAY: The energy is very important.
- (HOST) BAM: Right.

255
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:04,103
TIA RAY: So yes.

256
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,170
(HOST) BAM: I like that. Passion.

257
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,469
TIA RAY: Passion.

258
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,170
(HOST) BAM: YAYA?

259
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,320
YAYA: I think for me,
it would be teamwork.

260
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,137
- YAYA: They all came in as individuals.
- (HOST) BAM: Teamwork.

261
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:16,237
YAYA: But I think they're going out
of this experience as a whole.

262
00:18:16,537 --> 00:18:18,003
YAYA: They've worked together so hard.

263
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,773
YAYA: And honestly, the friendship here

264
00:18:19,773 --> 00:18:21,603
YAYA: is beyond anything I expected.

265
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,737
(HOST) BAM: I love that. Wow.

266
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:23,437
(HOST) BAM: That's amazing.

267
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,837
(HOST) BAM: Every journey
always has struggles.

268
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:27,170
(HOST) BAM: But with great supporters,

269
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,445
(HOST) BAM: they've become stronger

270
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:30,370
(HOST) BAM: with every step they take.

271
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,537
(HOST) BAM: That pretty much sums up
what this season has been like. Now,

272
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:34,637
(HOST) BAM: can each of you

273
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,637
(HOST) BAM: share words
of encouragement for trainees

274
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,170
(HOST) BAM: before their final stage

275
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,970
(HOST) BAM: performance coming real soon?

276
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,137
(HOST) BAM: Anything
you'd like to say to them?

277
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:45,037
BAMBAM: You know, I want to say,

278
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,037
BAMBAM: thank you so much for... you know.

279
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,853
BAMBAM: Everyone's hard work is made to be

280
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:51,770
BAMBAM: where you are right now.

281
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,370
BAMBAM: And you see a lot of people

282
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,970
BAMBAM: loving you guys and...

283
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,170
BAMBAM: you know,
I hope the best for everyone.

284
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,703
BAMBAM: Don't care about the result.

285
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:00,170
BAMBAM: Just enjoy the journey.

286
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,337
BAMBAM: Enjoy the process. And, yeah.

287
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:05,137
BAMBAM: I hope everyone of you guys
have a good time today.

288
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:06,803
(HOST) BAM: thank you, BAMBAM. JEFF?

289
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:11,303
JEFF: I think, whether...
This is the last day. So whether

290
00:19:11,303 --> 00:19:14,137
JEFF: good or bad,
you're coming home to your family.

291
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:17,770
JEFF: So today,
just give your best performance.

292
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,203
JEFF: Give your best self.

293
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,703
JEFF: And I think you can do it.

294
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,744
JEFF: I know you for so long now.

295
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:24,729
JEFF: For three or four months now.

296
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,427
(HOST) BAM: Absolutely.
JEFF: And I know you can do it.

297
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,675
JEFF: So give your best and keep going.

298
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,323
(HOST) BAM: Keep it up. TIA RAY?

299
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:33,861
TIA RAY: Yes.

300
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:36,593
TIA RAY: And this is the last day
on this stage

301
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,461
TIA RAY: for CHUANG ASIA S2, right?

302
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:43,661
TIA RAY: But it's your new day
for the future.

303
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:47,027
TIA RAY: So I hope everyone
can have a new beginning

304
00:19:47,027 --> 00:19:48,727
TIA RAY: starting from today.

305
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:50,827
TIA RAY: And on the new journey,

306
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:52,727
TIA RAY: you may
encounter many challenges.

307
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,861
TIA RAY: But because of the past 300 days,

308
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:56,661
TIA RAY: you have become
the best version of yourselves.

309
00:19:56,661 --> 00:19:59,094
TIA RAY: So you will be more confident
on the road ahead.

310
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,127
TIA RAY: And you have fans supporting you.

311
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,694
TIA RAY: I hope you keep working hard
on your music

312
00:20:02,694 --> 00:20:04,694

BAMBAM: I didn't meet them
for like a month.

2168
01:54:07,403 --> 01:54:08,785

01:54:08,785 --> 01:54:11,269
BAMBAM: you can see
how much they improved,

2170
01:54:12,433 --> 01:54:15,703
BAMBAM: how much they
are ready to go out to the world

2171
01:54:15,703 --> 01:54:18,103
BAMBAM: to show their talent
and their shining.

2172
01:54:18,921 --> 01:54:22,369

BAMBAM: we can debut
like three groups of them.

2178
01:54:34,523 --> 01:54:35,278
(HOST) BAM: I know, right.

2179
01:54:35,633 --> 01:54:37,369
BAMBAM: But you know, like, unfortunately,

2180
01:54:37,369 --> 01:54:40,862

like, seven of them only, so.

it doesn't matter, you know.

2186

2275
02:00:14,882 --> 02:00:16,682

2284
02:00:35,715 --> 02:00:36,631
YAYA: It is, yes.

2285
02:00:36,631 --> 02:00:38,915

your personal journey

2286
02:00:40,282 --> 02:00:41,115

(HOST) BAM: Yeah, on the show,

2288
02:00:42,264 --> 02:00:47,282

that i've ever done in the entertainment business.

2289

from this experience.

(HOST) BAM: Really!

2291
02:00:51,715 --> 02:00:53,002

2292
02:00:53,002 --> 02:00:54,380
(HOST) BAM: I thought
you were here to give.

2293
02:00:54,794 --> 02:00:58,415
YAYA: Well, I think it's
a give and take. Because, honestly,

2294
02:00:58,748 --> 02:01:01,048
YAYA: when we first met all the trainees,

2295
02:01:01,715 --> 02:01:03,815
YAYA: you could see
that they were super nervous

2296
02:01:03,815 --> 02:01:08,482
YAYA: and they were not a hundred percent
comfortable in like themselves.

2297
02:01:08,482 --> 02:01:08,932
(HOST) BAM: Right.

2298
02:01:08,932 --> 02:01:11,015
YAYA: And I saw how much they grew

2299
02:01:11,148 --> 02:01:15,748
YAYA: and it's such an inspiration.
I've been very very inspired.

2300
02:01:16,148 --> 02:01:17,148
YAYA: Never stop growing.

2301
02:01:17,148 --> 02:01:19,682

2407
02:07:57,378 --> 02:07:57,615
(HOST) BAM: Right.

2408
02:07:57,715 --> 02:08:03,548
TIA RAY: And then me is like...
I also learned a lot from the trainees, yes.

2409
02:08:03,548 --> 02:08:06,415
TIA RAY: Because there
was one time that we...

2410
02:08:06,415 --> 02:08:10,645
TIA RAY: they were choosing
from opportunities, friendship...

2411
02:08:10,645 --> 02:08:11,082
(HOST) BAM: Right.

2412
02:08:11,336 --> 02:08:12,106
TIA RAY: And...

2413
02:08:12,106 --> 02:08:12,704
(HOST) BAM: I was there.

2414
02:08:12,704 --> 02:08:13,215
TIA RAY: Something else, right.

2415
02:08:13,215 --> 02:08:14,250
(HOST) BAM: Yeah, right.

2416
02:08:14,250 --> 02:08:15,400

2417
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,282
(HOST) BAM: Growth, right?

2418
02:08:16,282 --> 02:08:16,715

2419
02:08:16,715 --> 02:08:17,848
(HOST) BAM: Growth, friendship,

2420
02:08:17,848 --> 02:08:18,538
(HOST) BAM: opportunities.

2421
02:08:18,538 --> 02:08:20,515
TIA RAY: Opportunities,
and then they chose friendship.

2422
02:08:20,515 --> 02:08:21,482
(HOST) BAM: A lot of them.

2423
02:08:21,482 --> 02:08:24,648
TIA RAY: a lot of them,
like almost most of them, right.

2424
02:08:24,815 --> 02:08:28,815
TIA RAY: So that moment caught
my attention and also

2425
02:08:28,815 --> 02:08:32,415
TIA RAY: I was touched
by how everybody loved each other

2426
02:08:32,415 --> 02:08:35,015
TIA RAY: and care for each other,
care about each other

2427
02:08:35,015 --> 02:08:40,948
TIA RAY: and I think
being an artist on the stage,

2428
02:08:41,015 --> 02:08:46,415
TIA RAY: especially with like
this kind of idol and teamwork.

2429
02:08:46,415 --> 02:08:49,882
TIA RAY: So I think friendship
and caring are very important.

2430
02:08:50,048 --> 02:08:53,948
TIA RAY: So there's one word
I want to give to everybody on the stage.

2431
02:08:54,648 --> 02:08:56,882
TIA RAY: It's also here, whatever

2432
02:08:56,882 --> 02:09:01,915

I want you guys to be more caring in life,

2433
02:09:02,448 --> 02:09:04,458

2434
02:09:04,650 --> 02:09:09,015
TIA RAY: it just respect more
and care more.

2435
02:09:09,515 --> 02:09:10,035
TIA RAY: Because...

2436
02:09:10,666 --> 02:09:11,882
(HOST) BAM: The world needs that, right.

2437
02:09:11,882 --> 02:09:12,615
TIA RAY: The world needs that

2438
02:09:12,615 --> 02:09:17,082
TIA RAY: and life is short, so we
have to be caring for each other

2439
02:09:17,148 --> 02:09:18,715
TIA RAY: and caring for your dream,

2440
02:09:19,082 --> 02:09:23,082

and your soul, so I think, yeah.

2442
02:09:24,148 --> 02:09:25,315

2446
02:09:33,048 --> 02:09:34,348

2447
02:09:34,348 --> 02:09:35,498

2448
02:09:35,498 --> 02:09:35,915

2451
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:43,730

2452
02:09:43,730 --> 02:09:44,015

I just hadn't pursued it

02:32:59,613 --> 02:33:01,453
HU YETAO: on the debut team position.

2951
02:33:01,973 --> 02:33:03,013
HU YETAO: But this year,

2952
02:33:03,213 --> 02:33:05,493
HU YETAO: I'm not just wanting
to be in the debut group,

2953
02:33:05,493 --> 02:33:07,373
HU YETAO: I also want to be
in the center position.

2954
02:33:07,813 --> 02:33:09,693
BAMBAM: No. 1 is

2955
02:33:09,893 --> 02:33:11,533
BAMBAM: HU YETAO!

2956
02:33:16,613 --> 02:33:18,693
DORN: My name is DORN.

2957
02:33:20,573 --> 02:33:22,253
DORN: I've been dancing
for more than 10 years.

2958
02:33:23,773 --> 02:33:25,493
DORN: I love to support my friends.

2959
02:33:25,493 --> 02:33:27,493
DORN: Whenever I turn,
I find the friends who do things together.

2960
02:33:27,493 --> 02:33:29,493
DORN: And there will be support.

2961
02:33:29,493 --> 02:33:31,533
DORN: We are a flame for each other.

2962
02:33:31,533 --> 02:33:33,293
DORN: So it will turn into
a huge shining fire.

2963
02:33:33,373 --> 02:33:34,213
DORN: I am a dancer.

2964
02:33:34,213 --> 02:33:36,173
DORN: In the end, we'll only
be a shadow of the artists.

2965
02:33:36,173 --> 02:33:38,013
DORN: So I have to find my own flame.

2966
02:33:38,013 --> 02:33:39,773
DORN: No. 3 is

2967
02:33:39,773 --> 02:33:40,493
BAMBAM: DORN!

2968
02:33:42,573 --> 02:33:43,653
DORN: Thank you

2969
02:33:43,653 --> 02:33:47,053
DORN: for letting me step into the light.

2970
02:33:47,053 --> 02:33:48,413
PEANUT: No.1.

2971
02:33:49,413 --> 02:33:51,533
DORN: I want to thank CHUANG

2972
02:33:51,533 --> 02:33:53,973
DORN: for being the spotlight
that lets people see me.

2973
02:35:02,243 --> 02:35:05,390
(See the World, Find Yourself)

2974
02:35:07,867 --> 02:35:10,800
MENG MEIQI: I am the first graduate
of the CHUANG family, MENG MEIQI.

2975
02:35:12,733 --> 02:35:15,267
MENG MEIQI: 7 years ago,
I was just like you,

2976
02:35:15,267 --> 02:35:18,100
MENG MEIQI: standing on
this exciting and glorious stage.

2977
02:35:18,533 --> 02:35:20,067
MENG MEIQI: So seeing you today

2978
02:35:20,200 --> 02:35:22,867
MENG MEIQI: actually made me
think of my past self.

2979
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:26,733
MENG MEIQI: Congratulations
on completing this journey.

2980
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:31,333
MENG MEIQI: The graduation ceremony
is not the end for you,

2981
02:35:31,333 --> 02:35:33,033
MENG MEIQI: but a new beginning.

2982
02:35:33,833 --> 02:35:37,133
MENG MEIQI: There may be many difficulties
waiting for you in the future.

2983
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:40,200
MENG MEIQI: But I hope you can look back

2984
02:35:40,300 --> 02:35:43,500
MENG MEIQI: at the self
who stood on the stage out of passion.

2985
02:35:44,833 --> 02:35:45,833
MENG MEIQI: Overturn in adversity,

2986
02:35:45,833 --> 02:35:46,833
MENG MEIQI: and thrive towards the sun.

2987
02:35:47,033 --> 02:35:49,400
MENG MEIQI: Juniors,
congratulations on your graduation!

2988
02:35:54,067 --> 02:35:57,067
REN HAO: Hello everyone, I am REN HAO,
a graduate of CHUANG 2019,

2989
02:35:57,733 --> 02:36:01,500
REN HAO: also the electric boy.

2990
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:06,933
REN HAO: Today is not just the day
for you guys to debut and form a group.

2991
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,500
REN HAO: There's something more important.

2992
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:13,067
REN HAO: Today is the 6th anniversary
of the broadcast of CHUANG 2019.

2993
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,600
REN HAO: On this special day,

2994
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:18,267
REN HAO: I hope you all
can carry forward the spirit

2995
02:36:18,267 --> 02:36:20,200
REN HAO: of CHUANG. Cheer up!

2996
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:23,933
REN HAO: Speaking of CHUANG,

2997
02:36:24,933 --> 02:36:26,233
REN HAO: we have something in common.

2998
02:36:26,733 --> 02:36:29,267
REN HAO: When I graduated,
it was also by the seaside.

2999
02:36:29,833 --> 02:36:33,433
REN HAO: It reminds me
of backpacks, folding stools,

3000
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:36,400
REN HAO: Starlight Island,

3001
02:36:36,400 --> 02:36:38,000
REN HAO: and something
you haven't experienced yet.

3002
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,633
REN HAO: A shared dorm for 101 people.

3003
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:43,733
REN HAO: Walking from my bed
to the end of the dorm

3004
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:45,400
REN HAO: takes more than a minute.

3005
02:36:45,867 --> 02:36:47,667
REN HAO: We lived in such an atmosphere

3006
02:36:48,267 --> 02:36:50,733
REN HAO: for more than
100 days and nights.

3007
02:36:52,633 --> 02:36:53,900
REN HAO: In this journey,

3008
02:36:54,467 --> 02:36:55,833
REN HAO: we are all participants.

3009
02:36:56,433 --> 02:36:59,000
REN HAO: Everyone comes here
with a pure heart.

3010
02:37:00,733 --> 02:37:01,867
REN HAO: The dreams we once chased

3011
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:04,833
REN HAO: and the pain that we got
are the limited memories of 2019.

3012
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:09,000
REN HAO: I hope you all
live up to your youth

3013
02:37:09,800 --> 02:37:10,700
REN HAO: and not let yourself down.

3014
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:12,467
REN HAO: Keep going!

3015
02:37:16,667 --> 02:37:19,733
ZHAO YUE: It's been 5 years,
and I have returned to my alma mater.

3016
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:23,433
ZHAO YUE: I am very happy today

3017
02:37:23,433 --> 02:37:26,467
ZHAO YUE: I can participate in
your grand debut night.

3018
02:37:26,733 --> 02:37:28,467
ZHAO YUE: I saw you all working so hard

3019
02:37:28,467 --> 02:37:30,133
ZHAO YUE: and I was deeply moved.

3020
02:37:30,133 --> 02:37:31,900
ZHAO YUE: I thought of my younger self.

3021
02:37:32,067 --> 02:37:35,400
ZHAO YUE: I remember stepping into
the dreamlike world for the first time,

3022
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,433
ZHAO YUE: I was on a little train,

3023
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:40,100
ZHAO YUE: slowly heading
towards a fairy-tale castle.

3024
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,600
ZHAO YUE: I remember it was
the third rankings announcement,

3025
02:37:43,833 --> 02:37:45,333
ZHAO YUE: I saw my poster

3026
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:48,200
ZHAO YUE: falling
from the high walls of the castle.

3027
02:37:49,867 --> 02:37:50,633
ZHAO YUE: From that moment on,

3028
02:37:50,633 --> 02:37:53,833
ZHAO YUE: it seemed like
fate turned a new page for me.

3029
02:37:54,333 --> 02:37:57,633
ZHAO YUE: And I seemed to become

3030
02:37:57,667 --> 02:37:59,700
ZHAO YUE: the protagonist
in a fairy tale tested by fate.

3031
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,000
ZHAO YUE: But the protagonists
in fairy tales are all brave.

3032
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:07,667
ZHAO YUE: But I said "I don't dare"
a total of 27 times on the show.

3033
02:38:10,178 --> 02:38:11,700
ZHAO YUE: On this path...

3034
02:38:11,700 --> 02:38:13,733
ZHAO YUE: On this path
illuminated by dreams,

3035
02:38:13,867 --> 02:38:16,067
ZHAO YUE: I've been
moving forward trembling.

3036
02:38:16,833 --> 02:38:20,067
ZHAO YUE: But one day I realized

3037
02:38:20,300 --> 02:38:22,200
ZHAO YUE: "I dare"

3038
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:25,500
ZHAO YUE: can also illuminate
the brilliance in my heart.

3039
02:38:26,433 --> 02:38:28,533
ZHAO YUE: And now, like you all,

3040
02:38:29,933 --> 02:38:34,333
ZHAO YUE: I am still bravely writing
new chapters of the future.

3041
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:37,600
MIKA: Hello everyone.

3042
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:41,165
MIKA: Hello, I am MIKA.

3043
02:38:42,221 --> 02:38:45,067
MIKA: I have a good friend
standing over there.

3044
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:47,500
MIKA: HU YETAO.

3045
02:38:48,133 --> 02:38:51,000
MIKA: Do you remember
four years ago at Haihua Island?

3046
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:53,133
HU YETAO: I will never forget it.

3047
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:55,133
HU YETAO: Never.

3048
02:38:56,100 --> 02:38:57,300
MIKA: Cheer up!

3049
02:38:58,867 --> 02:39:00,233
MIKA: When you think about Hawaii,

3050
02:39:00,700 --> 02:39:02,400
MIKA: you can think about sunshine,

3051
02:39:02,533 --> 02:39:05,037
MIKA: the beach, peace and me.

3052
02:39:05,581 --> 02:39:08,500
MIKA: And when you think about
this season of CHUANG ASIA,

3053
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:11,300
MIKA: you can think about 21 amazing boys,

3054
02:39:11,533 --> 02:39:17,000
MIKA: 21 amazing artists and 21 brothers.
A lot like your season,

3055
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,700
MIKA: my season on CHUANG
was filmed on a hot island.

3056
02:39:20,033 --> 02:39:23,033
MIKA: They took away our phones.
And for the first time,

3057
02:39:23,233 --> 02:39:24,500
MIKA: they made 100 trainees

3058
02:39:24,500 --> 02:39:26,500
MIKA: who didn't speak the same language
lived together

3059
02:39:26,500 --> 02:39:28,067
MIKA: for four months. At first,

3060
02:39:28,067 --> 02:39:31,333
MIKA: I was scared.
I didn't know if I could learn Chinese,

3061
02:39:31,467 --> 02:39:33,600
MIKA: or if I could make Chinese friends.

3062
02:39:34,067 --> 02:39:37,633
MIKA: But now I can say
I can kind of speak Chinese,

3063
02:39:38,433 --> 02:39:42,133
MIKA: and I have countless Chinese friends
with countless memories.

3064
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,800
MIKA: So all I want to say
is no matter what happens tonight,

3065
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:48,269
MIKA: no matter what the outcome is,
you guys coming on this show,

3066
02:39:48,269 --> 02:39:49,933
MIKA: you guys meeting
the people that you did,

3067
02:39:49,933 --> 02:39:52,685
MIKA: and you guys doing what you did,
is already a success.

3068
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:55,500
MIKA: So don't worry,
you guys already made it.

3069
02:40:00,100 --> 02:40:02,500
QIAO YIYU: Hello everyone,
No. 1, QIAO YIYU.

3070
02:40:04,333 --> 02:40:07,233
QIAO YIYU: That's right, last year,
I was also on this stage,

3071
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:08,933
QIAO YIYU: shouting my name out loud.

3072
02:40:09,300 --> 02:40:10,800
QIAO YIYU: Time really flies.

3073
02:40:10,867 --> 02:40:13,867
QIAO YIYU: It feels like all of this
happened just yesterday.

3074
02:40:14,633 --> 02:40:16,133
QIAO YIYU: Last year at this time,
I was just like you.

3075
02:40:16,133 --> 02:40:18,533
QIAO YIYU: It was also my first time
coming to a foreign country,

3076
02:40:18,533 --> 02:40:20,867
QIAO YIYU: living together
with so many girls of different countries.

3077
02:40:21,267 --> 02:40:24,700
QIAO YIYU: The first time
I tried a cute style on stage.

3078
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:27,800
QIAO YIYU: The first time
I was seen and recognized.

3079
02:40:28,233 --> 02:40:31,667
QIAO YIYU: The first time
I debuted and became an artist.

3080
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,300
QIAO YIYU: CHUANG
really made me grow a lot.

3081
02:40:35,833 --> 02:40:38,500
QIAO YIYU: It also made me understand
that growth doesn't come by waiting.

3082
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:40,600
QIAO YIYU: Instead of waiting for it,

3083
02:40:40,667 --> 02:40:41,933
QIAO YIYU: it's better to chase it.

3084
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:45,600
QIAO YIYU: You can only grow
by running fast.

3085
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:49,900
QIAO YIYU: So I wonder
what they experience this year

3086
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,467
QIAO YIYU: and what are
their special moments.

3087
02:41:12,833 --> 02:41:14,425
NINJA: After I got here,

3088
02:41:14,573 --> 02:41:15,800
NINJA: I just realized

3089
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:18,893
NINJA: how big this world is.

3090
02:41:19,900 --> 02:41:23,149
NINJA: I'm just like a tiny fish
being thrown into a big ocean.

3091
02:41:24,237 --> 02:41:28,472
NINJA: After I've got to know,
to learn, to see,

3092
02:41:29,104 --> 02:41:32,417
NINJA: to meet so many talented people,

3093
02:41:33,300 --> 02:41:36,345
NINJA: then I just realized
how small I really am.

3094
02:41:38,833 --> 02:41:40,533
KK: The night before the GRAND AUDITION,

3095
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:44,267
KK: the four members
were just lying there.

3096
02:41:45,133 --> 02:41:46,233
KK: No one said a word,

3097
02:41:46,700 --> 02:41:48,867
KK: but we were all awake.

3098
02:41:49,833 --> 02:41:51,667
KK: We just stared at the ceiling

3099
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:53,400
KK: and kept our eyes open till dawn,

3100
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:57,000
KK: wondering if we will
perform well tomorrow.

3101
02:41:59,699 --> 02:42:01,635
KOSHIN: The first time I came here,

3102
02:42:01,810 --> 02:42:03,666
KOSHIN: there was one thing
that hit me the hardest.

3103
02:42:03,959 --> 02:42:06,398
KOSHIN: I can't express
what I thought very well.

3104
02:42:07,524 --> 02:42:09,237
KOSHIN: It's really difficult.

3105
02:42:09,941 --> 02:42:12,241
KOSHIN: So I just pretended
to understand every time.

3106
02:42:12,747 --> 02:42:15,469
KOSHIN: Right, right. Yes, yes.

3107
02:42:15,709 --> 02:42:17,452
KOSHIN: I can only answer these.

3108
02:42:18,395 --> 02:42:21,997
KOSHIN: Then I thought to myself,

3109
02:42:22,453 --> 02:42:23,653
KOSHIN: "I want to learn English".

3110
02:42:26,133 --> 02:42:28,133
TADALEE: During the rankings,

3111
02:42:28,900 --> 02:42:31,085
TADALEE: I was trying my best.

3112
02:42:31,565 --> 02:42:34,157
TADALEE: But no matter how hard I tried,

3113
02:42:35,181 --> 02:42:37,100
TADALEE: I still got stucked in B.

3114
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:41,233
TADALEE: I started to doubt myself

3115
02:42:42,733 --> 02:42:44,067
TADALEE: what I did wrong.

3116
02:42:45,300 --> 02:42:46,267
TADALEE: Or,

3117
02:42:47,500 --> 02:42:49,533
TADALEE: maybe it's me
who isn't good enough.

3118
02:42:52,667 --> 02:42:54,133
MYST: Time really flies.

3119
02:42:54,933 --> 02:42:56,500
MYST: There are
so many things I haven't done.

3120
02:42:57,633 --> 02:42:59,100
MYST: I haven't been in Class A yet.

3121
02:42:59,633 --> 02:43:01,000
MYST: I haven't been
in the center position yet.

3122
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:03,100
MYST: And I haven't won the MVP either.

3123
02:43:04,267 --> 02:43:07,500
MYST: My sixteen years old
was so difficult.

3124
02:43:09,633 --> 02:43:13,933
XIONG: That was our first
and also the last time,

3125
02:43:15,033 --> 02:43:18,700
XIONG: 60 people together
watching the sunset on the rooftop.

3126
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:23,067
XIONG: I knew we had
to say goodbye after sun set.

3127
02:43:24,133 --> 02:43:26,867
XIONG: We just looked at each other,

3128
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:32,433
XIONG: thinking that the dorm corridor
will never be so lively again.

3129
02:43:34,949 --> 02:43:36,857
HIKARU: I've been an idol

3130
02:43:37,173 --> 02:43:39,123
HIKARU: half my life.

3131
02:43:39,610 --> 02:43:41,485
HIKARU: I have debuted for two times.

3132
02:43:41,837 --> 02:43:43,415
HIKARU: Now I'm 26 years old,

3133
02:43:44,260 --> 02:43:45,871
HIKARU: this is the last chance.

3134
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:57,533
OMAR: Everything that happened here
is a first for me.

3135
02:43:58,233 --> 02:44:00,100
OMAR: The first time
singing and dancing on stage.

3136
02:44:00,667 --> 02:44:02,633
OMAR: The first time
getting recognition from others.

3137
02:44:03,233 --> 02:44:06,933
OMAR: The first time seeing real fans.

3138
02:44:06,933 --> 02:44:09,533
OMAR: And the first time
leaving home for so long.

3139
02:44:10,267 --> 02:44:13,033
OMAR: When I cried,
I didn't want to go home.

3140
02:44:15,245 --> 02:44:19,405
KOHI: First time I've been
on camera for so long.

3141
02:44:19,673 --> 02:44:23,629
KOHI: Every moment here is
a small, beautiful moment,

3142
02:44:23,725 --> 02:44:25,645
KOHI: becoming
a very precious memory for me.

3143
02:44:25,645 --> 02:44:29,645
KOHI: In my 22, all the moments

3144
02:44:29,773 --> 02:44:32,845
KOHI: are precious to me.

3145
02:44:34,267 --> 02:44:35,500
WHYLUCAS: In these three months here,

3146
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:36,833
WHYLUCAS: I wrote 10 songs
in three months here,

3147
02:44:37,400 --> 02:44:40,433
WHYLUCAS: which is
more than I wrote living alone

3148
02:44:40,433 --> 02:44:41,533
WHYLUCAS: in Singapore.

3149
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,600
WHYLUCAS: Hopefully,
I didn't disappoint anyone.

3150
02:44:44,600 --> 02:44:47,333
WHYLUCAS: Because
I'm really proud of myself.

3151
02:44:49,267 --> 02:44:51,233
AGUANG: The greatest achievement of all is

3152
02:44:51,233 --> 02:44:53,200
AGUANG: when you're doubted by everyone,

3153
02:44:53,333 --> 02:44:54,633
AGUANG: but you made it.

3154
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:57,700
AGUANG: I've practiced
that split so many times.

3155
02:44:57,867 --> 02:44:58,900
AGUANG: Two months have passed,

3156
02:44:58,900 --> 02:45:00,100
AGUANG: the bruises are still there.

3157
02:45:02,200 --> 02:45:03,633
BIANURA: From the very beginning,

3158
02:45:03,933 --> 02:45:05,633
BIANURA: I thought I'm not gonna make it.

3159
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:10,100
BIANURA: Because I realized
that this is not a comedian show.

3160
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:16,267
BIANURA: But I can make you happy,
so maybe I can be an idol.

3161
02:45:18,533 --> 02:45:20,900
WUXUN: I have no regrets coming here.

3162
02:45:21,433 --> 02:45:23,200
WUXUN: I used to be very lazy.

3163
02:45:23,633 --> 02:45:26,533
WUXUN: Here, I learned
how to get ready for the stage,

3164
02:45:27,433 --> 02:45:28,600
WUXUN: learned how to lose weight,

3165
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,100
WUXUN: and learned how to apply makeup.

3166
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:32,233
WUXUN: And many, many other things.

3167
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:35,900
WUXUN: Now, I want to be a good musician

3168
02:45:36,433 --> 02:45:38,000
WUXUN: and an okay artist.

3169
02:45:40,667 --> 02:45:42,500
YAO ZIHAO: I feel like I've grown so much.

3170
02:45:42,733 --> 02:45:45,467
YAO ZIHAO: Because now I feel
if 100 people scold me,

3171
02:45:45,467 --> 02:45:47,300
YAO ZIHAO: then 200 people will see me.

3172
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:50,233
YAO ZIHAO: Among them,
maybe 10 people will like me.

3173
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:57,100
SHEN: Back then, the 12-year-old SHEN
used to always rush to the center.

3174
02:45:57,833 --> 02:46:00,700
SHEN: Because I thought the center
would make me be the lead.

3175
02:46:01,867 --> 02:46:06,500
SHEN: But now, 19-year-old SHEN
can be farther to the side.

3176
02:46:07,133 --> 02:46:08,400
SHEN: Because I now know,

3177
02:46:08,600 --> 02:46:11,467
SHEN: even on the side,
I can still be the lead.

3178
02:46:14,133 --> 02:46:16,067
DONGDONG: I'm so lucky to have come here.

3179
02:46:17,100 --> 02:46:19,300
DONGDONG: The people here
have truly changed me.

3180
02:46:20,067 --> 02:46:21,700
DONGDONG: I no longer
worry about the future,

3181
02:46:22,233 --> 02:46:23,467
DONGDONG: but only focus on the present.

3182
02:46:24,667 --> 02:46:27,733
DONGDONG: This place
is a turning point in my life.

3183
02:46:30,387 --> 02:46:34,172
PEANUT: DORN, I didn't know why
when we first met,

3184
02:46:34,879 --> 02:46:37,037
PEANUT: you cried so hard for me.

3185
02:46:38,796 --> 02:46:41,526
PEANUT: Do you know that
from the first public stage until now,

3186
02:46:42,285 --> 02:46:44,077
PEANUT: we've never been
in different groups?

3187
02:46:45,467 --> 02:46:46,933
PEANUT: But I now understand

3188
02:46:47,533 --> 02:46:49,800
PEANUT: why you cried so hard
for me on that day.

3189
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:53,533
PEANUT: It has made me
respect you until today.

3190
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:57,267
THI-O: I'm used to being alone.

3191
02:46:58,300 --> 02:47:03,200
THI-O: I often feel alone.
I always eat alone,

3192
02:47:03,700 --> 02:47:06,267
THI-O: sing alone, shower alone.

3193
02:47:06,900 --> 02:47:08,300
THI-O: But after coming here,

3194
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:12,200
THI-O: especially on the stage,
I don't feel alone anymore.

3195
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:14,233
THI-O: I have my friends next to me.

3196
02:47:17,117 --> 02:47:19,649
DORN: I believe that among
all bedrooms in the camp,

3197
02:47:20,045 --> 02:47:23,597
DORN: mine is the most lively one.

3198
02:47:24,278 --> 02:47:27,781
DORN: Why?
Because everyone will come to my bedroom

3199
02:47:27,949 --> 02:47:29,901
DORN: after a long day of training.

3200
02:47:30,946 --> 02:47:32,653
DORN: It's quite surprisingly.

3201
02:47:33,036 --> 02:47:34,971
DORN: Though we speak different languages,

3202
02:47:35,149 --> 02:47:38,333
DORN: come from different countries,

3203
02:47:38,733 --> 02:47:40,833
DORN: we can still use body language
to communicate.

3204
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:46,100
YUCHEN: It's always fun being
with a group of people

3205
02:47:46,300 --> 02:47:47,433
YUCHEN: and doing funny things together.

3206
02:47:47,933 --> 02:47:49,833
YUCHEN: We put on strange makeup together.

3207
02:47:50,067 --> 02:47:51,800
YUCHEN: We break down and cry together,

3208
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:53,533
YUCHEN: and laugh out loud together.

3209
02:47:54,133 --> 02:47:55,800
YUCHEN: This is the happiest thing, right?

3210
02:47:56,267 --> 02:47:59,500
YUCHEN: Waking up every day
with a group of good friends around me.

3211
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:05,667
HU YETAO: Actually, I'm not confident.

3212
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:10,267
HU YETAO: I'm also afraid
that everyone's liking for me is not for long.

3213
02:48:11,800 --> 02:48:13,467
HU YETAO: So I never thought

3214
02:48:14,067 --> 02:48:16,400
HU YETAO: that I would gain
such profound friendships here.

3215
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:21,533
HU YETAO: But now, I have companions
to go through with me.

3216
02:48:22,700 --> 02:48:24,267
HU YETAO: I came here alone,

3217
02:48:25,433 --> 02:48:28,267
HU YETAO: but I hope to leave
with a group of people.

carry more memories.

3346

03:14:57,539 --> 03:14:59,205

3623
03:18:42,872 --> 03:18:46,939
YAO ZIHAO: My mother's dream

3625
03:18:50,005 --> 03:18:51,872

3628
03:19:05,205 --> 03:19:08,939
YAO ZIHAO: During
these six years of training,

3629
03:19:09,972 --> 03:19:12,572
YAO ZIHAO: I have always
been full of controversy.

3630
03:19:13,705 --> 03:19:16,539
YAO ZIHAO: I want to say thank you,

3631
03:19:16,539 --> 03:19:17,339

3637
03:19:34,805 --> 03:19:36,172
YAO ZIHAO: Last night,

3638
03:19:37,572 --> 03:19:39,472
YAO ZIHAO: I didn't want to sleep
and didn't dare to sleep.

3639
03:19:40,172 --> 03:19:42,305
YAO ZIHAO: Because I knew
that was our dorm...

3640
03:19:47,972 --> 03:19:50,739
YAO ZIHAO: Last night HU YETAO asked me

3641
03:19:51,605 --> 03:19:53,672
YAO ZIHAO: if I could debut.

3642
03:19:53,939 --> 03:19:56,172
YAO ZIHAO: I confidently said,
"Of course I can."

3643
03:19:56,172 --> 03:19:58,772
YAO ZIHAO: But actually
I was really nervous.

3644
03:20:02,472 --> 03:20:04,705
YAO ZIHAO: I want to tell HU YETAO

3645
03:20:06,705 --> 03:20:07,972
YAO ZIHAO: that I would be with you

3646
03:20:07,972 --> 03:20:09,172
YAO ZIHAO: once I said I would.

3647
03:20:12,672 --> 03:20:13,472
YAO ZIHAO: YUCHEN.

3648
03:20:16,339 --> 03:20:18,172
YAO ZIHAO: You will always
be my good brother.

3649
03:20:19,905 --> 03:20:21,305
YAO ZIHAO: I never believed in anything.

3650
03:20:21,305 --> 03:20:24,572
YAO ZIHAO: After tonight,
we will become people from

3651
03:20:24,572 --> 03:20:25,901
YAO ZIHAO: different worlds.

3652
03:20:25,901 --> 03:20:27,149

03:20:43,705 --> 03:20:45,272

3656
03:20:45,705 --> 03:20:47,661
YAO ZIHAO: And JACKSON, ALTON ANG.

3657
03:20:47,661 --> 03:20:50,939
YAO ZIHAO: They promised me that they would
come back to see me at the finals when they left.

3658
03:20:51,305 --> 03:20:52,272
YAO ZIHAO: And I promised them

3659
03:20:52,272 --> 03:20:53,305
YAO ZIHAO: I would debut.

3660
03:20:53,305 --> 03:20:54,905
YAO ZIHAO: Now I made it.

3661
03:21:00,672 --> 03:21:02,305
YAO ZIHAO: Thank all the fans
who voted for me.

3662
03:21:02,305 --> 03:21:03,739

HU YETAO: When I can't sleep at night,

3741
03:27:33,892 --> 03:27:35,392
HU YETAO: I start to imagine

3742
03:27:35,992 --> 03:27:37,759
HU YETAO: if one day,

3743
03:27:37,792 --> 03:27:39,126

3744
03:27:39,126 --> 03:27:41,859

03:27:42,726 --> 03:27:44,292
HU YETAO: But I am a sentimental person.

3746
03:27:44,292 --> 03:27:46,726
HU YETAO: Every time I think about it,
I start to cry.

3747
03:27:46,726 --> 03:27:47,759
HU YETAO: I move myself.

03:27:47,759 --> 03:27:50,059

any gold or any glory

3898
03:36:22,672 --> 03:36:24,374
