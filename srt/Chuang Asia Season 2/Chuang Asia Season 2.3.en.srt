177
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:48,800
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Standing
on this stage and seeing the trainees

178
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,208
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): perform
on this stage reminds me of

179
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,968
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): the time
when I just debuted.

180
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:54,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The first time
I stood on the stage, I was very excited.

181
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
But when I stood on stage

182
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:59,128
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and heard the cheers
and support from the audience below,

183
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:00,368
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
who were cheering for me,

184
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,488
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): in that moment,
I instantly fell in love with the stage.

185
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:03,568
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Um...

186
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:07,408
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): BAMBAM,
I heard that GOT7 is making a comeback.

187
00:13:07,448 --> 00:13:08,488
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
How do you feel about it?

188
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:10,888
BAMBAM: I can understand now.

189
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:17,728
BAMBAM: Yeah, you know, I just came back
with all my brothers GOT7

190
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:18,968

00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:21,928
BAMBAM: the album called
WINTER HEPTAGON.

BAMBAM: The title song is called PYTHON.

193
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:27,008
BAMBAM: After three years,
and it was an amazing time.

194
00:13:28,528 --> 00:13:30,168
TRAINEES: BAMBAM, GOT7, superb.

195
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:35,248
TIA RAY: It's my first time here in Asia,
you know, like doing the mentor thing.

196
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,048
TIA RAY: I have been doing that
in the mainland China already.

197
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,328
TIA RAY: But this is a very special
experience for me

198
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:42,848

199
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:47,128

- BAMBAM: Absolutely.
- TIA RAY: Right?

201
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:50,808
TIA RAY: And without your help,
it's impossible.

202
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:52,208
- TIA RAY: So...
- BAMBAM: Yeah.

203
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,488
TIA RAY: Thank you.

204
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:58,848
YAYA: I'm really looking forward
to how they're going to work as a team.

205
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:01,808
YAYA: So, this, they've never been
in the team before.

206
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:04,008
YAYA: So, I wanna see
how that teamwork works out.

207
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:05,608
- YAYA: And how they can deliver.
- TIA RAY: I can't wait.

208
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:10,008
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
Before the performance begins,

209
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:11,848
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
please welcome BAMBAM

210
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:14,048
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): to introduce
the rules of today's performance.

211
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,168
BAMBAM: Me, right? Okay.

212
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:20,968
BAMBAM: Okay.

213
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,568
BAMBAM: Sorry, but my Chinese
is not so good.

214
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:26,088
BAMBAM: Alright,
thank you XU MINGHAO (THE 8).

215
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:29,808
BAMBAM: So, you know, now the first
public stage is about to begin.

216
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:34,528
(First Public Stage Rules) BAMBAM: So, you know, the mission for this
performance is GROUP BATTLE.

217
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,408
BAMBAM: Today we have
a total of 10 teams,

218
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:41,968
BAMBAM: and we gonna split into 5 groups
for head-to-head battle.

219
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:44,208
(After each battle, there will be two rounds of voting)
BAMBAM: After each GROUP BATTLE,

220
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:46,608
BAMBAM: there will be
two rounds of voting.

221
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:50,008
(First, Vote for Your Chosen Trainee)
BAMBAM: First, vote for your picked trainees,

222
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,968

223
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:59,328
BAMBAM: Their destiny
will be decided by you.

224
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:04,088
YUCHEN: If we lose, call a car
to the airport immediately.

225
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:06,408
DAVID: Why? Are you going back
to celebrate Chinese New Year?

226
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:08,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): On the stage
today, I think

227
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:11,568
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): it's not just
about the trainees' competition,

228
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,168
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think
among the mentors

229
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,168
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): there should be
some competition.

230
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:16,888
(Really?)
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So, we mentors

231
00:15:16,928 --> 00:15:18,448
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): have to compete a bit
to see who has the sharpest eyes.

232
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:20,608
- BAMBAM: Do we also have a penalty?
- TIA RAY: Punishment?

233
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:21,448
BAMBAM: Yeah.

234
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,888
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's
the Chinese New Year today,

235
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,488
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): and I plan to

236
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:28,128
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): take our trainees

237
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:28,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): to eat hotpot

238
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,888
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
as a year-end dinner.

239
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,768
- TRAINEES: Oh, hotpot.
- TRAINEES: Really, is that true?

240
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:34,608
YAO ZIHAO: Hotpot.

241
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:35,928
YAO ZIHAO: Don't pull a fast one on us.

242
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:41,088
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So I think,
the losing mentor

243
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,888
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
should order more food.

244
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:45,848
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Or desserts
and drinks for the trainees.

245
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:48,448
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay,
so it's settled then.

246
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,768
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
The first public stage

247
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:53,448
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): of CHUANG ASIA S2
is about to begin now.

248
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,688
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Please, Mentors,
take your seats.

249
00:15:58,728 --> 00:15:59,648
TIA RAY: I'm looking forward to it.

250
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:08,088
BAMBAM: Alright, so let's welcome
A and OK, OK, OK to the stage.

251
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,248
BAMBAM: Welcome.

252
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,888
HIKARU: OMAR.

253
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,528
BIANURA: OMAR looks cute.

254
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:26,288
AUDIENCE: OMAR.

255
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,928
YAO ZIHAO: KK.

256
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,128
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So cute.
- AUDIENCE: OMAR.

257
00:16:30,408 --> 00:16:32,088
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Before

258
00:16:32,128 --> 00:16:33,688
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
the performance begins,

259
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:37,288
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): we mentors
have to battle a bit.

260
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:42,888
BAMBAM: So, you know, I think it's hard
for mentors to, you know, decide

261
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,928
BAMBAM: and, you know,
make a bet who's gonna win, right?

262
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:49,408
BAMBAM: So, we have
a special time for you guys,

263
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:52,408
BAMBAM: show what they've got right now
a little bit before performing.

264
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:54,728
BAMBAM: And then you all can decide
before watching the show,

265
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:59,168
BAMBAM: and you all can start betting
on who's gonna win.

266
00:16:59,288 --> 00:17:00,168
- BAMBAM: Let's go.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): You all,

267
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:03,168
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): does anyone want
to show off your own charm

268
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,968
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): to help earn points
for your team?

269
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:07,288
OMAR: Sorry.

270
00:17:07,688 --> 00:17:10,168
OMAR: You are just okay,

271
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,088
OMAR: but we are...

272
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,768
TRAINEES: A.

273
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:17,448
BAMBAM: A.

274
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:22,208
KK: Cuteness and sexiness
may not be comparable.

275
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,528
KK: So, today we will
sort the cuteness out.

276
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:26,368
TRAINEES: KO.

277
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:31,368
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
How is it, all mentors?

278
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:33,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The harsh words
that don't seem quite harsh.

279
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,928
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): After listening,
let's vote first

280
00:17:36,928 --> 00:17:38,688
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
to see which team will win.

281
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,448
TIA RAY: It's so hard to choose.

282
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,528
TIA RAY: But I have to choose, right?

283
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:46,168
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Yes, you have to.
- TIA RAY: If I have to choose,

284
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,728
(which team) - TIA RAY: then...
- BAMBAM: Just take a guess.

285
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,768
TIA RAY: Okay, I'll go cute this time.

286
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:52,128
JUNHAN: Yay.

287
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:56,608
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Personally,
I will vote for

288
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,368
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): A.

289
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,288
JUNHAN: Thank you,
senior XU MINGHAO (THE 8).

290
00:18:00,928 --> 00:18:03,168
BAMBAM: Alright, YAYA, take a guess.

291
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,008
YAYA: If it's from the heart,

292
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,968
YAYA: I gotta go with the sexy team.

293
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:08,608
YAYA: OK, OK, OK.

294
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:11,808
BAMBAM: This is tough.

295
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:13,968
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Final vote,
BAMBAM, choose now.

296
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,408
(IT'S SO HARD)

297
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:24,888
TRAINEES: A.

298
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:27,328
- TRAINEES: A.
- BAMBAM: I can't help, right?

299
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,288
BAMBAM: I can't help.

300
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:30,488
BAMBAM: Sorry,
I want to support you too,

301
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:33,008
BAMBAM: but this is my song.

302
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,088
BAMBAM: I choose A.

303
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,608
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Since you

recognition from the mentors.

305

00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,808
B: My mouth isn't just for talking,

327
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:47,048
B: but it's sexy enough
to make you lose control.

328
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,408
HONG JIN: Hello. Hi everyone.

329
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,408
HONG JIN: I'm HONG JIN,

330
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,728
HONG JIN: and I have the

331
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,088
HONG JIN: sexiest eyes.

332
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:02,848
JIAHAO: Hello everyone, I look very sexy
when whipping my hair, JIAHAO.

333
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:06,728
JIAHAO: When I whip my hair,
it's very sexy.

334
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:09,208
IVAN: Hello everyone.

335
00:20:09,728 --> 00:20:10,808
IVAN: Hello.

336
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:13,888
IVAN: I'm the team's

337
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:16,008
IVAN: sexy beginner,

338
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:18,128
IVAN: IVAN.

339
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:19,488
BAMBAM: Okay.

340
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:22,688
TIAN QI: Okay, okay.

341
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,008
GORDON: Let's go, go, go.

342
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:29,754
STAFF: Why did you choose
this song back then?

343
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:33,280
KK: Actually, I didn't really want
to choose this song

344
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,434
KK: because there were
only two songs left.

345
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,914
KK: One was in Thai, but I knew

346
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:39,514
KK: my language skills
weren't very good.

347
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,504
KK: So, I chose
the Chinese song, OK, OK, OK.

348
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:43,200
KK: After listening to it,
I was anxious.

349
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,408
KK: What should I do?
Why did I choose this song?

350
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:46,752
(REGRET)

351
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:54,082
KK: All my teammates suited this song.

352
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,802
KK: They were just the people
I wanted to choose.

353
00:20:55,802 --> 00:20:58,402
JIAHAO: The dance
was highly Afro-inspired.

354
00:20:58,402 --> 00:20:59,282
(LIKE)
JIAHAO: So, I was very surprised.

355
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,602
JIAHAO: I thought I had to
choose it for sure.

356
00:21:00,642 --> 00:21:02,362
(LIKE+1)
B: I think the dancing is okay.

357
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:03,842
B: This is also my forte.

358
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,402
(LIKE+2)
SMART: This song suits me

359
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:07,402
SMART: even more than the first stage.

360
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:08,882
(LIKE+3)
KK: When my teammates came,

361
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:10,442
KK: I pretended to be happy.

362
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:11,962
KK: Because I didn't want them to know

363
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,562
KK: that I didn't like this song at all.

364
00:21:13,562 --> 00:21:14,882
(Forced Smile)

365
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:17,642
IVAN: Should we watch the dance
or listen to the song first?

366
00:21:17,882 --> 00:21:18,642
KK: Let's watch first.

367
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:35,402
(Position 2 is similar to the CENTER position)
KK: Blue one seems to be the second center.

368
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:43,482
KK: You want this?

369
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:46,882
(Who would have thought
to get position 2...)

370
00:21:48,082 --> 00:21:49,162
HONG JIN: I'll take number one.

371
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:50,082
- KK: Number one.
- HONG JIN: Yes.

372
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,482
HONG JIN: Hey, number two.

373
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:53,762
(POSITION 2)
KK: Number two, number two.

374
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:56,482
(POSITION 2)
B: I want two.

375
00:21:56,522 --> 00:21:57,682
(POSITION 2)
KK: Two.

376
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,202
(Need Position 2)

377
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:04,322
JIAHAO: I think B is
a very strong opponent.

378
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,642
JIAHAO: I'm not sure if I can beat him.

379
00:22:05,642 --> 00:22:07,642
JIAHAO: So I think I can
let him have it.

380
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,562
- SMART: I'll take number one please.
- KK: Okay, okay.

381
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,722
SMART: One, two, three, four.

382
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:17,882
(AMAZING)

383
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,122
KK: Honestly, it's about the same.

384
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,002
- IVAN: About the same.
- KK: Yes.

385
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:26,362
JIAHAO: Let's do this. Count to three,
and then all four of us choose together.

386
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:28,242
JIAHAO: Three, two, one.

(B: POSITION 2)

388
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:31,602
KK: You wanna five?

389
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:33,562
- HONG JIN: Sure.
- KK: Okay.

390
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:34,642
(HONG JIN: POSITION 5)
IVAN: I...

391
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:36,922
KK: Four or three, which would you like?

392
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,002
IVAN: I want...

393
00:22:38,202 --> 00:22:38,962
(POSITION 3)
JIAHAO: I'll take number three.

394
00:22:40,162 --> 00:22:41,442
JIAHAO: Is it me who

395
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:42,722
JIAHAO: seems to not like competition
as much as before,

396
00:22:42,722 --> 00:22:45,522
JIAHAO: or does everyone like
competition too much?

397
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:46,962
- JIAHAO: I want number one.
- IVAN: Number one.

398
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:47,962
JIAHAO: Both of us want number one.

399
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:49,602
- HONGJIN: Both of you want it?
- JIAHAO: Yeah.

400
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:52,082
KK: This is so hard.

401
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:55,802
KK: Everyone thinks they may only get
to perform a few times,

402
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,962
KK: so they want to reveal more
of themselves, even if it's not apparent.

403
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:03,042
KK: But, they've clashed emotionally
like that several times already.

404
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,042
B: Do battle.

405
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:09,082
JIAHAO: Five, six, seven, eight.

406
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:11,242
JIAHAO: One, two, three, four.

407
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:13,242
JIAHAO: Five, six, seven, eight.

408
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:18,482
KK: I don't know
if it's for personal reasons

409
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,922
KK: or because of this song,
but I feel a bit alienated.

410
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:24,242
- B: Okay.
- KK: Okay.

411
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:29,162
- B: Okay.
- KK: No, we together.

412
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:31,482
- KK: Choose.
- HONG JIN: I choose...

413
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:32,962
- KK: Yeah?
- B: Yeah.

414
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:34,202
(SMART: POSITION 1)

415
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:35,442
KK: Only two people left.

416
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:36,962
JIAHAO: What's left, three or four?

417
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,562
- IVAN: Three, four.
- KK: Three and four are left.

418
00:23:38,722 --> 00:23:40,602
- JIAHAO: Which one do you want?
- IVAN: I want number three.

419
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,402
(Want to choose position 3)

420
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:44,442
KK: Hurry.

421
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,962
IVAN: I think the position three
is a bit easier than position four.

422
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:50,722
IVAN: I should be able
to learn it more easily.

423
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,882
IVAN: Actually, JIAHAO also agrees
that number three

424
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:54,442
IVAN: is a bit easier.

425
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:58,722
IVAN: But personally, he seems to like
the moves of number three.

426
00:23:58,722 --> 00:23:59,642
JIAHAO: So, we...

427
00:24:00,122 --> 00:24:01,842
JIAHAO: Anyway, three and four
are the two of us.

428
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,842
- IVAN: But we can switch positions.
- KK: Sure, sure.

429
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:08,322
(POSITION 3, POSITION 4)
KK: Then you take four, and he three.

430
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:10,322
JIAHAO: I'm three, he's four.

431
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:14,082
IVAN: Are you serious?

432
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:18,922
KK: Exhausted, I can't explain why.
Suddenly, a wave of exhaustion hits me.

433
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:23,642
KK: Rather than saying that the five are
lost, I feel more lost than the five.

434
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:28,034
KK: That's exactly how I feel.

435
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:29,874
KK: Because they are quite

436
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,674
KK: soft deep down.

437
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:37,554
KK: This song might already be
a song for women.

438
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:42,954
KK: All my teammates are good
at being sexy. They do it very well.

439
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:45,474
HONG JIN: It's more...
it's a little feminine

440
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:48,514
HONG JIN: and more like diva.

441
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,674
KK: So, I don't want to do this anymore,
I want to go home,

442
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:10,194
KK: because I'm not good at this.

443
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:10,914
(LET ME GO)

444
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:13,634
DANCE TEACHER: Overall right now,
the moves look overdone.

445
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:15,594
DANCE TEACHER: Just want you guys
to fix the moves first.

446
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:22,874
KK: We want something that's not too
feminine. We need to change the style.

447
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:24,994
KK: Change it to a boy group style.

448
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,514
HONG JIN: I actually really
liked my style,

449
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:32,794
HONG JIN: so it was very hard to

450
00:25:33,274 --> 00:25:34,634
HONG JIN: let it go.

451
00:25:34,794 --> 00:25:36,994
DANCE TEACHER: Because the latter part
of the song keeps getting more intense,

452
00:25:37,034 --> 00:25:39,394
DANCE TEACHER: especially
these four people right here.

453
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:43,594
DANCE TEACHER: So, I want JIAHAO
and IVAN to be a bit stronger.

454
00:25:43,634 --> 00:25:45,634
(Lack of strength)

455
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:47,314
KK: I think there's no right
or wrong in being sexy.

456
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:51,394
KK: It depends on the expression;
men dancing can be sexy in a manly way.

457
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,474
KK: There might be a clear difference.

458
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:55,994
KK: One, two, three, four.

459
00:25:56,274 --> 00:25:59,394
KK: Okay, okay, follow along.

460
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:01,994
KK: At the beats seven and eight,
SMART does the move...

461
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:06,754
KK: One, five, six, seven, eight,
seven and then up, right?

462
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,794
KK: Explode with power.

463
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,714
B: When we have to switch parts,
we have to change positions.

464
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:19,554
B: We modify the dance moves.
We need to remember everything anew.

465
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:21,474
IVAN: Before we even learned the new
moves, we've already started fixing them.

466
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:28,154
IVAN: So, I have to keep memorizing
new moves. Even now, I'm still confused.

467
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,194
TRAINEES: Nosebleed.

468
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:45,754
JIAHAO: There are many things that
everyone still can't quite adjust to.

469
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:47,754
(Uneven Dance)

470
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:49,434
DANCE TEACHER: No.

471
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:54,674
PD: Let me ask this.
Do you think you dance well yet?

472
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,360
PD: I think this part is a bit sexy.

473
00:26:59,392 --> 00:27:03,760
PD: But I think you show
your strength and explosive power.

474
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,120
PD: This will make this song special.

475
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:12,128
PD: The part you modified
is not so good.

476
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:17,394
SMART: Back then, there were two of us
feeling down, B and me.

477
00:27:18,074 --> 00:27:19,114
IVAN: We didn't know

478
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:22,754
IVAN: what we should express.

479
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:31,234
B: They said we can be ourselves.

480
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,394
B: We can be ourselves in the solo part.

481
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:37,154
B: So, why we have to change
the solo part to be...

482
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:40,354
B: You know what I mean, right?

483
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:43,984
HONG JIN: Because it's "See the world, Find yourself,"

484
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:46,144
HONG JIN: but when we were trying to be ourselves,

485
00:27:46,144 --> 00:27:47,328
- HONG JIN: they told us not to.
- B: No.

486
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:56,514
B: It says we "See the world, Find yourself,"
and when we are ourselves, why do they ask me to change?

487
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:59,674
SMART: That's why I'm confused.
So much in my mind.

488
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:07,154
SMART: Like I do this, you know, I do it two or more.
I don't know at that time, I don't know anything.

489
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:09,874
SMART: That's why I cried.

490
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:14,154
SMART: I don't know what I'm doing.
Is it good or bad?

491
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:17,874
KK: We recorded a video
during our practice today.

492
00:28:17,874 --> 00:28:20,074
KK: When I saw it,
I thought it was okay.

493
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,752
KK: They can have their own style
when being the centers;

494
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:24,714
KK: a clear style would pose no problem.

495
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:29,074
KK: But during the chorus
or dance break,

496
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:33,034
KK: just dance in sync. There's no
such thing as good or bad style.

497
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:36,434
KK: Just dance in sync, that's enough.
In other parts, show your own style.

498
00:28:36,474 --> 00:28:38,514
B: It's okay, it's okay, hug SMART.

499
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:40,154
- SMART: Hug.
- B: It's okay. It's okay.

500
00:28:48,914 --> 00:28:51,514
KK: The changes I requested made them
feel as if they were being held back.

501
00:28:51,514 --> 00:28:55,354
KK: At first, it was a highlight, but it became
less significant after my changes.

502
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,800
KK: In those days,
I didn't laugh at all.

503
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,720
KK: Really dispirited. Every day, probing
about others' songs, listening to their songs.

504
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,320
KK: Wow, so pleasant to hear.

505
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,320
TRAINEES: Four, five, six, seven, eight.

506
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,000
JUNHAN: One, two, three,
four, five, six.

507
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,000
KK: I saw the performance
of our opponents.

508
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,560
KK: Wow, they possess a kind of power.
We watched them do it.

509
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,400
KK: I kind of envy them.

510
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,008
KK: When they came out,

511
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:36,736
KK: the atmosphere was very lively.

512
00:29:36,736 --> 00:29:39,040
KK: Compared to our song, I think

513
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,440
KK: this song is very lively.

514
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,080
KK: So I'm thinking about how
to modify it like crazy.

515
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,040
KK: Just now, we saw their chorus.

516
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,960
KK: Their center is very obvious. For our
chorus, two people are singing the lines.

517
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
(The center is not obvious)
KK: It's not very obvious.

518
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
(The center is not obvious)
KK: The momentum is a bit weak.

519
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,960
(The center is not obvious, highlight everyone's characteristics)
KK: The strength is also weak. I hope

520
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,120
(The center is not obvious, highlight everyone's characteristics)
KK: the chorus should be modified. One person is fine.

521
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,200
(The center is not obvious, highlight everyone's characteristics)
KK: I've found a way to highlight everyone's strength.

522
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,520
KK: Modified some movements

523
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,320
KK: that are suitable

524
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,760
KK: for me

525
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,040
(KK choreographed for the team)
KK: and everyone else.

526
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,600
(KK choreographed for the team)
B: It's my first time working together with KK.

527
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,200
B: He always has new ides.

528
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,640
B: He can make us win over Class A

529
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,160
B: and find a way to highlight

530
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,280
B: the strengths of our team.

531
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,960
(Helping IVAN during the dance practice)
KK: Our strength lies in the CP feel.

532
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
KK: We preserve our own style
and radiate our charm.

533
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,520
KK: If the audience like you,
they really do.

534
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,960
KK: At first, I thought we would lose.

535
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,960
KK: But now I feel we can win.

536
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,920
YAYA: I like it.

537
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:25,618
DAVID: SMART used facial
expressions very well.

538
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:27,178
PEAT: KK already stands out.

539
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,658
PEAT: I really like his dance lines.

540
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:31,298
PEAT: I feel like his lines have become
much more beautiful.

541
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,258
PEAT: It seems like he's well-prepared.

542
00:33:33,258 --> 00:33:35,738
- BAMBAM: Wow.
- YAYA: Wow.

543
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:38,538
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you so much,
OK, OK, OK.

544
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:40,538
BAMBAM: Now let's switch the team.

545
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:43,498
BAMBAM: And then let's see
A team performance.

546
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:44,978
BAMBAM: So, here you guys switch.

547
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:45,858

548
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:49,378
AUDIENCE: Keep going.

549
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:53,338
WHYLUCAS: How they gonna beat that team?

550
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,298
MYST: They can definitely beat it.

551
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:56,458
- WHYLUCAS: Really?
- MYST: Yes.

552
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:58,778
MYST: It's not like that they're good.
They're really good.

553
00:33:58,818 --> 00:34:01,058
MYST: But they're just cute.

554
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,298
MYST: And the cute always win.

555
00:34:06,498 --> 00:34:10,778
TRAINEES: Hello, we are GET A.

556
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:17,378
OMAR: Hello everyone,
I'm OMAR, the T-rex of Team GET A.

557
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:20,538
OMAR: I'm as tall and big as a T-rex.

558
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,738
OMAR: So, I want to be brave
like a T-rex,

559
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,818
OMAR: not afraid of any obstacles.

560
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,978

when I smile.

572
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:53,058

582
00:35:27,378 --> 00:35:31,218
AGUANG: I'm the little pig from GET A,
AGUANG.

583
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:32,658

584
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,898
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Okay,

585
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:38,818
TRAINEES: Three, two, one.

586
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:40,258

588
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,418
(TIDY, VITALITY)
JUNHAN: win with tidiness and vitality.

589
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,458
JUNHAN: Our rivals, Team OK, OK, OK

590
00:35:48,538 --> 00:35:51,218
JUNHAN: might focus on a sexy style.

591
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:52,898
(Sexy Boy)
JUNHAN: If men focus on a sexy style,

592
00:35:52,938 --> 00:35:55,018
JUNHAN: they might be at a disadvantage.

593
00:35:55,018 --> 00:35:56,338
JINGYU: But A is like...

594
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:59,858
(SO YOUTHFUL, ATMOSPHERIC)
JINGYU: bright, lively, and with a good vibe.

595
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,738
OMAR: We are very clearly divided.

596
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:03,938
OMAR: I might focus more on dancing.

597
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:05,698
OMAR: All my teammates are vocals.

598
00:36:05,738 --> 00:36:07,698
(DANCE, E-SPORT PLAYER,
THE REST ARE VOCALS)

599
00:36:07,738 --> 00:36:09,858
AGUANG: Our team really
has a lot of vocals,

600
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:12,258
AGUANG: but the division of our singing
parts is very smooth.

601
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:13,738
- AGUANG: I want part one.
- JUNHAN: I'll choose one.

602
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:14,938
JINGYU: One or two is fine.

603
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:19,418
PEAT: I want to sing but
you two sing so good.

604
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,098
PEAT: I'll change to rap. It's okay.

605
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:22,738
- PEAT: I'm three, okay.
- OMAR: Three.

606
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:23,178
PEAT: Yes.

607
00:36:23,218 --> 00:36:24,978
- OMAR: You?
- AGUANG: Four.

608
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,018
- OMAR: You?
- SICHEN: Five.

609
00:36:27,258 --> 00:36:28,698
PEAT: One, two, three,

610
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,498
AGUANG: four, five.

611
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,018
- JUNHAN: Okay.
- AGUANG: C.

612
00:36:32,058 --> 00:36:33,818
TRAINEES: C.

613
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:37,378
PEAT: And you will go this one.

614
00:36:37,418 --> 00:36:39,338
(What is this?)

615
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:51,018
OMAR: Who can do this?

616
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,218
JINGYU: Which number is this?

617
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:54,138
- PEAT: Four, right?
- JINGYU: Maybe we will change.

618
00:36:54,138 --> 00:36:55,778
AGUANG: Four.

619
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:57,458
AGUANG: Four.

620
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:59,618
JINGYU: This is number four.
SICHEN is the main dancer here.

621
00:36:59,658 --> 00:37:00,808
(NO WAY!)
SICHEN: How can I do that?

622
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,658
JINGYU: Number four is very important,
you must do a split.

623
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:06,458
JINGYU: I can't do it, I'm too old.

624
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:06,898
(I'm old...)

625
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:09,298
JINGYU: I shouldn't say that.
Don't say that on camera.

626
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:10,858
JINGYU: My age now may be

627
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,058
(FRAGILE)
JINGYU: an age susceptible to injury easily.

628
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:14,378
JUNHAN: That number four,

629
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:14,898
(NO THANKS)
JUNHAN: I don't...

630
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:17,018
JUNHAN: I never thought of that part.

631
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:19,458
(I've thought about it)
AGUANG: Dance, it's okay, you can practice.

632
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:20,858
AGUANG: You can practice all of it.

633
00:37:20,898 --> 00:37:22,418
(DANCER)
AGUANG: I'd rather be a dancer.

634
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,018
AGUANG: If I dance,
I need time to practice.

635
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,338
AGUANG: It will develop muscle memory.

636
00:37:27,226 --> 00:37:29,184
AGUANG: And then, no matter what,
you will be able to dance.

637
00:37:29,306 --> 00:37:31,986
- AGUANG: I think four must be fierce.
- PEAT: But I want to...

638
00:37:32,026 --> 00:37:35,066
- AGUANG: I can do it, I can be fierce.
- PEAT: I want to sing that part.

639
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:38,752
AGUANG: Rap.

640
00:37:38,752 --> 00:37:40,552
AGUANG: Even though I may appear neat,

641
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,112
(FIERCE)
AGUANG: there's a fierce side to me.

642
00:37:44,632 --> 00:37:46,472
- OMAR: Good.
- AGUANG: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
00:37:46,512 --> 00:37:47,632
(Cool Boy)

644
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:49,032
(PLAYER)
AGUANG: I think I

645
00:37:49,712 --> 00:37:50,752
(PLAYER)
AGUANG: can be a rapper.

646
00:37:50,752 --> 00:37:52,752
(RAPPER)
AGUANG: Just being cool is enough.

647
00:37:52,992 --> 00:37:55,992
AGUANG: I think
this is a new challenge for us.

648
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:58,712
AGUANG: Now we don't need to be
afraid of it anymore, because we...

649
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:00,912
AGUANG: when we practiced
the THEME SONG, it was difficult.

650
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,912
AGUANG: We managed to do
a three-minute song.

651
00:38:02,952 --> 00:38:04,912
AGUANG: Is this song three minutes?
It's not even two minutes.

652
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,752
AGUANG: So, it is easier
than the THEME SONG.

653
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,872
AGUANG: Therefore, we can do it well.

654
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,392
JUNHAN: Keep it up,
looking forward to seeing it.

655
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:13,512
JINGYU: And there must be
another person dancing.

656
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:14,952
JUNHAN: Dance.

657
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,352
JUNHAN: One person dances,
another person does the split.

658
00:38:16,352 --> 00:38:17,992
(We will definitely make it well)

659
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:33,832
(Team A's first vocal class)

660
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:34,712
(Good!)
VOCAL TEACHER: Good.

661
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:40,992
(What?)
VOCAL TEACHER: What?

662
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:51,712
VOCAL TEACHER: One, two,

663
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:53,192
VOCAL TEACHER: three, four.

664
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:56,712
PEAT: It's a bit of a language issue.

665
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,032
PEAT: I mean, I feel that

666
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,312
PEAT: Koreans speak fast.

667
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,952
PEAT: Suppose I speak like this,
it might be like one two three

668
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,432
PEAT: while Koreans, one two three four
five six seven eight, like this.

669
00:39:06,472 --> 00:39:08,112
PEAT: So, I feel that...
Especially with rap,

670
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:12,192
PEAT: from 8 to 16
to 20 within a few seconds.

671
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:13,912
PEAT: It's quite hard.

672
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,552
(Team A's second vocal class)

673
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,914
VOCAL TEACHER: OMAR, can you...

674
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:43,794
(OMAR tries the rap part)

675
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:44,794
VOCAL TEACHER: Good.

676
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:49,234
VOCAL TEACHER: My idea, my opinion.

677
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,274
VOCAL TEACHER: I think

678
00:39:51,314 --> 00:39:53,154
(VOCAL and RAP)
VOCAL TEACHER: PEAT and OMAR,

679
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,074
VOCAL TEACHER: you switch the...

680
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:57,074
(VOCAL, Exchange opinions, RAP)
VOCAL TEACHER: parts,

681
00:39:57,114 --> 00:39:59,674
(RAP, Exchange opinions, VOCAL)
VOCAL TEACHER: So, PEAT rap verse two.

682
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:07,474
PEAT: It can't be switched, right?

683
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,514
PEAT: He is the C.

684
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:12,274
- PEAT: Because he is the center.
- JINGYU: He is the center.

685
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:14,434
(Consider OMAR's center position)

686
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:16,514
(Consider OMAR's center position)
OMAR: That day I asked PEAT if

687
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:19,194
(Consider OMAR's center position)
OMAR: we should try switching parts. Then I said

688
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:21,874
OMAR: your part is harder than mine.

689
00:40:21,914 --> 00:40:22,754
OMAR: And I also said that

690
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:24,354
OMAR: take my vocal part

691
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:26,474
(Propose to use two parts to swap with rap part)
OMAR: plus another hook part to exchange with you.

692
00:40:26,514 --> 00:40:27,714
OMAR: And then PEAT said

693
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:29,314
OMAR: no, you are the center.

694
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:30,394
OMAR: I can't...

695
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:31,834
OMAR: Yes, he kept saying so.

696
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,194
OMAR: It might be because
if I switch with him,

697
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,354
OMAR: it would give me
fewer parts of my own.

698
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:36,194
OMAR: If we change, we can

699
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,794
OMAR: show we...

700
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:42,234
OMAR: Advantage.

701
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:43,474
JINGYU: Yes, advantage.

702
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,074
- PEAT: Yes.
- OMAR: Make the stage more...

703
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:45,954
JUNHAN: Even if we switch,

704
00:40:45,954 --> 00:40:49,034
JUNHAN: OMAR can definitely
show his strengths,

705
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:52,594
JUNHAN: because OMAR
might be more suitable for rapping.

706
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,034
JUNHAN: I think no matter
what the result is,

707
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:57,114
JUNHAN: we have to show our best.

708
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,274
JUNHAN: Then it's settled.

709
00:40:58,314 --> 00:40:59,954
- OMAR: Okay.
- JUNHAN: Okay.

710
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:01,314
- AGUANG: Are you okay?
- PEAT: Okay.

711
00:41:01,354 --> 00:41:03,274
JUNHAN: Okay.

712
00:41:04,034 --> 00:41:04,794
PEAT: Keep going.

713
00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:06,394
AGUANG: You can do it, PEAT.

714
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:07,474
PEAT: I think OMAR

715
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:08,834
PEAT: did very well.

716
00:41:08,874 --> 00:41:12,034
PEAT: And I feel like
we were right to have him.

717
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:15,474
PEAT: And I believe that choosing
this song is the right decision.

OMAR: Position your legs like this.

719

OMAR: Step forward.

720
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:24,314
OMAR: Okay, then lift your leg up.

721
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:28,834
JUNHAN: OMAR, actually
he is a very enthusiastic person.

722
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:31,154
JUNHAN: He can help make our dance moves

723
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:32,674
JUNHAN: perfect and look better.

724
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:35,754

(GOOD!)

OMAR: Lower down a bit like that. Yeah.

739
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:14,274
OMAR: PEAT couldn't do that.

740
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:16,314
OMAR: His hand can do this.

741
00:42:16,354 --> 00:42:18,114
OMAR: And this hand does like this.

742
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:20,674
OMAR: He can't do it.

743

(What's this?)

744
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,154
OMAR: So, I have him do it with

745
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:35,754
OMAR: those like the floor
and wall corner.

746
00:42:35,834 --> 00:42:37,634
OMAR: It will be a 90-degree angle.

747
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:39,474
OMAR: So, I have him put his arm there,

748
00:42:39,514 --> 00:42:41,154
OMAR: and told him
this is a 90-degree angle.

legs like this,

764
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:34,354
AGUANG: and then going down and getting
back up, it's a bit difficult.

AGUANG: Before dancing,
the dance teacher

766
00:43:36,554 --> 00:43:38,314
AGUANG: will teach body exercises.

767
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:39,594

772
00:43:56,674 --> 00:43:57,594
JUNHAN: does not give up
on obstacles at all.

773
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:59,634
JUNHAN: Spoke firmly
that he wanted to try.

774
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:03,594
JUNHAN: When you don't see him,
he's secretly practicing.

775

JUNHAN: Stretching legs like this.

776
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:13,634
AGUANG: It just takes
perseverance and time

777
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:15,234
AGUANG: to bring something about.

778
00:44:15,274 --> 00:44:16,554

781
00:44:27,394 --> 00:44:29,274
JUNHAN: just dance in sync with
beautiful, clean moves and that's enough.

782
00:44:29,274 --> 00:44:33,274
JUNHAN: We'd go through it frame by frame
to see if the dancing was in sync.

783
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:36,794
(A different way of learning)
JUNHAN: We wrote down the issues.

784
00:44:38,074 --> 00:44:41,354
JUNHAN: I think if we can
do it step by step,

785
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:43,714
JUNHAN: then make all the moves orderly.

786
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,074

sees this image that

787
00:44:46,154 --> 00:44:47,554

a big age difference, I feel that

799

JUNHAN: our viewpoints are the same.

800

and be ourselves.

better next time,

won't be these cute moments anymore.

901
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:41,354
BAMBAM: XU MINGHAO (THE 8),

902
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:45,194
BAMBAM: what do you think
about this after watching?

903
00:53:45,234 --> 00:53:48,754
BAMBAM: Which team performed better, or
what are your thoughts on this performance?

904
00:53:49,114 --> 00:53:52,754
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): First of all, I think
Team A has shown remarkable improvement.

905
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And when I watched
their performance, I couldn't help but

906
00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:58,514
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): to smile
unconsciously.

907
00:53:59,154 --> 00:54:01,914
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): After watching you,

908
00:54:01,914 --> 00:54:03,594
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I think
your brightness

909
00:54:03,594 --> 00:54:06,794
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): after this,
it will be hard to return to this state.

910
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:10,074
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): As your potential
and dancing improve,

911
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:12,794
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your singing
and expression skills improve,

912
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,034
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
you may still be bright,

913
00:54:15,394 --> 00:54:19,114
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): but you definitely
won't be as bright as you are now.

914
00:54:19,194 --> 00:54:22,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8):
So, I feel very good.

915
00:54:23,154 --> 00:54:24,554
- BAMBAM: Okay. That's good.
- XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Good.

916
00:54:24,954 --> 00:54:27,074
BAMBAM: TIA RAY, you wanna...
what do you think about,

917
00:54:27,114 --> 00:54:29,234
BAMBAM: you know, you seem
really enjoy the show.

918
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:29,954
TIA RAY: I did.

919
00:54:29,994 --> 00:54:33,314
TIA RAY: OK, OK, OK,
I think your song choice,

920
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:34,874
TIA RAY: the song arrangement,

921
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:36,674
TIA RAY: and your dancing
impressed me a lot.

922
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:39,394
TIA RAY: KK truly caught my attention.

923
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:41,074
TIA RAY: You are...

924
00:54:41,314 --> 00:54:45,154
TIA RAY: I feel like you have
a very important role in this team.

925
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:48,114
TIA RAY: Everyone surprised me.

926
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:50,474
TIA RAY: So, I really like
your performance.

927
00:54:50,514 --> 00:54:52,114
TIA RAY: Today you're very sexy,
explosively sexy.

928
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:53,634
KK: Thank you, Mentor.

929
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:55,394
TIA RAY: But actually, I think

930
00:54:55,434 --> 00:54:58,834
TIA RAY: the others can still do more.

931
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:02,394
TIA RAY: Seems like there is still room
to develop in terms of sexiness.

932
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:04,354
TIA RAY: In terms of expression,

933
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:06,034
TIA RAY: you need some room
for improvement.

934
00:55:06,074 --> 00:55:07,914
TIA RAY: Has anyone trained
with XU MINGHAO (THE 8),

935
00:55:07,954 --> 00:55:11,234
TIA RAY: or trained with BAMBAM?

936
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,794
TIA RAY: Could you help teach them?

937
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:16,234
TIA RAY: Show them
what male sexiness is.

938
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:18,954
TIA RAY: What it is like,
how to express it.

939
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:21,594
BAMBAM: No one really accepts me
as a sexy guy.

940
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:22,354
(Really?)

941
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:24,474
TIA RAY: Really?
But I think you're sexy.

942
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:28,194
BAMBAM: But, you know,
I feel like YAYA can answer this.

943
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:29,554
- PEAT: Four?
- JINGYU: Otherwise we have to change.

944
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:32,114
BAMBAM: What is sexy for you, YAYA?

945
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,154
YAYA: I think TIA RAY is super sexy.

946
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,714
TIA RAY: But we're talking

00:55:38,954 --> 00:55:39,514
