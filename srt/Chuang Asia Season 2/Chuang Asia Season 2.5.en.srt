JEFF: Thank you.

2435
01:51:22,882 --> 01:51:25,482
STAFF: All the trainees go
to the swimming pool, please.

2436
01:51:37,722 --> 01:51:39,162
HU YETAO: I liked the final part
where we played at the swimming pool.

2437
01:51:39,202 --> 01:51:40,882
HU YETAO: We even danced
to the THEME SONG in the water.

2438
01:51:41,002 --> 01:51:43,282
HU YETAO: It was so fun.

2439
01:52:15,122 --> 01:52:16,282
THI-O: Got to go play in the water.

2440
01:52:16,442 --> 01:52:19,202
THI-O: I'm soaked, my hair is drenched,
but it feels good.

2441
01:52:20,282 --> 01:52:23,282
KEVIN: It's as if everyone
let go of their fatigue,

2442
01:52:23,442 --> 01:52:25,802
KEVIN: and all the stress
was released completely.

2443
01:52:26,522 --> 01:52:28,602
KEVIN: I think sports are something
that's super fun.

2444
01:52:28,642 --> 01:52:31,002
KEVIN: This is youth, this is energy.

2445
01:52:31,162 --> 01:52:33,562
KEVIN: I think
this sports day was amazing!

2446
01:52:33,642 --> 01:52:34,882
KEVIN: After the first performance,

2447
01:52:35,002 --> 01:52:38,362
KEVIN: honestly, everyone might have been
both excited and happy

2448
01:52:38,402 --> 01:52:40,282
KEVIN: with a bit of pressure too.

2449
01:52:40,322 --> 01:52:43,282
KEVIN: I think today,
everyone let everything out.

2450
01:52:43,362 --> 01:52:45,962
KEVIN: The smiles on their faces
were genuine, not fake.

2451
01:52:46,042 --> 01:52:49,722
KEVIN: Smiles that reveal all the teeth.

2452
01:52:49,802 --> 01:52:51,842
DAVID: It's like turning back time
to high school days.

2453
01:52:51,882 --> 01:52:54,162
DAVID: Feeling an excitement
I haven't felt in ages.

2454
01:52:54,402 --> 01:52:55,802
TRAINEES: Awesome.

2455
01:52:55,922 --> 01:52:57,242
AGUANG: Let's go!

2456
01:53:01,162 --> 01:53:02,522
THI-O: Not being on stage all the time,

2457
01:53:02,602 --> 01:53:06,162
THI-O: it's a fun, relaxed perspective.

2458
01:53:06,162 --> 01:53:08,402
THI-O: Not overthinking things,
and it's pretty funny.

2459
01:53:09,002 --> 01:53:11,882
KOSHIN: After participating
in the sports day, I felt really happy.

2460
01:53:12,042 --> 01:53:16,762
KOSHIN: Normally it's just dancing,
but doing other things is fun too.

2461
01:53:16,882 --> 01:53:20,002
ALTON ANG: When there's a competition,
some win and some lose.

2462
01:53:20,042 --> 01:53:21,602
ALTON ANG: Whether we win or lose,

2463
01:53:21,722 --> 01:53:23,842
ALTON ANG: I think it doesn't matter.
Throughout the game,

2464
01:53:23,882 --> 01:53:27,442
ALTON ANG: it's about experiencing
the moments everyone shared together.

2465
01:53:28,282 --> 01:53:30,282
KEVIN: The enthusiasm, the eagerness
I think

2466
01:53:30,322 --> 01:53:32,842
KEVIN: it's like releasing energy.

2467
01:53:32,962 --> 01:53:34,642
KEVIN: At that moment,
I felt everyone was so charming.

2468
01:53:34,882 --> 01:53:43,042
EARTH: I feel it's a very worthwhile day
for this season of CHUANG ASIA.

2469
01:53:43,282 --> 01:53:45,522
EARTH: I felt something like... wow,

2470
01:53:45,522 --> 01:53:47,002
EARTH: thank you for making
this day happen.

2471
01:53:47,002 --> 01:53:49,882

2472
01:53:56,922 --> 01:53:57,962
YAO ZIHAO: I think

2473
01:53:58,402 --> 01:54:02,122
YAO ZIHAO: it's a really
wonderful memory.

2474
01:54:02,842 --> 01:54:04,322
YAO ZIHAO: Next round,
the rankings will be announced.

2475
01:54:04,602 --> 01:54:07,442
YAO ZIHAO: When announcing results
or eliminating trainees, we'll feel sad.

2476
01:54:07,442 --> 01:54:10,322
YAO ZIHAO: Because I feel like
it might be the last time we meet.

2477
01:54:10,362 --> 01:54:12,962
YAO ZIHAO: It might even be
the last time we meet in our lives.

2478
01:54:14,722 --> 01:54:19,322
JUNHAN: Actually, this sports day
where all 60 of us were together

2479
01:54:19,682 --> 01:54:21,682
JUNHAN: is something very memorable.

2480
01:54:21,722 --> 01:54:24,522
JUNHAN: I don't know
what will happen after this.

2481
01:54:24,882 --> 01:54:26,842
JUNHAN: Who will remain?
Who will have to go home?

2482
01:54:28,242 --> 01:54:32,402
KEVIN: Looking back, it was probably
the last time we had fun together,

2483
01:54:32,442 --> 01:54:36,402
KEVIN: did group activities together

2484
01:54:36,442 --> 01:54:38,402
KEVIN: before the elimination.

2485
01:54:38,442 --> 01:54:42,162
KEVIN: Actually, after the fun,
there's also

2486
01:54:43,642 --> 01:54:44,922
KEVIN: a little bit of sadness.

2487
01:54:45,122 --> 01:54:48,162
KEVIN: Everyone might face elimination.

2488
01:54:48,322 --> 01:54:51,122
KEVIN: We'll have to face the question
of who stays and who goes home. I think...

2489
01:54:51,602 --> 01:54:53,842
KEVIN: We still don't want to think
about these things now.

2490
01:54:53,962 --> 01:54:54,762
(WE AGAIN)

2491
01:54:54,802 --> 01:54:58,082
(CAN WE MEET AGAIN NEXT TIME?)

2492
01:55:18,722 --> 01:55:20,002
(NEXT WEEK)

2493
01:55:20,002 --> 01:55:22,362

2499
01:55:31,802 --> 01:55:33,802
HU YETAO: Actually, the second public stage
has always worried me.

2500
01:55:33,842 --> 01:55:35,482
HU YETAO: Because if we reach
the second round,

2501
01:55:35,482 --> 01:55:37,362
HU YETAO: that means it's almost ending.

2502
01:55:37,762 --> 01:55:41,562
KOSHIN: I'm also interested
in songwriting.

2503
01:55:41,602 --> 01:55:44,202
KOSHIN: All of us collaborating
to create something new

2504
01:55:44,402 --> 01:55:47,322

and unique.

2505
01:55:47,522 --> 01:55:50,442

my songwriting and production potential.

2506
01:55:50,442 --> 01:55:52,922

make music with friends

2507
01:55:55,802 --> 01:55:59,442
