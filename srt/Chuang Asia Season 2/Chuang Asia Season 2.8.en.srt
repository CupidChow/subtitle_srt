ZI XUAN LI: Save some for me.

361
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,640
SHEN: In both of those boxes
are living beings.

362
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
SUNNY: it's alive?

363
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,640

SUNNY: Bread?

SUNNY: Those glasses make me
feel like she looks neat.

368
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,640
SUNNY: So I think she could be
a fairly mature woman.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,040
SUNNY: A woman who likes to go
to cafes, something like that.

370
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,280
ZI XUAN LI: He said I like
to go to cafes.

371
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,400
ZI XUAN LI: Then, you all stand in line
and close your eyes.

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,360
ZI XUAN LI: I'll come out in a moment.

373
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,040
(HELP ME!)

374
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,600

- SHEN: Can I open my eyes now?
- ZI XUAN LI: Yeah.

376

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,680
SHEN: Once I opened my eyes, I saw her.

380
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,760
SHEN: She's very small and very pretty.

381
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,360
(shy)

382
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,600
ZI XUAN LI: This is called
DOU ZI (bean) in Chinese.

383
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200

384

385
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,960
ZI XUAN LI: I wear this

386
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,600
ZI XUAN LI: during the competition.

387
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,312
ZI XUAN LI: This is about a habit
of mine during the dance practice.

388
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,080
(Self-check)
ZI XUAN LI: I watched the video clips repeatedly to check the proper dance positions.

389
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
(Self-check)
ZI XUAN LI: I watched the video clips repeatedly to check the proper dance positions.

391
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,920
(Made a mistake)

392
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,000
(Made a mistake)
ZI XUAN LI: You still can't see it all.

393
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,400
ZI XUAN LI: He said I'm a woman
who likes taking photos.

394
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
SHEN: Sorry, sorry.

395
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,760
SHEN: How much have you practiced?

396
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,040
SHEN: Normally, I have to practice
with others to understand.

397
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,160
(Start practicing)

398
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,840
(First training together)
SHEN: Miss, we need to...

399
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,880
(Not easy to speak out)
SHEN: We have to communicate a bit emotionally.

400
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,720
SHEN: Better stand this way.

401
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
ZI XUAN LI: This side?

402
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,080
SHEN: And like this.

403
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,640
(Demonstration)

404
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
(Let me think)

405
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,840
HIKARU: SHEN.

406
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
(Confused)

407
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,960
ZI XUAN LI: Then I'll do this.

408
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,400
SHEN: Okay...

409
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
SHEN: Yes, and then...

410
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,840
SHEN: Right. Then just rotate
with your hand.

411
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,480
TADALEE: Go.

412
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,400
(Easy to learn) - TADALEE: Okay.

413
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,520
(Easy to learn)
B: Got it.

414
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,760
ZI XUAN LI: Okay, bye bye.

415
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
B: Thanks for practicing hard.

416
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,480
SHEN: Indeed, at first

417
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,880
SHEN: we weren't very close,

418
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
(Too shy to make eye contact)
SHEN: didn't dare to communicate emotionally.

419
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
SHEN: This is the first time.
It's really the first time.

420
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,880
(The entire body was stiff)

421
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
(In a dilemma)

422
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,560
TADALEE: Five, six, seven, eight

423
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,000
ZI XUAN LI: Everyone might

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,360
ZI XUAN LI: feel a little awkward.
We are not familiar with each other.

425
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,360
(CAN, CAN, CAN)
DANCE TEACHER: Can. Can.

426
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
ZI XUAN LI: Can't do it.

427
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,840
TADALEE: Not yet.

428
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,400
TADALEE: ZI XUAN LI is very cute.

429
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
TADALEE: But, when working together,

430
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,960
TADALEE: But, when working together,

431
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,560
(Great)
TADALEE: I feel good.

432
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,200

B: So good.

434
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,960
TADALEE: As soon as she came in,

435
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,320
TADALEE: she quickly got
the steps right.

436
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,000
TADALEE: So, I feel this is
someone who

437
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,640
TADALEE: had very little time
but she could do everything good.

438
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,080
TADALEE: She remembered the steps well,
could do this and that very quickly.

439
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,800
(Great)

440
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,040

HIKARU: A legendary person.

443
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,960
HIKARU: She can remember
the dance steps almost instantly,

444
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,720
HIKARU: and dance

445
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,880
(Demonstrated good professionalism)
HIKARU: in sync right away.

446
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
HIKARU: I feel she is really amazing.

447
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,200
DANCE TEACHER: Yes, yes.

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,680
SHEN: Good.

449
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
HIKARU: What the actual performance
will be like?

450
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,680
HIKARU: I eagerly look forward to it.

451
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
JEFF: Nice.

452
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,080
AGUANG: Oh, my God.

453
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,800
SHOYA: I feel a bit bad to say this,

454
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,200
SHOYA: but my eyes were fixed
on SHEN alone.

455
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,560
SHOYA: That's how much
SHEN's performance stuck in my memory.

456
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
SHOYA: I think I might be
becoming a fan of his.

457
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,760
BAMBAM: Okay, first, let me ask,
you know, our special guest.

458
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,920
BAMBAM: How does it feel to work
with all the boys for the first time?

459
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,280
ZI XUAN LI: On the first day we met,

460
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,960
ZI XUAN LI: the PD told me
that my face was very red.

461
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,640
ZI XUAN LI: Honestly, this is a genre
that I've never tried on stage before.

462
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,200
ZI XUAN LI: For me, it's something
new and challenging.

463
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,000
BAMBAM: Alright, so, you know, now we
have to go to voting for PYTHON,

464
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,320
BAMBAM: and then we've got to see
who will become the MVP for this team.

465
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,000

508
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,880
BAMBAM: I wanna know what JEFF and YAYA

509
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,240
BAMBAM: think about this performance?

510
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,840
BAMBAM: JEFF, what do you feel?

511
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,560
(This song is hard to sing)
JEFF: I think this song is hard to sing

512
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,960
(This song is hard to sing and hard to perform)
JEFF: and hard to perform too.

513
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,360
JEFF: Because the dance,
they changed the dance...

514
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,240
- BAMBAM: Every move.
- JEFF: Yeah, every move.

515
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,840
JEFF: I just love how they put
the story into the choreograph

516
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,440
JEFF: while they use the guest
in the best efficient way to use it.

517
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,120
JEFF: I just love it.

518
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,320
JEFF: But, I wonder one thing.

519
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,160
JEFF: Because they changed
the entire choreography,

520
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,880
JEFF: I couldn't remember
the original one from GOT7.

521
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,360
JEFF: So, BAMBAM,
could you please just...

522
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
- BAMBAM: The original one?

527

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
BAMBAM: Oh, God.

529
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,640
(Planned to perform for the first time with GOT7)
BAMBAM: I was planning to save this dance for GOT7.

530
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,680
JEFF: Let's go!

531
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,440
YAYA: BAMBAM!

532
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,000
(SHY)
BAMBAM: I'm really shy. I'm shy a little bit.

533
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
(VERY EXCITED!)
BAMBAM: Oh, God damn.

534
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,240
BAMBAM: It's okay?

535
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,320
BAMBAM: It's okay. Let's go.

536
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,680

537
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,960
(ORIGINAL VERSION by BAMBAM)

538
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,440

JEFF: Yes.

548

BAMBAM: How do you like it,
the original PYTHON?

549
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,760
JEFF: I would say BAMBAM.

550
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,160
(Vote for BAMBAM)
JEFF: I vote for you.

551
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,400
BAMBAM: You vote for me?

552
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,440
(Like)
BAMBAM: Thank you so much, man.

553
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,080
BAMBAM: Alright, and YAYA,
how do you feel about this performance?

554
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,280
YAYA: It was sensual,
but it was still strong.

555
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,200
YAYA: And I just couldn't take
my eyes off all of you.

556
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,000
YAYA: TADALEE is really talented.

557
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,760
TADALEE: Thank you.

558
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,200
(Well done guys)
YAYA: Well done guys.

559
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
BAMBAM: You know, one thing
I wanna comment is

560
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,920
BAMBAM: you guys remixed this song
to really something else

561
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,160
BAMBAM: and I like it.

562
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,040
BAMBAM: But, you know, you guys did
everything yourselves

563
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,800
BAMBAM: and make PYTHON become

564
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,560
BAMBAM: your own song.

565
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,280
BAMBAM: I really like it.

566
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,160
BAMBAM: And I also agree with JEFF with,
you know, you guys have a story line, right?

567
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
BAMBAM: You know, some touchy,
touchy. Skin ship.

568
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,960
BAMBAM: You know, on the performance,
it was really great, man.

569
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
BAMBAM: I like it. Thank you.

570
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,120
BAMBAM: If I think the person
who caught my attention the most

571
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,360
BAMBAM: was

572
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
BAMBAM: HIKARU. You did really well.

573
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,680
BAMBAM: Your face expression
was the best.

574
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
BAMBAM: Alright, the result is here.

575
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
- KK: I think it must be SHEN.
- TRAINEES: I think it's

576
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,160
- AGUANG: I think number one.
- TRAINEES: HIKARU.

577
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,920
PRAY: Not necessarily.

578
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,200
- GEN1ES DIDI: Who? SHEN? What do you think?
- PRAY: I'm not sure.

579
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,800
- LYU: SHEN.
- SHOYA: SHEN.

580
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,600
DORN: The two people who really
caught my eyes.

581
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
DORN: Everything is perfect
with good composition.

582
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,960
DORN: They are TADALEE and SUNNY.

583
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,720
PEANUT: For the person who fits
the song the best,

584
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,640
PEANUT: it should be HIKARU,
in my opinion.

585
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:58,880
BAMBAM: So, the MVP of PYTHON team is...

586
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,280
(MVP, SHEN)
BAMBAM: Give it up for SHEN.

587
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,480
YAO ZIHAO: That's it.

588
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,160
BAMBAM: Please say something.

589
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,280
SHEN: This isn't like last time.
This is the second time I've got MVP.

590
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,560
SHEN: This time I want to confidently
say that MVP was expected,

591
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,920
SHEN: because I really worked hard
for this performance.

592
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,040
SHEN: Because at first, I couldn't
dance well at all.

593
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,960
SHEN: I had to practice controlling
facial expressions and body movements.

594
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,000
SHEN: Because my body
doesn't have much muscle.

595
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,520
SHEN: I'm too thin.
So it was quite difficult.

596
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,760
SHEN: And in our team,
TADALEE is the best dancer,

597
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,680
SHEN: so he is suitable
for the center and leader.

598
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,760
SHEN: And I have to thank
the entire team.

599
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,080
SHEN: Thanks to ZI XUAN LI.
Thank you, mentors.

600
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,440
SHEN: Finally, I want to talk
about my close friend.

601
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
SHEN: HIKARI, let's go!

602
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,640
SHEN: This MVP, to be honest,
when I got it,

603
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,520
SHEN: I was quite surprised.

604
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,040
SHEN: From now on, I will have
more confidence in myself.

605
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,720
SHEN: This MVP for the second public
stage is not beyond my expectations.

606
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,440
TADALEE: I am happy and proud of SHEN.

607
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,800
TADALEE: No matter who gets the MVP,

608
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,440
TADALEE: I am happy and pleased for him.

609
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,960
TADALEE: Definitely, because I believe,
and I see that all these five people

610
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
TADALEE: are capable people,
and have a very clear self-identity.

611
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,320
TADALEE: And today, SHEN was great.

612
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,640
TADALEE: We are happy for him.

613
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,920
BAMBAM: Do you think
you can win WHEN WE DISCO?

614
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,560
B: We can win, because we have TADALEE.

615
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,840
B: Definitely, we can compete with DORN.

616
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,160
BAMBAM: You guys are really boasting.

617
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,800
BAMBAM: Alright, SHEN,

618
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,080
BAMBAM: something to XIONG?

619
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,320
WUXUN: What do you mean by that face?

620
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,080
SHEN: You speak first.

621
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,360
(You did a great job!)
XIONG: You did a great job.

622
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,400
SHEN: Ah! Thank you.

623
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,880
- SHEN: Thank you.
- XIONG: I'm proud of you.

624
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,320
XIONG: But we're fastened to
the chairs. We simply can't depart.

625
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,280
SHEN: Competing with them
is quite tough,

626
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,560
SHEN: but I won't give up.

627
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,600
SHEN: And I believe that my team's
dancing skills are quite good.

628
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,040
SHEN: I think we can compete
against them with ease.

629
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,440
SHEN: I will be standing up there soon.

630
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,520
BAMBAM: Okay.

631
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,920
BAMBAM: I know you guys
are good friends,

632
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,560
BAMBAM: but it's time to announce
who will sit on the MVP section.

633
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,960
BAMBAM: And the team that will sit
on the MVP section.

634
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
YAYA: Which one do you like more?

635
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,320
YAYA: Everyone completed perfectly.

636
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,320
JEFF: It comes with energy.

637
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,960
BAMBAM: Give it up for WHEN WE DISCO.

638
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,760
BAMBAM: So, everybody, please
give it up for PYTHON one more time.

639
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,720
BAMBAM: Thank you so much
for all your hard work.

640
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,400
BAMBAM: And please make
some noise for ZI XUAN LI.

641
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,640
BAMBAM: Thank you. Thank you so much.

642
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,680
TADALEE: After the performance,
I feel very relieved.

643
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,000
TADALEE: We gave our best effort here.

644
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,560
TADALEE: And we feel that
we have no regrets.

645
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,240
BAMBAM: WHEN WE DISCO,
congratulations one more time.

646
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
AUDIENCES: Good job.

647
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,960
BAMBAM: The next stage is
something really different.

648
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,640
BAMBAM: This is the hottest song
in the vocal position.

649
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,360
BAMBAM: So, now let's welcome
center trainee, KOHI.

700
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,440
KOHI: I just thought it would feel
so different when I sang it.

701
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,680
KOHI: Once we started singing,

702
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,280
KOHI: we realized that if we sing
in the original key, we would go mad.

(Easy to break the sound)
SMART: The vocal technique

704
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,800

705
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,800

our intonation or our slide technique.

706
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960

713
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,120
KOHI: To be honest, I'm also worried

714
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,280
KOHI: to lead this group of friends

715
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,320
KOHI: to challenge ourselves
with such a difficult song.

716
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,840
KOHI: I wonder if we can actually do it.

717
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,280
KOHI: Because this song
is for women song.

718
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,960
KOHI: We will feel it hard.

719
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,800
BIANURA: We still cannot reach the note,

720
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,720
BIANURA: so we're trying
to drop the key.

721
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,960
BIANURA: Singing is more comfortable.

722
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,040
BIANURA: And then we dropped again.

723
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,640

724
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,280

BIANURA: Minus 2.

729
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,000
BIANURA: So, our problem is...
We have tried but...

730
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,800
BIANURA: For my part,
dropped by 1 key, yet

731
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,400
BIANURA: it's still too high.

732
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,760
BIANURA: I think like the power
in the original.

733
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,440
BIANURA: But it's quite hard
to another parts.

734
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,120

747

871
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,000
TIA RAY: So, everybody remembers me.

872
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,200
TIA RAY: I've loved singing
since I was a child.

873
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,880
TIA RAY: But, I was shy
since I was a child.

874
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,760
TIA RAY: And my mom never knows
that I like to sing.

875
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,160

practicing by myself.

BIANURA: Oh, my God.

877
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,400
TIA RAY: Because I was afraid that
people wouldn't like it.

878
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,040

I won to a competition in the school.

I got second.

884
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,200

TIA RAY: Without telling her,
as a surprise.

886
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,080
TIA RAY: So she saw me on the TV show.

887
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,800
TIA RAY: And then she cried.

888
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,760

889
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,200
TIA RAY: she was wrong.

890
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,680
TIA RAY: And she didn't know that I've
been loving singing for these years.

891
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,200
TIA RAY: So, she called me and she said

892
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,080
TIA RAY: "I am your biggest fan
in the world."

893

is really proud of)

I am more brave than her,

896

TIA RAY: because she had a music dream.

897

With the full energy.

989
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,120
TIA RAY: And then, afterward, KOHI said

990
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,680
TIA RAY: "I feel like I can do it.
The original key."

991
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,960
BAMBAM: They need someone to,
you know...

992
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,360
- TIA RAY: Encourage.
- BAMBAM: Put their confidence a bit.

993
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,280
- TIA RAY: Right.
- BAMBAM: Yeah.

994
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,800
TRAINEES: Thank you, TIA RAY.

995
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,960
SHOYA: Thank you very much.

996
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,800
- TIA RAY: You're welcome.
- KOHI: Thank you!

997
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,720
BAMBAM: Alright, so before we
move on to voting.

998
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,560
BAMBAM: You know, let's start
from one by one,

999
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,120
BAMBAM: anything they wanna
say to the fans.

1000
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,400
BAMBAM: Start with SMART.

1001
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,640
SMART: Hello, I'm SMART, number one.

1002
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,240
SMART: Today, I'm here to sing a song

1003
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,000
SMART: about dreams.

1004
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,880
SMART: So, I want to carry
the dreams of my friends in this show.

1005
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,560
SMART: I want to keep doing this.

1006
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,040
SMART: If you like my singing today,

1007
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,800
SMART: don't forget to vote for me.

1008
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,920
SMART: Thank you.

1009
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,120
AUDIENCE: Good job.

1010
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,240
JUNHAN: Hello everyone.

1011
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,600
JUNHAN: I also want to sing
on this stage.

1012
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,040
JUNHAN: So, I treated it
as the idea that

1013
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,640
JUNHAN: this might be
my final stage here,

1014
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,880
JUNHAN: and I had the intention
of singing for everyone.

1015
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,440
JUNHAN: And I want to tell everyone that
this is my dream.

1016
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,240
JUNHAN: Please vote for me.

1017
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,200
JUNHAN: I will take care of you.

1018
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,680
KOHI: Hello.

1019
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,680
KOHI: I'm KOHI. I number three.

1020
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,320
KOHI: Ladies are beautiful.

1021
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,760
KOHI: Beautiful ladies.

1022
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,440
BIANURA: I'm number four.

1023
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,080
BIANURA: One, two, three,

1024
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,520
BIANURA: four.

1025
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,480
BIANURA: I'm BIANURA, number four.

1026
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,760
BIANURA: So, don't forget
to vote four, for me.

1027
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,360
BIANURA: And I will give
all of my love for you.

1028
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,200
BIANURA: That's it.

1029
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
SHOYA: Yeah! Thank you very much.

1030
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,880
SHOYA: Today, so happy.

1031
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,760
SHOYA: And thank you everyone
for supporting me.

1032
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,600
SHOYA: I wish you happiness.

1033
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,440
SHOYA: Thank you.

1034
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,640
SHOYA: Don't forget to vote for SHOYA.

1035
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,680
JEFF: Very queenly.

1036
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,480
BAMBAM: And now,

1037
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,640
BAMBAM: let's see who will become
the MVP of the team.

1038
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,800
BAMBAM: The time is over.

1039
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,240
BAMBAM: JEFF.

1040
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,040
BAMBAM: it's a vocal team.

1041
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,240
BAMBAM: What you think about this team?

1042
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,080
JEFF: Right, because this is
like a vocal team.

1043
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,560
JEFF: I just love
how they arranged everything

1044
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,880
JEFF: and they put
the harmonization at the end.

1045
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,680
JEFF: BIANURA, I think you
got the voice. You got the vocal.

1046
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,280
JEFF: But sometimes
you have to control it.

1047
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,880
JEFF: I think when you do
the high note at the end, like...

1048
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,400
JEFF: Something like that.

1049
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,360
JEFF: You dropped the mic down.

1050
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,520
- KOHI: Go.
- TIA RAY: Do it.

1051
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,520
(Trying the new technique...)

1052
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,240
TIA RAY: No, no, no.

1053
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,640
TIA RAY: No, no, no. Try JEFF's way.

1054
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,160
TIA RAY: Not to move the microphone.

1055
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,360
TIA RAY: Try to use your core
to control the fade.

1056
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,200
JEFF: Nice.

1057
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,400
JEFF: That. That's what
I'm talking about. Nice.

1058
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,520
BAMBAM: TIA RAY and JEFF,

1059
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,040
BAMBAM: you all should open the...

1060
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,920
(TIA RAY, JEFF Vocal Academy)
BAMBAM: vocal academy together.

1061
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,120
BAMBAM: Alright, YAYA,
what do you think?

1062
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,640
YAYA: TIA RAY, first of all.

1063
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,400
YAYA: Oh, my God.

1064
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,920
YAYA: I had goosebumps like

1065
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,560
YAYA: from the top of my head
to the bottom of my legs.

1066
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,160
YAYA: It was incredible.

1067
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:52,360
YAYA: And I think that contributed
to the overall beauty of the show.

1068
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,800
YAYA: I think it was
a very memorizing performance.

1069
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,800
YAYA: And again, SHOYA, I was
very pleasantly surprised.

1070
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,160
YAYA: I thought you were incredible.

1071
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,440
BAMBAM: So, the MVP
for I DREAM team goes to...

1072
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,560
(MVP, SHOYA)
BAMBAM: SHOYA.

1073
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,960
(VERY EXCITED!)
BAMBAM: Oh, God damn.

1074
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,120
BAMBAM: Congrats.

1075
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:33,240
JEFF: I think it's about finding
oneself in one's own strengths.

1076
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,880
JEFF: Even if there aren't many choices,

1077
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,320
JEFF: they still have to do
things they're not good at.

1078
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,600
JEFF: Like we saw SHOYA, who had always
been dancing, and now he's singing.

1079
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:46,000
JEFF: He feels that he likes singing.

1080
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,600
JEFF: Sometimes,
it brings something new.

1081
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:52,360
JEFF: I think it reveals one's true self
and challenges someone on the stage.

1082
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,800
BAMBAM: SHOYA, congratulations.

1083
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,800
BAMBAM: Anything you wanna
say to the fans?

1084
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,480
SHOYA: Thank you guys for voting me.

1085
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,040
SHOYA: And one thing,

1086
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,200
SHOYA: KOHI always teaches me
the vocal skills.

1087
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,480
SHOYA: Before, our show,
UNDER THE MOON ROAD.

1088
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,200
SHOYA: He always teaches me.

1089
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,400
(REHEARSAL DAY)
SHOYA: Then, I tried.

1090
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,880
SHOYA: So, I wanna tell thank you KOHI.

1091
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,200
SHOYA: Really. Really.

1092
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,120
SHOYA: Thank you.

1093
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,920
SHOYA: Why are you crying?

1094
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,400
SHOYA: Don't cry, why?

1095
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,560
SHOYA: Yeah.

1096
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,400
SHOYA: What?

1097
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,400
KOHI: To be honest,
SHOYA did very well today.

1098
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,160
KOHI: Actually, SHOYA's dance break
section used to be mine,

1099
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,400
KOHI: but given our time constraints

1100
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,800
KOHI: and to benefit our team,

1101
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,080
KOHI: it was more effective
for SHOYA to take over

1102
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,440
KOHI: that part instead of me.

1103
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,840
KOHI: I am truly happy inside.

1104
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,240
BAMBAM: Okay, and let's see if I DREAM

1105
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,200
BAMBAM: can take over WHEN WE DISCO.

1106
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,680
BAMBAM: You guys ready?

1107
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,680
BAMBAM: The MVP for this round is...

1108
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,360
TIAN QI: I DREAM.

1109
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,600
TIAN QI: When talking about I DREAM,
I feel that

1110
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,600
TIAN QI: it brings a lot of surprises.

1111
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,200
TIAN QI: It's...

1112
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
TIAN QI: It's really melodious.

1113
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,200
TIAN QI: It's melodious. So,

1114
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:19,840
TIAN QI: I get goosebumps
all over my body.

1115
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,200
DONGDONG: I DREAM.

1116
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,280
DONGDONG: I think
everyone is really good.

1117
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,560

has their own strengths.

WUXUN: But I'll help everyone
finish the song.

1313
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:24,963
WUXUN: The overall style

1314
01:12:24,963 --> 01:12:25,883
(FIGHTING)
WUXUN: might be a bit more uplifting.

1315
01:12:25,923 --> 01:12:27,843
WUXUN: The dance moves might need

1316
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,243
(FIGHTING) (AFRO)
WUXUN: some Afrobeat elements.

1317

(FIGHTING AFRO)

1318
01:12:31,843 --> 01:12:34,363
THI-O: A song that I

1319
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:36,283
THI-O: once nearly released.

1320
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:38,203
- THI-O: I want you guys to listen to it.
- TRAINEES: Okay.

1321
01:12:38,203 --> 01:12:39,003

1322
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:43,403
WHYLUCAS: Yeah, like Firework.

1323
01:12:43,403 --> 01:12:44,483

HU YETAO: Yeah.

1325
01:12:45,563 --> 01:12:47,403
(SIMILAR STYLE)
TRAINEES: Similar style.

1326
01:12:47,843 --> 01:12:49,683
HU YETAO: Should we make it
a bit stronger?

1327
01:12:49,723 --> 01:12:54,963
HU YETAO: This is too light. Too light.

1328
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,803
(OBJECTIONS)
HU YETAO: We need something stronger.

1329
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,843
HU YETAO: More handsome.

1330
01:12:59,883 --> 01:13:00,923

(COUNTDOWN - DAY 11)

1338
01:13:14,203 --> 01:13:16,563
(SECOND MEETING)
HU YETAO: Everyone has to think now

1339
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,243
HU YETAO: whether this song
will be cute or sexy,

1340
01:13:18,283 --> 01:13:19,523
HU YETAO: or just cool.

1341
01:13:19,523 --> 01:13:24,563
THI-O: I want... I want...
You know, I want

1342

- WHYLUCAS: Oh.

1348
01:13:36,403 --> 01:13:38,003
HU YETAO: I think we can add
more warrior spirit.

1349
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:38,843
(STRONG HANDSOME WARRIOR)
HU YETAO: Like going into a battle.

1350
01:13:38,843 --> 01:13:40,243
(STRONG HANDSOME WARRIOR) - YUCHEN: The visuals.
- THI-O: Yeah, yeah.

1351
01:13:40,243 --> 01:13:41,723
(STRONG HANDSOME WARRIOR DUNE) YUCHEN: I want it to have
the vibe of the movie DUNE.

1352
01:13:43,283 --> 01:13:43,683
THI-O: I'm okay.

1353

(COMPROMISE)

1354
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:46,843

discussion is over,

1356
01:13:50,363 --> 01:13:50,643

YUCHEN: I think.

1357
01:13:50,643 --> 01:13:54,123
(Reach an agreement The first meeting is over)WUXUN: For our ORIGINAL team, I think
whoever wants to showcase something,

1358
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:55,563
(FREE TO CREATE)
WUXUN: just give it their all.

1359

WUXUN: THI-O and WHYLUCAS

1360
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:58,323
(ARRANGE)
WUXUN: have some knowledge in song arrangement.

1361
01:13:58,323 --> 01:14:00,523
(LYRICS)
WUXUN: HU YETAO said his part wasn't written well,

1362
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,083
(LYRICS)
WUXUN: but he insists on writing it himself.

1363
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:03,963
(LYRICS)
WUXUN: Once he's done, I'll help adjust it.

1364
01:14:03,963 --> 01:14:06,603
WUXUN: YUCHEN is thinking
about the melody of some hooks.

1365
01:14:06,603 --> 01:14:08,843
WUXUN: Everyone is working really hard.

1366
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,043
WUXUN: We four are busy writing lyrics.

1367
01:14:11,043 --> 01:14:13,963
(Each one is doing their own duties) (LYRICS) (ARRANGE)WUXUN: As for them, they're
busy arranging the melody in the room.

1368
01:14:13,963 --> 01:14:14,923
(O!)
WHYLUCAS: Oh!

1369
01:14:16,683 --> 01:14:17,803

WHYLUCAS: En! Ye!

1370
01:14:19,603 --> 01:14:20,203
THI-O: Let me listen to it.

1371
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:21,883
THI-O: I was making music with WHYLUCAS

1372
01:14:21,923 --> 01:14:23,963
THI-O: until four, five,
six in the morning.

1373
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:25,763
THI-O: Then continue practicing
in the morning.

1374
01:14:25,763 --> 01:14:26,923
THI-O: Sometimes we argue.

1375
01:14:26,923 --> 01:14:28,563
THI-O: Then, there are times when...

1376
01:14:28,563 --> 01:14:30,683
THI-O: Don't do it like this,
mine is cooler.

1377
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:32,843
THI-O: WHYLUCAS would say, nah, bro,
mine is cooler.

1378
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,963
THI-O: It's like friendly
battling with each other.

1379
01:14:34,963 --> 01:14:37,963
THI-O: He's my brother.
He's my producer-in-crime.

1380
01:14:37,963 --> 01:14:41,163
THI-O: I really like the time
working with WHYLUCAS.

1381
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:43,003

THI-O: I just want a meeting today.

1398
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,963
THI-O: So you guys give feedback.

1399
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:10,363
(1:30 a.m.)

1400
01:15:10,363 --> 01:15:14,083
(1:30 a.m.)

1401
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:16,643
(Pay close attention to the reaction)
(1:30 a.m.)

1402
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:19,803
WUXUN: This is acceptable as an intro,

1403
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:21,883
WUXUN: but if you use this as a hook,

1404
01:15:21,883 --> 01:15:23,563
- WUXUN: it feels like it's still...
- WHYLUCAS: I don't think it's quite there.

1405
01:15:23,563 --> 01:15:24,843
(NOT ENOUGH!)
WUXUN: Not there yet.

1406
01:15:24,843 --> 01:15:26,963
YAO ZIHAO: I think the overall style
of this song

1407
01:15:26,963 --> 01:15:29,123
YAO ZIHAO: doesn't quite
have the warrior spirit.

1408
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:30,683
(The musical style doesn't
carry enough tension)

1409
01:15:30,683 --> 01:15:31,843
(The musical style doesn't carry enough tension)
HU YETAO: But if you ask me,

1410
01:15:31,843 --> 01:15:33,963
(The overall vibe is off. The overall tone needs tweaking)HU YETAO: the overall vibe
and tone are not right yet.

1411
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:36,363
HU YETAO: It's not just the intro
that's problematic.

1412
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:37,683
YAO ZIHAO: It's not just one part.

1413
01:15:37,723 --> 01:15:38,723
(FIRST DEMO FAILED)

1414
01:15:38,723 --> 01:15:41,723
THI-O: Yes, making music is

1415
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:46,203
THI-O: being ready to understand
everyone's opinions.

1416
01:15:46,203 --> 01:15:48,083
THI-O: And that's the key element
in creating music.

1417
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,683
THI-O: Everyone's opinions

1418
01:15:49,683 --> 01:15:51,163
THI-O: become

1419
01:15:51,163 --> 01:15:52,443
(INTEGRATION PROCESS)
THI-O: one.

1420
01:15:52,443 --> 01:15:53,723
(INTEGRATION PROCESS)
THI-O: one.

1421
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:55,723
HU YETAO: Because THI-O and WHYLUCAS
are really alike.

1422
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:56,723
HU YETAO: They are both musicians.

1423
01:15:56,883 --> 01:15:59,603
HU YETAO: I just need to bring
their musician mindset

1424
01:15:59,603 --> 01:16:01,323
HU YETAO: into the survival show.

1425
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,323
HU YETAO: The other parts,
I think there's no need to worry.

1426
01:16:03,443 --> 01:16:04,923
(3:30 a.m. The second version of the demo is being revised)
THI-O: The rhythm right now.

1427
01:16:05,883 --> 01:16:07,483
THI-O: Me and WHYLUCAS worked on it.

1428
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:10,203
THI-O: We showed the group today.

1429
01:16:10,203 --> 01:16:11,243
THI-O: They gave feedback.

1430
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:12,763
- WHYLUCAS: Yeah.
- THI-O: Needing more energy.

1431
01:16:12,883 --> 01:16:14,283
(3:30 a.m.)
WHYLUCAS: This is for the team.

1432
01:16:14,283 --> 01:16:16,683
WHYLUCAS: It's three-thirty.
I need to wake up at six.

1433
01:16:16,683 --> 01:16:17,563
WHYLUCAS: But it's okay.

1434
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:18,123
WHYLUCAS: I give my all
in the second round.

1435
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:19,403
WHYLUCAS: I give my all
in the second round.

1436
01:16:19,403 --> 01:16:21,043
WHYLUCAS: Composed this song with
the other team members to make it good.

1437
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,643
WHYLUCAS: Composed this song with
the other team members to make it good.

1438
01:16:22,643 --> 01:16:24,363
WHYLUCAS: We discussed a lot.

1439
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:25,843
WHYLUCAS: We stayed up very late
for several nights.

1440
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:37,963
YUCHEN: Oh, my God!

1441
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:39,403
THI-O: It was a lot of fun
in this process.

1442
01:16:39,403 --> 01:16:42,203
THI-O: But what I concern
the most is the time.

1443
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:43,243
THI-O: Because the time is very tight.

1444
01:16:43,243 --> 01:16:43,763
THI-O: Because the time is very tight.

1445
01:16:43,763 --> 01:16:46,523
(Countdown: 6 days) THI-O: We finished the song, but
we haven't finished choreographing.

1446
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:49,483
THI-O: It's quite tough.

(Countdown: 5 and a Half Days left)

1449

DANCE TEACHER: Before this,
you guys said that

1450
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:04,003
DANCE TEACHER: the style
would be wasteland, right?

1451
01:17:04,003 --> 01:17:08,603
DANCE TEACHER: This style, at first
feels more like @@

1452
01:17:08,603 --> 01:17:10,083
(There is a deviation in style)

1453
01:17:10,723 --> 01:17:14,963
DANCE TEACHER: At the beginning,
the special guest will use...

1454
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,723
HU YETAO: The special guest will
come out at the beginning?

1455
01:17:16,723 --> 01:17:17,763
DANCE TEACHER: Yes, she will come out
at the beginning.

1456
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:18,883

1460
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:25,403

YUCHEN: He cut out half of the first part.

1461
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:26,523
(WHYLUCAS advises changing this part)
HU YETAO: Why?

1462
01:17:26,523 --> 01:17:27,563
HU YETAO: Now, as I listen to it,

1463
01:17:27,563 --> 01:17:29,443
HU YETAO: from beginning to end, both
the content of the song

1464
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:31,083
HU YETAO: and everything else fit well.

1465
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,483
HU YETAO: We just adjust the parts
that aren't melodious.

1466
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,403
HU YETAO: Just make them more melodious.

1467
01:17:35,403 --> 01:17:37,963
YUCHEN: Actually, the biggest problem
is the continuous revisions.

1468
01:17:37,963 --> 01:17:39,723
YUCHEN: Everyone has their own opinions.

1469
01:17:39,723 --> 01:17:41,603
YUCHEN: Continually revising
without stopping.

1470
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:43,043
YUCHEN: Whether it's the structure,

1471
01:17:43,043 --> 01:17:44,283
YUCHEN: the music,

1472
01:17:44,283 --> 01:17:46,963
YUCHEN: or each person's part,
it's been revised all the time.

1473
01:17:46,963 --> 01:17:47,923
(Practice)
(Countdown - Day 05)

1474
01:17:47,923 --> 01:17:49,363
(Practice)
(Countdown - Day 04)

1475
01:17:49,363 --> 01:17:51,283
HU YETAO: I think we should cut
the dance break part.

1476
01:17:51,283 --> 01:17:51,763
(Prepare to remove the dance break)

1477
01:17:51,763 --> 01:17:53,363
(Prepare to remove the dance break)
HU YETAO: Because now there's no time,

1478
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:55,283
(Prepare to remove the dance break 1. There is not enough time)
HU YETAO: and it's too hard

1479
01:17:55,283 --> 01:17:56,523
(Prepare to remove the dance break 1. There is not enough time 2. The difficulty level is too high)
HU YETAO: to dance.

1480
01:17:56,523 --> 01:17:57,763
YUCHEN: We should add more lyrics.

1481
01:17:57,763 --> 01:17:59,283
(Add a new section of content)
YUCHEN: This part.

1482
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:01,643
YUCHEN: WHYLUCAS and THI-O's part.

1483
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:02,883
YUCHEN: WHYLUCAS and THI-O's part.

1484
01:18:03,163 --> 01:18:03,923
YUCHEN: THI-O's verse two,

1485
01:18:03,923 --> 01:18:05,563
YUCHEN: THI-O's verse two,

1486
01:18:05,563 --> 01:18:06,243
YUCHEN: split it for HU YETAO
and YAO ZIHAO to rap instead.

1487
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:09,403
YUCHEN: split it for HU YETAO
and YAO ZIHAO to rap instead.

1488
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,723
WHYLUCAS: Eventually, when
a lot of things changed,

1489
01:18:12,723 --> 01:18:13,563
WHYLUCAS: THI-O's part

1490
01:18:13,563 --> 01:18:14,563
WHYLUCAS: got a bit cut,

1491
01:18:14,563 --> 01:18:15,323
WHYLUCAS: got a bit changed.

1492
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,043
WHYLUCAS: and I think he felt maybe...

1493
01:18:17,043 --> 01:18:19,963
WHYLUCAS: He was worried that his part
might be reduced.

1494
01:18:20,443 --> 01:18:22,483
THI-O: Why is that?

1495
01:18:22,483 --> 01:18:25,443
THI-O: Do we really have to
split the lyrics?

1496
01:18:25,443 --> 01:18:26,883
(THI-O refuses to make changes)

1497
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:28,963
YUCHEN: Or how about this?

1498
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:30,523
YUCHEN: The first line
of the second part,

1499
01:18:30,523 --> 01:18:33,323
YUCHEN: my part.

1500
01:18:33,323 --> 01:18:34,323
YUCHEN: Then I'll split my lines
with you.

1501
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:35,723
(THI-O's solo adds new content)
(WHYLUCAS sings YUCHEN's part)

1502
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:37,563
WHYLUCAS: Then I'll help.

1503
01:18:37,563 --> 01:18:38,603
WHYLUCAS: I'll try to think for him.

1504
01:18:38,603 --> 01:18:40,643
- HU YETAO: Think for whom?
- WHYLUCAS: For THI-O.

1505
01:18:40,643 --> 01:18:42,083
- YAO ZIHAO: Huh?
- HU YETAO: Who?

1506
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,923
(For Him) YAO ZIHAO: The one with
the least lines is YUCHEN.

1507
01:18:44,963 --> 01:18:46,363
YAO ZIHAO: The one with
the least lines is YUCHEN.

1508
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:48,483
YAO ZIHAO: He also
cut out his own lines.

1509
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,723
YAO ZIHAO: If we're going to talk like this
again, there's no need to talk anymore.

1510
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,523
WHYLUCAS: I feel like help the team
in translation.

1511
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,363
WHYLUCAS: But lately,

1512
01:18:57,363 --> 01:19:00,163
WHYLUCAS: everyone has
differing opinions.

1513
01:19:00,163 --> 01:19:01,763
WHYLUCAS: So I feel I'm stuck
in the middle.

1514
01:19:01,763 --> 01:19:04,203
WHYLUCAS: Sometimes I feel
it's difficult.

1515
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:07,403
WHYLUCAS: Because I don't want to translate
the message to come across offensive.

1516
01:19:07,883 --> 01:19:09,443
WHYLUCAS: Because right now, I am

1517
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:10,883
WHYLUCAS: quite worried.

1518
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:13,403
(Depressed) WHYLUCAS: Don't know
if it will affect the performance.

1519
01:19:13,403 --> 01:19:13,643
(Depressed)

1520
01:19:13,643 --> 01:19:14,683
(Practice)
(Countdown - Day 04)

1521
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,043
(Practice)
(Countdown - Day 03)

1522
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:24,323
(Feeling Off)

1523
01:19:27,043 --> 01:19:28,483
WHYLUCAS: I think

1524
01:19:28,483 --> 01:19:31,483
WHYLUCAS: during the collaboration,
I became closer to THI-O.

1525
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:33,523
WHYLUCAS: So I will share
my own opinion with him.

1526
01:19:33,523 --> 01:19:35,043
WHYLUCAS: If all day long,

1527
01:19:35,043 --> 01:19:36,243
WHYLUCAS: he keeps thinking
about his part,

1528
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:39,043
WHYLUCAS: if he is sad all day,

1529
01:19:39,043 --> 01:19:41,483
WHYLUCAS: I think it would
affect everyone.

1530
01:19:41,483 --> 01:19:43,243
WHYLUCAS: It will bring down
everybody's mood.

1531
01:19:43,243 --> 01:19:45,603
WHYLUCAS: I told him
that I can feel his feelings.

1532
01:19:45,603 --> 01:19:47,963
WHYLUCAS: Because I am in the middle.

1533
01:19:47,963 --> 01:19:50,203
WHYLUCAS: So I said to him,
I think you need to, maybe,

1534
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:51,483
WHYLUCAS: look at the bright side.

1535
01:19:51,483 --> 01:19:52,843
(Let It Go)

1536
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:53,883
WHYLUCAS: I want to say,

1537
01:19:53,883 --> 01:19:56,323
WHYLUCAS: I think this will
always happen

1538
01:19:56,323 --> 01:19:59,563
WHYLUCAS: when you put a bunch
of different personalities together.

1539
01:19:59,563 --> 01:20:02,483
WHYLUCAS: Even the perfect family
sometimes quarrels.

1540
01:20:03,123 --> 01:20:06,243
(The family-like squad gathers,)
(Calling the guest...)

1541
01:20:06,243 --> 01:20:07,323

01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:15,163
(Signal is being transmitted...)

1546
01:20:16,683 --> 01:20:18,123
YAO ZIHAO: I am very busy today,

1547
01:20:18,123 --> 01:20:20,403
(Barrier-free communication)
YAO ZIHAO: so I couldn't come.

1548
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:21,563
THI-O: Are you sure...?

1549
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:22,603
THI-O: How did you get that?

1550
01:20:22,643 --> 01:20:23,843
YUCHEN: How do you know that?

1551
01:20:23,843 --> 01:20:25,203
YAO ZIHAO: I have very good hearing.

1552
01:20:25,203 --> 01:20:27,083
HU YETAO: Normally when I talk to you,
you don't understand anything.

1553
01:20:27,083 --> 01:20:28,563
(Don't mess around)

1554
01:20:28,563 --> 01:20:30,843
- YUCHEN: Wait.
- YAO ZIHAO: Hahaha, I was going to say...

1555
01:20:31,763 --> 01:20:33,443
(Glad to perform with you)

1556
01:20:33,443 --> 01:20:35,203
- HU YETAO: Glad to perform with you.
- YAO ZIHAO: Glad to perform with you.

YAO ZIHAO: Oh.

1558
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,483
HU YETAO: It is more of an honor for us
to perform with you.

1559
01:20:38,483 --> 01:20:40,283
- YAO ZIHAO: We are very glad to perform with you.
- HU YETAO: We are very glad.

1560
01:20:40,283 --> 01:20:43,003
(I can add my instrument into the music)
HU YETAO: I can...

1561
01:20:43,003 --> 01:20:45,643
(Looking forward to it)

1562
01:20:45,643 --> 01:20:46,643
WHYLUCAS: She'd add what?

1563
01:20:46,643 --> 01:20:47,523
THI-O: Instrument.

1564
01:20:47,523 --> 01:20:48,203
(The guest is skilled at playing musical instruments)
WHYLUCAS: Oh!

1565
01:20:48,203 --> 01:20:50,363
(The guest is skilled at playing musical instruments)
WHYLUCAS: Oh!

1566
01:20:50,363 --> 01:20:55,723
HU YETAO: But the part I inserted
will have some melody modifications.

1567
01:20:55,723 --> 01:20:56,243
(Yes!)

1568
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:58,723
HU YETAO: We are having problems
with the bridge right now.

1569
01:20:58,723 --> 01:21:01,363
HU YETAO: That is, THI-O wants to

1570
01:21:01,363 --> 01:21:04,123
HU YETAO: sing on the backing track
during the bridge for you.

1571

YUCHEN: I guessed it already.

1590

HU YETAO: No need to talk about this.

1591
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,603
HU YETAO: Just hearing the voice,
I guessed it already.

01:22:34,243 --> 01:22:37,123
NANA OUYANG: I listened to your demo
and was very surprised.

1604
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:38,043
NANA OUYANG: So I

1605
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:39,683
(Immediately get into work mode)
NANA OUYANG: tried to add my ideas.

1606

to the melody that I adjusted.

1607
01:22:42,923 --> 01:22:44,523
NANA OUYANG: It should be THI-O

1608
01:22:44,523 --> 01:22:46,283
NANA OUYANG: who will sing harmony?

1609
01:22:46,283 --> 01:22:47,163
THI-O: Yes, the bridge part.

1610
01:22:47,163 --> 01:22:49,763
THI-O: But I just listened to the demo.

1611
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:51,563
- THI-O: Today...
- NANA OUYANG: Yeah, I changed it a little bit.

1612
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:53,323
NANA OUYANG: Maybe I can
play for you guys

1613
01:22:53,323 --> 01:22:55,043
NANA OUYANG: and then we can discuss

1614
01:22:55,043 --> 01:22:58,443
NANA OUYANG: if you wanna, like,
do some change or anything.

1615
01:22:58,443 --> 01:23:00,723
YUCHEN: I think she is very gentle

1616
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:01,723
YUCHEN: and very talented.

1617
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:02,283

musical instruments.

(Everyone is completely satisfied)

1620
01:23:09,043 --> 01:23:11,003
NANA OUYANG: So I changed the melody
a little bit.

1621
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:18,003
NANA OUYANG: After that, I will

1622
01:23:18,643 --> 01:23:20,123

1623
01:23:20,123 --> 01:23:21,563

sing this part.

01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,603
(Supporter HU YETAO is online)HU YETAO: Now this part
is the most beautiful part of the song.

1625
01:23:23,603 --> 01:23:25,083
NANA OUYANG: No, not really.

1626
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:28,563
NANA OUYANG: At first, I was
quite worried

1627
01:23:28,563 --> 01:23:30,803
NANA OUYANG: because I can't dance.

1628
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:33,003
NANA OUYANG: What if I can't
get along with others?

1629
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:33,563
WHYLUCAS: You definitely can.

1630
01:23:33,563 --> 01:23:34,283
(Supporter WHYLUCAS is online)

1631
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,843
THI-O: If there is a sign
zero to infinity,

1632
01:23:36,843 --> 01:23:38,483
THI-O: it's our time
hold onto the right.

1633
01:23:38,483 --> 01:23:39,603
THI-O: It's time to rise.

1634
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,403
(Supporter THI-O is online)

1635
01:23:41,403 --> 01:23:43,803
THI-O: What's your inspiration
for writing this?

1636
01:23:43,803 --> 01:23:45,883
NANA OUYANG: From there, it's about like

1637
01:23:45,883 --> 01:23:47,043
NANA OUYANG: to embrace,

1638
01:23:47,043 --> 01:23:48,323
(Embrace)
NANA OUYANG: to like, find your way.

1639
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,323
NANA OUYANG: So I think
my appearance is like

1640
01:23:50,323 --> 01:23:51,723
NANA OUYANG: I'm out of your team,

1641
01:23:51,723 --> 01:23:54,043
NANA OUYANG: but I blessed you guys.

1642
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:54,923
(Think alike)

1643
01:23:54,923 --> 01:23:55,643
NANA OUYANG: Yeah.

1644
01:23:55,643 --> 01:23:57,243
HU YETAO: We designed the scene that
you are a goddess.

1645
01:23:57,243 --> 01:23:57,723
(Goddess)
NANA OUYANG: Really?

1646
01:23:57,723 --> 01:23:59,283
(Goddess)- HU YETAO: Yeah.
- NANA OUYANG: I'm a goddess. Okay.

1647
01:23:59,283 --> 01:24:01,163
NANA OUYANG: The lyrics are quite...

1648
01:24:01,163 --> 01:24:01,843
(Tacit Agreement)

1649
01:24:03,043 --> 01:24:05,723
THI-O: We can sing in unison
or do you want me...

1650
01:24:05,723 --> 01:24:07,203
THI-O: I can try harmonize?

1651
01:24:07,203 --> 01:24:08,723
- THI-O: Maybe?
- NANA OUYANG: Yeah. Or unison.

1652
01:24:08,723 --> 01:24:09,123
THI-O: Okay, unison.

1653
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:29,203
NANA OUYANG: Yeah.

1654
01:24:29,923 --> 01:24:32,403
THI-O: It's the lyrics and melody
that NANA OUYANG and I composed together

1655
01:24:32,403 --> 01:24:33,083
THI-O: for the bridge part.

1656
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:36,603
THI-O: I'm very happy that NANA OUYANG
would sing the melody I composed

1657
01:24:36,603 --> 01:24:39,003
THI-O: and the lyrics I wrote.

1658
01:24:39,003 --> 01:24:40,803
THI-O: Super happy how it turned out.

1659
01:24:40,803 --> 01:24:43,203
THI-O: She is super duper professional,

1660
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,803
THI-O: super duper respectful
of everyone.

1661
01:24:46,043 --> 01:24:47,723
HU YETAO: Because doing our own song
is starting from zero.

1662
01:24:47,723 --> 01:24:49,363
HU YETAO: We didn't even have a song

1663
01:24:49,363 --> 01:24:50,523
HU YETAO: or even a demo.

1664
01:24:50,523 --> 01:24:52,403
HU YETAO: Even the beat had to
be created anew.

1665
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:54,563
HU YETAO: Hence, arguments
are inevitable.

1666
01:24:54,563 --> 01:24:57,163
HU YETAO: Where there are people,
there will be arguments.

1667
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:59,083
THI-O: Simply put,

1668
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,523
THI-O: let's compare it to colors.

1669
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:03,043
THI-O: There might be purple,

1670
01:25:03,043 --> 01:25:06,003
THI-O: yellow, black, red, blue.

1671
01:25:06,003 --> 01:25:09,443
THI-O: But those colors, when combined,
will be one color.

1672
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:10,763
THI-O: it will be beautiful.

1673
01:25:13,043 --> 01:25:16,403
(ORIGINAL)

1674
01:29:20,883 --> 01:29:22,443
DUY: The melody is so good.

1675
01:29:22,443 --> 01:29:23,403
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: YAO ZIHAO

1676
01:29:23,403 --> 01:29:24,403
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: really surprised me.

1677
01:29:24,403 --> 01:29:26,683
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: His stage presence
is very good.

1678
01:29:26,683 --> 01:29:27,403
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: When he speaks
in private,

1679
01:29:27,403 --> 01:29:30,123
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: he is very much like
a young boy.

1680
01:29:30,123 --> 01:29:31,403
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: But when on stage,

1681
01:29:31,603 --> 01:29:33,803
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: his voice seems like
it belongs to another person.

1682
01:29:33,803 --> 01:29:37,083
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: It makes him look
quite charming

1683
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,083
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: and his voice
is powerful.

1684
01:29:38,083 --> 01:29:39,243
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: When he raps,

1685
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:41,163
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: it really resonates
with me.

1686
01:29:42,683 --> 01:29:43,963
Gen1es QIAO YIYU: It impressed me a lot.

1687
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:45,123
DORN: I was immersed. I was wondering

1688
01:29:45,123 --> 01:29:48,043
DORN: WHEN WE DISCO, can we beat them?

1689
01:29:48,243 --> 01:29:50,283
DORN: The first firework came, bang.

1690
01:29:50,963 --> 01:29:52,083
DORN: Still okay.

1691
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:54,123
DORN: When the cello comes, oh, we lose.

1692
01:29:55,443 --> 01:29:58,243
BAMBAM: You guys did an amazing job
of producing, huh.

1693
01:29:58,243 --> 01:29:59,763
BAMBAM: Really well. Really well.

1694
01:29:59,763 --> 01:30:01,563
BAMBAM: I want to ask NANA OUYANG.

1695
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,923
BAMBAM: How do you feel to work
with the boys for the first time?

1696
01:30:03,923 --> 01:30:09,283
NANA OUYANG: I think it's really a different
kind of style that I never tried.

1697
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:11,483
NANA OUYANG: But I know
it's their original song.

1698
01:30:11,483 --> 01:30:13,043
NANA OUYANG: So I respect them.

1699
01:30:13,043 --> 01:30:15,483
NANA OUYANG: And then, after I listened
to the demo,

1700
01:30:15,483 --> 01:30:20,083
NANA OUYANG: I was like, wow,
these guys are so talented.

1701
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:22,643
NANA OUYANG: So I'm impressed and...

1702
01:30:22,643 --> 01:30:24,803
NANA OUYANG: And then, after I listened
to the demo,

1703
01:30:24,803 --> 01:30:27,363
NANA OUYANG: I'm like okay, maybe
I can add cello

1704
01:30:27,363 --> 01:30:32,963
NANA OUYANG: and maybe the bridge,
I can sing in my own style.

1705
01:30:32,963 --> 01:30:35,283
NANA OUYANG: So, I mean
it's a great honor

1706
01:30:35,283 --> 01:30:39,603
NANA OUYANG: to work with these
wonderful talented trainees.

1707
01:30:39,603 --> 01:30:40,043
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you.

1708
01:30:40,043 --> 01:30:42,763
BAMBAM: Please give it up
for NANA OUYANG one more time.

1709
01:30:45,803 --> 01:30:48,563
BAMBAM: Alright, now it's time to vote.

1710
01:30:48,563 --> 01:30:50,323
BAMBAM: We are about to come to the end.

1711
01:30:50,323 --> 01:30:52,483
BAMBAM: And you know before voting,

1712
01:30:52,483 --> 01:30:53,723
BAMBAM: start from HU YETAO.

1713
01:30:53,723 --> 01:30:56,163
BAMBAM: You can say anything
to the fans.

1714
01:30:56,163 --> 01:31:00,443
HU YETAO: Please vote
for HU YETAO and my boys.

1715
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:05,603
HU YETAO: I'm No. 1.

1716
01:31:12,243 --> 01:31:14,563
THI-O: I'm still so shocked
by what Mom said.

1717
01:31:14,563 --> 01:31:15,323
THI-O: Okay.

1718
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,563
THI-O: Hello, I'm THI-O.

1719
01:31:19,563 --> 01:31:21,643
THI-O: The song earlier was a song
we composed ourselves.

1720
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:22,923
THI-O: Did you like it?

1721
01:31:22,923 --> 01:31:24,043
AUDIENCE: Yes!

1722
01:31:24,043 --> 01:31:25,723
THI-O: If you liked our performance,

1723
01:31:25,723 --> 01:31:27,683
THI-O: vote for all five of us.

1724
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:29,283

THI-O: you can vote for No. 2.
Thank you very much.

1726

YAO ZIHAO: Hello, I am YAO ZIHAO.

1727
01:31:35,163 --> 01:31:37,283
YAO ZIHAO: I'm No. 3.

1728
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,723
YAO ZIHAO: But

1729
01:31:39,723 --> 01:31:43,363
YAO ZIHAO: my Thai and English
very no good.

1730
01:31:43,363 --> 01:31:45,763
YAO ZIHAO: Because we are
the ORIGINAL team,

1731
01:31:45,763 --> 01:31:48,323
YAO ZIHAO: I think each of us is an MVP.

1732
01:31:48,323 --> 01:31:49,363
YAO ZIHAO: Thank you.

1733
01:31:50,323 --> 01:31:52,723
YUCHEN: Hello, my name is YUCHEN.

1734
01:31:53,163 --> 01:31:56,603
YUCHEN: I think MVP belongs
to all of us.

1735
01:31:56,603 --> 01:31:59,603
YUCHEN: I think the most important thing
is that we get to perform on this stage

1736
01:31:59,603 --> 01:32:01,203
YUCHEN: together with the best friends.

1737
01:32:01,203 --> 01:32:03,643
YUCHEN: It will be a memory that I will
never forget for the rest of my life.

1738
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:04,763
YUCHEN: Another thing,

1739
01:32:05,523 --> 01:32:07,243
YUCHEN: I know that my mom
must be watching.

1740
01:32:07,243 --> 01:32:08,643
YUCHEN: Just as the lyrics say,

1741
01:32:08,643 --> 01:32:10,203
YUCHEN: I want to make my mom proud.

1742
01:32:10,203 --> 01:32:12,883
YUCHEN: And I hope
you will be proud of me too.

1743
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:14,203
YUCHEN: Thank you.

1744
01:32:16,283 --> 01:32:17,843
WHYLUCAS: Hello everyone.

1745
01:32:17,843 --> 01:32:19,403
WHYLUCAS: WHYLUCAS again.

1746
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:21,843
WHYLUCAS: Thank you for voting for us.

1747
01:32:22,523 --> 01:32:24,923
WHYLUCAS: Thank you for voting
for all of us, so we can get here.

1748
01:32:24,923 --> 01:32:27,843
WHYLUCAS: I really enjoy writing the song
with everybody here.

1749
01:32:27,843 --> 01:32:28,843
WHYLUCAS: Lastly,

1750
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:31,843
WHYLUCAS: last time, I say I
want to go to Chatuchak, right?

1751
01:32:32,763 --> 01:32:33,763
WHYLUCAS: This time,

1752
01:32:34,163 --> 01:32:37,043
(Songkran)
WHYLUCAS: who wants to go to Songkran with me?

1753
01:32:41,203 --> 01:32:43,123
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you so much.

1754
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:45,283
BAMBAM: Alright.
For the last team, ALL STARS,

1755
01:32:45,283 --> 01:32:47,123
BAMBAM: the voting starts.

1756
01:32:57,203 --> 01:32:58,603
TADALEE: This is so hot.

1757
01:33:00,123 --> 01:33:01,923
BAMBAM: And the time's up.

1758
01:33:02,363 --> 01:33:06,243
BAMBAM: Alright, so while we waiting
for the results,

1759
01:33:06,803 --> 01:33:07,963
BAMBAM: TIA RAY,

1760
01:33:08,363 --> 01:33:10,643
BAMBAM: how do you feel
watching performances?

1761
01:33:10,883 --> 01:33:14,483
TIA RAY: I am very happy to see
an original performance on this stage.

1762
01:33:14,483 --> 01:33:18,123
TIA RAY: For idols, I think
it is a very rare opportunity.

1763
01:33:18,123 --> 01:33:20,203
TIA RAY: NANA OUYANG
has made this performance

1764
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:22,483
TIA RAY: more energetic

1765
01:33:22,483 --> 01:33:23,883
TIA RAY: and dimensional.

1766
01:33:23,883 --> 01:33:25,123
TIA RAY: But one thing.

1767
01:33:29,123 --> 01:33:30,243
TIA RAY: I think HU YETAO

1768
01:33:30,243 --> 01:33:31,883
TIA RAY: has shown everyone

1769
01:33:31,883 --> 01:33:34,843
TIA RAY: a different perspective
of you again in this performance.

1770
01:33:34,843 --> 01:33:36,323
TIA RAY: And this time you're very

1771
01:33:36,323 --> 01:33:37,083
(Powerful)
TIA RAY: powerful.

1772
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,403
(Powerful)
TIA RAY: Thank you.

1773
01:33:38,403 --> 01:33:39,683
HU YETAO: Thank you, TIA RAY.

1774
01:33:39,683 --> 01:33:42,003
TIA RAY: You guys did an amazing job,
thank you so much.

1775
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:44,483
BAMBAM: JEFF,
how do you feel about this?

1776
01:33:44,483 --> 01:33:46,523
JEFF: Right, the energy is good.

1777
01:33:46,523 --> 01:33:48,123
JEFF: I love the song.

1778
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:52,123
JEFF: This feels like
the debut song of a boy group.

1779
01:33:52,403 --> 01:33:54,043
- BAMBAM: I would say the same.
- JEFF: Yeah?

1780
01:33:54,043 --> 01:33:56,563
(go debut)
JEFF: So just go, go debut.

1781
01:33:58,763 --> 01:34:00,443
BAMBAM: Go debut now. Okay.

1782
01:34:00,443 --> 01:34:02,603

1790
01:34:24,163 --> 01:34:28,763
BAMBAM: Alright, now it's time
to announce the MVP of ALL STARS.

1791
01:34:30,283 --> 01:34:32,803
BAMBAM: I want everyone
to look at the front

1792
01:34:32,803 --> 01:34:34,603
BAMBAM: and close your eyes.

1793
01:34:34,603 --> 01:34:35,843
BAMBAM: Close your eyes.

1794
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:41,203

1795
01:34:47,203 --> 01:34:50,523
AGUANG: Regarding the ORIGINAL team,
I think it's THI-O.

1796
01:34:51,043 --> 01:34:52,803
AGUANG: Because his high pitch is great.

1797
01:34:52,843 --> 01:34:54,723
PEANUT: Honestly, I would
pick YAO ZIHAO, because

1798
01:34:54,763 --> 01:34:57,803
PEANUT: the rap part he performed
was very powerful.

1799
01:35:12,923 --> 01:35:13,883
YAO ZIHAO: I'm pleased.

1800
01:35:13,883 --> 01:35:16,683
YAO ZIHAO: And I got MVP today
perhaps because

1801
01:35:16,683 --> 01:35:18,523

1802
01:35:18,523 --> 01:35:20,603
YAO ZIHAO: I went back to doing
the genre of music I specialize in.

1803

BAMBAM: The scores are

1837
01:36:51,243 --> 01:36:52,643
BAMBAM: really close.

1838
01:36:52,963 --> 01:36:54,523
JACKSON: ORIGINAL team

1839
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:57,163
JACKSON: is the most suitable
to win the MVP.

1840
01:36:57,163 --> 01:37:00,363
JACKSON: Composed a song in four days

1841
01:37:00,363 --> 01:37:01,883
JACKSON: and choreographed
the dance themselves.

1842
01:37:02,043 --> 01:37:04,003
JACKSON: I think this is incredible.

1843
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:06,203
JACKSON: I never thought
it would be that good.

1844
01:37:06,443 --> 01:37:08,163
OMAR: WHEN WE DISCO.

1845
01:37:08,723 --> 01:37:11,963
OMAR: Because their lineup
is particularly strong.

1846
01:37:11,963 --> 01:37:14,603
OMAR: DORN is an amazing dancer.

1847
01:37:14,603 --> 01:37:16,483
OMAR: And there's also XIONG.

1848
01:37:16,483 --> 01:37:17,763
OMAR: XIONG is especially...

1849
01:37:17,763 --> 01:37:19,163
OMAR: His vibe is particularly cool.

1850
01:37:19,803 --> 01:37:23,883
OMAR: And I feel like
they were born for this song.

1851
01:37:23,883 --> 01:37:25,483
OMAR: PEANUT and NINJA.

1852
01:37:25,483 --> 01:37:31,163
OMAR: When NINJA wears sunglasses, he
really looks like a bad boy in TV dramas.

1853
01:37:31,163 --> 01:37:36,403
OMAR: PEANUT's outfit and makeup
suit this song very well.

1854
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:45,123
BIANURA: Yeah, the ORIGINAL has put a lot of effort
for this show, of the music, of the choreography, and of the concept.

TIAN QI: Probably WHEN WE DISCO.

1856
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:48,363
TIAN QI: It's really WHEN WE DISCO.

1857
01:37:48,923 --> 01:37:50,323
TIAN QI: I think their group...

1858
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:52,083
TIAN QI: Everyone can be the center.

1859
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:54,963

1860
01:37:55,763 --> 01:37:57,483

1876
01:38:44,443 --> 01:38:46,003
THI-O: Without NANA OUYANG, I'd say

1877
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,123
THI-O: we wouldn't be the MVP.

1878
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:50,603
YUCHEN: I think it's quite complete.

1879
01:38:50,603 --> 01:38:53,363
YUCHEN: When on stage,

1880
01:38:53,363 --> 01:38:56,363
