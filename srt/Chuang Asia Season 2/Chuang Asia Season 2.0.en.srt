1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,760
Idol gives a lot of impact to the world.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,079
For Koreans, being an idol

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,280
is considered a prominent profession.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,560
Good looks,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,760
or good at singing and dancing.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,520
Most Chinese idols

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,760
reach the peak
of their popularity during their debut.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,279
If they want to keep shining,

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,520
they need to find their own uniqueness.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,720
So that everyone can remember them.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,560
The image of idols
that I have always had in mind is that

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,080
they are like energy transmitters.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,720
Actually, what kind of energy is this?
Or what color is it?

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,960
We have to see all the colors
of this world before we can answer that.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
In my opinion,

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,400
Japanese trainees

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,360
are very good at dancing.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,240
They're giving off
a very professional vibe.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,000
It's like they are going
to "explode and burn" out of a sudden.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,680
They have personalities like
the characters in Crows Explode.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,840
For Chinese trainees,

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,200
I feel that they are all quite tall.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,440
They look very good.

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,309
For Malaysia trainees,

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,520
they live by the sea

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,440
and have sturdy bodies,

27
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,880
with tight and well-built muscles.

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,040
For Thai trainees,

29
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,440
I think they have

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,039
a manly charm, maybe a bit raw.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,200
Sexy and stuff like that.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Koreans know how to attract people.

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,879
They know what to do.

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,419
This year, there are contestants

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,959
from many countries

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
with different professions and countries.

37
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,199
From here on out,

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,080
I want to see the wider world.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,680
Because this is where youngsters
gather to showcase their talents.

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,520
I can be the best in Singapore,

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,319
but when you see the world
and meet the contestants,

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,559
we embrace the differences
and embrace the challenges.

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
This is the part
where I wanna work on myself.

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,160
We get to see the cultures
and skills from international friends.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,960
That is to open up a world
we have never seen.

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,880
I don't want to follow
the image of an idol

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
as commonly defined by people.

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,840
I feel that since we are
a world-class boy band,

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,040
we must do something different.

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Get out of your comfort zone.

51
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Explore the world.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,439
If they want to find themselves,

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,119
I will share the experiences I have

54
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
as someone
who has been an idol for 10 years.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,600
CHUANG ASIA S2
is similar to how I started.

56
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,080
When I first got my passport
and flew to Korea.

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
It's the best show I have ever seen.

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
CHUANG ASIA S2

59
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:39,560
is looking for a boy band that
can dance, have strong visuals, and sing

60
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
in different positions.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,560
They say that your eyes
are the windows to your soul.

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,280
So, when you see more,

63
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,560
you realize more.

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
I think you have found yourself.

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,480
But now it's time for you
to see the world.

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
Welcome to CHUANG ASIA.

67
00:02:57,056 --> 00:03:00,160
See the world. Find yourself.

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,936
=CHUANG ASIA S2=

69
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:13,728
Welcome to the orientation party
of CHUANG ASIA S2.

70
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,248
Sixty trainees
from 10 countries are here.

71
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:23,258
From this moment, your journey begins.

72
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:25,722
Meet your future teammates

73
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,922
and start chasing miracles together.

74
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:33,482
Let's welcome our trainees.

75
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:37,562
Welcome LIZI from China.

76
00:03:39,082 --> 00:03:44,402
The top ranking of the 2023
Guangdong Provincial Broadcasting Exam.

77
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:45,631
LIZI: Hello.

78
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,391

a former child model
who won a national competition.

82
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:01,562

LIZI: Oh, my God.

86
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,203
LIZI: So nervous.

87
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,202
LIZI: When I first walked in,

88
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:29,522
LIZI: I felt the camera
must have caught it.

89
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:30,883
LIZI: My ears were turning red.

90
00:04:32,683 --> 00:04:34,243
LIZI: My blood rushed to the max.

91
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:35,283
LIZI: Can I eat it?

92
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:36,043
- KAO: Hello.
- LIZI: Hello.

93
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,242

101
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:46,362
- LIZI: K-A-O?
- KAO: That's right.

102
00:04:46,363 --> 00:04:47,442
KAO: It's like the number 9.

103
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:48,482
- LIZI: I see.
- KAO: Yes.

104
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,203
- LIZI: Oh, I see.
- KAO: Yeah.

105
00:04:50,443 --> 00:04:51,123
- LIZI: I see.
- KAO: Yeah.

106
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,042
XIN: Hello everyone,
my name is CHEN DINGXIN.

107
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,922
XIN: I've been training in singing
and dancing for two and a half days,

108
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:07,483
XIN: but I've been training
in basketball for two and a half years.

109
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:11,802
PEAT: Hello, my name is PEAT.
Known as Suchanon Chuenluecha.

110
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,162
PEAT: I was an actor before this.

111
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:18,402
PEAT: I'm known as
"The Prince of Smiles."

112
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,882
PEAT: That's what the fans call me.

113
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:22,923
PEAT: I hope you like my smile.

114
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:25,642
PEAT: Hello!

115
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:26,443
PEAT: I'm...

116
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,762
PEAT: At first, I thought
we'd go straight in and perform.

117
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:38,842
PEAT: But in the end, it was like...

118
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:41,162
PEAT: Oh, it's about getting
to know each other first.

119
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,202
PEAT: Then I started to

120
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,163
PEAT: feel nervous.

121
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,042
- PEAT: Wow, it's cool, right?
- KAO: Very cool.

122
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:49,002

124
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:52,762
PEAT: Oh, my God.

125
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,882
LIZI: What's this?

126
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:54,803
PEAT: Cheese ball, right?

127
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,282
TRAINEES: Odd one out.

128
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,562
TRAINEES: Odd one out.

129
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:58,843
TRAINEES: Odd one out.

130
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:01,562
LIZI: You're the first one.

131
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:02,363
PEAT: LIZI.

132
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:05,163
PEAT: Let's take a photo.

133
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:06,563
KAO: Cheese.

134
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,002
- XIN: Cheese.
- PEAT: One, two, three.

135
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,043

136
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:15,363
PEAT: Anyway, I hope you like my smile.

137
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,403

140
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,442

141
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,322
JUNHAN: I studied the Thai language.

142
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,562
JUNHAN: I bought a book.
Can I say the name, which is funny?

143
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,802
JUNHAN: "Don't laugh. I'm a Thai book."

144
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,442
JUNHAN: And now,
I'm learning the basic Thai vocabulary,

145
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,963
JUNHAN: quite a lot of it.

146
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,243

TRAINEES: Hello.

152
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,363
LIZI: Chinese?

LU JUNXI: Yes, I'm Chinese.

154
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,083

TRAINEES: Hello.

161
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,096
TRAINEES: Hello.

162
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,136
- JUNHAN: Hello.
- LU JUNXI: Yes.

163
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:04,496

164
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,216

165
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,456

166
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,296
KAO: Thank you.

167
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,016
LU JUNXI: How long have you been here?

168
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,096
PEAT: For...

169
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:15,296
XIN: Five minutes?

170
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:16,136
LU JUNXI: Five minutes?

171
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,976
LU JUNXI: I chatted with them a lot.

172
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:21,535
LU JUNXI: Even though
we couldn't communicate,

173
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,216
LU JUNXI: I feel that
our spirits are already connected.

174
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,615
LU JUNXI: I say my sentence in Chinese

175
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,415
LU JUNXI: and insert

the song I'm presenting today is

00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,243
YAO ZIHAO: a very fun song
called 'Apology Letter'.

517
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,603
YAO ZIHAO: Why? When I first got here,
I once snuck out like a troublemaker.

518
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:10,203
YAO ZIHAO: And the instructor made me
write an apology letter.

each other first, then we can decide

00:25:33,643 --> 00:25:36,123
XIONG: who we want to perform with.

DAVID: the first stage in my mind

596
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:36,563
DAVID: is not the same style as his.

597
00:27:37,723 --> 00:27:38,323

in terms of looks.

602
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:02,563
WUXUN: And I hardly think
about who comes second.

603
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,443

there is enough.

that you remember quite well?

609
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:19,763
JUNHAN: If it comes to Thailand,
it's quite

610

NINJA: Welcome to Thailand, guys.

621
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,363
KAO: For me, it's not about everyone
being highly skilled,

622
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,483
KAO: but rather about having
their own unique character.

623
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:15,803
LIZI: So that everyone can remember
their own strengths.

624

679
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:44,923
WUXUN: Why would people come to me?

680
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:46,923
WUXUN: I didn't sing nor dance.

681
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,403
PRAY: Very good, super cool.

682
00:31:48,683 --> 00:31:49,843

00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:51,603
PRAY: Approaching the right person
on your own

684
00:31:51,883 --> 00:31:53,323
PRAY: is the best way.

685
00:31:55,843 --> 00:31:58,363

want to be with me? No.

686
00:32:04,843 --> 00:32:06,443
KEVIN: The advantage of our band
is that...

687
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:07,203
WEIZHI: It's not complicated.

688
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:11,163

00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:17,923
RYAN WINTER: Always support us.

693
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,522
YUCHEN: It's easy for me to choose teammates.

694
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,483
YUCHEN: It has to be

695
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,323
YUCHEN: someone I can get
along well with.

696
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:29,483
YUCHEN: Getting along is very important.

697
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:30,563
YUCHEN: WUXUN.

698
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,483
- YUCHEN: Do you have a group yet?
- WUXUN: Not yet

699
00:32:32,523 --> 00:32:33,963
- YUCHEN: I really want you.

700
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:36,243
YUCHEN: Let's go.

701
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:38,763
TRAINEES: Three, two, one, fighting!

702
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:40,243
TRAINEES: Fighting!

703
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:43,403
TRAINEES: Hello, we are 185+ CLUB.

704
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,403
TIAN QI: Oh, the envelope is too big.

705
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:45,963
JACKSON: Fold it in half.
Oh, you folded my face.

706
00:32:49,283 --> 00:32:51,362
DAVID: The four of us
are the same height.

707
00:32:51,363 --> 00:32:52,923
XIONG: At least someone will get an A.

708
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:56,563
TRAINEES: We are the best group.

709
00:32:56,603 --> 00:32:59,162
This is the last 5 minutes for you

710
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:01,083
to form your group.

711
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:02,603
GORDON: Everybody.

712
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:03,683
GORDON: Everybody.

713
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:06,723
GORDON: Right now, we have three vocals.

714
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:09,723
GORDON: And now, I want to find another
fairly good vocal, is it possible?

715
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:11,963
SUNNY: Vocal team.

716
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,963
GORDON:
Initially, I met DUY and HONG JIN.

717
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:17,843
GORDON: But what I'm thinking is...

718
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:20,723
GORDON: Is it necessary
to find the fourth person

719
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,043
GORDON: to create more possibilities?

720
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,363
GORDON: REXY.

721
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:25,323
GORDON: WUXUN.

722
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:26,683
GORDON: Bro.

723
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:27,723
GORDON: OMAR, you group?

724
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:29,683
GORDON: PEANUT, what kind of situation
are you in right now?

725
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,003
GORDON: Right now we have three,
missing one.

726
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,483
JIAHAO: What style
are you guys looking for?

727
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:34,923
GORDON: A leading vocal.

728
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,443
GORDON: It doesn't have to be the lead.
I can train.

729
00:33:37,043 --> 00:33:38,443
JIAHAO: I'm a dancer.

730
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,243
GORDON: It's hard.

731
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:45,683
DUY: It's so hard for me and GORDON
to find another teammate.

732
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:47,923
DUY: Thai people will enjoy with Thai people.

733
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:49,763
TRAINEES: Go! We are SUPER THAI.

734
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:50,603
DUY: Chinese too.

735
00:33:52,203 --> 00:33:53,283
DUY: Japanese too.

736
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,003
DUY: Korean too.

737
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,763
KOHI: Korean, Korean.

738
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:02,603
- KOHI: Oppa.
- TRAINEES: Oh, Oppa.

739
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:03,803
KOHI: So cool.

740
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:10,778
KOHI: Hello, it's nice to meet you.
My name is LEE JUNGHYUN.

741
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,258
KOHI: I'm the only Korean here.

742
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:14,378
KOHI: I'm a trainee from Korea.

743
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,218
KOHI: And I'm someone who wants
to debut on CHUANG ASIA S2.

744
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,938
GORDON: Whatever it takes, we'll just...
we'll bond it together for sure.

745
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,898
GORDON: Let me be honest.
We are the group with the best singing.

746
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:24,978
GORDON: The whole group gets A.

747
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:28,178
KOHI: Malaysia.

748
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:29,138
KOHI: Vietnam.

749
00:34:29,178 --> 00:34:29,938
KOHI: Canada.

750
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:30,698
KOHI: Korea.

751
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:33,178
KOHI: None of us
are from the same country.

752
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,058
KOHI: So, is there any team

753
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,498
KOHI: that can be as perfect as us?

754
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:38,698
TRAINEES: Showtime.

755
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:46,195
Who am I?

756
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:48,035
What do I want?
What do I want to communicate?

757
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:50,635
Until one day, I suddenly realized

758
00:34:50,995 --> 00:34:52,595
what kind of person I want to be.

759
00:34:55,875 --> 00:34:59,754
Before becoming part of a team,
you are yourself.

760
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,915
Therefore, you have to know yourself.

761
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,395
Know whether

762
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,594
you can become a good idol

763
00:35:06,595 --> 00:35:09,234
and are suited for this industry or not.

764
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:12,674
I hope to see the spark in them.

765
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,714
I hope they can surprise me.

766
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:18,715
I feel like, these days,
for the new people

767
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:21,075
who want to dance and sing,

768
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:23,074
they always just try to be

769
00:35:23,075 --> 00:35:25,395
someone they love, someone they like
all the time.

770
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:27,874
At the end of the journey,

771
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,475
they will realize that
being themselves is the best.

772
00:35:31,555 --> 00:35:33,715
But I feel like a lot of people still

773
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,515
don't know how to be themselves.

774
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:37,634
This program is gonna be

775
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,715
the best chance for
a lot of people to find their true...

776
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:42,395
selves.

777
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:46,635
This stage is like a filter,

778
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:50,554
allowing those who step onto it
to understand themselves even more,

779
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:51,874
to see themselves clearly.

780
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,474
Only those with true dreams,

781
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:57,675
those who are determined,
dedicated, and brave will remain.

782
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,674
See the world fully
and for what it truly is

783
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:02,075
in all its true details.

784
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:03,955
And also,

785
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:06,675
most importantly, don't stop searching.

786
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,514
Art is like... there are no boundaries.

787
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,834
You have to try different things
to realize

788
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:13,594
what you're good at, what you're not.

789
00:36:13,595 --> 00:36:15,874
Do your best, believe in yourself

790
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,595
and just

791
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,114
put in a hundred percent

792
00:36:19,115 --> 00:36:20,314
and it will definitely show.

793
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:21,155
Good luck.
