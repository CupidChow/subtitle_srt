(PREVIOUSLY)
HOST: Hello guys.

23

HOST: Welcome all the fans
of CHUANG ASIA S2.

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,360
HOST: Please welcome our 35 trainees!

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
HOST: Today, we will know it together.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,800
HOST: The trainees

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,440
HOST: who will advance
to the final grand debut night.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,560
HOST: In front of you,

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
HOST: there are three
differently colored areas.

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,720
(GROWTH)
HOST: Growth.

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,440
(FRIENDSHIP)
HOST: Friendship.

32
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,680
(OPPORTUNITY)
HOST: And Opportunity.

33
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
HOST: If you choose Growth,

34
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,880
(GROWTH)
HOST: go over there.

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,640
(GROWTH, FRIENDSHIP) HOST: If you choose
Friendship, stand right here in the middle.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
(GROWTH, FRIENDSHIP, OPPORTUNITY)
HOST: If you choose Opportunity,

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
HOST: stand here on your left.

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
HOST: Please choose one
out of three keywords

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,320
HOST: and stand in
the corresponding area.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,000
HOST: Mentors,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,680
HOST: if you had to choose
the most meaningful takeaway

42
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,800
HOST: from your path,

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
HOST: which keyword would it be?

44
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,240
JEFF: I would choose Opportunity.

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
JEFF: Opportunity for me is like,

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,920
JEFF: you have to go out,

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,920
JEFF: and do it and make it yourself.

48
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,960
JEFF: I mean, I learned a lot through

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,000
JEFF: all the journey that I've been to.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
JEFF: Every time that I go
to create my own opportunity.

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,560
JEFF: It's better not to wait
for others to create for you.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
JEFF: And you have to be
responsible for your choice.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,120
HOST: Thank you, JEFF. YAYA.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,880
YAYA: I would probably choose
Opportunity as well.

55
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,600
YAYA: Opportunity is not something
that comes about all the time.

56
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,880
YAYA: You have to grow.
You have to create friendship.

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,440
YAYA: You have to work on yourself
to be able to get an opportunity.

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,120
HOST: TIA RAY.

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,600
TIA RAY: To me, all three
are what we need to face,

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,840
TIA RAY: experience, and learn from.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,320
TIA RAY: No one can succeed
by oneself alone.

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,520
TIA RAY: I think,
in our lives and in society,

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
TIA RAY: and in our careers,

64
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,920
TIA RAY: I think each of us needs
the right time, place, and people.

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,600
TIA RAY: Only then can we succeed.

66
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,960
TIA RAY: I hope you can

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,760
TIA RAY: be the brave one
to choose your own path.

68
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,280
HOST: So, step up.

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,480
HOST: Choose and decide whether you want
to go for the left or the right.

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,640
HOST: Let's hear from Growth.

71
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,800
TIA RAY: I think there are two choices.

72
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
(RIGHT, External Growth, The grown is from other people)
TIA RAY: On the left are for those who believe they have internal growth.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,760
(LEFT, Internal Growth, Confident inside of you)
TIA RAY: And on the right are for those who believe they have external growth.

74
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,400
TIA RAY: One is confidence
from inside of you.

75
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,640
TIA RAY: And the other one is
that your growth is from other people.

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,240
TIA RAY: First of all, for those of you
who have chosen 'growth external,'

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,720
TIA RAY: maybe you
achieved your goals.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,280
TIA RAY: Maybe you
got a satisfactory stage result.

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,160
TIA RAY: Or maybe you have started
to have a group of supporting audience.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,520
TIA RAY: And you have made
so many new friends here.

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,360
TIA RAY: I think all of this
is so precious.

82
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,760
TIA RAY: It's very precious.

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,480
TIA RAY: I hope in future stages,

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
TIA RAY: we can still see you,

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
TIA RAY: and you can still shine.

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
(Achieve your personal goals)
PRAY: I believe self-identity is a form of growth for me.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,400
(Internal Growth, Confident inside of you)
PRAY: Growth is accompanied by pain.

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,480
PRAY: As long as I overcome this pain,

89
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,120
PRAY: I may become even more invincible.

90
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,840
(External Growth, The grown is from other people)
DUY: I learned a lot of dancing skills from my friend.

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,040
(Gain recognition from others)
DUY: I learned English from GORDON.

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,640
DUY: The most important is

93
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,000
DUY: I can make
all the amazing friends here.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,560
Host: Next is Friendship.

95
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,440
HOST: So many people chose Friendship.

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,040
YAYA: Obviously, you guys
are from so many different countries.

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,720
YAYA: And that is the beginning
of your friendship together.

98
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,920
YAYA: And I want you
to answer my next question.

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
YAYA: Among the friendships
you made in CHUANG ASIA S2,

100
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
YAYA: which ones are deeper?

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,440
YAYA: The friendships that you cried
through the hard times together with?

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,480
YAYA: Or the friendships that while
you're on stage you won together?

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,240
(LEFT) YAYA: On the left, that will represent
the friends that you cried together.

104
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,400
(Friendship cried together) YAYA: And like, you know,
you went through this process together.

105
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,280
(RIGHT) YAYA: For the right hand side,
the friends that you won together.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,120
(Friendship won together) YAYA: You're on stage,
You guys accomplished so much together.

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,960
YAYA: For you,
which one holds more value?

108
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
(A friend you cried with through the hard times)
BIANURA: I choose to cry with my friend.

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
(Friendship cried together) BIANURA: Because
if we win, it's 100 percent we gonna be happy.

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
BIANURA: But I want to be there
when my friend is... let down,

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,960
BIANURA: or need shoulder to cry.

112
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
KK: For me, friendship
is the most important.

113
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,760
KK: Those who cried together...

114
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,160
KK: I think only after going through
hardships, can you call someone a friend.

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,960
DORN: Friendship means
sailing the same boat.

116
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,120
DORN: My mother once said that

117
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
(Friendship won together) DORN: "Choose friends
who are willing to stay with you when you are in trouble".

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,600
HOST: Moving on to Opportunity.

119
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,520
JEFF: So I have two questions.

120
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,040
(LEFT, Grab opportunity came to you) JEFF: On the left,
did you grab every opportunity that came to you?

121
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,240
(RIGHT, Create your own opportunity)
JEFF: And right. Did you create your own opportunity?

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,920
(Create your own opportunities)
KOSHIN: Since we came on this show,

123
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,080
KOSHIN: I think every performance
is an opportunity we created ourselves.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,800
(Grab opportunities that come your way)
JACKSON: Opportunities are left for those who are prepared.

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
(Grab opportunity came to you)
JACKSON: I admit that I'm still not prepared enough.

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
JACKSON: So I will work harder
to grab all opportunities.

127
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,160
HOST: From 35 to 21.

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
JEFF: Standing before me,
three trainees,

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,000
JEFF: who have already seized
an opportunity in CHUANG ASIA S2's journey.

130
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,080
JEFF: But will you be able to grab this final
opportunity to advance to grand debut night?

131
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:28,840
JEFF: Among you, only one trainee
who gets the advance to the next round is...

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,480
JEFF: XIONG.

133
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,560
HOST: Big... Big congratulation to XIONG.

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,600
HOST: The first to advance
to the next round, please.

135
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,920
JEFF: Now we're going to announce
at the same time.

136
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,080
JEFF: So those, who have successfully
advanced to the grand debut night are...

137
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,920

JEFF: WHYLUCAS.

139
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
JEFF: KOSHIN,

140
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,080
JEFF: OMAR.

141
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,560
JEFF: Next person is...

142
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
JEFF: Congratulations.

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,800
JEFF: MYST.

144
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,680
HOST: And get a big round of applause
for the five,

145
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,280
HOST: who get to advance.

146
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,440
XIONG: Opportunities
are really important.

147
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,600
XIONG: I was given such a valuable
opportunity by chance.

148
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,160
XIONG: That's why I'm here.

149
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,200
XIONG: And,

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,040
(GRAND AUDITION) (First Public Stage)
XIONG: having opportunities leads me to more visibility.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,080
(Second Public Stage)
XIONG: So I could stand on the stage,

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,400
(Sport Day)
XIONG: and earned growth and friendship,

153
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,488

XIONG: to become who I am now.

154
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,880
HOST: TIA RAY, you are next.

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,600
TIA RAY: In front of me,
there are 7 trainees.

156
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,040
TIA RAY: You have all
gained different experiences here.

157
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,160
TIA RAY: So no matter
how the road ahead is like,

158
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,560
TIA RAY: I hope in the days to come,

159
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,560
TIA RAY: you can
still believe and persist.

160
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,960
TIA RAY: Each journey is the best experience
to become a better self.

161
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,520

162
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,080

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,080
TIA RAY: So, the only person.

165
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,360

KOHI: The reason I chose 'growth'

170

KOHI: is no matter what,

171
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:35,320
KOHI: 'growth' needs
opportunities and friends.

172
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,640

good friendships from this show.

beyond the stage in this show.

I chose Friendship.

236
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,440
TADALEE: Because it is something that,
as time goes on,

237
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,840

that decreases more.

they increase accordingly.

that friendship is something special.

some people may not be together.

TADALEE: Even today, some stages,
some people may not be together.

253
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,040

come back together.

JACKSON: As people say,
all parties will come to an end.

259
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,560
JACKSON: There's another saying,

260

JACKSON: "Life is filled with
unexpected encounters."

GORDON: Three years ago,

266
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,400
GORDON: at a top company in this industry,

267
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,000
GORDON: I began my first trainee life.

268
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,320
GORDON: There,
I witnessed systematic training

269
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,960
GORDON: and what the standards

270
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,840
GORDON: for an idol actually should be.

271
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,320
GORDON: At Berklee's summer camp
six months ago,

272
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,360
GORDON: I witnessed
the diversity of music.

273
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,080
GORDON: And six months later,

274
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,880
GORDON: I came here

275
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,360
GORDON: to CHUANG ASIA.

276
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,040
GORDON: If you wonder

277
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,480
GORDON: whether I'm sad
since I am eliminated,

278
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
GORDON: my answer is yes.

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
GORDON: But I also look forward
to what direction my steps will take.

280
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,600
GORDON: Because I was literally
just standing on opportunities.

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,000
GORDON: Guys, don't forget.

282
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,440
GORDON: Although our slogan is called

283
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,000
GORDON: "See the world. Find yourself."

284
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
GORDON: Being on the platform
of this program means

285
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,040
GORDON: at the same time,
the world is looking at us.

286
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,360
GORDON: Don't feel like this is the end.

287
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
GORDON: This is literally the new start.

TIA RAY: I believe success is defined
by oneself, not by others.

301

there will be more challenges ahead.

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,800
JEFF: Just one step away
from debuting as a group.

335
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,440
JEFF: Your ranking result of your fans
recognizes your hard work.

336
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,520

the 1st elimination round,

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,520
(Ranking After 1st Elimination: 13)
KOSHIN: I got 13th place.

340
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,200

341
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,840
KOSHIN: I would be very happy
if I could maintain my ranking.

342
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,440

343
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,240
OMAR: I would be very happy if my rank goes up.

344
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,680

345
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,520

346
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720

347

352
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
(Ranking After 1st Elimination: 2)
THI-O: To be honest,

353
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,600

JEFF: Or another trainee
you want to check.

362
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,600

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,040
HIKARU: I have so many friends

665
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
(DORM CHECK-IN)
HIKARU: that I can hardly describe it.

666
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,080
HIKARU: Especially my roommates,
JACKSON, WHYLUCAS, and BIANURA,

667
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,200
HIKARU: we chat and laugh
about silly things every day.

668
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,080
HIKARU: Even when the show ends,
we will still stay close like this.

669
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,400
HIKARU: Also, I'm so sorry for always
saying, "Clean the room too."

670
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,840
HIKARU: Please keep taking care of me.

671
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,120
HIKARU: And finally, the "future".

672
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,160
HIKARU: Regarding my future
after CHUANG ASIA S2,

673
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,200
HIKARU: to be honest,
I probably can't say anything.

674
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,640
HIKARU: But I'll do my best
in my own way until the show ends.

675
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,480
HIKARU: CHUANG ASIA S2 is a phase of
my youth I wouldn't have had in Japan.

676
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,120
HIKARU: Many things have happened.

677
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,880
HIKARU: Some days there was only
so spicy food that I couldn't eat.

678
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
HIKARU: There were cultural differences.
But it's all part of my youth in CHUANG ASIA S2.

679
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,840
HIKARU: Thank you very much.

680
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,440
HIKARU: Thank you.

681
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,560
JEFF: Thank you.

682
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,040
HIKARU: From now on, I'll do my best,

683
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,120
HIKARU: in my own way,
so I won't regret it later.

684
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,440
HIKARU: And I'll rest well.

685
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,440
HIKARU: Don't think about what's next.

686
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,440
HIKARU: Now, just think about the stage.

687
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
HIKARU: Focus on the final round
and do my best.

688
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,400
MYST: Hello everyone.

689
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,480
MYST: Before coming to here,

690
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,640
(NO. 20, MYST)
MYST: my life was quite smooth.

691
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,520
MYST: I used to perform in Disney
and Broadway shows.

692
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,160
MYST: And my school grades weren't bad.

693
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,760
MYST: They said I was like
any other neighborhood kid.

694
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,800
(DORM CHECK-IN)
MYST: But, after I came here,

695
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
MYST: I found that the world

696
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,520
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
MYST: is very vast.

697
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,280
MYST: And many people are better than I.

698
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,560
MYST: When I was in CHUANG ASIA,

699
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,880
MYST: Definitely, I wanted to be
better than others,

700
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,480
MYST: so I tried to compete with others
to the best of my ability.

701
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,080
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
MYST: And I overcame

702
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,960
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
MYST: many obstacles.

703
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,120
MYST: I have grown significantly

704
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,360
MYST: and I've been
through a lot of pain.

705
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,320
MYST: But, I found that I don't need
to compete with others.

706
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,320
MYST: But, I found that I don't need
to compete with others.

707
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
MYST: Just competing
with myself is enough.

708
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,800
MYST: I gaze into the mirror every day.

709
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,880
MYST: I gaze into the mirror every day.

710
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,320
MYST: I see a more confident me,

711
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,360
MYST: I see a more confident me,

712
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,280
MYST: a more responsible me,

713
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,160
MYST: and a more hardworking me.

714
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,880
MYST: If the next day I don't feel sore,

715
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,200
MYST: I must keep trying.

716
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,880
MYST: Start to practice.

717
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,800
MYST: Finally, I can accept if I'm not
the number one.

718
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,360
MYST: But I can't accept if I'm not
the one who tries the hardest.

719
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,200
MYST: So, I will start trying very hard.

720
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,160
MYST: Thank you, everyone.

721
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,400
MYST: The greatest thing
I've received might be...

722
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,640
MYST: I've discovered that
this world is extremely vast.

723
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,320
MYST: And there are
so many different people,

724
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,080
MYST: and they have different goals.

725
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,400
MYST: Everyone has their own life.

726
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,480
MYST: And everyone has
their own problems.

727
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,720
MYST: I understand life more.

728
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,240
WHYLUCAS: Hello, brothers and sisters.

729
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,960
WHYLUCAS: My name is WHYLUCAS
from Singapore.

730
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,560
WHYLUCAS: Thank you for voting for me.

731
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,400
WHYLUCAS: I have to say
how grateful I'm to be here.

732
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,200
WHYLUCAS: To be honest, I'm quite proud
of myself for coming this far.

733
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,720
WHYLUCAS: Thank you for supporting me,
I hope to do my best

734
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,120
WHYLUCAS: to make you guys proud and to make
my country proud by walking down this route

735
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,960
WHYLUCAS: as the only Singaporean.

736
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,280
WHYLUCAS: I have a prepared script.

737
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,840
WHYLUCAS: The prepared script is that...

738
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,280
(REHEARSAL DAY)
WHYLUCAS: To begin, I was a solo artist, so come here,

739
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,520
WHYLUCAS: I felt like something
had to change.

740
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,680
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
WHYLUCAS: I couldn't do everything like a solo artist.

741
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,720
WHYLUCAS: I have to work with the team.

742
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,640
WHYLUCAS: Teamwork matters.
Vocal, dancing, all matter. So

743
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,440
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
WHYLUCAS: I changed my working style to fit the team better.

744
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)

745
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
WHYLUCAS: But I felt like I lost

746
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,680
WHYLUCAS: a bit of WHYLUCAS.

747
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,320
WHYLUCAS: But my point is

748
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,440
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
WHYLUCAS: after all of this

749
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,680
WHYLUCAS: I feel like
everything happens for a reason.

750
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,880
WHYLUCAS: Life is about balance.

751
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,760
WHYLUCAS: So, I have to go through that
to realize...

752
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,080
WHYLUCAS: I do want to only be
the WHYLUCAS

753
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,240
WHYLUCAS: that all of you guys
know from the start

754
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,120
WHYLUCAS: and the WHYLUCAS
that I know myself.

755
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,080
WHYLUCAS: Yeah, you guys
will watch my come back.

756
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,120
WHYLUCAS: Thank you guys so much.

757
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,080
WHYLUCAS: I want to make the people
in my country proud.

758
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,760
WHYLUCAS: Because honestly, Singapore
doesn't have much of an idol culture like this.

759
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,960
WHYLUCAS: So, I want to be the first
from my country who can come this far.

760
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,920
WHYLUCAS: I want to prove to everyone

761
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,960
WHYLUCAS: I'm not just
a singer-songwriter as before.

762
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,080
WHYLUCAS: I can be someone
who others can really see.

763
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,040
WHYLUCAS: I can become
an idol for others.

764
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,960
JEFF: Okay, so next up.

765
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,640
(Still crying?)

766
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
BIANURA: No, no, no.

767
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,560
BIANURA: I will tell you now,

768
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,480
BIANURA: Unbelievable, like,

769
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,320
BIANURA: my feelings now is

770
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,720
BIANURA: I am so blessed, I'm so happy.

771
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,160
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
BIANURA: I bring myself here to entertain all the people

772
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
BIANURA: to bring a joy and happiness to all of the trainees,

773
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,120
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
BIANURA: all of the mentors,

774
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,920
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
BIANURA: and of course, to all of the audience.

775
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,120
BIANURA: Wow, oh, my God.

776
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,920
BIANURA: I-I cannot believe that

777
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
BIANURA: I can pass to the final stage.

778
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,920
BIANURA: Because I know this is
a boy group competition,

779
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
BIANURA: not a comedian competition.

780
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
BIANURA: And my ranking, it's

781
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,680
BIANURA: far, like, from my expectation.

782
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,480
BIANURA: That's why I want to say

783
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,760
BIANURA: thank you so much to all
the people that always support me,

784
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,120
BIANURA: like, always believe that
I can improve to be a better person.

785
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,000
BIANURA: And it makes me, like,

786
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
BIANURA: I wanna prove
my hard work to the final.

787
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,480
BIANURA: And guys,

788
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,560
BIANURA: let's make the final
so amazing.

789
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,160
BIANURA: Let's do our best to the final.

790
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,880
BIANURA: Thank you so much, guys.

791
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,360
BIANURA: Let's do it together.

792
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,000
BIANURA: Thank you so much.

793
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,880
NINJA: BIANURA.

794
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,320
AGUANG: First of all, I want to say

795
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,480
AGUANG: thank you to the fans
who voted for me.

796
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,920
AGUANG: Thank you for staying
with me up to this point,

797
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,480
AGUANG: and supporting me
until the final round.

798
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,880
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
AGUANG: My improvement during this time helped me discover a new me.

799
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,400
AGUANG: I thought I would be
eliminated after the first public stage.

800
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,120
AGUANG: But, I was lucky that
you saw my improvement.

801
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,040
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
AGUANG: You gave me confidence.

802
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,200
AGUANG: For the second public stage,
I chose a challenging dance.

803
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
AGUANG: Even though I...

804
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,200
AGUANG: But I feel that
my second public stage was very poor.

805
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,440
AGUANG: But I learned
many new things this time,

806
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,360
AGUANG: and also gained
a lot of experience.

807
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:18,760
AGUANG: I think the experience will help
me perform better in the final stage.

808
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,600
AGUANG: I'm eager to see
what the final stage day will entail.

809
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,840
AGUANG: I think there will be
a lot of applause from the audience,

810
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,640
AGUANG: a lot of cheers,
and beautiful lights.

811
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,520
AGUANG: I feel that it will be
an unforgettable day.

812
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,800
AGUANG: And I will do my best
in this final part,

813
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,040
AGUANG: and dedicate a wonderful stage
to all the fans who support me.

814
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,880
AGUANG: Finally, I need to thank
the fans who support and love me.

815
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,520
AGUANG: And thank you
for seeing me as well.

816
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,520
AGUANG: All of you said that
I am the light in your lives,

817
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,560
AGUANG: and I am your light baby.

818
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,800
AGUANG: But I want to say that
without you guys,

819
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,520
AGUANG: I wouldn't shine as that light,

820
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,280
AGUANG: and I wouldn't be
the light baby.

821
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,200
AGUANG: Thank you.

822
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,160
AGUANG: I love you guys.

823
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,680
OMAR: Hello everyone, I am OMAR.

824
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,680
OMAR: It feels as if the first
elimination was just yesterday.

825
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,600
OMAR: The final stage, which I feel
is far away, is just 10 days away.

826
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,040
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
OMAR: I have improved a lot in the past four months.

827
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,280
OMAR: I have changed from the old OMAR,
who couldn't do anything to who I am now.

828
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
OMAR: I have changed from the old OMAR,
who couldn't do anything to who I am now.

829
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,200
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
OMAR: Before I joined this program,

830
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,320
OMAR: because of learning Chinese dance,
it caused me a lot of pain.

831
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,600
OMAR: because of learning Chinese dance,
it caused me a lot of pain.

832
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,640
OMAR: Then I cried secretly
in the stairwell

833
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,480
OMAR: and called my mom saying
I wanted to go home and stop studying.

834
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,360
OMAR: After I joined the program,

835
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,920
OMAR: some of the seniors asked me

836
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,160
OMAR: why I am happy every day
without any worries.

837
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,080
OMAR: Actually, I have a lot of pressure
hidden in my heart.

838
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,440
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
OMAR: When

839
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,080
OMAR: it came to night,

840
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,480
OMAR: I would weep beneath the blanket
because I missed home.

841
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
OMAR: But now, I am not
the same anymore.

842
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,080
OMAR: I will not think about giving up.

843
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,480
OMAR: I will not say that
I want to go home anymore.

844
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,640
OMAR: When coming here,
I told myself that I had to do my best.

845
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,040
OMAR: I don't want to disappoint others.

846
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,720
OMAR: So, this is what I have to face.

847
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,840
OMAR: That is the only way
to improve myself.

848
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,000
OMAR: Lastly, my beloved Mario,

849
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,880
OMAR: thank you

850
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,480
OMAR: for everything you have given me.

851
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,280
OMAR: You are the light that brings
endless brightness to me.

852
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,480
OMAR: You have worked hard.

853
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,560
OMAR: I want to say,

854
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,160
OMAR: I'll be like Mario, running to you
without hesitation. Thank you.

I am the only B-class

KK: In my hand is
the envelope of DONGDONG.

954
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,960
KK: DONGDONG, guess why I am
holding your envelope.

955
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,240
KK: Because I think
you are very mysterious.

956
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,240
KK: Because you like to walk
around alone mysteriously.

957
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,320
KK: So, I think your ranking
is very mysterious.

958
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,800
KK: That's why I want to see it.

959
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,560
KK: DONGDONG, want to take a guess?

960
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,880

KK: 12?

963
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,080
KK: But your ranking is...

964
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,680
KK: But your ranking is...

965
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,360

966
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,200
JEFF: Alright.

967
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,400
JEFF: Now DONGDONG,
moving to the stage. Yes.

968
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,520

your envelopes. Both of you,

969
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,680
JEFF: I'm gonna announce it. KK,

970

to be number one.

981
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,920
THI-O: Not thinking that I am number one,
but aiming to, what, to become number one.

982
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,360
JEFF: 3.

983
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,800

I got the 2nd ranking.

984
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800

I got the 3rd ranking.

985
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,400

I would like to thank everyone

986
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,600

and voting for me.

987

JEFF: So, now we're gonna do the speech.

988
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,440
JEFF: So, now we're gonna do the speech.

989
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,000
JEFF: Starting from KK.

990
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,880
KK: I want to thank myself

991
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,320
KK: for choosing to join this program,

992
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,480
KK: especially during
the first public stage.

993
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,240
KK: And thank my friends

994
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,720
KK: who chose me to be the center
in your hearts during that time.

995
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,040
(SONG SELECTION DAY)
KK: But actually, it seems I was the one being affected,

996
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,680
KK: because I chose the song
that really troubled me.

997
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,640
KK: Because its style
didn't quite suit me.

998
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,960
KK: And at that time,
my head was full of

999
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,840
KK: thoughts of wanting to run away,
run away, run away.

1000
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,680
KK: I couldn't sleep.

1001
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,120
KK: And I often told my friends,

1002
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,240
KK: "Want to run away with me?"
But I also want to thank myself

1003
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,560
KK: for still standing strong.

1004
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,320
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
KK: And then I

1005
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,160
KK: unexpectedly became the MVP.

1006
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,560
KK: And during the second public stage,

1007
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,360
(SONG SELECTION DAY)
KK: finally, I was able to choose the song I liked

1008
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,240
KK: I had the right to choose.

1009
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,600
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
KK: And I want to thank my teammates

1010
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,240
KK: for trusting and allowing me
to be the center,

1011
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,120
KK: and making me the MVP.

1012
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,120
KK: Who I want to thank the most
are the fans.

1013
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,040
KK: Thank everyone for seeing me.

1014
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,320
KK: Thank you for voting
and supporting me.

1015
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,960
KK: And I want to say

1016
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,360
KK: no matter where I will be
from now on,

1017
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,520
KK: I will continue to chase the stage.

1018
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,000
KK: And I will continue
to make you see me,

1019
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,080
KK: and I won't let you down.

1020
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:28,840
KK: Thank you.

1021
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,440
JEFF: Thank you.

1022
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,360
JEFF: So, next up, we have TADALEE.

1023
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,240
TADALEE: Hello.

1024
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,360
TADALEE: My name is TADALEE.

1025
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,600
TADALEE: Thank you very much
for making me stand here.

1026
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,000
TADALEE: I am one of those

1027
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,840
TADALEE: who always strive
and never give up,

1028
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,600
TADALEE: or ever lose heart
on this path.

1029
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,320
TADALEE: Actually, my dream
of becoming an artist

1030
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,760
TADALEE: has been present for a long time,
but I haven't pursued it yet.

1031
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,880
TADALEE: Because before that,
I was an athlete,

1032
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,680
TADALEE: so I didn't have
the opportunity to do this.

1033
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,840
TADALEE: But when I had the opportunity,

1034
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,520
TADALEE: maybe because of the immense
love and passion for this,

1035
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,360
TADALEE: it made me focus
and become enthralled with it.

1036
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,400
TADALEE: I can say that
I danced every day.

1037
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,600
TADALEE: I think this helped me
improve quickly.

1038
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,040
TADALEE: Until one day, I had the chance
to be a dancer

1039
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,280
TADALEE: which wasn't part of the plan,

1040
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,880
TADALEE: but it's a chance
that came and I took it.

1041
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,400
TADALEE: I kept dancing all along.

1042
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,880
TADALEE: But, my dream of becoming
an artist never disappeared.

1043
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,200
TADALEE: I kept applying for auditions,

1044
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:29,720
TADALEE: yet I never received
a positive reply.

1045
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,960
TADALEE: I kept fighting
and never gave up.

1046
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,320
TADALEE: During that time, I studied
dance and worked as a dancer.

1047
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,600
TADALEE: I used my earnings from work to continue
my dance studies and it continued that way.

1048
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,000
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
TADALEE: Until today, I stand on this stage,

1049
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,680
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
TADALEE: it's a great honor.

1050
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
TADALEE: I feel that

1051
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,040
(SECOND PUBLIC STAGE)
TADALEE: the phrase

1052
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
TADALEE: "Effort never harms
a determined person,"

1053
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,280
TADALEE: is truly accurate.

1054
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,320
TADALEE: And I want to tell everyone

1055
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,400
TADALEE: no matter what you are
dreaming or doing,

1056
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,800
TADALEE: I believe I am not
the only one who dreams.

1057
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
TADALEE: You guys may have
your own dreams.

1058
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,560
TADALEE: I hope you believe, love, and
are sincere with what you do.

1059
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,160
TADALEE: One day it will come true.

1060
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:06,960
TADALEE: Thank you.

1061
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,040
JEFF: Alright, moving on to DONGDONG.

1062
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,240
DONGDONG: Hello everyone, I'm DONGDONG.

1063
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,240
DONGDONG: Honestly, I think
it's really amazing.

1064
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,000
DONGDONG: There are 8 billion people
on this planet,

1065
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,360
DONGDONG: but we can still meet here

1066
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,000
DONGDONG: and have this much bonding
with each other,

1067
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,280
DONGDONG: have built
many stages together.

1068
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,640
DONGDONG: And I want to thank everyone
in the WHEN WE DISCO team.

1069
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,200
DONGDONG: Because even though we were
together for a short time,

1070
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,560
DONGDONG: but... during that time,
you all made me

1071
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,840
DONGDONG: experience happiness and
warmth that I've never felt before.

1072
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:40,760
DONGDONG: And I could release
disco energy on the stage with you guys.

1073
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,680
DONGDONG: And I really feel happy

1074
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,840
DONGDONG: to be friends with those who
have the same dreams in this program.

1075
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,280
DONGDONG: Finally, I want
to thank all the fans.

1076
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,360
DONGDONG: The cheers you give each time
gradually accumulate in my heart

1077
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,960
DONGDONG: and it makes me gradually
more confident in facing this world.

1078
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,440
DONGDONG: And thank the fans
who support me unconditionally.

1079
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,760
DONGDONG: It makes me realize that
I can be loved by you guys.

1080
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,400
DONGDONG: This is just
the beginning for me.

1081
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,720
DONGDONG: I hope in the future
you'll always be by my side.

1082
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,960
DONGDONG: And we will go to see a wider
and more exciting world together.

1083
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,680
DONGDONG: Hello, my name is DONGDONG.

1084
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,840
DONGDONG: Thank everyone
for supporting me.

1085
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,520
DONGDONG: No matter
what the future holds,

1086
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,240
DONGDONG: I hope everyone
will stay by my side.

1087
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,000
DONGDONG: Let's see
the wide world together.

1088
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,840
DONGDONG: Thank you.

1089
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,880
JEFF: Thank you.

1090
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,120
DONGDONG: Over the years
in this industry,

1091
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,120
DONGDONG: I think
the hardest thing to get is

1092
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,960
DONGDONG: friendship.

1093
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
DONGDONG: It could be because
of the power of friendship.

1094
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,880
DONGDONG: That's why we've come
this far today.

1095
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,840
(The second public stage)

1096
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,200
DONGDONG: Today is my happiest day
in the past 5 years.

1097
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,120
DONGDONG: I don't know
when I'll be so happy next time.

1098
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,280
DONGDONG: With my ability,
I can reach the final round, and even

1099
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,440
DONGDONG: debut as well.

1100
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,600
JEFF: Alright, moving on to NINJA.

1101
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,720
NINJA: Yeah, I'm still 7th.

1102
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,680
NINJA: I'm so happy right now.

1103
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,920
NINJA: DORN,

1104
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,760
NINJA: I keep your promise, bro.

1105
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,040
NINJA: I've been thinking
since the previous stage that, at best

1106
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,280
NINJA: as long as I do well,
it's the same.

1107
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,760
NINJA: As long as I am here, I am okay.

1108
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,560
NINJA: It doesn't matter
if I rise or fall.

1109
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,880
NINJA: Just being here
at the FINAL STAGE.

1110
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,480
NINJA: Ready to do the next stage
with everyone, I am happy.

1111
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,520
NINJA: At first, my goal was just
to come and take the legend.

1112
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,160
NINJA: But now I have a new goal, bro.

1113
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,440
NINJA: I want the world to know

1114
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,120
JEFF: that...

1115
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,000
NINJA: that Thai kids are the real deal.

1116
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,480
NINJA: I have to say that

1117
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,000
NINJA: being able to be here

1118
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,200
NINJA: isn't because of just me,
like I said before,

1119
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,960
NINJA: it's because I have
everyone behind me,

1120
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,640
NINJA: in front of me,
here too, there too.

1121
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,600
NINJA: Everyone has always
been the driving force for me.

1122
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,680
NINJA: And PEANUT,

1123
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,520
NINJA: it' good to be closer like this.
It's much more heartwarming.

1124
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,640
NINJA: Just in case
we go to China together.

1125
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,960
NINJA: Thanks for all the support.

1126
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,040
NINJA: I love you all, thank you.

1127
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,800
NINJA: I always said that my goal here
was to play for fun.

1128
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,080
NINJA: But now, I also have a new goal.

1129
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,200
NINJA: If possible,

1130
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,560
NINJA: I want to debut with DORN

1131
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
NINJA: and debut
with the SUPER THAI brothers.

1132
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,480
JEFF: So, now moving on to THI-O.

1133
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,760
THI-O: Hello, my name is
THI-O from Thailand.

1134
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,480
THI-O: First of all, I want to thank
the fans very much.

1135
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,040
THI-O: I wanna say that I would not
be here without my supporters.

1136
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,160
THI-O: Thank you so much.

1137
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,560
THI-O: And even though I have,
you could say, dropped the ranking.

1138
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,120
THI-O: I do not want my fans to be sad.

1139
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,640
THI-O: I can feel the power, the energy
you guys have always given me.

1140
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,240
THI-O: And you guys always say
that you guys are proud of me.

1141
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,440
THI-O: But I wanna say right here
that I am proud of you.

1142
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,200
THI-O: Wherever you are,
I'm super-duper proud of you

1143
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,960
THI-O: for living this life
and living to the fullest.

THI-O: CHUANG ASIA S2 has given me
the ability to grow.

1160
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,920

1162
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,280

1163
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,880

the right people,

1202

who are with me every day,

1203
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,200
HU YETAO: I might go over my own.

1204
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,280

so I want to see theirs.

to be in the TOP 7.

1250
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,560
HU YETAO: Not quite there, right?

1251
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,920

1262
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,120

1263
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,720

1264
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,760
JEFF: Okay, now
we're gonna do the speech.

1265
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,160
JEFF: Start up with WUXUN.

1266
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,240
WUXUN: First, I want to thank

1267
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,760
WUXUN: all the fans who support me.

1268
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,200
WUXUN: And thank you for your support.

1269
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,520
WUXUN: When I won last time, I said,

1270
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,280
WUXUN: this victory,

1271
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,840
WUXUN: half of it is mine,
and the other half is yours.

1272
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,200
WUXUN: But this time, I want to say

1273
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,680
WUXUN: this ticket to the finals is

1274
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,880
WUXUN: what you have given me.

1275
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,000
WUXUN: Thank you.

1276
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
WUXUN: And what I want to say is...

1277
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,120
WUXUN: HUANG ZITAO...

1278
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,320
WUXUN: Bro.

1279
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,200
WUXUN: What I want to say is...

1280
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,880
(BOSS)
WUXUN: Boss, now

1281
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,120
WUXUN: I can stand

1282
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,440
WUXUN: on stage.

1283
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,160
WUXUN: I can shine as someone
who sings and dances now.

1284
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,160
WUXUN: You probably can't imagine it.

1285
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,680
(Unexpected)
WUXUN: Yes, because...

1286
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,960
WUXUN: To be honest, at first
I really felt that I was like that,

1287
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,600
WUXUN: someone who dances awkwardly.

1288
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,360
WUXUN: And at the beginning of learning,
I couldn't remember the dance moves.

1289
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,360
WUXUN: I didn't understand
the standing positions.

1290
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,200
WUXUN: And I couldn't do the moves.

1291
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,040
WUXUN: It was really embarrassing.

1292
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,400
WUXUN: I really thought I was like
scrap metal that couldn't dance.

1293
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,880
WUXUN: But

1294
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,880
WUXUN: I was refined into a baton that's

1295
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,320
WUXUN: ready for the battle,

1296
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,600
WUXUN: and to compete with everyone.

1297
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,120
WUXUN: I feel that it's very perfect.

1298
00:58:59,120 --> 00:58:59,840
WUXUN: Thank you.

1299
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,040
HUANG ZITAO: Call me.

1300
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,640
YAYA: WUXUN.

1301
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,880
YAYA: I feel that
the first few times meeting him,

1302
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,040
YAYA: we might not quite
remember him yet.

1303
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,440
YAYA: But, I feel that he is quite

1304
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,040
YAYA: clearer,

1305
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,280
YAYA: which is very good.

1306
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,560
YUCHEN: Hello.

1307
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,040
YUCHEN: I'm YUCHEN.

1308
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,560
YUCHEN: I'm from China.

1309
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,640
YUCHEN: Since coming here,
I've introduced myself a lot.

1310
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,480
YUCHEN: I said I'm YUCHEN,
a musical actor.

1311
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,840
YUCHEN: But I want to tell everyone that

1312
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,840
YUCHEN: I can be
more than a musical actor.

1313
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,200
YUCHEN: And I can also be
an idol in your hearts.

1314
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,360
YUCHEN: At first when I came here,

1315
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,640
YUCHEN: actually, I felt that
the musical stage

1316
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,280
YUCHEN: isn't much different
from the idol stage.

1317
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,520
YUCHEN: I came here
just because I want to

1318
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,880
YUCHEN: show my strengths
and correct my weaknesses,

1319
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,240
YUCHEN: to perform a good show
for everyone to watch.

1320
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,600
YUCHEN: But as time went by,

1321
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,400
YUCHEN: when I was on stage
and heard people call my name,

1322
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,280
YUCHEN: I started to realize

1323
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,640
YUCHEN: that everyone did that

1324
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,800
YUCHEN: because I am YUCHEN.

1325
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,520
YUCHEN: That's why
everyone is willing to come see me,

1326
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,320
YUCHEN: willing to like me.

1327
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,560
YUCHEN: I've been here for 117 days.

1328
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,560
YUCHEN: I'm very lucky to have met
a wonderful group of people,

1329
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,920
YUCHEN: like WuYuZiYe,

1330
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,960
YUCHEN: like our Carrot Family.

1331
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,160
YUCHEN: They told me

1332
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,200
YUCHEN: because we have
different colors,

1333
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,440
YUCHEN: when we came to CHUANG ASIA S2,

1334
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,400
YUCHEN: we became
the beautiful diversity here.

1335
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,480
YUCHEN: So, I think, for me,
this competition

1336
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,960
YUCHEN: isn't a competition anymore.
I think winning and losing

1337
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,240
YUCHEN: isn't that important anymore.

1338
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,560
YUCHEN: What makes me the happiest
every day is

1339
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,640
YUCHEN: when I wake up

1340
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,360
YUCHEN: and open my eyes
with my closest friends,

1341
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,320
YUCHEN: and when the staff wakes us up,

1342
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,320
YUCHEN: we go to the practice room.

1343
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,040
YUCHEN: I really like this feeling.

1344
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,760
YUCHEN: So, I want to try
to keep this feeling.

1345
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,480
YUCHEN: I want to stay on stage.,

1346
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,600
YUCHEN: which means

1347
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,400
YUCHEN: I want to keep moving
forward with my friends.

1348
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,960
YUCHEN: This is not the end for us.

1349
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,360
YUCHEN: I want to tell
you guys here that

1350
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,000
YUCHEN: I'm YUCHEN,
who's ready to be an idol.

1351
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,640
YUCHEN: By being ready,
I mean I have prepared myself

1352
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,720
YUCHEN: to face the challenges ahead,

1353
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,360
YUCHEN: and to confront the next stage.

1354
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,760
YUCHEN: I don't want this to end
in just four months.

1355
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,360
YUCHEN: I want to walk onto bigger
and bigger stages with my friends.

1356
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,240
YUCHEN: Thank you, everyone.

1357
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:16,240
YAO ZIHAO: Hello, my name is
rainbow pony, YAO ZIHAO.

1358
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,680
YAO ZIHAO: This is the second time I am
speaking on the stage of CHUANG ASIA S2.

1359
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,280
YAO ZIHAO: Time flies so fast

1360
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,120
YAO ZIHAO: like a movie that has been
sped up four times.

1361
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,320
YAO ZIHAO: It disappears in a blink,

1362
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,000
YAO ZIHAO: very fast.

1363
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,360
YAO ZIHAO: And I am very happy
with every day here

1364
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,120
YAO ZIHAO: until a teacher asked me

1365
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,120
YAO ZIHAO: if I am happy
with anything here.

1366
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,400
YAO ZIHAO: I tried to think,
but I couldn't think of any.

1367
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,080
YAO ZIHAO: I was stunned.

1368
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,200
YAO ZIHAO: I love...

1369
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,120
YAO ZIHAO: my fans very much.

1370
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,440
YAO ZIHAO: You are really amazing.

1371
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,880
YAO ZIHAO: I've got the fifth ranking.

1372
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,680
YAO ZIHAO: When my mother
gave birth to me,

1373
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,520
YAO ZIHAO: it was very hard.

1374
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,680
YAO ZIHAO: So, bringing me this far
must have been quite difficult.

1375
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,920
YAO ZIHAO: Thank you, everyone.

1376
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,480
YAO ZIHAO: Yes.

1377
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,640
(What are you talking about?)

1378
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,160
YAO ZIHAO: And then...

1379
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,480
YAO ZIHAO: Thank you, everyone.

1380
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,080
YAO ZIHAO: Wait a moment.

1381
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:08,480
YAO ZIHAO: What did I say? I was so excited
that I didn't know what I was saying.

1382
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,920
YAO ZIHAO: I wanted to say something
very classic and awesome.

1383
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,040
YAO ZIHAO: But I failed to say it.

1384
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,400
YAO ZIHAO: The path ahead, I'll go
against the current and overcome obstacles

1385
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,920
YAO ZIHAO: to become SUN WUKONG.
To those

1386
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,200
YAO ZIHAO: who want to overcome...

1387
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,000
YAO ZIHAO: Wait. Let's try again.

1388
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,520
YAO ZIHAO: The path ahead,
YAO ZIHAO will overcome obstacles

1389
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,640
YAO ZIHAO: to become SUN WUKONG,

1390
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,800
YAO ZIHAO: and speak to his enemies
who want to defeat him,

1391
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:25,640
YAO ZIHAO: "no way."

1392
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,480
JEFF: Last one, HU YETAO.

1393
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,200
HU YETAO: Hello everyone, I'm HU YETAO.

1394
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,840
HU YETAO: First of all,
I want to thank my Carrots

1395
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,880
HU YETAO: who gave me the ticket
to the finals again.

1396
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,480
HU YETAO: Thank you, everyone,
for working hard together.

1397
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,600
HU YETAO: Next, I want to thank
everyone I met here.

1398
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,880
HU YETAO: Even now it's
early summer in Bangkok,

1399
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,280
HU YETAO: but everyone is like
the scorching sun,

1400
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,560
HU YETAO: helping to dispel
the darkness in my life

1401
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,400
HU YETAO: From childhood to adulthood,

1402
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,240
HU YETAO: not being accepted
is normal for me.

1403
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,200
HU YETAO: The words I have said,
the things I have done,

1404
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,080
HU YETAO: they are often
misunderstood and distorted

1405
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,080
HU YETAO: as if a special label
was on me.

1406
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,240
HU YETAO: I've never had the right

1407
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,800
HU YETAO: to receive respect
and justice.

1408
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,800
HU YETAO: But, my fans and friends
have made my world warm again.

1409
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,040
HU YETAO: I want to tell
everyone who likes me that,

1410
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,160
HU YETAO: Use a compassionate heart
to accept everything that happens in life.

1411
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,480
HU YETAO: Use goodness to fight
against the malice of the world.

1412
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,760
HU YETAO: We are all brave people.

1413
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:44,400
HU YETAO: We will encourage
each other forever.

1414
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:48,760
HU YETAO: I have been waiting
for four years.

1415
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,440
HU YETAO: The times that made me fail,

1416
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,400
HU YETAO: the times that made me want
to give up, I have gone through them all.

1417
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,480
HU YETAO: Flowers that bloom
in the desert

1418
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,320
HU YETAO: not only have
astonishing beauty

1419
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:59,560
HU YETAO: but also a strong heart

1420
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,320
HU YETAO: and a life that won't give up.

1421
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,960
HU YETAO: I have been knocked down
again and again, but at the same time,

1422
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,880
HU YETAO: I will stand up again
and again similarly.

1423
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,120
HU YETAO: In 2021, I once said that

1424
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,480
HU YETAO: I will engrave my name
HU YETAO on the debut position.

1425
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,720
HU YETAO: But this year,

1426
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,160
HU YETAO: I will not only engrave it
on the debut position

1427
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,880
HU YETAO: but also on the center
position. Thank you.

1428
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,880
HU YETAO: Either as an artist,

1429
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,960
HU YETAO: or as a so-called idol,

1430
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,360
HU YETAO: I think my biggest mission is

1431
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,440
HU YETAO: to help the fans learn
something from myself,

1432
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,520
HU YETAO: that is to live their lives
in their own way

1433
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,960
HU YETAO: and dare to be themselves.

1434
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,440
YAYA: So there are two trainees
who chose each other's names.

1435
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,280
YAYA: I think you know who you are.

1436
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,280
YAYA: PEANUT and DORN,
please come to the center.

1437
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,280
DORN: Beloved bro.

1438
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
PEANUT: Smoochies.

1439
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,520
YAYA: Was this the plan or was this fate

1440
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,000
YAYA: You guys have picked
each other's names.

1441
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,680
DORN: It is fate.

1442
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,720
PEANUT: Hey, are you crazy?

1443
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,600
DORN: I want to see

1444
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,840
DORN: the result of this one.

1445
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,840
DORN: Because...

1446
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,240
DORN: Since GRAND AUDITION,

1447
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,040
DORN: he has been together with me.

1448
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:07,080
TIA RAY: Really?

1449
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,400
PEANUT: Yeah.

1450
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,080
TIA RAY: Why?

1451
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,600
PEANUT: I just think about my brother.

1452
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,480
YAYA: Since you've chosen
each other's results,

1453
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:15,600
YAYA: you can open the envelopes
at the same time.

1454
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,160
PEANUT: Are you secretly liking me?

1455
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,360
DORN: A little bit of crush.

1456
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,840
DORN: Let's see PEANUT's first.

1457
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,720
PEANUT: Okay.

1458
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:28,800
TADALEE: Oh my god!

1459
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,360
DORN: Congratulations.

1460
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,800
DORN: You got number...

1461
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,160
PEANUT: Seriously, I hope
to be in the top 7.

1462
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,800
PEANUT: Because we really want to debut.

1463
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,680
PEANUT: But in the worst case scenario,
I hope the rank will not drop.

1464
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,560
DORN: Do you see beside our friend?

1465
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,240
DORN: No. 12.

1466
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,400
PEANUT: Oh, my God!

1467
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,560
PEANUT: If you ask me if I'm satisfied,
yes, I'm satisfied.

1468
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,360
PEANUT: At least I passed to the final
round performance, GRAND DEBUT NIGHT.

1469
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,320
(Fight with all my might)
PEANUT: We will fight harder than before.

1470
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,440
PEANUT: Next up, is the ranking
announcement of...

1471
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,120
PEANUT: DORN.

1472
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,840
PEANUT: And the rank of DORN is...

1473
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,920
DORN: No. 4.

1474
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,000
DORN: Sure!

1475
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,760
DORN: Because I give No. 1 to XIONG.

1476
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:22,760
DORN: Because...

1477
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,400
DORN: When doing his past work
on WHEN WE DISCO,

1478
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,960
DORN: he did really well.

1479
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,840
DORN: I admit this.

1480
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,680
DORN: And there's the MVP thing,

1481
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,600
DORN: with extra points added
and MVP of MVP as well.

1482
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,240
DORN: So I felt like
I might only deserve the 4th place.

1483
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,640
WHYLUCAS: No. 1.

1484
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,720
PEANUT: No. 1, yes.

1485
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,680
JEFF: Congratulations.

1486
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,720
DORN: Is it the wrong card?

1487
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
DORN: Last round I got 3rd place,

1488
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,200
DORN: but today I got 1st place.

1489
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:01,000
DORN: Because I received love
from all ANLLYS.

1490
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,400
DORN: Here!

1491
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,680
DORN: I'm telling the truth.

1492
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,680
DORN: Because they saw some value in me.

1493
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,720
DORN: They thus

1494
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,080
DORN: supported me until today.

1495
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,120
DORN: I am really very happy.

1496
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:15,680
DORN: I feel that without these people,
I wouldn't be standing here.

1497
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,080
DORN: That's really the truth.

1498
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,160
NINJA: You deserve it.

1499
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,200
NINJA: I'm proud of you.

1500
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,360

but he's also a really good person.

1501
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,560
NINJA: Glad to know a man named DORN.

1502
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,800
YUCHEN: I think DORN went

1503
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,360
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
YUCHEN: through a period where

1504
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,440
(First Public Stage)
YUCHEN: he had not been discovered.

1505
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,880
YUCHEN: Until he became

1506
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:35,200
(Second Public Stage)
YUCHEN: who he is today.

1507
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,000
YUCHEN: So I'm really happy
he got 1st place.

1508
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,040
YUCHEN: I think he deserves this.

1509
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:43,200
JEFF: Honestly, DORN surprised me.

1510
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,360
JEFF: Because I saw him
steadily climb up

1511
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,400
JEFF: and today,

1512
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,960
JEFF: he became No. 1.

1513
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,520
JEFF: He himself must be shocked too.

1514
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,800
JEFF: Now, PEANUT,
say something, please.

1515
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,440
PEANUT: Yes, hello.

1516

PEANUT: and everything I've done...

1523
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,840
(GRAND AUDITIONS)

1543
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,720
DORN: I want to take my heart out
and show everyone how it feels right now.

1544
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,400
TADALEE: And his hand is like this.

1545
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:26,280

the strength of every ANLLYS member.

they voted for me.

DORN: Right now, what I received
from all the fans is...

1548
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,280
DORN: The opportunity I received
is a huge opportunity.

1549
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:41,480
DORN: I feel like I have to
be strong in return.

1550
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,880
DORN: Because I want to be big brother DORN,
as everyone knows,

1551
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,840
DORN: and I will continue to be.

1552
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:51,920
(I'm moved. I can't even speak)
DORN: Wow, I'm too excited to speak.

1553
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,360
DORN: I didn't expect this
to happen in the show.

1554
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,240
DORN: But I feel that today
is just the beginning.

1555
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,040
DORN: The position can shift
at any time.

1556
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040

1557
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,040

DORN: Everyone loves this profession.

1559
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,520
DORN: Everyone loves performing
on stage very much.

1560
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,560
DORN: Therefore, ultimately friendship is
the most important, as I chose the middle circle.

1561
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,960
DORN: I would like to conclude
with a little bit of Chinese.

1562
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,120
DORN: Excuse me.

1563
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,440

TIA RAY: KOHI, which one
you wanna choose?

1573
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,360
TIA RAY: Yourself or your friend?

1574
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,360
(KOHI chooses himself)
KOHI: Of course.

1575
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,360

TIA RAY: Yourself?

1577
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,360
TIA RAY: Why?

1578
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,040
KOHI: Because my ranking
is the most important.

1579
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,480
YAYA: Okay.

1580
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,520

1582
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,520

SHEN: I choose myself
because the fans voted for me.

1590
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,360

1591
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,760

01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,120
XIONG: I choose myself.

1598
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,120

your own, right?

1599
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:34,600
- XIONG: Yes.
- TIA RAY: Why?

1600
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,600
XIONG: Because I think the fans
must have worked really hard

1601
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,600
XIONG: to support and vote for me.

1602
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,160
XIONG: I want to open this envelope
with my own hands.

1603
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,040

it's just me,

1613
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,080
KOSHIN: without any friends,

1614
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,360
KOSHIN: I might feel lonely.

1615
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,040
KOSHIN: But I will try my best on stage.

1616

01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,480
KOHI: If I were to speak honestly,

1632
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:58,280
KOHI: I feel once again that there are
many people who really love and support me.

1633
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,320
KOHI: I feel very grateful.

1634
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,640
KOHI: I think the most important thing
is to say thank you first.

1635
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,880
KOHI: So, I want to thank everyone here.

1636
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,920
KOHI: Now,

1637
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:13,800
KOHI: Mom, Grandma, right now in Korea,
winter is passing by and spring is about to start.

1638
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,480
KOHI: My mom always says:

1639
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:22,600
KOHI: Son, if there comes a day when you
face difficult times and feel exhausted

1640
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:26,360
KOHI: to the point where you
start doubting your path,

1641
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,920
KOHI: the first thing you should do is
to reflect and question yourself first.

1642
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,360
KOHI: you're still not
confident in your own path.

1643
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,480
KOHI: So you are confused
about your path.

1644
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,560
KOHI: My mom always says this.

1645
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,720
KOHI: When thinking
about those words constantly,

1646
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,320
KOHI: at this moment, I feel very happy.

1647
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:46,720
KOHI: I feel like I'm walking
the right path.

1648
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,560
KOHI: Love you, Mom and Grandma.

1649
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,280
KOHI: Thank you.

1650
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,760
JEFF: Moving on, KOSHIN.

1651
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:00,080
KOSHIN: Hello everyone, I am KOSHIN.

1652
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:02,240
KOSHIN: Hello, my name is KOSHIN.

1653
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,360
KOSHIN: First, thank you
for the 11th position.

1654
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,440
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
KOSHIN: When I first came here,

1655
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,840
KOSHIN: at the first evaluation,
I got a grade C.

1656
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,600
KOSHIN: It really made me
lose confidence.

1657
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,160
KOSHIN: But after that, I was evaluated
by the Mentors.

1658
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,120
KOSHIN: And after that, I performed
on the first and second stages.

1659
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,920
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)

1660
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,520
KOSHIN: I was also evaluated
by the fans.

1661
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,320
KOSHIN: I am really happy to have received
MVP twice. Thank you very much.

1662
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,960
KOSHIN: Finally,

1663
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,960
KOSHIN: for everyone who supports me

1664
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,480
KOSHIN: and for me to keep fighting,

1665
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:38,480
KOSHIN: I will try my best
with the challenges in the FINAL STAGE.

1666
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,000
KOSHIN: Please wait for me. Thank you.

1667
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,640
JEFF: Thank you.

1668
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,640
JEFF: Moving on to SHEN.

1669
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,360
SHEN: Hello, everyone.

1670
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,440
SHEN: I am SHEN YISHENG.

1671
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,360
SHEN: I am SHEN YISHENG.

1672
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,560
SHEN: Hello, everyone.

1673
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,520
SHEN: I am SHEN YISHENG.

1674
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,360
SHEN: Today, that I can reach this point

1675
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,960
SHEN: is because the fans
have always been by my side.

1676
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,320
SHEN: Therefore,

1677
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,320
SHEN: I would like
to sincerely thank my fans here.

1678
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,880
SHEN: I think I have changed
since I first joined the show.

1679
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,280
(GRAND AUDITIONS)
SHEN: Maybe from the GRAND AUDITION.

1680
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,800
SHEN: Maybe in the song BITE ME,

1681
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,240
SHEN: I have not been chosen.

1682
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,720
SHEN: But when everyone
switched microphones,

1683
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,200
SHEN: I was given
a valuable opportunity to perform.

1684
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,720
SHEN: It allowed me
to win my "first blood"

1685
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,440
SHEN: with my off-key voice.

1686
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,240
SHEN: I became the focus at that moment.

1687
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,600
SHEN: It made all of you

1688
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,280
SHEN: see me.

1689
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,080
SHEN: When receiving the MVP
during the first public stage,

1690
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,080
SHEN: I think that

1691
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,200
SHEN: part of it is due to luck.

1692
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,200
SHEN: But when I received the MVP
during the second public stage,

1693
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,040
SHEN: I think it was because of myself.

1694
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,040
SHEN: Like I said on stage back then,

1695
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,040
SHEN: I think I already

1696
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,880
SHEN: expected to get it.

1697
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,680
SHEN: It gave me another opportunity

1698
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,040
SHEN: to let you see me.

1699
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,480
SHEN: Giving me the chance
to perform three times

1700
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,520
SHEN: made everyone accept me.

1701
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,320
SHEN: Giving me three months,

1702
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,080
SHEN: I can gain your admiration.

1703
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,400
SHEN: Even though

1704
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,560
SHEN: both times I didn't
get the center position,

1705
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,120
SHEN: I became the protagonist
in your hearts.

1706
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:56,520
SHEN: At last, I want to say

1707
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,520
SHEN: the stage is my way
of proving myself.

1708
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,680
SHEN: SHEN on stage

1709
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,520
SHEN: deserves a better position.
As long as I want it,

1710
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,680
SHEN: it will certainly be mine.

1711
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,520
SHEN: Because I am

1712
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,960
SHEN: the dual MVP king
even not in center position.

1713
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,080
SHEN: I must say it.

1714
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,080
SHEN: I am from class C,

1715
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,240
SHEN: wearing gray shirt.

1716
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:15,720
SHEN: Thank you.

1717
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,480
SHEN: SHEN, who has come
this far, has received MVP twice.

1718
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,440
SHEN: You can be proud,
but don't be too proud.

1719
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,280
SHEN: There are people who accept you,

1720
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,080
SHEN: but there will also be

1721
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:25,840
SHEN: people who do not accept you.

1722
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,120
SHEN: I must do well

1723
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,560
SHEN: so as not to disappoint my fans.

1724
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,720
JEFF: Moving on to the last one, XIONG.

1725
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,680
XIONG: Hello, everyone,
I am LIN JINXIONG.

1726
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,280
XIONG: Hello, everyone,
I am LIN JINXIONG.

1727
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,520
XIONG: Today, I can stand
in this position.

1728
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,520
XIONG: I feel really happy.

1729
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,200
XIONG: So, I would like
to thank you so much

1730
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,440
XIONG: for your support and love
towards me.

1731
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,880
XIONG: This time I chose

1732
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,560
XIONG: I want to challenge myself.

1733
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,600
XIONG: I want you to see me
in a different way.

1734
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,240
XIONG: Miracles may happen

1735
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,960
XIONG: amid facing countless despair.

1736
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,080
XIONG: So, for me,
the song WHEN WE DISCO

1737
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,400
XIONG: is a small miracle in these years.

1738
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,920
XIONG: At that time,
off the stage, I felt very nervous.

1739
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,960
XIONG: It reminded me of myself
during the first public stage,

1740
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,160
(First Public Stage)
XIONG: the self that lacked confidence and afraid.

1741
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,080
XIONG: But the moment
I stood on the stage,

1742
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,080
(Second Public Stage)
XIONG: I heard very loud cheers.

1743
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,000
XIONG: It was a sound I could not hear
in the practice room.

1744
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,040
XIONG: Thank you, everyone.

1745
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,840
XIONG: Thank you for making me

1746
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,720
XIONG: experience the joy
of being on stage.

1747
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:27,720
XIONG: There were long periods of time

1748
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,720
XIONG: when I had to face
everything alone.

1749
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,480
XIONG: But now, I have many friends
beside me

1750
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,520
XIONG: and also all of you
who support me.

1751
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,480
XIONG: I want to say

1752
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,840
XIONG: I hope someone
as unimportant as me

1753
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,440
XIONG: can bring energy
or inspiration to you.

1754
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,600
XIONG: I hope to be able

1755
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,920
XIONG: to add colors to your lives.

1756
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,520
XIONG: Finally, I want to say,

1757
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,880
XIONG: now that I've come this far,

1758
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,080
XIONG: I cannot lose.

1759
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,040
XIONG: I've gotten one step closer
to my dream here.

1760
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,240
XIONG: There are 12 days left.

1761
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,520
XIONG: I will take your support

1762
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,000
XIONG: and love for me

1763
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,280
XIONG: to move forward

1764
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,640
XIONG: step by step.

1765
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,680
XIONG: See you on the FINAL STAGE.

1766
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,400
XIONG: Thank you, everyone.

1767
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,080
XIONG: I love you.

1768
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,720
YAYA: Time goes by quickly.

1769
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,960
YAYA: The kids might not feel this way.

1770
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,560
YAYA: Because it's been over 120 days
they've been training.

1771
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,440
YAYA: After this, if they debut,

1772
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,440
YAYA: they will truly experience
the taste of the outside world.

1773
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:25,520
YAYA: I hope that everything they have
gathered here, they will use it outside as well.

1774
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,920
JEFF: Always remember,
we do something because we want to.

1775
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,360
JEFF: Do not let the competition
consume us.

1776
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,920
JEFF: Believe now, we have
come far from the starting point.

1777
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,800
JEFF: And I hope you all find
the path you hoped for

1778
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,240
JEFF: and make your dreams come true.

1779
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,320
JEFF: Now the second elimination
has ended.

1780
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,160
JEFF: Now it's time for the more
exciting part of CHUANG ASIA S2.

1781
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,560
JEFF: GRAND DEBUT NIGHT!

1782
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,440
JEFF: Let's just try again,
GRAND DEBUT NIGHT.

1783
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,000
JEFF: This will be your final mission
on the stage

1784
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,960
JEFF: and your last step toward debut.

1785
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,520
JEFF: In a moment, I will announce
three final performance,

1786
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,400
JEFF: songs that you will perform
on GRAND DEBUT NIGHT.

1787
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,520
JEFF: The first song is

1788
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,680
JEFF: HAPPY

1789
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,000
JEFF: by DAY6.

1790
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,280
THI-O: The song I really want is HAPPY.

1791
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:48,240
THI-O: For this stage, I'm not going
to say anything. I'm going to do my best.

1792
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,560
THI-O: Give it my all

1793
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:52,680
THI-O: and let fate guide us,

1794
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,040
THI-O: as I always say in life.

1795
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:55,600
JEFF: Next,

1796
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,840

1797
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,120

JEFF: For the center position,

1803
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,920
JEFF: the fans have already
made their decision

1804
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,640
JEFF: for the three final songs.

1805
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,520
JEFF: They have been decided

1806
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,600
JEFF: based on
the WeTV SEND LOVE rankings

1807
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,960
JEFF: from March 11th to March 24th.

1808
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:13,000
JEFF: The top three trainees
have earned the center spots

1809
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,200
JEFF: for GRAND DEBUT NIGHT.

1810

01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,200
JEFF: The first place

1814
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:23,680

JEFF: HU YETAO,

1816
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,200
(1st place in WeTV Send-Love: HU YETAO)

1817
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,120
HU YETAO: Thank you to my fans who voted
SEND LOVE for me to get the No. 1

1818
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:38,640
HU YETAO: and made me the center
of the FINAL STAGE.

1819
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,360
HU YETAO: They are like the light
that guides me.

1820
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,320
HU YETAO: Thank you all very much.

1821
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,120
JEFF: You have the first choice
among the three finale songs.

1822
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,560
TIA RAY: Next up, I will announce
the second place

1823
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,000

(2nd place in WeTV Send-Love: THI-O)

1827
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:05,720
TIA RAY: So you can choose
from the remaining two songs

1828
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:11,520
TIA RAY: and you will take the center
position for the one you select, okay?

1829
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,160
THI-O: Okay, my feeling for getting
2nd in SEND LOVE is

1830
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,760
THI-O: I was so shocked.
I want to say I was so shocked.

1831
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,880
THI-O: I want to say,
thank you very much.

1832
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,160
THI-O: Honestly, I was so scared that I wasn't able
to choose the song I wanted to perform.

1833
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:30,920
YAYA: The third will naturally take
the center position of the song that's left

1834
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,720
YAYA: and that person is...

1835
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,640
YAYA: DORN.

1836
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,800
(3rd place in WeTV Send-Love: DORN)

1837
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:39,080
DORN: As always, I want to thank

1838
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:42,200
DORN: my lovely fans
for letting me be the center.

1839
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,440
YAYA: You get the center
of that song that you choose.

1840
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,920
JEFF: The three centers
for the final songs have been confirmed.

1841
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,600
JEFF: Starting with HU YETAO.

1842
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,800
TIA RAY: The song that HU YETAO chose is

1843
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,240
TIA RAY: FEEL SPECIAL.

1844
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,040
HU YETAO: It's the end
of the show already.

1845
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,040
HU YETAO: Whether it'll be a perfect end
depends on this performance.

1846
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:17,680
HU YETAO: For me, I think debuting
is not an end or conclusion.

1847
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,800
HU YETAO: The important thing is that I want
to perform the remaining stages the best I can.

1848
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,920
JEFF: Move on, we have THI-O.

1849
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,200
TIA RAY: THI-O, come on.

1850
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,800
THI-O: If I got 3rd place in SEND LOVE,

1851
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,360
THI-O: DORN might have chosen
HAPPY instead of ROSE BLOSSOM.

1852
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,840
THI-O: I am very happy.
I really want to thank the fans

1853
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,680
THI-O: from the bottom of my heart really.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

1854
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,120
JEFF: So DORN will get ROSE BLOSSOM.

1855
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,240
DORN: I had no choice,

1856
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,280
DORN: but I chose to turn it
into an opportunity.

1857
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,600
DORN: So I am targeting this song.

1858
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:07,600
DORN: I will make the song
that no one chose the best performance.

1859
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:14,240
JEFF: Starting from 4th until the end,
start with XIONG.

1860
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,680
DORN: First song is better.

1861
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,640

1862
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,160
JEFF: Alright, H1-KEY.

1863
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,920

1866
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,680
XIONG: His ability,

1867
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,960

really is excellent.

1868

1875
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,720
OMAR: is this song hard for singing?

1876
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,240
