have to stop what you are doing like,

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560

BAMBAM: TIA RAY.

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,200
TIA RAY: I think the first time

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,480
TIA RAY: when I first met everyone,
I said I hoped

89
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
TIA RAY: to see everyone's growth here

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,560
TIA RAY: and I truly feel everyone's
dedication on stage.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,880
TIA RAY: It is a true dedication
from the heart.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,400
TIA RAY: You have been here
for about 80 days, right?

93
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
TIA RAY: 80 days.

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
TIA RAY: Almost, right?

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,200
TIA RAY: So, I think that
it is a process, an experience.

96
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,680
TIA RAY: The most important thing is
to never forget the dream in your heart.

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,240
YAYA: So, no matter who's staying today
or leaving today,

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,240
YAYA: never stop chasing
the spirit of challenge.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,560

101

BAMBAM: Different ranking results
will be placed on different floors.

123
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,080

the elevator to reach them.

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,120
SHEN: I feel

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,640

like there's something new, I think...

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,600
SHEN: When the rules change a bit,
it becomes more interesting.

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,840

128
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,000
HU YETAO: I was confused,

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,640

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,240

BAMBAM: most of you came alone.

134
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,720
BAMBAM: But now you have made
new friends, right?

135
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,640
BAMBAM: You will form your own teams

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,200
BAMBAM: and base on your prediction
of your ranking,

137
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
BAMBAM: take the elevator to different
floors to see your scores.

138
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,880
BAMBAM: And then you can group up
maximum to three.

139
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960
BAMBAM: So, yeah...
anyone wanna go first,

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,320
BAMBAM: please let me know right now.

141
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,760

BAMBAM: Then, DORN.

143
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680

who you wanna go with?

144
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,600
DORN: PLENGTHAI and PEANUT.

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,560
BAMBAM: Alright.

146
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,120
PEANUT: We are quite stressed,

147
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,960
PEANUT: so stressed that

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
PEANUT: I can't eat
and kind of want to vomit.

149
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,400
PEANUT: it's until the day when people
will be eliminated, yes.

150
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
PEANUT: We agreed to raise our hands
at the same time, if there's anything.

151
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,200
DORN: I just want to know
if my friends survive.

152
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,760
DORN: That is all I'm hoping for.

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,800
DORN: At least I'm confident

154
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,880
DORN: that the abilities
of each SUPER THAI member

155
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,000
DORN: will be impossible to be below 35.

156
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,240
DORN: Well...

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
(Hold hands together)
PEANUT: ♪Hold hands and go together♪

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
(Hold hands together)

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,320
PEANUT: How do we feel about being
the first team to go?

160
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,480
PEANUT: Actually, we were
quite stressed.

161
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,240
PEANUT: What should we do?
Which floor should we go to?

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,360
DORN: Where exactly do we need to go?

163
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
PLENGTHAI: Oh, wow.

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
- PLENGTHAI: Fourth?
- DORN: Yes.

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,040

501
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,000
MYST: Today I'm going to write letters

502
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,800
MYST: to all 59 people.

503
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,320
MYST: It's gonna take like so long,
but...

504
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,800
MYST: it's worth it.

505
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,160
(WRITING...)

506
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,160
MYST: I don't know how
to write in Chinese.

507
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,240
MYST: Because I don't know how
to write in Chinese,

508
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
MYST: so I had to look it up
on the internet.

509
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,640
(WRITING...)
MYST: Then I wrote it down.

510
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,960
MYST: I wrote 'Hello'.

511
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,680
MYST: After this show,
I'll be much better at Chinese.

512
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,280
MYST: I will become...

513
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,840
MYST: a Chinese language expert.

514
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,120
(OLD SIX)

515
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,480
(WRITING...)
MYST: When writing letters,

516
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,920
MYST: I wrote down
my impressions of them,

517
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,440
MYST: and the things I wanted
them to know.

518
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,080
(WRITING...)
MYST: Also drew pictures.

519
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,960
(DRAWING...)

520
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,240
MYST: It took two days,

521
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,880
MYST: over ten hours. On the third day,
I woke up to draw at seven o'clock.

522
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,040
MYST: Very tired.

523
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,120
MYST: But it's okay.

524
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
MYST: I think it's enough just
to make them happy.

525
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,680
MYST: I want everyone to know
that I see them.

526
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,480
PRAY: Who will be the next group?

527
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,000
GORDON: Eh?

528

it was TIAN QI's group.

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,360
PRAY: Okay.

530
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,320
TIAN QI: Oh, my God.

531
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,880
TIAN QI: What is this?

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,440
TIAN QI: wrote letters to me.
When I saw them, I cried.

540
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,560
TIAN QI: It says, after arriving
in Beijing, they would come to see me.

541
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,440
TIAN QI: At that moment,
I couldn't hold back my tears.

542
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,200
TIAN QI: Why do you have me
read these letters at this moment?

543
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,320
TIAN QI: Give me these letters
after they really get eliminated.

544
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,640
TIAN QI: Giving them to me like this
makes me worried

545
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,040
TIAN QI: that they won't pass.

546
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,840
XIN: When the wind blew
across the stream,

547
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,680

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,280

(Ranking from Episode 4
XIN: 37, LIZI: 44)

555
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,040
XIN: How to choose this?

556
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,880
LIZI: What should we do?

557
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,920
XIN: I think I know
which floor to go to.

558
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,920
XIN: I think my abilities are limited.

559
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,640
XIN: I would probably
end up in ranking 36-60.

574
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,560
LIZI: Well...

575
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,560
LIZI: There is a bit of regret,

576
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
LIZI: because

577
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,040
LIZI: being here feels like a dream.

578
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,840
LIZI: I still want to dream
for a bit longer, but...

579
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,320
LIZI: I've tried my best, it's okay.

580
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,000
LIZI: Actually, I've already
accepted it.

581
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,720
LIZI: because

582
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,320
LIZI: Actually, I don't feel
pressured anymore.

583
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,960
LIZI: I actually feel more relieved
after knowing the result.

584
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,680
LIZI: I think it's okay.

585
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,240
LIZI: I created a performance
that I am impressed with myself.

586
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,920
LIZI: Even though I want to
perform again, but...

587
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,200
LIZI: What can I do, it's not up to me.

588
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,760
LIZI: THI-O also wrote a letter for me.

589
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,720
LIZI: He said

590
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,040
LIZI: I am the first Chinese trainee

591
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,160
LIZI: that THI-O feels close to.

592
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,640
LIZI: I think THI-O is someone
very talented and good.

593
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,920
LIZI: I believe that he will definitely
keep getting better.

594
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,040
XIN: And this is the letter
that MYST wrote to me.

595
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,160
XIN: He wrote it in English

596
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,480
XIN: even though he knows I'm Chinese.

597
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,200
XIN: He even wrote to me
in two languages.

598
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,480
XIN: I feel very happy.

599
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,800
XIN: And here is the letter
that LIZI wrote. Will you read it?

600
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,320
LIZI: Read it yourself.

601
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,496
LIZI: I wrote it for you to read.

602
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,560
XIN: He said... I'm very cute.

603
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,800
XIN: And he also said that coming here
must have put a lot of pressure on me.

604
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
LIZI: I'll read it to you instead.

605
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,240
XIN: Then you read, okay.

606
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,000
LIZI: Right here.

607
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,280
LIZI: It says,

608
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
LIZI: when you leave, don't forget me.

609
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,880
XIN: No way.

610
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,200
LIZI: This is what I fear the most.

611
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,840
LIZI: Earlier, we had a small fight.

612
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,640
LIZI: After that, the next day,

613
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,280
LIZI: I didn't dare talk to him.

614
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,840
LIZI: And then SICHEN gave me
cookies to give him.

615
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,800
LIZI: I turned my head to give
them to him like this.

616
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,680
LIZI: And the next day,

617
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,760
LIZI: after we made up,

618
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,360
LIZI: we went out to shoot
and were in the car.

619
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,720
LIZI: We each shared one earphone
and listened to music together.

620
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,680
LIZI: He used one and I used the other.

621
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,400
LIZI: At that time...

622
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
LIZI: How should I say this?

623
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,080
LIZI: I think that day was
the happiest day for me.

624
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
LIZI: And that day in the car,
I kept gazing at the scenery outside.

625
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
LIZI: I thought that day the scenery was
especially beautiful because I felt...

626
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,800
LIZI: It felt very happy.

627
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,160
LIZI: I don't know what to say.

628
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,640
(REHEARSAL DAY)
LIZI: Because I consider XIN

629
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
LIZI: a sincere friend.

630
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,480
LIZI: Just like we said in diary 317.

631
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,360
LIZI: We're not just friends
on the show.

632
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,560
LIZI: I don't know what to say,
in my view, I don't...

633
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
LIZI: To be honest,
I could guess about it.

634
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,040
LIZI: Or it could be a hunch.

635
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,960
LIZI: Or you could say
I had prepared myself.

636
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,960
LIZI: But deep down, I still can't
accept this truth completely.

637
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,720
LIZI: And I don't want to cry.

638
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,360
LIZI: I don't want to cry
in front of the camera.

639
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,240
LIZI: Today in front of the camera
I really don't want to cry at all.

640
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,600
LIZI: And at that time,
when I got out of the elevator,

641
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,960
LIZI: there was a camera
in the elevator, right?

642
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,440
LIZI: When I got out of the elevator
and took the stairs,

643
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,520
LIZI: when there was no camera anymore,

644
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,640
(I need to cry)

645
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,680
LIZI: I burst into tears then.

646
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,640
(Cry Loudly)

647
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,560
XIN: You've just joined this

00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,200
XIN: It's okay.

649
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,760
XIN: You're talented,
plus you're only 20,

650
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,400
XIN: and you still want to do this.

651
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,280
XIN: Actually, you just
need an opportunity.

652
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,600
LIZI: I don't want to leave you guys.
And you.

653
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,600
XIN: It's okay, we can always meet.

654

XIN: We're in the same country, right?

655
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800

SHEN: It's real.

992
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,480

It's a huge cockroach.

I noticed it earlier.

can this bug fly this high?

(JOKER)
SHEN: Finally, you're abandoned.

1076
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,200
WUXUN: Because we are a family of four,

1077
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,760
WUXUN: and only three could go.

1078
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,320

HU YETAO: I think...

1102
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,600
HU YETAO: To be honest,
I said I could to it.

1103
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,760
HU YETAO: But if no one was with me
I could not do it myself at all.

1104
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,840
HU YETAO: If I were alone today, I would
probably choose a ranking around ten.

1105
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,320
YAO ZIHAO: Because this is his second
time participating in this show.

1106

if he is ranked 1-7.

to go on his own.

of a group called

(SILENCE)

1169
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,960

experience this again.

1171

YAO ZIHAO: This should be...
Obviously, this should be

1195
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,160
(A Gift from DAVID)- YAO ZIHAO: for me.
- YUCHEN: This is for you. Little Pony.

1196
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,520
YUCHEN: It seems...

1197
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,680
HU YETAO: Did you write it?

1198
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,840
YAO ZIHAO: I didn't write it, honestly.

1199
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,200
- HU YETAO: Who else calls me this, if not you?
- YAO ZIHAO: I wouldn't write it for you.

1200

1201

1202
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,520
YAO ZIHAO: I wouldn't write it for you.

1203
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,440
HU YETAO: This letter, you have
to secretly read it.

1204
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,480
YAO ZIHAO: Hey! You can't do that.

1205
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,760
HU YETAO: You have to secretly read it.

1206
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,360
HU YETAO: If you see it,
just pretend you didn't see it.

1207
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,880
HU YETAO: Otherwise, I would be
very embarrassed, HU YETAO.

1208
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,120
HU YETAO: Thank you for teaching me
many things in CHUANG.

1209
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,520
HU YETAO: Ever since I first met you,

1210
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,080
HU YETAO: I felt like you didn't have
much confidence in yourself.

1211
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
HU YETAO: Really, I'm just being honest.

1212
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,600
HU YETAO: I know you are HU YETAO.

1213
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,440
HU YETAO: But when I saw you,
it was like...

1214
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,040
HU YETAO: You didn't quite want
anyone to greet you.

1215
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,160
HU YETAO: The first time I greeted you,
I was really scared.

1216
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,720
HU YETAO: I was afraid you might think
I approached you for my own gain.

1217
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,320
HU YETAO: Later, I just pretended
not to know you and greeted you.

1218
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,000
HU YETAO: After that, I taught you
to dance Super. Hahahaha.

1219
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,200
HU YETAO: I later found out that
you are a very good person.

1220
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,240
HU YETAO: You're very humble with me.

1221
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,520
HU YETAO: So, I just wanted
to make friends with you,

1222
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,480
HU YETAO: because I'm afraid
of fake people.

1223
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,760
HU YETAO: Thank you for cheering
for me on stage.

1224
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,440
HU YETAO: Thank you for giving me
so much positive energy

1225
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,000
HU YETAO: even though
you always talk tough.

1226
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,440
HU YETAO: In the future,
let's fight together.

1227
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,720
HU YETAO: Let's try together,
and I hope you'll have confidence.

1228
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,400
HU YETAO: Pleased...

1229
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,920
HU YETAO: Pleased or please?

1230
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,520
YAO ZIHAO: Please.

1231
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,400
HU YETAO: Please.

1232
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,600
HU YETAO: You wrote 'pleased'.

1233
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,880
HU YETAO: You are very beautiful,
and also very handsome.

1234
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,960
HU YETAO: The personality...

1235
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,680
HU YETAO: The personality is
really very good.

1236
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,680
HU YETAO: Have some confidence,
HU YETAO. We will debut together.

1237
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,280
HU YETAO: In my heart,
you have always been number one.

1238
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,640
HU YETAO: Go for it. HU YETAO.

1239
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,240
HU YETAO: I hope you have
ultimate confidence.

1240
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,040
YUCHEN: Ultimate confidence.

1241
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,280
HU YETAO: I don't want to cry.

1242
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,520
HU YETAO: I won't cry.

1243
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,120
YAO ZIHAO: There's a cockroach.

1244
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,560
HU YETAO: Not scared,
not scared anymore.

1245
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360

much deeper than we thought.

DUY: You know,
I still can't believe that

1510
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,880
DUY: I'm still here

1511
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,640
DUY: and I continue my journey on
CHUANG ASIA S2

1512
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,560
DUY: because I thought
I had no international fans before.

1513
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,520
DUY: And I thought
I didn't have enough votes.

1514
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,760
DUY: But I'm still here.
So I want to say thank you

1515
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:10,360
DUY: for all the fans who voted for me
and supported me.

1516

DUY: I don't know
if they'll stay or they'll leave.

1521
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,280
DUY: So, I really hope that

1522
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,280
DUY: whether you stay or leave...

1523
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,680
DUY: I really hope that
whether you stay or you leave,

1524
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,760
DUY: you'll succeed

1525
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,400

1526
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,520

SMART: The time spent in

1542
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,440
SMART: the CHUANG was a time that

1543
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,360
SMART: was quite difficult for me.

1544
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,120
SMART: It was difficult because

1545
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,240
SMART: I didn't know if I'm

1546
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,520
SMART: walking here alone.

1547
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:57,600
SMART: Sometimes, in the room,

1548
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,720
SMART: I would secretly cry alone,
but I still had

1549
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:04,400

1550
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,080

SHOYA: Please stop sleeping
in the same bed as me every day.

1565
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,600
SHOYA: Because it makes
my body hurt a little.

1566
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,880

he always helps lift my spirits.

B: everyone who was eliminated
and everyone who is still here.

1633
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,360
B: For me, I believe this journey is
not just for a competition,

1634
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,760
(GRAND AUDITION)
B: but as a time for us to build up friendship

1635
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,880
(GRAND AUDITION)
B: and have a good memory together.

1636
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,080
B: Right now, I am very happy.

1637
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,840
B: I have gotten to know many friends.

1638
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,040
B: Thank you very much, everyone.

1639
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,640
BAMBAM: Alright.

1640
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,840
BAMBAM: Alright, next one, we go to

1641
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,760
BAMBAM: HIKARU.

1642
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,920
HIKARU: Hello everyone, this is HIKARU.

1643
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,600
HIKARU: Thank you everyone
who has supported me up to this point.

1644
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,240
HIKARU: To be honest,
before coming here,

1645
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,680
HIKARU: there were only difficult times.

1646
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,800
HIKARU: From being in
an idol training camp in Japan

1647
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,960
HIKARU: to becoming a boy group,

1648
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,960
HIKARU: joining an audition show
in Japan,

1649
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,440
HIKARU: to coming to CHUANG ASIA
as MAISON B,

1650
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,560
HIKARU: I am chasing my dreams.

1651
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,000
HIKARU: If it wasn't for being an idol,
I wouldn't have anything to talk about.

1652
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,440
HIKARU: I feel that I

1653
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,880
HIKARU: still have the potential
for development.

1654
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,480
HIKARU: We practice together every day,

1655
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,280
HIKARU: laugh together,
get tired together,

1656
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,960
HIKARU: and sometimes cry together.

1657
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,000
HIKARU: Meeting such wonderful friends
makes me very happy.

1658
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,040
HIKARU: There are people here
who speak up to five languages,

1659
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,840
HIKARU: and people who can sing,
dance, and even compose songs.

1660
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,560
(First Public Stage)

1661
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,760
HIKARU: There are talented people
with abilities I don't have.

1662
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,880
HIKARU: Please look forward to my work.

1663
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,920
HIKARU: Thank you, the fans,
for your continuous support,

1664
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,800
HIKARU: and all the staff,

1665
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,840
HIKARU: and all my fellow trainees.

1666
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,440
HIKARU: Thank you very much.

1667
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
HIKARU: Thank you.

1668
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,440
HIKARU: Thank you so much.

1669
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,200
BAMBAM: Alright, next one, WUXUN.

1670
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,640
WUXUN: What I want to say is...

1671
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,440
WUXUN: Before I came here,

1672
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,200
WUXUN: the agency and my boss
talked to me that

1673
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,240
WUXUN: to be an artist, it doesn't just
mean being able to sing and dance

1674
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,680
WUXUN: and you can be called an artist.

1675
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,200
WUXUN: You need to dedicate
and work hard,

1676
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:20,960
WUXUN: and put effort

1677
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,920
WUXUN: to be able
to call yourself an artist.

1678
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,320
WUXUN: Therefore, I think,

1679
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,040
WUXUN: boss, sending me here

1680
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:27,840
WUXUN: was the right decision.

1681
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,280
WUXUN: For myself,

1682
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,360
WUXUN: I appreciate you very much.

1683
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,760
(SONG SELECTION DAY)
WUXUN: It was an experience I've never felt before in my life.

1684
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,480
WUXUN: Well...

1685
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,000
WUXUN: Previously, my approach was to
find the answers myself.

1686
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,440
WUXUN: But now, I have many good friends

1687
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,480
WUXUN: who are ready
to grow and develop together.

1688
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,440
WUXUN: Like XIONG,

1689
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,920
WUXUN: HU YETAO, YAO ZIHAO

1690
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,160
WUXUN: and YUCHEN.

1691
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:52,800
WUXUN: Finally,

1692
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,400
WUXUN: I want to encourage myself
for the second public stage.

1693
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,440
(FIRST PUBLIC STAGE)
WUXUN: Actually, everyone might have seen my development,

1694
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,320
WUXUN: but I still think
it's not enough.

1695
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,400
WUXUN: I learned a phrase from here.

1696
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,960
WUXUN: It's a very good saying,
which is...

1697
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,880
WUXUN: "Good is the enemy of better."

1698
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,320
WUXUN: Yes, this sentence
is something I always keep in mind.

1699
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,520
WUXUN: Yes.

1700
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,120
WUXUN: Thank you.

1701
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,080
WUXUN: Let's go!

1702
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,200
BAMBAM: Thank you.

1703
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,160
BAMBAM: Alright, next one,

1704
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,680
BAMBAM: LYU, there you go.

1705
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
LYU: Hi, I am LYU.

1706
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
LYU: First of all, to all the fans
who have supported me,

1707
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:24,800
LYU: I sincerely thank you.

1708
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,680
LYU: And the people
I would like to thank are,

1709
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,800
LYU: SHOYA and HIKARU.

1710
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,360
LYU: The existence
of the other two members of MAISON B.

1711
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,760
LYU: The existence
of the other two members of MAISON B.

1712
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:37,160
LYU: This is something
very special to me.

1713
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,800
LYU: This kind of story
can happen because

1714
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,120
LYU: SHOYA was the one
who invited me here.

1715
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,520
LYU: He is an important person
who always supports me.

1716
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,720
LYU: And also HIKARI,
during my Firework performance,

1717
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,000
LYU: he has always been there
to help me.

1718
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,680
LYU: I want to thank HIKARI

1719
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,520
LYU: very much for that.

1720
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,480
LYU: Thank you.

1721
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,720
BAMBAM: Thank you so much.

1722
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,760
BAMBAM: Alright, PEANUT.

1723
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,360
PEANUT: Hello everyone,
my name is PEANUT.

1724
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,880
PEANUT: Hello everyone,
my name is PEANUT.

1725
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,400
PEANUT: My real dream is to be an idol.

1726
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,520
PEANUT: But before that,
I was disappointed like...

1727
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,000
PEANUT: like being heartbroken
by a woman.

1728
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,360
PEANUT: But then
there was a group of friends.

1729
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,040
PEANUT: When I performed with them,
I felt like

1730
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,080
PEANUT: "Wow, it was so much fun."

1731
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,840
PEANUT: It was so much fun,

1732
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,400
PEANUT: much more fun
than anything I've done.

1733
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,040
PEANUT: And I felt so happy
that I couldn't describe.

1734
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,960
PEANUT: Until now, I feel like...

1735
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,400
PEANUT: It's like we are a family,

1736
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,560
PEANUT: even though we haven't spent
that much time together.

1737
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:37,960
PEANUT: Compared to some people
who I have spent much longer time with.

1738
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,480
PEANUT: Finally, I want
everyone there to keep fighting

1739
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,160
PEANUT: and let's be here together.

1740
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:49,320
PEANUT: Don't lose hope, everyone.

1741
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,920
PEANUT: And let's dance together again.

1742
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,680
PEANUT: Thank you.

1743
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,400
BAMBAM: That's the charm
of performing on stage.

1744
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,600
BAMBAM: Alright, next one,

1745
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,800
- BAMBAM: SHEN, please.
- SHEN: Okay.

1746
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,000
SHEN: Well...

1747
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,160
SHEN: If you feel tired,
you can sit down first.

1748
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,320
SHEN: I think so.

1749
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:12,640
SHEN: Hello everyone,
I'm SHEN from China.

1750
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,720
SHEN: First of all,
I want to thank my fans.

1751
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:17,600
SHEN: Next, I want to thank the Mentors

1752
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,840
SHEN: and the teachers
who taught me various skills.

1753
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,960
SHEN: Thank you all for giving me
the opportunity to stand here.

1754
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,320
SHEN: I found the persons
I was looking for, which are

1755
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,880
SHEN: KK, XIONG, DAVID,
which is the Bite Me team, and HIKARI.

1756
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,840
SHEN: And also Still Monster.

1757
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,000
SHEN: And also

1758
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,840
SHEN: the Carrot Family.

1759
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,560
SHEN: It was the happiest time
being on the CHUANG ASIA.

1760
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,480
SHEN: On the first public stage, I found
the feeling of being in a group before.

1761
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,280
SHEN: I was so happy,
enjoying every day.

1762
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,320
SHEN: Even though we lost,
we gained something more important.

1763
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,400
SHEN: That is friendship.

1764
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,200
SHEN: So in my heart, I think that

1765
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,240
SHEN: choosing the right person is more
important than choosing the right song.

1766
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,600
SHEN: That's why I chose them.

1767
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,840
SHEN: If possible,

1768
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,360
SHEN: I would like to debut
with the right people.

1769
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,560
SHEN: My fans want me to become
the center in the GRAND AUDITION.

1770
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,240
SHEN: Actually, I kind of made it.
I made in into Class C.

1771
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,040
SHEN: Being in Class C
is not bad at all,

1772
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,640
SHEN: because at least,
the word "CHUANG ASIA" starts with a C.

1773
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,240
KK: Wow.

1774
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,240
PRAY: Wow.

1775
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:16,080
SHEN: Normally,
my character is quite open,

1776
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,600
SHEN: sometimes impulsive,

1777
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,800
SHEN: but when I'm on stage

1778
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,840
(First Public Stage)
SHEN: I will devote myself

1779
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,560
SHEN: in every stage performance,
using my abilities to prove myself.

1780
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,520
SHEN: Finally, I hope that

1781
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,880
SHEN: my performance can convey
emotions and feelings to many people

1782
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,840
SHEN: and I hope everyone will
continue to support me. I want to say

1783
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,280
SHEN: no one knows
what the future path will be like.

1784
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,440
SHEN: Cherish and value
the people beside you.

1785
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,280
SHEN: May the fans
who like me be happy every day.

1786
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,680
SHEN: Thank you.

1787
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,240
BAMBAM: That's awesome.

1788
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:46,920
BAMBAM: CHUANG ASIA starts with a C.

1789
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,360
- BAMBAM: I like that.
- TIA RAY: That's a good one.

1790
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,320
BAMBAM: Alright, last one, DONGDONG.

1791
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,480
DONGDONG: Hello everyone, I'm DONGDONG.

1792
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,160
DONGDONG: First of all,

1793
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,080

who have supported me all the way.

1794

DONGDONG: Yeah. And also,

1795
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,600
DONGDONG: I want to thank everyone

1796
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,840
DONGDONG: because in fact,
I am a person who is

1797
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,360
DONGDONG: quite shy and doesn't
usually approach others first.

1798
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,960
DONGDONG: But everyone
is still very warm to me.

1799
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
DONGDONG: So I want to thank everyone
who opened up

1800
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,680
DONGDONG: and got to know me. And I want
to thank JACKSON, ALTON ANG, and REXY.

1801
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:14,400
DONGDONG: Well...

1802
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,520

together with you on this show

1803
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,480
DONGDONG: made me
feel very safe and comforted.

1804
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,800
DONGDONG: And I want to thank
the members of team BAD NEWS.

1805
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,520
DONGDONG: You helped me understand
what it means to be a team leader

1806
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,080
DONGDONG: and learned
about being in the center position.

1807
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,080
DONGDONG: And I must thank
JELLY, RICKY, XIONG, and JUNHAN.

1808
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,400
DONGDONG: Because coming
to this show is like...

1809
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:43,720
DONGDONG: When I need help,

1810
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,880
DONGDONG: Finally, I would like
to say that in the future path,

1811
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,880
DONGDONG: no matter what obstacles
everyone may encounter,

1812
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,840
DONGDONG: I hope that everyone
will still have the passion.

1813
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:56,920
DONGDONG: Keep your head up,
keep moving forward, and dare to fight.

1814
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,560
DONGDONG: No matter
what the future will be,

1815
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,320
DONGDONG: I hope that we will be
the best version of ourselves.

the past two years has not been wasted.

1822
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,400
