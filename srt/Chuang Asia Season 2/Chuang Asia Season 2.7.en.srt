00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,680
TIA RAY: and give them
a unique experience on stage.

168
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,440
TIA RAY: And I hope that we

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,240

- TIA RAY: Can you understand?
- BAMBAM: A little bit.

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,960
TIA RAY: Okay.

175
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,160
YAYA: We're used to sitting
on the mentor penal,

176
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
YAYA: and we don't usually get to see

177
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,360
YAYA: what's going on behind the scenes,

178
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,400
YAYA: how the trainees
have to prepare themselves,

179
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
YAYA: how much time they
have to prepare themselves.

180
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,320
YAYA: So, in this process

181
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,520
YAYA: I just want you guys to know
that they are trying really hard

182
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,000
YAYA: and they're gonna win
your hearts tonight. I'm so sure of it.

183
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,280

BAMBAM: ZI XUAN LI and NAOMI WANG,

186
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,560
BAMBAM: we know you were trainees

187
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,120
BAMBAM: from the first season
of CHUANG in China,

188
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
BAMBAM: PRODUCE 101.

189
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,800
BAMBAM: And you know, you've gained a lot of love,
a lot of fame from many fans, you know.

190
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,480
BAMBAM: And now seven years
have passed by.

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,720
BAMBAM: Do you still have
any special memories from CHUANG?

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
ZI XUAN LI: Actually, at that time

193
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,280
ZI XUAN LI: I was quite inexperienced.

194
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,280
ZI XUAN LI: And I just felt that
all the 101 girls

195
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,360
ZI XUAN LI: were performing together
brightly, very happy.

196
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,080
NAOMI WANG: Yes.

197
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,760
NAOMI WANG: At that time, we...

198
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,600
NAOMI WANG: all thought we would be
very pressured,

199
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,760
NAOMI WANG: but actually,
at that time in the show,

200
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,120
NAOMI WANG: we enjoyed
the competition a lot.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,000
NAOMI WANG: In the end, we didn't debut.

202
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,080
NAOMI WANG: Just kidding.

203
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
BAMBAM: Okay.

204
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,240
BAMBAM: You guys also have a theme song.

205
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,840
BAMBAM: We wanna know if you
still remember the dance.

206
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,400
NAOMI WANG: Yes, we practiced
yesterday, together.

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,320
BAMBAM: Oh, yesterday?

208
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,360
BAMBAM: Can you guys
show us a little bit?

209
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:27,840
DIDI: Go ahead, go ahead.

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,880
NINJA: Oh, my God.

211
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
B: Big sister.

212
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
JEFF: Nice.

213
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,040
BAMBAM: Wow, that was amazing.

214
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
BAMBAM: From seven years ago, huh?

215
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,560
NAOMI WANG: Because we, ah, you haven't
danced since for, like, five years.

216
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,800
NAOMI WANG: She hasn't danced
for five years.

217
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080
NAOMI WANG: And me too,

218
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,480
NAOMI WANG: after the show
I have never practiced it.

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,520
NAOMI WANG: So, yesterday has gone hard.

220
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,680
NAOMI WANG: It seems like I've started
to learn a new dance.

221
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,600
NAOMI WANG: But

222
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,040
NAOMI WANG: as long as we starting
to make the moves, it came to muscle.

223
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,440
NAOMI WANG: Then we remember it all.

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,040
- TIA RAY: It's muscle memories.
- NAOMI WANG: Yeah.

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,200

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,120
BAMBAM: And we also have, you know,
seniors from the first season of CHUANG,

feel to be back here for the second time?

251
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,800
NANA OUYANG: I don't know
how to express my feeling,

252
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,800
NANA OUYANG: because it's like...
it's like a dream.

253
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,280
NANA OUYANG: Because my sister
used to be my little baby at home,

254
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,240
NANA OUYANG: but...

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,760
NANA OUYANG: now it's like
she's grown up

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,480

NANA OUYANG: I wish her luck
and health and happiness. Yeah.

260
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,920
BAMBAM: But, you know,
the most important question is

261
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,800
BAMBAM: Do you think you will win?

262
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,920

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,040
BAMBAM: after each group's performance.

302
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,560
(POSITION BATTLE VOTING RULES)
BAMBAM: You can vote for every trainee in that group with no limits.

303
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,280
BAMBAM: But

304
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,040
BAMBAM: you can only vote
once per trainee only.

305
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
BAMBAM: You cannot give two votes
to the one trainee.

306
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,680
BAMBAM: Only one per.

307
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,960
BAMBAM: Just vote
for the person you think

308
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,760
BAMBAM: he did good
or catch your attention.

309
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,760
BAMBAM: And the trainee
with the most votes in the group

310
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,800
BAMBAM: will be the group's MVP.

311
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,280
BAMBAM: And at the same time,

312
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,840
BAMBAM: the group
with the highest total votes

313
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,480
BAMBAM: will take
the MVP SEATs over here.

314
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,920
BAMBAM: As the show goes on,

315
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,000
BAMBAM: the MVP SEAT

316
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
BAMBAM: gonna change

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,960
BAMBAM: if some other team
get a higher score.

318
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,000
BAMBAM: So, after
all the seven groups performed,

319
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,080
BAMBAM: the team that's holding
the MVP SEAT

320
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,800
BAMBAM: until the end

321
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,360
(tips: The group with the highest total votes will take the MVP seat and keep it until another group gets a higher score)
BAMBAM: will be counted as the MVP team of

322
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,840
BAMBAM: the Second Public Stage, so

323
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,880
BAMBAM: the MVP who stays till the end

324
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,440

(Finally understood!)
AUDIENCE: Wonderful!

672
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,640

674
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
BAMBAM: It's nothing.

675
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,560
BAMBAM: Alright, so you got
to see everyone before voting.

676
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,840
- BAMBAM: QIAO YIYU.
- QIAO YIYU: Yes?

677
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,720
BAMBAM: You wanna
say something before voting?

678
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
QIAO YIYU: Wow.

679
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,080
QIAO YIYU: Can I hear some scream?

680
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,120
QIAO YIYU: So if you think
they are really really good,

681
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,320
QIAO YIYU: and their performance
has really shot your heart,

682
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,440
QIAO YIYU: then please vote
for my team, vote for MIC DROP.

683
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,680
QIAO YIYU: Thank you.

684
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,800
BAMBAM: Alright, now it's time.

685
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,520
BAMBAM: It's time to vote.

686
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,920
BAMBAM: No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

687
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,440
BAMBAM: So, you know,
before we waiting for the voting,

688
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,160
BAMBAM: counting.

689
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,560
BAMBAM: We should, you know,
have a little bit of small talk.

690
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:41,160
BAMBAM: How was working with our trainees
and performing on stage together for the first time?

691
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,280
QIAO YIYU: Actually,
this is the first time

692
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,840
QIAO YIYU:
that I had a stage with boys together.

693
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,080
QIAO YIYU: And I feel
it was a very special experience for me.

694
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,520
QIAO YIYU: Because
like the day that I first met these guys,

695
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,200
QIAO YIYU: I thought they're gonna be
like more

696
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,720
QIAO YIYU: naughty...

697
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,400
QIAO YIYU: Or more like...

698
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,320
BAMBAM: Naughty?

699
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,560
QIAO YIYU: You know, just.
But actually, they are super shy.

700
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,200
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- QIAO YIYU: They didn't even speak a lot of things to me.

701
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,240
QIAO YIYU: And so that made me feel
like they are

702
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,760
QIAO YIYU: younger brothers to me.

703
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,640
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- QIAO YIYU: So, like, these days

704
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,080
QIAO YIYU: that I've spent
with them together,

705
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,680
QIAO YIYU: I bought
some food and drinks for them.

706
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,080
QIAO YIYU: Because I feel...

707
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,440
QIAO YIYU: Just, every time
I look at them, I feel like

708
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,400
- QIAO YIYU: I wanna take care of them, yeah.
- BAMBAM: Okay.

709
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,000
BAMBAM: Who is the shyest here?

710
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,160
BAMBAM: When you first met.

711
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
QIAO YIYU: Wow, the shyest?

712
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,560
- QIAO YIYU: I think it's OMAR.
- BAMBAM: OMAR?

713
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,360
- BAMBAM: Really?
- QIAO YIYU: Yeah.

714
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,720
QIAO YIYU: 'Cause

715
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,320
QIAO YIYU: they all know
that the first day he met me,

716
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,520
QIAO YIYU: he didn't even
look at me. He was just like...

717
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,360
- BAMBAM: OMAR is the youngest here.
- QIAO YIYU: And after that, the second day,

718
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,920
QIAO YIYU: he even called me Teacher.

719
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,120
- BAMBAM: Oh. Teacher.
- QIAO YIYU: He called me Teacher.

720
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,160
BAMBAM: It's cute. Alright.

721
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,760
BAMBAM: Let's see what our mentors'
think about the first performance.

722
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,080
BAMBAM: JEFF, you are a good dancer.

723
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,000
(JEFF, the dancer!)
JEFF: Thank you.

724
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,880
- BAMBAM: I wanna see...
- JEFF: Of course.

725
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,840
(here I am king of dancing)
JEFF: I'm a king of dancing.

726
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,360
BAMBAM: How do you feel?

727
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200
JEFF: To be honest,

728
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,080
JEFF: to watch the whole show is...

729
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,680
JEFF: It's okay.

730
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,160
JEFF: The chemistry
is not quite there yet,

731
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,920
JEFF: but I mean, I've seen

732
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,400
JEFF: like so many people
were trying their best to dance.

733
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,560
JEFF: Like AGUANG.

734
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,280
JEFF: Which was like, I remember

735
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,160
JEFF: Which was like, I remember

736
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,080
(GRAND AUDITION)
JEFF: the first day

737
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,320
(GRAND AUDITION)
JEFF: that he did the dance.

738
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,080
(GRAND AUDITION)
JEFF: He was not quite there yet.

739
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,680
(GRAND AUDITION)
BAMBAM: Yeah.

740
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,280
(AGUANG improves a lot)
JEFF: But now, he has improved a lot.

741
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,000
BAMBAM: I know, right?

742
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
- JEFF: Right, from the first day.
- BAMBAM: Since that day.

743
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,640
JEFF: OMAR.

744
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,480
JEFF: You make the girls' hearts drop.

745
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,240
(Heart Flutterer)

746
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,320
JEFF: You have melted the women's heart.

747
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,360
YAYA: It was okay.

748
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,080
- BAMBAM: Okay?
- YAYA: I think we've seen a lot of improvement of all of you guys.

749
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,760
YAYA: OMAR.

750
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,160
JEFF: The women mentioned earlier

751
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,240
- JEFF: include YAYA.
- BAMBAM: YAYA?

752
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,080
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- YAYA: But on a serious note,

753
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,760
YAYA: I feel like you have improved
so much. Well done.

754
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,640
BAMBAM: Okay.

755
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,800
OMAR: Thank you.

756
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,520
BAMBAM: Okay.

757
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,440
TIA RAY: I think KOSHIN and OMAR

758
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,320
TIA RAY: got most of my attention.
I mean,

759
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,200
TIA RAY: I think OMAR

760
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,360
TIA RAY: also grows.

761
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,480
TIA RAY: Before, he was very shy.

762
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,960
TIA RAY: But when he performed
with the female guest,

763
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,680
TIA RAY: the way they dance together

764
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,400
TIA RAY: made me feel

765
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,560
TIA RAY: an attractive charm.

766
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,120
TIA RAY: A bit of sexiness in there.

767
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,960
TIA RAY: Feels like he has grown up

768
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,960
TIA RAY: and some hormones
radiate around him,

769
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,360
TIA RAY: making the performance
between the two of you

770
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,000
TIA RAY: and this stage

771
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,440
TIA RAY: look more attractive.

772
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,120
TIA RAY: And the overall, AGUANG,

773
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,480
TIA RAY: TIAN QI and LYU.

774
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,160
TIA RAY: I think
they are at similar levels.

775
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
TIA RAY: Therefore, I am very grateful
for their performance.

776
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,680
- TIA RAY: Thank you.
- QIAO YIYU: Thank you, TIA RAY.

777
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,120
- BAMBAM: Very well.
- TIAN QI: Thank you, Mentor.

778
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,480
BAMBAM: And...

779
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,560
BAMBAM: The result is here in my hand.

780
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,240
BAMBAM: So far,

781
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,000
BAMBAM: two of the trainees

782
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,040
BAMBAM: have a really close score.

783
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,560
BAMBAM: But,

784
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,720
BAMBAM: we only got only
one MVP right now.

785
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,280
BAMBAM: So, are you guys ready?

786
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

787
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,600
BAMBAM: Are you guys ready?

788
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,560
KOSHIN: Okay.

789
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,400
BAMBAM: The MVP of the team MIC DROP...

790
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,200
BAMBAM: Please turn around

791
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,920
BAMBAM: and check it.

792
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,720
HU YETAO: Wow.

793
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,000
BAMBAM: KOSHIN!

794
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,400
BAMBAM: Good job.

795
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,840
AUDIENCE: KOSHIN!

796
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,680
BAMBAM: KOSHIN! KOSHIN! KOSHIN!

797
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,240
KOSHIN: I can't believe it.

798
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,960
KOSHIN: After finishing
the performance...

799
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,320
KOSHIN: I never thought
I would be the MVP.

800
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,720
KOSHIN: Anyway, I have been MVP twice.
Thank you so much.

801
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,000
BAMBAM: So this is, you know, MIC DROP,
our first team to perform.

802
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,440
BAMBAM: So, since you
are the first team to perform yet,

803
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,240
BAMBAM: you guys
are the highest scores so far.

804
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240

BAMBAM: This is a song
for love and romance,

819
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,240

TRAINEES: Oh, my CRUSH.

832
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,160

833
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,800
WUXUN: Hello, I am WUXUN, the CRUSH dog.

834
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,560

a signal of love, I will be there.

835
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,320
WUXUN: Let's go.

836
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,600

837
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,880
PRAY: Sorry I have only seven seconds
of memory, always forgetting.

838
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,280
PRAY: Even though my memory isn't great,
my heart remembers only you.

839
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,320
KK: I will glare at others,
because I am affectionate only with you.

840
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,800
KK: Hello, I am your CRUSH cat,

841
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,840
KK: KK.

842
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,320
MYST: Sorry.

843
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,800
MYST: I fell in love.

844
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,880
BIANURA: MYST, again? Oh my god.

845
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,360
SUNNY: Who taught him this?

846
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,200
NAOMI WANG: They...
Why do the kids have so many tricks?

847
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,360
MYST: What's up?

848
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,920
MYST: Hello everyone.

849
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,160
MYST: I am MYST.

850
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,600
MYST: I am the CRUSH monkey.

854
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,560
ALTON ANG: If you have a problem,
I will help you.

855
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,760
ALTON ANG: If you stumble upon a door,
I'll break it down for you.

856
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,400
BAMBAM: And our special guest.

857
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,840

I am DIDI. I am the Crush.

858
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,240
DIDI: I am the player of this game.

859
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,080
DIDI: And they are
the characters in my game.

860
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,040
DIDI: And I pick all five of them.

861
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,560
DIDI: I hope they could
make you all feel that CRUSH.

862
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,080
BAMBAM: I hope you steal
all the love from our fans

863
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,040
BAMBAM: and be their CRUSH.

864
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,120
BAMBAM: So, good luck.

865
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,080
MYST: Let's go.

866
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,400
- KK: Honestly, I want to be the center.
- WUXUN: Hmm.

867
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,080
KK: This is the song
I wanted to pick most.

868
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,040
KK: And I really like this song.

869
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,440
KK: The vibe during the performance
is quite important.

870
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,560
KK: And this song emphasizes the vibe.

871
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,320
KK: I feel that I could perform it well.

872
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,360
MYST: I want to say something too.

873
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,640
MYST: First of all,

874
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,800
MYST: if you say the vibe is important,

875
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,560
MYST: this song is quite similar
to Justin Bieber's style.

876
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,480
MYST: And I make music

877
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,520
MYST: that has a style similar to his.

878
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,640
MYST: I really want to be the center.

879
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,720
MYST: So I want to be the center
and let them see

880
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,520
MYST: what I can do

881
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,440
MYST: and how well I can perform.

882
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,720
PRAY: I know that KK's
previous job was singing,

883
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,040
PRAY: and has worked with

884
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,200
PRAY: female guests frequently.

885
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,800
PRAY: I believe KK has slightly
more experience in this than you.

886
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,400
PRAY: So I want to vote for KK.

887
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,520
(KK+1)

888
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,600
ALTON ANG: I think KK is more suitable

889
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,280
(KK+2)
ALTON ANG: for this position.
KK: Well.

890
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,280
WUXUN: KK performed well

891
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,160
(KK+3)
WUXUN: on stage last time.

892
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,800
KK: I think,

893
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,240
KK: if I become the center,

894
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,080
KK: I want to consider the others more.

895
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,000
KK: I hope we can get parts equally,
like in the division of singing parts,

896
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,600
- KK: I am okay with that.
- WUXUN: Let's divide the parts.

897
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,880
KK: If someone likes my part,

898
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,320
KK: let's see
if we can divide the parts better.

899
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:55,960
- PRAY: Let's discuss it later.
- KK: Yes.

900
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,800
WUXUN: Actually, I understand MYST

901
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,000
WUXUN: wants

902
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,800
WUXUN: to be in the center.
I can understand that.

903
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,640
WUXUN: I think MYST
has not yet performed

904
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,240
WUXUN: his potential to the fullest
in previous performances.

905
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,080
WUXUN: In the previous rounds,
you were quite repressed, so this time...

906
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,680
WUXUN: If you're not the center,
at least let you be the deputy center.

907
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,520
(It sounds like another kind of honor)
- WUXUN: So you can express yourself, okay? - MYST: Alright, then. I like this.

908
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,120
WUXUN: We've

909
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,320
WUXUN: consulted and decided to assign
the team leader position to MYST.

910
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,320
(Leader)

911
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,520
(I'm so busy)
MYST: I have the opportunity to lead the team

912
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,360
(I'm so busy)
MYST: I have the opportunity to lead the team

913
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,160
MYST: I'm very happy.

914
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,920
(Pay Attention)

915
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,600
MYST: I speak English well,
so I can provide advice on English.

916
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,520
(Correct Pronunciation)

917
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,320
KK: He is very suited to be
the team leader. His English is good,

918
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,920
KK: so he can correct our pronunciation
or things like that.

919
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,440
MYST: As for PRAY, he's bad at
remembering the dance moves.

920
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,360
MYST: We need to teach him a bit more.

921
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,800
- PRAY: Five and six and seven...
- MYST: And seven.

922
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,080
WUXUN: This might be the first time
that MYST becomes the team leader,

923
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,280
WUXUN: so he has that boyish leadership.

924
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,520
(Step 1)
(Step 1)
(Step 2)

925

926
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,280
(This part)

927
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,520
(Your part now)

928
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,800
(All in)

929
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,360
(Excited)

930
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,480
KK: MYST is a team leader
who pays great attention to details.

931
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,680
KK: He's very happy
and helps oversee our part.

932
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,040
KK: And we are glad
to have him oversee us.

933
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,320
KK: Lately, I've been sleeping well.

934
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,920
DANCE TEACHER: You have to move forward.

935
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,840
MYST: Got it.

936
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,080
DANCE TEACHER: Be a gentleman.

937
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:42,840
DANCE TEACHER: Yes, yes.

938
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,400
DANCE TEACHER: You can't do like,
hey baby,

939
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,480
DANCE TEACHER: waiting for her
to come hold your hand.

940
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,680
KK: This song should be in that scenario.
Ambiguous, but not yet dating.

941
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,200
DANCE TEACHER: You have to move forward.

942
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,720
DANCE TEACHER: Yes.

943
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,440
DANCE TEACHER: I'm about to sleep.

944
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,480
DANCE TEACHER: You fell for someone.

945
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,960
- WUXUN: I'm a little excited.
- DANCE TEACHER: Be a man.

946
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,240
DANCE TEACHER: Be straightforward.

947
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,440
DANCE TEACHER: Go.

948
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,440
(He doesn't like me)

949
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,920
WUXUN: I still thought it as
a singing and dancing performance.

950
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,600
WUXUN: But I didn't think it would be

951
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,680
WUXUN: a singing and dancing performance
with a storyline.

952
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,840
WUXUN: And the interaction
with the female guest

953
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,040
WUXUN: is not that good.

954
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,080
WUXUN: I might be

955
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,720
WUXUN: locked up too long

956
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,400
WUXUN: in our CHUANG ASIA S2 dorm.

957
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,440
WUXUN: I didn't meet a girl for long.

958
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,640
WUXUN: It's like...

959
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,680
WUXUN: There is something
that makes me feel uneasy.

960
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,360
WUXUN: I feel disconnected.
(Looking forward to the special guest)

961
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:36,880

962

from the female guest for you.

963
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,480

we need to dress up a bit.

971
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,200
(Are you kidding me?)

972
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,800

Value more your crush.

973

to see that I am strong.

MYST: Wow, I look pretty cool.

976

(I am Batman)

977
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,760
WUXUN: Enough,
stop praising yourself anymore.

978
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,760
WUXUN: Or you'll faint
by your handsome look.

979
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,040
PRAY: We've thought of a group name.

980
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,760

- MYST: The fourth precept prohibits stealing.

1319
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,480
NINJA: Come on!

1320
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,880
MYST: But there is no precept

1321
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,320
MYST: that prohibits loving MYST.

1322
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,320
MYST: Thank you everyone, love you all.

1323
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,440
ALTON ANG: Hi, I'm ALTON ANG.

1324
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,320

BAMBAM: Okay.

1338
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,520
BAMBAM: Before we waiting
for the result,

1339
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,200
BAMBAM: let's have a small chat.

1340
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,280
- BAMBAM: We're gonna ask Gen1es DIDI.
- GEN1ES DIDI: Yes.

1341
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,080
BAMBAM: How do you feel working
with all the boys?

1342
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,000
BAMBAM: Any episode you want to
let us know?

1343
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,760
GEN1ES DIDI: Okay.

1344
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,840
GEN1ES DIDI: The first time I met them,

1345
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,360
GEN1ES DIDI: we have some
fun things happen.

1346
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,920
GEN1ES DIDI: They all make
a cute scene to me.

1347
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,400
GEN1ES DIDI: Make me feel
a crush to them.

1348
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,000
GEN1ES DIDI: To like bound
with each other faster.

1349
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,520
GEN1ES DIDI: I think it's super important
in our group,

1350
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,080
GEN1ES DIDI: 'cause actually,
we are not really dancing,

1351
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,720
GEN1ES DIDI: so more it's like acting.

1352
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,720
GEN1ES DIDI: I need to

1353
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,520
GEN1ES DIDI: get closer
to each other to be able to...

1354
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,320
GEN1ES DIDI: Let the audience know that

1355
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,440
GEN1ES DIDI: we are really having
the chemistry

1356
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,760
GEN1ES DIDI: and the crush feeling.

1357
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,160
BAMBAM: I hope everyone is going
to enjoy this.

1358
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,160
BAMBAM: Now, I want to know

1359
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,000
BAMBAM: what MIC DROP think.

1360
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,320
BAMBAM: Let me ask Gen1es QIAO YIYU.

1361
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,400
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: Oh, Gen1es DIDI,

1362
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,080
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: you got...

1363
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,720
GEN1ES DIDI: How was it?

1364
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,120
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: When I watched it,

1365
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,080
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: to be honest,

1366
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,760
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: I felt a bit...

1367
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,880
- GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: Heart racing.
- GEN1ES DIDI: Heart racing, right? I know.

1368
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,280
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: Yes, my heart
raced a bit.

1369
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,000
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: When I watched this,

1370
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,240
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: I admit I got a little
crush on all these trainees

1371
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:52,600
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: and also my friend
Gen1es DIDI.

1372
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,480
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: 'Cause I can feel
the chemistry between you guys.

1373
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,200
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: The eye contact

1374
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,240
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: and also
all this dancing

1375
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,800
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: and all the thing.
It's just so much together.

1376
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,960
GEN1ES DIDI: You're jealous.

1377
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,280
GEN1ES DIDI: You want to be with me.

1378
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,880
- GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: A little bit.
- BAMBAM: A little bit.

1379
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,920
BAMBAM: OMAR is the youngest.

1380
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,400
BAMBAM: They're all older brothers.

1381
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,520
BAMBAM: What do you think, OMAR?

1382
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,120
OMAR: I feel that everyone

1383
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,520
OMAR: expressed from their hearts.

1384
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,040
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- OMAR: This made me like the performance.

1385
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,960
- BAMBAM: Oh.
- PRAY: Wow.

1386
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,840
PRAY: Thank you, OMAR.

1387
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,440
BAMBAM: Okay. Before I announce,

1388
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,480
BAMBAM: TIAN QI, you think

1389
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,920
BAMBAM: they're gonna win you?

1390
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,320
GEN1ES DIDI: You know, we're classmates.

1391
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:40,960
BAMBAM: Who?
GEN1ES DIDI: Me and TIAN QI.

1392
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,440
- BAMBAM: Really?
- GEN1ES DIDI: Yeah.

1393
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,480
BAMBAM: But,

1394
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,000
BAMBAM: it's a competition right now.

1395
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,720
GEN1ES DIDI: Okay.

1396
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,600
GEN1ES DIDI: Who's gonna win?

1397
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,000
- BAMBAM: TIAN QI, you think...
- GEN1ES DIDI: Yo, yo!

1398
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,400
BAMBAM: You think they're gonna win you?

1399
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,840
TIAN QI: I feel like Gen1es DIDI
looks like a sweet girl.

1400
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,920
TIAN QI: So sweet.

1401
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,800
TIAN QI: But our team is better.

1402
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,600
BAMBAM: You know,
CRUSH was a vocal team.

1403
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,440
- JEFF: Yes.
- BAMBAM: How do you feel?

1404
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,240
BAMBAM: Anything you want to say?

1405
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,800
JEFF: They did a very good job

1406
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,560
JEFF: handling the vocal...

1407
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,200
- BAMBAM: Yes.
- JEFF: Then...

1408
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,480
JEFF: But there's sometimes they lose...

1409
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,480
- BAMBAM: Facial expressions?
- JEFF: Yeah.

1410
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,560
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- JEFF: Facial, because

1411
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,760
JEFF: they concerned about

1412
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,440
- JEFF: the dance moves.
- BAMBAM: The vocal too much.

1413
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,200
JEFF: Also the singing.

1414
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,840
JEFF: Another thing about MYST is...

1415
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,000
JEFF: I think he had a book

1416
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,200
JEFF: full of the flirting joke.

1417
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,880
BAMBAM: I hope he steals
a lot of people's hearts.

1418
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,560
BAMBAM: Do you have a joke?

1419
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,680
JEFF: You have it?

1420
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,160
BAMBAM: Do it, you want...

1421
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,480
JEFF: Show me.

1422
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,680
- BAMBAM: Me? Joke?
- JEFF: Yeah. You.

1423
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,800
BAMBAM: TIAN QI, can you do it
a little bit?

1424
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,440
BAMBAM: Do this.

1425
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,880
BAMBAM: Okay, let me see.

1426
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,840
BAMBAM: You'll fit just fine in my life.

1427
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,760
(You'll fit just fine in my life)

1428
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,320
BAMBAM: You get it?

1429
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,160
BAMBAM: Bro, give me a line.

1430
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,240
JEFF: I can't think of any.

1431
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,880
JEFF: Because all I can think about
is BAMBAM.

1432
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:07,200
(Nothing is on my mind, just BAMBAM)

1433
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,160
(Killed!)

1434
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:12,800
BAMBAM: Thank you so much.

1435
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,960
BAMBAM: So, let me announce
the final result.

1436
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,880
BAMBAM: CRUSH.

1437
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,440
BAMBAM: who is going to be the MVP
in the team?

1438
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,680
BAMBAM: The MVP

1439
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,880
BAMBAM: for CRUSH.

1440
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:36,840
GEN1ES DIDI: KK.

1441
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,160
BAMBAM: KK, congratulations!

1442
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,960
KK: I'm very surprised
to get the MVP title.

1443
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,760
KK: This song is a turning point for me.

1444
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,160
KK: It's the reason I chose this song.

1445
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,080
KK: It's really a limit for me.

1446
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,760
KK: Compared to the performances in the first
and second stages, the genre has changed a lot.

1447
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,960
KK: What I want to say is actually,

1448
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,280
KK: each one of us in the group has tried
different genres of music.

1449
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,640
KK: Finally, this time, I got the song
I liked the most.

1450
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,200
KK: The most important thing is you.

1451
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,640
KK: You voted for me,
thank you very much

1452
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,480
KK: for letting me choose
the song I like.

1453
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,200
KK: You are the light
that always shines in my life.

1454
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,760
KK: Love you all so much, thank you.

1455
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,440
BAMBAM: Another result I got

1456
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,320
BAMBAM: is...

1457
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,800
BAMBAM: our CRUSH is going to sit
in the MVP section

1458
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,960
BAMBAM: or MIC DROP, are you guys
gonna stay there?

1459
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,760
BAMBAM: Who will sit in the MVP section

1460
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,440
BAMBAM: is...

1461
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,440
BAMBAM: MIC DROP.

1462
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,440
OMAR: When I watched CRUSH,
I felt like I was about to leave.

1463
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,960
BAMBAM: Thank you so much.

1464
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,240
BAMBAM: Make some noise
for CRUSH one more time

1465
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,880
BAMBAM: and Gen1es DIDI
joining us today.

1466
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,680
KK: Actually, this time
I hope our team wins

1467
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,680
KK: at least once.

1468
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,520
KK: Because in the first public stage,

1469
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,960
KK: I was the MVP of the losing team.

1470
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,720
KK: But this round, I think that MVP

1471
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,520
KK: is not that important.
I just want to win once.

1472

1645
01:29:28,176 --> 01:29:28,976
GORDON: is me.

1646
01:29:28,976 --> 01:29:31,216

I'm quite confident

1647
01:29:31,216 --> 01:29:33,416

won't be bad.

GORDON: This is my favorite method.

1653
01:29:42,256 --> 01:29:44,456
GORDON: Normally,
your vocal cords will...

1654
01:29:44,856 --> 01:29:46,816
GORDON: be like this, right?

1655
01:29:46,816 --> 01:29:49,336
GORDON: But if you...

1656
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,176
GORDON: Adjust the sound balance

1657
01:29:58,176 --> 01:29:59,376
GORDON: and make it smooth.

through a straw while humming scales)

at singing.

1666
01:30:31,696 --> 01:30:34,776
JACKSON: I change from a person
who always dances intensely

how I did it.

my forte. I want to

01:36:39,776 --> 01:36:40,856
GORDON: most confidence...

1811
01:36:44,896 --> 01:36:46,376
- DUY: Too much.
- JACKSON: Too much?

1812
01:36:46,376 --> 01:36:47,536
- GORDON / DUY: Too much.
- JACKSON: Too much, too much.

1813
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:49,976
(Inpromptu singing)

1814
01:37:10,096 --> 01:37:13,496
JACKSON: Our mentor motivates us.

1815
01:37:14,336 --> 01:37:16,576
JACKSON: She supports us from behind.

1816
01:37:16,576 --> 01:37:19,096
JACKSON: She inspires us to push harder.

1817
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,416
JACKSON: Suddenly, I am very touched.

1818
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:23,576
JACKSON: Really moved.

1819
01:37:24,576 --> 01:37:25,976

- DANCE TEACHER: Six, seven,

1823
01:37:33,216 --> 01:37:34,296
DANCE TEACHER: Eight, up.

1824
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:40,096
(SMOOTH LANDING)

1825
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:42,776
PEAT: Safe, safe.

1826
01:37:44,456 --> 01:37:46,616
GORDON: JACKSON's totally different.

1827
01:37:46,616 --> 01:37:48,336
GORDON: During practice earlier,

1828
01:37:48,336 --> 01:37:49,696
GORDON: every time, he was very wild.

1829
01:37:51,136 --> 01:37:52,416
(Make a friend be a human clock!)

1830
01:37:54,136 --> 01:37:55,096
(SMOOTH HANDLING)

1831
01:37:57,776 --> 01:37:58,776
(BYE BYE)

1832
01:37:58,816 --> 01:38:01,136
DANCE TEACHER: Five, six, seven, eight.

1833
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:03,416
GORDON: But for YAYA,
for the first time, it was like

1834
01:38:03,416 --> 01:38:05,136
GORDON: he was carrying a precious gem.

1835
01:38:05,136 --> 01:38:08,096
DANCE TEACHER: Eight and one, too slow.

1836
01:38:08,096 --> 01:38:08,976
(Careful)
DANCE TEACHER: Too slow.

1837
01:38:08,976 --> 01:38:10,056
(CAREFUL) (SLOWLY)

1838
01:38:10,096 --> 01:38:11,016
YAYA: Look at me. Look at me.
(LOOK AT YOU!?)

1839
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:15,776
YAYA: Wait.

1840
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:19,856
(Shyness is taking over!)

1841
01:38:19,856 --> 01:38:21,416
JACKSON: YAYA is truly beautiful.

1842
01:38:21,536 --> 01:38:23,416
JACKSON: When we looked at each other,

1843
01:38:23,536 --> 01:38:24,536
JACKSON: I felt like
JACKSON: very shy.

1844
01:38:25,896 --> 01:38:28,296
PEAT: One, two, three, four.

1845
01:38:31,336 --> 01:38:32,176
GORDON: Sorry.

1846
01:38:32,736 --> 01:38:34,376
(FACE TURNS RED)

1847
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:37,256
DUY: I think 80 percent, see...

1848
01:38:40,816 --> 01:38:42,336
DANCE TEACHER: Okay.

1849
01:38:42,336 --> 01:38:43,936
GORDON: Suddenly, he became
very talkative.

1850
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:45,296
GORDON: Becomes talkative now.

1851
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,696
(LOOKS JITTERY)

1852
01:38:51,416 --> 01:38:53,176
(Mind goes blank)
GORDON: My mind goes blank.

1853
01:38:55,576 --> 01:38:56,336
STAFF: You sing.

1854
01:38:57,256 --> 01:38:58,616
GORDON: Why is your voice shivering?

1855
01:38:59,056 --> 01:39:00,456
DANCE TEACHER: Position of YAYA,

1856
01:39:00,456 --> 01:39:02,296
DANCE TEACHER: do like this.

1857
01:39:04,016 --> 01:39:05,296
DANCE TEACHER: And go.

1858
01:39:07,576 --> 01:39:08,456
DANCE TEACHER: Nice.

1859
01:39:08,896 --> 01:39:10,016
- DANCE TEACHER: Yes.
- REXY: And then...

1860
01:39:10,016 --> 01:39:11,976
REXY: Mentor YAYA is
a professional actress.

1861
01:39:11,976 --> 01:39:13,416
REXY: About making eye contact,

1862
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:15,256
REXY: she's truly a master.

1863
01:39:15,256 --> 01:39:17,976
YAYA: You will never get to see
me again, ever again.

1864
01:39:17,976 --> 01:39:20,456
YAYA: So, you wanna take this little
time that we have

1865
01:39:20,456 --> 01:39:22,216
YAYA: to look at each other, okay?

1866
01:39:23,896 --> 01:39:25,376
DANCE TEACHER: Five, six,

1867
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,176
DANCE TEACHER: seven, eight, and...

1868
01:39:27,576 --> 01:39:29,296
(Staring into each other's eyes...)

1869
01:39:39,856 --> 01:39:42,096
(Facing the wall, embarrassed from blushing)
GORDON: Zooming into the ears.

1870
01:39:42,096 --> 01:39:45,376
YAYA: Every woman
must want to be YAYA,

1871
01:39:45,376 --> 01:39:46,536
YAYA: because he's so strong...

1872
01:39:46,536 --> 01:39:47,536
YAYA: That was really good.

1873
01:39:47,536 --> 01:39:48,696
YAYA: High five, that was really good.

1874
01:39:48,696 --> 01:39:50,496
(Quickly wiping the sweat
from the hands)

1875
01:39:52,376 --> 01:39:53,976
GORDON: Having a guest made us

1876
01:39:53,976 --> 01:39:56,496
GORDON: perform better
than when we rehearsed alone.

1877
01:39:56,496 --> 01:39:58,216
GORDON: The vibe improved a lot.

1878
01:40:00,576 --> 01:40:02,576
GORDON: When singing, you need to have

1879
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:04,416
GORDON: someone you
want to communicate with.

1880
01:40:04,896 --> 01:40:08,176
GORDON: And that person appears,
so the performance feels more emotional.

1881
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:12,976
PEAT: She keeps talking to us,
so it makes us...

1882
01:40:12,976 --> 01:40:14,736
YAYA: Supposed that I drop myself and...

1883
01:40:14,736 --> 01:40:16,336
- PEAT: Break our wall.
- YAYA: And here, you have to...

1884
01:40:16,336 --> 01:40:17,616
PEAT: She is very nice

1885
01:40:17,616 --> 01:40:19,536
PEAT: and gives us some advice too.

1886
01:40:21,696 --> 01:40:24,136
REXY: When all the characters
come together,

1887
01:40:24,136 --> 01:40:26,216
REXY: we are presenting a perfect story.

1888
01:40:29,736 --> 01:40:32,056
JACKSON: We must perform
well in this round.

1889
01:40:32,056 --> 01:40:33,696
JACKSON: We will not disappoint you.

1890
01:40:34,496 --> 01:40:37,416
JACKSON: I'll let you see what it's like
when the muscular guy sings a love song.

1891
01:44:08,976 --> 01:44:12,056
(IMPRESSED) (IMPRESSED) (IMPRESSED)
NINJA: Oh, my God.

NINJA: Hey, look at him.

1894
01:44:17,416 --> 01:44:18,416
BIANURA: JACKSON.

1895
01:44:20,976 --> 01:44:22,736
DORN: I feel like I like REXY.

1896
01:44:22,736 --> 01:44:23,896
DORN: I feel like REXY is very handsome.

1897
01:44:23,896 --> 01:44:24,696
(REXY is so fine!)
DORN: Super handsome.

1898
01:44:24,696 --> 01:44:27,496
DORN: And YAYA leaned on his shoulder.

1899
01:44:27,496 --> 01:44:28,656
DORN: Wow.

1900
01:44:28,656 --> 01:44:30,536
DORN: It was already
impressive since the beginning.

1901
01:44:30,536 --> 01:44:32,656
WHYLUCAS: I am very impressed with DUY.

1902
01:44:32,656 --> 01:44:35,216
WHYLUCAS: He was really into this song.

1903
01:44:35,216 --> 01:44:36,976
WHYLUCAS: He is much more confident.

1904
01:44:36,976 --> 01:44:39,416
WHYLUCAS: And he is
a much better performer.

1905
01:44:39,416 --> 01:44:40,736
PEANUT: LAST FIREWORKS
OF THE SUMMER NIGHT today,

1906
01:44:40,736 --> 01:44:42,736
PEANUT: to be honest, we need
to give it up to DUY and GORDON

1907
01:44:42,736 --> 01:44:46,496
PEANUT: Because I have respected these two
for a long time in terms of singing.

1908
01:44:46,496 --> 01:44:48,736
PEANUT: And today, they came
to sing this song together.

1909
01:44:48,736 --> 01:44:51,296
PEANUT: There was a harmony section.

1910
01:44:51,296 --> 01:44:53,256
PEANUT: I feel like they finally
released their potential.

1911
01:44:53,256 --> 01:44:56,136
PEANUT: I am very impressed
and very proud of them.

1912
01:44:56,136 --> 01:44:59,816
BAMBAM: Everybody, please give it up
for SUMMER NIGHT.

1913
01:45:02,856 --> 01:45:05,216
BAMBAM: Okay, before we start voting,

1914
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:07,696
BAMBAM: Let me ask Mentor YAYA first

1915
01:45:07,696 --> 01:45:11,136
BAMBAM: how do you feel you work
with the trainees?

1916
01:45:11,136 --> 01:45:13,576
BAMBAM: Are they shy

1917
01:45:13,576 --> 01:45:16,656
BAMBAM: or getting embarrassing
in front of you?

1918
01:45:16,656 --> 01:45:19,096
YAYA: They are extremely shy.

1919
01:45:19,096 --> 01:45:20,576
BAMBAM: Oh.

1920
01:45:20,576 --> 01:45:21,376
YAYA: Like...

1921
01:45:21,976 --> 01:45:22,216
(Who?)
(Who?)
BAMBAM: Who?

1922
01:45:22,776 --> 01:45:24,096
BAMBAM: Especially who?

1923
01:45:24,096 --> 01:45:27,616
- YAYA: JACKSON is the most shy,
- BAMBAM: JACKSON.

1924
01:45:28,936 --> 01:45:30,136
YAYA: which is surprising.

1925
01:45:30,136 --> 01:45:34,376
YAYA: You know, beneath the masculine
and tough look,

1926
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:35,736
YAYA: he is very

1927
01:45:35,736 --> 01:45:37,096
YAYA: little one.

1928
01:45:38,656 --> 01:45:39,656
YAYA: Red ears.

1929
01:45:39,656 --> 01:45:40,816
- YAYA: His ears are really red.
- BAMBAM: Red ears.

1930
01:45:40,816 --> 01:45:41,456
BAMBAM: They are red now too.

1931
01:45:41,456 --> 01:45:44,256
BAMBAM: JACKSON, if you're so shy,
how do you hold her?

1932
01:45:47,976 --> 01:45:49,056
(Still Shy)

1933
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:54,856
JACKSON: She gives me so much confidence
to look at her.

1934
01:45:54,856 --> 01:45:56,816
JACKSON: So,

1935
01:45:56,816 --> 01:45:58,096
JACKSON: Oh my god.

1936
01:46:01,096 --> 01:46:02,256
JACKSON: Oh...

1937
01:46:02,256 --> 01:46:04,416
JACKSON: Just one look and I'm dead.

1938
01:46:06,256 --> 01:46:07,416
TADALEE: He's excited.

1939
01:46:08,216 --> 01:46:09,256
ALTON ANG: What is he saying?

1940
01:46:09,256 --> 01:46:10,536
MYST: Exactly, what is he talking about?

1941
01:46:10,536 --> 01:46:10,896
ALTON ANG: Yeah.

1942
01:46:11,576 --> 01:46:14,056
JACKSON: She helped me a lot.

1943
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:17,736
JACKSON: She helped me
overcome that shyness.

1944
01:46:17,736 --> 01:46:20,776
JACKSON: Especially for this performance.

1945
01:46:20,776 --> 01:46:23,656
JACKSON: I want to thank
Mentor YAYA a lot.

1946
01:46:23,656 --> 01:46:25,896
JACKSON: Thanks to her
who helped me overcome it.

1947
01:46:27,816 --> 01:46:29,456

1948
01:46:31,496 --> 01:46:32,536

2000
01:48:57,376 --> 01:48:58,936

that it almost burst out.

2001
01:48:58,936 --> 01:49:00,096

2002
01:49:00,096 --> 01:49:02,776

2004

JEFF: a little bit of everything.

2025
01:49:42,696 --> 01:49:46,696
JEFF: Because you bring out
the best of everybody.

2026
01:49:46,696 --> 01:49:49,296

01:50:04,456 --> 01:50:06,656

01:50:17,216 --> 01:50:19,376
JEFF: Thailand is always in summer.

2039
01:50:19,576 --> 01:50:20,896

2046
01:50:35,056 --> 01:50:41,496
BAMBAM: Three of the members have really
close points of voting right now,

2047
01:50:41,496 --> 01:50:43,936
BAMBAM: which is REXY,

2048
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,736
BAMBAM: GORDON,

2049
01:50:46,776 --> 01:50:48,096
BAMBAM: and DUY.

2050
01:50:52,016 --> 01:50:53,016

2051
01:50:53,016 --> 01:50:54,216

2052
01:50:54,736 --> 01:50:58,896
BAMBAM: But there can be
only one MVP for the team.

2053
01:50:59,376 --> 01:51:01,816
BAMBAM: So the MVP of SUMMER NIGHT...

2054
01:51:03,096 --> 01:51:04,096
BAMBAM: Give it up for...

2055
01:51:13,336 --> 01:51:14,256
BAMBAM: DUY.

2056
01:51:18,096 --> 01:51:19,816
MYST: Awesome.

2057
01:51:20,816 --> 01:51:22,016
PRAY: That's my boy.

2058
01:51:22,856 --> 01:51:24,016
WHYLUCAS: Yay!

2059
01:51:28,856 --> 01:51:30,056
DUY: No way.

2060
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,856
DUY: Thank you.

2061
01:51:34,096 --> 01:51:35,256
DUY: I don't know.

2062
01:51:35,816 --> 01:51:38,056
DUY: I still cannot believe it.

2063
01:51:38,056 --> 01:51:40,016
DUY: Because my ranking is 33.

2064
01:51:40,016 --> 01:51:42,256
KOHI: The biggest surprise is DUY.

2065
01:51:42,656 --> 01:51:44,056
KOHI: To be honest,

2066
01:51:44,056 --> 01:51:46,456
KOHI: GORDON sang very well.

2067
01:51:46,456 --> 01:51:49,296
KOHI: But you can't deny
that DUY stood out more today.

2068
01:51:49,576 --> 01:51:53,136
KOHI: It might be because
he sang higher notes.

2069
01:51:53,136 --> 01:51:57,016
KOHI: But I can say that his tone
was really fitting.

2070
01:51:57,376 --> 01:51:58,376
KOSHIN: It's DUY.

2071
01:51:59,616 --> 01:52:00,616
KOSHIN: Yes.

2072
01:52:00,776 --> 01:52:03,056
KOSHIN: Unexpected.

2073
01:52:03,296 --> 01:52:05,336
KOSHIN: I knew DUY had
amazing vocal power.

2074
01:52:05,336 --> 01:52:08,416
KOSHIN: And I am really happy
that he got MVP for vocals.

2075
01:52:08,416 --> 01:52:10,416
KOSHIN: DUY is truly amazing.

2076
01:52:11,176 --> 01:52:12,496
DUY: You know, I...

2077
01:52:12,696 --> 01:52:15,776
DUY: I already prepared myself.

2078
01:52:16,376 --> 01:52:18,296
DUY: After this show, I go Vietnam

2079
01:52:18,296 --> 01:52:20,496
DUY: and eat some Vietnamese food
like pho.

2080
01:52:20,496 --> 01:52:22,096
BAMBAM: Okay, have pho.

2081
01:52:22,096 --> 01:52:23,576
DUY: I thought I have no more chance

2082
01:52:23,576 --> 01:52:25,976
DUY: Because my ranking is 33.

2083
01:52:28,376 --> 01:52:30,256
BAMBAM: Rank is a number.

2084
01:52:30,256 --> 01:52:31,296
- BAMBAM: Okay?
- DUY: It's just a number.

2085
01:52:31,296 --> 01:52:32,176
BAMBAM: Don't worry about it.

2086
01:52:32,176 --> 01:52:34,856
DUY: But I think I have one more chance.

2087
01:52:35,536 --> 01:52:39,496
DUY: If I can pass this round,

2088
01:52:39,776 --> 01:52:42,976
DUY: I will try more harder, so harder

2089
01:52:43,456 --> 01:52:45,616

to challenge other dance styles.

2146

for you all to see.

is looking forward to our performance.

my ears turn red.

2160

DONGDONG: But my passion

2161

this place feels so hot.

2187

conditioner is broken or something.

2195
01:58:46,296 --> 01:58:47,576
DORN: I am a fan of funk dancing.

2196
01:58:47,616 --> 01:58:48,896
DORN: I feel that
when I hear WHEN WE DISCO,

2197
01:58:49,776 --> 01:58:53,176
DORN: it definitely has to go along
with old school and funk.

2198
01:58:53,176 --> 01:58:54,976
DORN: So I feel that
this is definitely my first choice.

2199
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,656
DORN: Because it's something
I'm already skilled at.

2200
01:58:57,936 --> 01:59:00,736

on the TV, we looked at each other...

2201

wanted to team up with Thai people

2204

DONGDONG: because I want to learn...

2205
01:59:10,096 --> 01:59:12,256
DONGDONG: How come they are so lively
and open-hearted?

2206
01:59:12,256 --> 01:59:14,176

their true selves.

to challenge myself.

2216
01:59:35,656 --> 01:59:38,856
DORN: Therefore, I don't want there
to be issues with

2217
01:59:38,856 --> 01:59:40,496
DORN: mental issues that we
couldn't manage properly.

2218
01:59:40,496 --> 01:59:42,896
DORN: It would cause the atmosphere
of the performance to be bad.

2219
01:59:42,896 --> 01:59:45,496
DORN: So I feel like I want

2220
01:59:45,496 --> 01:59:47,856
DORN: to get everything everyone wants.

2221
01:59:47,976 --> 01:59:49,016

DONGDONG: Center?

2225
01:59:55,736 --> 01:59:58,256
DORN: I have this idea.
I don't want the center position.

2226
01:59:58,736 --> 02:00:00,776
DORN: This song, I'm here to dance.

2227
02:00:00,816 --> 02:00:03,296
DORN: I don't want anything else.

2228
02:00:03,376 --> 02:00:05,976

I have an ace up my sleeve, which is...

2229
02:00:05,976 --> 02:00:08,816
DORN: The more I relax,
the better my work turns out.

2230

NINJA: So,

2231
02:00:09,776 --> 02:00:11,336
- DONGDONG: Settled down?
- NINJA: center is going to be

2232

XIONG: I got appointed as the center.

2239
02:00:22,696 --> 02:00:26,976

I have never tried before.

2240
02:00:26,976 --> 02:00:29,576

haven't found that vibe.

2247

the disco vibe at all.

2248
02:00:55,816 --> 02:00:57,376
(Scratching his head)
XIONG: I was very worried during the dance class.

2249

I wasn't suitable at all.

2251

I can only see him.

and wants to perform it very much.

the mood of the song WHEN WE DISCO.

it's due to the moves.

DONGDONG: but I was the one getting hot.

2472
02:12:21,296 --> 02:12:25,456
DONGDONG: I rarely have the chance
to dance with a woman.

2473
02:12:25,656 --> 02:12:26,536

if you just go like this

I would be this close to her

2500
02:13:50,376 --> 02:13:53,376
XIONG: when we have
dance moves together.

2501

on stage wasn't a big deal.

2509
02:14:06,816 --> 02:14:08,296
XIONG: It made me...

2510
02:14:09,176 --> 02:14:11,056
XIONG: Less anxious.

2511
02:14:30,096 --> 02:14:33,056
DORN: I also started practicing
by genuinely making eye contact.

2512
02:14:33,056 --> 02:14:34,496
DORN: If we feel it ourselves,

2513
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:36,616

will be able to relate.

2526
02:18:45,456 --> 02:18:47,096
TIAN QI: If we were actually in a disco,

2527
02:18:47,096 --> 02:18:49,456
TIAN QI: he would be the standout,
the brightest.

2528
02:18:49,456 --> 02:18:51,816

2543

PEANUT: Hello, I am PEANUT. Number two.

2544
02:19:39,416 --> 02:19:41,216
PEANUT: We practiced really hard,

2545
02:19:41,216 --> 02:19:44,576
PEANUT: because our lock dance
or pop dance basics are almost zero.

2546
02:19:44,616 --> 02:19:46,576
PEANUT: We had DORN helping us.

2547
02:19:46,616 --> 02:19:48,496
PEANUT: Finally,
we made it through well,

2548
02:19:48,536 --> 02:19:50,536

2549

2550
02:19:53,016 --> 02:19:54,256
PEANUT: Today,

2551
02:19:54,296 --> 02:19:55,736
PEANUT: no matter who becomes the MVP,

2552
02:19:55,776 --> 02:20:00,176
PEANUT: I want audience and fans

2553
02:20:00,216 --> 02:20:02,816

MVPs in your hearts today.

2554

2560
02:20:14,816 --> 02:20:18,096
XIONG: If it weren't for them,
I wouldn't be standing on stage today.

2561
02:20:18,136 --> 02:20:20,856
XIONG: They've got this way of

2562
02:20:22,136 --> 02:20:23,856
XIONG: pulling me out,

2563
02:20:23,856 --> 02:20:26,256
XIONG: dragging me away
from my shy, introverted self...

2564
02:20:26,256 --> 02:20:28,696
XIONG: Yes. Now I can dance with them

2565
02:20:28,696 --> 02:20:31,576

2566

- AUDIENCE: DORN!
- DORN: I am...

2571
02:20:46,176 --> 02:20:48,216
DORN: Honestly, I don't hope for MVP.

2572
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:50,656
DORN: But I hope you will
feel like I'm your brother.

2573
02:20:53,496 --> 02:20:54,816
DORN: After the performance,
I want to have that feeling.

2574
02:20:54,816 --> 02:20:56,016
DORN: Can I?

2575
02:20:56,016 --> 02:20:57,456

2576
02:20:57,456 --> 02:20:58,856

2579
02:21:02,176 --> 02:21:05,336
DORN: Honestly, I have to thank
everyone behind me.

2580
02:21:05,616 --> 02:21:07,576
DORN: Actually, as everyone knows,

2581
02:21:07,576 --> 02:21:09,096
DORN: I just recovered
from a leg injury.

2582
02:21:09,096 --> 02:21:13,496
DORN: But they kept preventing me
from practicing all the time.

2583
02:21:13,496 --> 02:21:14,656
DORN: It's a good thing.

2584
02:21:14,656 --> 02:21:16,496
DORN: I recovered thanks to them.

2585
02:21:16,496 --> 02:21:17,656
DORN: Otherwise, I would
have been very stubborn.

2586
02:21:17,656 --> 02:21:19,616
DORN: Actually, about the MVP, I...

2587
02:21:19,616 --> 02:21:20,456
DORN: It's not necessary
to give it to me.

2588
02:21:20,456 --> 02:21:22,336
DORN: Give it to someone
behind me, anyone.

2589
02:21:22,496 --> 02:21:23,376
DORN: That's all.

2590
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:25,776
DORN: They helped me.

2591
02:21:25,776 --> 02:21:26,976

2592
02:21:26,976 --> 02:21:29,896
AUDIENCE: Okay.

2593
02:21:30,616 --> 02:21:33,856
DONGDONG: I want to say... Because...

2594
02:21:33,856 --> 02:21:35,936
DONGDONG: Actually, the reason
I chose DISCO team

2595
02:21:35,936 --> 02:21:39,096
DONGDONG: was that I wanted
to learn from them.

2596
02:21:39,096 --> 02:21:40,896
DONGDONG: And I have learned

2597

today's performance.

2600
02:21:49,856 --> 02:21:53,096
DONGDONG: Win or lose the MVP,

2601
02:21:53,096 --> 02:21:55,336
DONGDONG: I hope our performance today

2602
02:21:55,736 --> 02:21:58,616
DONGDONG: will earn us a place as
the all-time MVP in your hearts.

2603

tried this style before.

2620
02:22:46,736 --> 02:22:49,096

2621
02:22:49,136 --> 02:22:50,176
- BAMBAM: Oh, really?
- NAOMI WANG: Yeah.

2622
02:22:50,216 --> 02:22:51,296

- NAOMI WANG: Because...

2623
02:22:51,336 --> 02:22:54,016

a lot of interactions,

2624
02:22:54,016 --> 02:22:56,136

2626
02:22:57,616 --> 02:23:00,736

to put their hands on me.

2627
02:23:00,776 --> 02:23:02,456
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- NAOMI WANG: I'm like grabbing their hands,

2628
02:23:02,496 --> 02:23:03,656
NAOMI WANG: like touch me, touch me.

02:23:04,016 --> 02:23:05,576
NAOMI WANG: This is a show. It's okay.

2630
02:23:05,616 --> 02:23:07,416
NAOMI WANG: Treat me
like a boy, or a prop.

2631
02:23:07,416 --> 02:23:08,736
NAOMI WANG: Don't think of me as a girl.

2632
02:23:08,936 --> 02:23:10,576
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- NAOMI WANG: And here's the show.

2633

2635
02:23:13,736 --> 02:23:15,376
- NAOMI WANG: The shiest?
- BAMBAM: For you?

2636
02:23:15,696 --> 02:23:16,736

2639
02:23:20,176 --> 02:23:22,016

2640
02:23:22,056 --> 02:23:24,416

2645
02:23:32,696 --> 02:23:35,416
BAMBAM: So, how about we
start voting now?

2646
02:23:35,456 --> 02:23:38,376
BAMBAM: Let's see who will become
the MVP for WHEN WE DISCO team?

2647
02:23:38,376 --> 02:23:40,656
BAMBAM: And, voting starts.

2648
02:23:46,416 --> 02:23:47,976

02:23:54,736 --> 02:23:56,616
BAMBAM: So, while we're waiting
for the results,

2654
02:23:56,656 --> 02:23:58,336
BAMBAM: let's have a small chit-chat.

2655
02:23:58,496 --> 02:24:00,096
BAMBAM: JEFF, What do you think?

2656
02:24:00,176 --> 02:24:02,936
(The Best Show)
JEFF: For me, it's the best show so far.

2657
02:24:03,616 --> 02:24:06,336
JEFF: I really love that
because they were all like...

2658
02:24:06,376 --> 02:24:08,336
JEFF: Especially XIONG.

2659
02:24:08,616 --> 02:24:12,256
JEFF: He didn't do, like a...
This type of show that much.

2660
02:24:12,296 --> 02:24:15,296
- JEFF: Because back then, he was very quiet
- BAMBAM: Yeah.

2661
02:24:15,336 --> 02:24:16,936
JEFF: and shy, and then...

2662
02:24:17,336 --> 02:24:18,576
JEFF: Now, look at him.

2663
02:24:18,736 --> 02:24:22,056
JEFF: Look good, charming,
and very playful.

2664
02:24:23,096 --> 02:24:24,776
- JEFF: I mean...
- XIONG: Thank you very much.

2665
02:24:25,216 --> 02:24:27,296
JEFF: I mean the energy is pretty good.

2666
02:24:27,336 --> 02:24:29,896
JEFF: I can't pick the one that I like.

2667
02:24:29,896 --> 02:24:31,896
JEFF: Because I just like everyone.

2668
02:24:31,976 --> 02:24:33,296
JEFF: What do you think, BAMBAM?

2669
02:24:33,376 --> 02:24:35,936
BAMBAM: Oh! It's a dance team, huh?

2670
02:24:36,016 --> 02:24:37,696
BAMBAM: Everyone is really good for me.

2671
02:24:37,736 --> 02:24:39,176
BAMBAM: I really like it

2672
02:24:39,176 --> 02:24:40,336
BAMBAM: But for me,

2673
02:24:40,776 --> 02:24:44,576
BAMBAM: the one that got
a really, really good dance skill

2674
02:24:45,136 --> 02:24:46,736
BAMBAM: I have to say. It's DORN.

2675
02:24:46,776 --> 02:24:47,936
BAMBAM: It's you, bro.

2676
02:24:48,936 --> 02:24:49,856
DORN: Thank you.

2677
02:24:50,496 --> 02:24:52,056
BAMBAM: From the first day until now,

2678
02:24:52,136 --> 02:24:54,496
BAMBAM: you haven't danced
weakly for a single day.

2679
02:24:54,536 --> 02:24:55,976
- BAMBAM: That's like...
- DORN: Thank you.

2680
02:24:56,176 --> 02:24:57,456
- BAMBAM: I love it.
- DORN: Thank you.

2681
02:24:57,496 --> 02:24:58,216
BAMBAM: I love it.

2682
02:24:58,216 --> 02:25:00,496
BAMBAM: DORN, you just recovered
from a leg injury.

2683
02:25:00,536 --> 02:25:04,936
BAMBAM: While practicing,
were there any health issues?

2684
02:25:05,136 --> 02:25:06,216
DORN: Definitely.

2685
02:25:06,216 --> 02:25:08,176
- DORN: I had Achilles tendonitis, right? And...
- BAMBAM: Yes.

2686
02:25:08,256 --> 02:25:10,576
- DORN: We had only four days to prepare for the performance.
- BAMBAM: I see.

2687
02:25:10,616 --> 02:25:13,696
DORN: I felt like I had to push myself,

2688
02:25:13,696 --> 02:25:16,416
DORN: because if I didn't,
I was afraid I'd fall behind.

2689
02:25:16,456 --> 02:25:18,136
DORN: It's my stubbornness
that made me want to dance.

2690
02:25:18,176 --> 02:25:19,456
DORN: I feel that this performance,

2691
02:25:19,496 --> 02:25:20,496
DORN: honestly, from my heart,
DORN: I don't need to be MVP.

2692
02:25:21,496 --> 02:25:23,496
DORN: I'm happy to dance again.

2693
02:25:23,536 --> 02:25:26,816
DORN: Because I talked to a friend

2694
02:25:26,856 --> 02:25:28,496
DORN: about wanting to do
this performance with him.

2695
02:25:29,016 --> 02:25:31,056
DORN: I danced with him in mind.

2696
02:25:31,256 --> 02:25:33,776
DORN: Just dancing makes me satisfied.
I am very happy.

2697
02:25:33,816 --> 02:25:36,776
BAMBAM: This is one thing that
I really admire about DORN.

2698
02:25:36,776 --> 02:25:39,816
BAMBAM: In the last filming,
he was still injured.

2699
02:25:40,016 --> 02:25:41,936
(Leg Swelling)
BAMBAM: But today, you can't see it.

2700
02:25:42,136 --> 02:25:44,016
BAMBAM: And that is
the professional's mindset.

2701
02:25:44,056 --> 02:25:45,056
BAMBAM: I really like it

2702
02:25:45,096 --> 02:25:47,336
BAMBAM: At last, Mentor TIA RAY,
what do you think?

2703
02:25:47,376 --> 02:25:49,856
TIA RAY: I have nothing to say.
It's the best show so far.

2704
02:25:51,656 --> 02:25:52,616
TIA RAY: I really enjoyed it.

2705
02:25:52,656 --> 02:25:54,296
TIA RAY: Everyone is so professional.

2706
02:25:54,336 --> 02:25:55,896
TIA RAY: And also...

2707
02:25:56,336 --> 02:25:58,296
TIA RAY: NAOMI WANG, seriously.

2708
02:25:58,336 --> 02:25:59,696
TIA RAY: She is the Queen tonight.

2709
02:25:59,736 --> 02:26:02,176
- TIA RAY: I mean. On the stage with the guys.
- BAMBAM: And you're right. You know.

2710
02:26:02,176 --> 02:26:05,816
TIA RAY: And then, you guys are
really, really combined as one.

2711
02:26:05,896 --> 02:26:06,816
TIA RAY: I am not a dancer,

2712
02:26:06,856 --> 02:26:08,296
- BAMBAM: Yeah. Yeah.
- TIA RAY: so I can't judge.

2713
02:26:08,336 --> 02:26:10,936
TIA RAY: But I was so...
Enjoyed the show. It's...

2714
02:26:11,376 --> 02:26:12,216
TIA RAY: It's a bang.

2715
02:26:12,256 --> 02:26:13,736
BAMBAM: It's a bang. It's still grand.

2716
02:26:13,776 --> 02:26:15,136
TIA RAY: Congratulations, guys.

2717
02:26:15,136 --> 02:26:16,336

BAMBAM: So...

2726
02:26:33,896 --> 02:26:37,496
BAMBAM: Really win with
the really high score.

2727
02:26:40,416 --> 02:26:43,056
BAMBAM: The MVP
for WHEN WE DISCO team...

2728
02:26:46,496 --> 02:26:48,016
BAMBAM: Give it up for...

2729
02:26:48,056 --> 02:26:48,896
BAMBAM: XIONG.

2730
02:26:50,936 --> 02:26:52,456

XIONG: Thank you.

2737
02:27:14,016 --> 02:27:15,536
BAMBAM: Alright, XIONG, say something.

2738
02:27:15,896 --> 02:27:16,896
XIONG: I think

2739
02:27:16,936 --> 02:27:19,096
XIONG: the reason I'm the center is that

2740
02:27:19,096 --> 02:27:20,896
XIONG: my teammates believe in me.

2741
02:27:21,616 --> 02:27:24,656
XIONG: So I got the center. Because...

2742
02:27:25,816 --> 02:27:28,616
XIONG: I chose this song
to challenge myself.

2743
02:27:29,056 --> 02:27:31,176
XIONG: So, I want to thank them.

2744
02:27:32,176 --> 02:27:33,216
XIONG: And thank you all as well.

2745
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:36,176
XIONG: Honestly, it's because of them

2746
02:27:36,216 --> 02:27:39,936
XIONG: that made me very happy
with this song on stage.

2747
02:27:40,616 --> 02:27:43,256
XIONG: If it weren't
for these four people,

2748
02:27:43,456 --> 02:27:46,656
XIONG: today, I might
still be the same as before.

2749
02:27:46,736 --> 02:27:47,816
XIONG: I can feel
that I was enjoying it.

2750
02:27:48,536 --> 02:27:49,816
XIONG: I really feel it.

2751
02:27:50,456 --> 02:27:52,896
YUCHEN: Today, XIONG
has surpassed himself,

2752
02:27:53,416 --> 02:27:54,336
YUCHEN: challenged himself.

2753
02:27:54,456 --> 02:27:57,576

bite his lip while dancing before.

2754
02:27:58,576 --> 02:28:00,016

02:28:02,696 --> 02:28:05,016

02:28:06,856 --> 02:28:08,256
DORN: and is very determined.

2759
02:28:08,296 --> 02:28:10,736

in every role he gets.

2760
02:28:10,816 --> 02:28:13,456

from the first performance to this one,

2761

02:28:24,376 --> 02:28:26,056
BAMBAM: Okay, let's ask MIC DROP.

2766
02:28:26,096 --> 02:28:27,696
BAMBAM: Do you guys think

2767
02:28:27,776 --> 02:28:30,216
BAMBAM: they gonna take the MVP seat?

2768
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:37,096
- DORN: No, no, no.
- OMAR: Yeah. I...

2769
02:28:37,176 --> 02:28:40,976

02:28:43,576 --> 02:28:44,896

think about this show?

2772
02:28:44,896 --> 02:28:45,816
BAMBAM: Be honest.

2773
02:28:46,456 --> 02:28:48,016
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: To be honest,

2774
02:28:48,576 --> 02:28:52,656
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: I mean like.
Funky is one of my favorite styles.

2775
02:28:52,696 --> 02:28:54,456
- BAMBAM: Okay.
- GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: And...

2776
02:28:55,056 --> 02:28:59,136
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: I used to dancing
in the old school, Korea or something.

2777
02:28:59,176 --> 02:29:02,016
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: So,
seeing this kind of stage on

2778
02:29:02,056 --> 02:29:04,376
GEN1ES QIAO YIYU: CHUANG ASIA S2 was
a really big surprise for me.

2779
02:29:04,416 --> 02:29:08,056
BAMBAM: KOSHIN, you win for two rounds.

2780
02:29:09,056 --> 02:29:11,136
BAMBAM: What do you
think about this round?

2781
02:29:16,016 --> 02:29:17,296
KOSHIN: Actually, I want to win.

2782
02:29:18,496 --> 02:29:19,256
KOSHIN: But...

2783
02:29:21,816 --> 02:29:23,096
KOSHIN: Really hard.

2784
02:29:23,136 --> 02:29:24,056
BAMBAM: Really hard?

2785
02:29:24,216 --> 02:29:24,936
KOSHIN: Yes, but...

2786
02:29:24,976 --> 02:29:27,416
KOSHIN: If I lose here,

2787
02:29:27,456 --> 02:29:31,016
KOSHIN: it means I've lost
to DONGDONG's team again.

2788
02:29:31,056 --> 02:29:32,296
KOSHIN: So, I want to win.

2789
02:29:32,336 --> 02:29:35,616
BAMBAM: Okay, DONGDONG,
do you think you can win MIC DROP?

2790
02:29:35,896 --> 02:29:36,816
DONGDONG: I think...

2791
02:29:36,856 --> 02:29:38,136
DONGDONG: Yes, we can win.

2792
02:29:41,456 --> 02:29:43,696
BAMBAM: MIC DROP,
you've won for two rounds.

2793
02:29:43,856 --> 02:29:45,376
BAMBAM: Let's see what's going on.

2794
02:29:46,096 --> 02:29:52,976
BAMBAM: So the team
that will take the seat of the MVP...

2795
02:29:55,536 --> 02:29:56,496
BAMBAM: Oh my god.

2796
02:29:58,736 --> 02:30:00,536
BAMBAM: Coming right back
after the commercial.

2797
02:30:00,576 --> 02:30:01,296
BAMBAM: I'm sorry.

2798
02:30:05,136 --> 02:30:05,976
ALTON ANG: Again.

2799
02:30:06,376 --> 02:30:09,656
BAMBAM: The team that got the MVP...

2800
02:30:15,416 --> 02:30:16,296
BAMBAM: The team...

2801
02:30:19,096 --> 02:30:20,816
BAMBAM: Make some noise
for WHEN WE DISCO.

2802
02:30:31,576 --> 02:30:33,136
NINJA: Amazing.

2803
02:30:36,616 --> 02:30:38,656
NINJA: The happiness up there
is greater than anything else.

2804
02:30:38,656 --> 02:30:40,816
NINJA: Today, I'm happy
to dance with my teammates.

2805
02:30:40,816 --> 02:30:42,696
NINJA: And dance with friends
we want to be with.

2806
02:30:42,696 --> 02:30:43,536
NINJA: That makes me happy.

2807
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:45,056
XIONG: I am very happy.

2808
02:30:45,056 --> 02:30:48,176
XIONG: When I danced, I didn't
think about anything else.

2809
02:30:48,176 --> 02:30:50,016
XIONG: I was just enjoying
the performance.

2810
02:30:50,096 --> 02:30:51,576
DORN: I feel satisfied.

2811
02:30:51,576 --> 02:30:52,536
DORN: Today, on the stage,

2812
02:30:52,936 --> 02:30:54,176
DORN: I was happy.

2813
02:30:54,176 --> 02:30:58,656
PEANUT: We all enjoyed it.
We were happy when we performed.

2814
02:30:58,656 --> 02:31:01,616
PEANUT: I feel that
it is the best thing.

2815
02:31:01,616 --> 02:31:04,656
DONGDONG: Today is the happiest day

2816
02:31:04,656 --> 02:31:06,336
DONGDONG: in the past five years.

2817
02:31:06,336 --> 02:31:08,816
DONGDONG: I could remember
standing on stage with them

2818
02:31:08,816 --> 02:31:10,776
DONGDONG: right up to my last breath.

2819
02:31:29,456 --> 02:31:30,456
DONGDONG: I'm sad.

2820
02:31:31,376 --> 02:31:33,376
DONGDONG: Although
this time is very short,

2821
02:31:33,576 --> 02:31:34,816
DONGDONG: it's one
of the happiest stages.

2822
02:31:35,056 --> 02:31:35,856
DONGDONG: I don't know if I

2823
02:31:36,776 --> 02:31:37,656
DONGDONG: would have

2824
02:31:37,656 --> 02:31:39,296
DONGDONG: such a stage next time.

2825
02:31:41,136 --> 02:31:43,376
- AUDIENCE: DORN!
- BAMBAM: Alright.

2826
02:31:44,216 --> 02:31:45,376
BAMBAM: Finally...

2827
02:31:45,736 --> 02:31:49,216
BAMBAM: The MVP SEATs have taken.

2828
02:31:54,456 --> 02:31:55,696
BAMBAM: Alright. NINJA.

2829
02:31:55,896 --> 02:31:59,256
BAMBAM: How do you feel
that you finally take over the MVP SEAT?

2830
02:31:59,336 --> 02:32:00,896
NINJA: First of all...

2831
02:32:05,736 --> 02:32:07,776
NINJA: I didn't pull it,
but it tightened by itself.

2832
02:32:09,456 --> 02:32:10,376
NINJA: Listen.

2833
02:32:10,416 --> 02:32:12,176
NINJA: I didn't mean to show off at all.

2834
02:32:12,216 --> 02:32:15,096
NINJA: But thank you very much
for truly supporting all of us.

2835
02:32:15,096 --> 02:32:18,976
NINJA: Because it's very difficult
to be the MVP of all teams.

2836
02:32:18,976 --> 02:32:20,736
NINJA: It's the highest
challenge of today.

2837
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:23,056
NINJA: We don't know
if we could sit here for long.

2838
02:32:23,056 --> 02:32:25,456
NINJA: But at least
we sit here once today.

2839
02:32:25,456 --> 02:32:27,096
NINJA: It's not just because
we performed well,

2840
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:28,336
NINJA: but you all voted for us.

2841
02:32:28,376 --> 02:32:29,456
NINJA: Thank you very much.

2842
02:32:29,496 --> 02:32:30,136
BAMBAM: Alright.

2843
02:32:31,856 --> 02:32:34,616
BAMBAM: I hope
WHEN WE DISCO keep continue

2844
02:32:34,856 --> 02:32:37,896
BAMBAM: and keep the MVP SEAT
until the last team. Alright?

2845
02:32:37,896 --> 02:32:39,096
BAMBAM: Wish the best for you guys.

2846
02:32:39,296 --> 02:32:40,896
BAMBAM: And now...

2847
02:32:42,256 --> 02:32:44,496
BAMBAM: I'm very excited
for the next team.

2848
02:32:44,496 --> 02:32:47,776
BAMBAM: This is probably
the only song today

2849
02:32:47,936 --> 02:32:49,576
BAMBAM: that makes you feel

2850
02:32:49,576 --> 02:32:52,216
BAMBAM: captivated

2851
02:32:52,216 --> 02:32:54,216
BAMBAM: and dangerous.

2852
02:32:54,216 --> 02:32:55,736
BAMBAM: To be honest, I'm a bit nervous

2853
02:32:55,736 --> 02:32:59,096
BAMBAM: about how you will
turn it out on this stage.

2854
02:32:59,096 --> 02:33:02,216
BAMBAM: Since this is a song
that I wrote and I composed.

2855
02:33:03,856 --> 02:33:05,376
BAMBAM: Let's welcome

2856
02:33:05,776 --> 02:33:09,296
BAMBAM: the powerful
and charismatic center,

2857
02:33:10,096 --> 02:33:11,616
BAMBAM: TADALEE.

2858
02:33:12,776 --> 02:33:15,536
BAMBAM: Leading his team
along with a special guest,

2859
02:33:15,536 --> 02:33:18,816
BAMBAM: the first generation
of CHUANG senior,

2860
02:33:18,816 --> 02:33:20,896
BAMBAM: ZI XUAN LI,

2861
02:33:21,096 --> 02:33:24,816
BAMBAM: performing the song called

2862
02:33:24,816 --> 02:33:25,976
BAMBAM: PYTHON.

2863
02:33:28,376 --> 02:33:30,576
BAMBAM: I'm super nervous. Well.

2864
02:33:30,576 --> 02:33:31,896
BAMBAM: Since it's my song.

2865
02:33:31,896 --> 02:33:33,776
BAMBAM: No bias or anything.

2866
02:33:33,776 --> 02:33:36,976
BAMBAM: I am gonna watch
with my honest feeling and everything.

2867
02:33:36,976 --> 02:33:39,656
BAMBAM: So everybody,
please welcome PYTHON.

2868
02:33:41,896 --> 02:33:44,536
- TADALEE: One, two, three.
- TRAINEES: PYTHON.

2869
02:34:05,176 --> 02:34:07,456
(To Be Continued)

2870
02:34:07,816 --> 02:34:10,256
(Before the First Elimination)

2871
02:34:22,656 --> 02:34:27,216
(Everyone is concentrated)

2872
02:34:34,696 --> 02:34:37,576
NINJA: I have to say
that our dance class is difficult.

2873
02:34:56,376 --> 02:34:57,536
JACKSON: I know RIKIMARU.

2874
02:34:57,536 --> 02:34:58,696
JACKSON: So I was very surprised.

2875
02:34:58,696 --> 02:34:59,336
JACKSON: But I just...

2876
02:34:59,336 --> 02:35:01,576
JACKSON: I just watched his performance

2877
02:35:01,576 --> 02:35:03,056
JACKSON: and felt it was amazing.

2878
02:35:03,176 --> 02:35:06,336
RIKIMARU: This time I had the chance
to be your special mentor

2879
02:35:06,336 --> 02:35:09,336
RIKIMARU: to create your performance.

2880
02:35:09,336 --> 02:35:10,336
RIKIMARU: In the mission,

2881
02:35:10,336 --> 02:35:11,576
RIKIMARU: there's a song

2882
02:35:11,576 --> 02:35:13,136
RIKIMARU: that I choreographed myself.

2883
02:35:13,376 --> 02:35:14,376
RIKIMARU: Can you guess it?
RIKIMARU: Which song it is?

2884
02:35:15,896 --> 02:35:16,896
RIKIMARU: It is...

2885
02:35:17,296 --> 02:35:18,696
RIKIMARU: MIC DROP.

2886
02:35:18,696 --> 02:35:21,136
RIKIMARU: Hello everyone, I am RIKIMARU.

2887
02:35:21,176 --> 02:35:22,336
RIKIMARU: Do you know me?

2888
02:35:22,336 --> 02:35:23,536
TRAINEES: Yes.

2889
02:35:24,136 --> 02:35:25,656
RIKIMARU: How do you
think about the practice?

2890
02:35:26,056 --> 02:35:27,016
AGUANG: It's very difficult.
RIKIMARU: Very difficult.

2891
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:31,496
RIKIMARU: Then, first,

2892
02:35:31,496 --> 02:35:34,456
RIKIMARU: can you show me
the performance once?

2893
02:35:34,456 --> 02:35:36,296
RIKIMARU: I want to know
how you all dance.

2894
02:35:36,296 --> 02:35:38,136
TRAINEES: Yes!

2895
02:35:45,376 --> 02:35:46,976
(Watching very intently)

2896
02:36:04,616 --> 02:36:06,656
RIKIMARU: Stop.

2897
02:36:09,536 --> 02:36:10,816
RIKIMARU: I think...

2898
02:36:13,856 --> 02:36:16,456
RIKIMARU: Just like,
for this movement, you

2899
02:36:16,496 --> 02:36:18,096
RIKIMARU: just use your hands.

2900
02:36:18,136 --> 02:36:20,296
RIKIMARU: When you guys dance,

2901
02:36:20,336 --> 02:36:24,136
RIKIMARU: you guys are just
using your hands or something.

2902
02:36:24,176 --> 02:36:26,696
RIKIMARU: So, we need to
use our bodies, too.

2903
02:36:27,176 --> 02:36:30,456
RIKIMARU: Can we start
from the hook part?

2904
02:36:30,456 --> 02:36:32,296
RIKIMARU: Five, six, seven, eight.

2905
02:36:32,336 --> 02:36:33,376
RIKIMARU: One, two.

2906
02:36:33,416 --> 02:36:34,536
RIKIMARU: At this moment,

2907
02:36:34,576 --> 02:36:36,496
RIKIMARU: you have to use the body.

2908
02:36:36,536 --> 02:36:37,856
RIKIMARU: you have to use the body.

2909
02:36:38,176 --> 02:36:40,056
RIKIMARU: You guys just use hands, so...

2910
02:36:40,536 --> 02:36:43,816
RIKIMARU: Also use hand. Ah, use arm...
No. Use your body, too.

2911
02:36:44,016 --> 02:36:46,176
RIKIMARU: Five, six, seven, go.

2912
02:36:46,216 --> 02:36:48,976
RIKIMARU: One, two, three, four.

2913
02:36:49,016 --> 02:36:50,296
RIKIMARU: Now, more. Do again.

2914
02:36:50,896 --> 02:36:52,336
(Focused)
RIKIMARU: Also like, when you...

2915
02:36:52,336 --> 02:36:52,976
RIKIMARU: When you guys are dancing,

2916
02:36:53,096 --> 02:36:56,176
RIKIMARU: it seems like... Always like,
your hands are too strained.

2917
02:36:56,176 --> 02:36:58,856
RIKIMARU: So, you should get them relax.

2918
02:36:59,576 --> 02:37:05,456
RIKIMARU: Because some had
already taken dance lessons before.

2919
02:37:05,456 --> 02:37:08,096
RIKIMARU: But some started to learn it
after joining the program. Therefore,

2920
02:37:08,096 --> 02:37:10,016
RIKIMARU: their levels are varied.

2921
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:12,176
RIKIMARU: They need to practice harder.

2922
02:37:12,176 --> 02:37:14,536
RIKIMARU: Suddenly, I felt nervous.

2923
02:37:14,656 --> 02:37:17,376
RIKIMARU: Let's divide
into three groups.

2924
02:37:27,816 --> 02:37:31,336
RIKIMARU: So, this movement.
Like which area. Like which beat.

2925
02:37:31,336 --> 02:37:32,896
(Skill Training)

2926
02:37:32,896 --> 02:37:36,136
RIKIMARU: It seems like
you don't know, like, which beat.

2927
02:37:38,216 --> 02:37:41,136
RIKIMARU: Just listen to
the beat more carefully, okay?

2928
02:37:41,136 --> 02:37:42,696
RIKIMARU: So, group two.

2929
02:37:51,536 --> 02:37:55,896
RIKIMARU: When you dance faster, it's easier.
But when you dance slow, it's more difficult.

2930
02:37:55,896 --> 02:38:02,496
RIKIMARU: When you dance, you are too strained. When
you're relaxed, your dancing will be bigger and more powerful.

2931
02:38:02,696 --> 02:38:03,416
RIKIMARU: Group three.

2932
02:38:09,576 --> 02:38:15,816
RIKIMARU: Next time, when you are dancing,
look at each other. And watch the timing.

2933
02:38:16,256 --> 02:38:18,856
RIKIMARU: Okay, together.
Can we dance together?

2934
02:38:19,096 --> 02:38:20,336
RIKIMARU: Okay, let's go.

2935
02:38:27,776 --> 02:38:31,256
RIKIMARU: After about 30 minutes,
they were more relaxed.

2936
02:38:31,416 --> 02:38:35,216
RIKIMARU: But like... When you guys
dance my choreography,

2937
02:38:35,216 --> 02:38:37,856
RIKIMARU: you guys always look like AI.

2938
02:38:38,216 --> 02:38:38,976
RIKIMARU: Like...

2939
02:38:40,256 --> 02:38:41,416
RIKIMARU: Like this.

2940
02:38:41,576 --> 02:38:43,456
RIKIMARU: You just showed me...

2941
02:38:43,496 --> 02:38:45,416
RIKIMARU: Showed us that feeling

2942
02:38:45,456 --> 02:38:46,936
RIKIMARU: and power.

2943
02:38:46,976 --> 02:38:49,856
RIKIMARU: Also, I feel...
When I practice it by myself...

2944
02:38:50,296 --> 02:38:53,056
RIKIMARU: When I practice
in front of the mirror,

2945
02:38:53,096 --> 02:38:54,856
RIKIMARU: alone, with no one watching.

2946
02:38:54,896 --> 02:38:57,456
RIKIMARU: Like, nobody
is watching me dance. Like, practicing.

2947
02:38:57,936 --> 02:39:00,216
RIKIMARU: Sometimes
I feel like, oh, I'm cool.

2948
02:39:00,336 --> 02:39:02,536
RIKIMARU: So when you perform
in front of people,

2949
02:39:02,576 --> 02:39:04,376
RIKIMARU: you guys kind of like this.

2950
02:39:04,616 --> 02:39:07,696
RIKIMARU: So when you are alone,

2951
02:39:07,976 --> 02:39:10,016
RIKIMARU: you can dance like this.

2952
02:39:10,256 --> 02:39:11,896
RIKIMARU: Just like
when you record a TikTok,

2953
02:39:12,296 --> 02:39:14,256
RIKIMARU: like, it's just me.
I'm having fun.

2954

the feeling of having fun.

2970
02:39:57,656 --> 02:40:00,136
RIKIMARU: Dance battle.
Like, who is cooler?

2971
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:01,176

RIKIMARU: So this music...

2977
02:40:50,136 --> 02:40:52,296

RIKIMARU: So this lyrics say that I'm the best.

2978
02:40:52,296 --> 02:40:54,696
RIKIMARU: So when you perform this,

2979
02:40:54,696 --> 02:40:58,056
RIKIMARU: you can perform like this.
This expression is better.

2980

02:41:08,216 --> 02:41:11,616
RIKIMARU: That kind of expression
and power. It's okay.

2985
02:41:11,616 --> 02:41:12,696
RIKIMARU: Anyone else?

2986
02:41:12,976 --> 02:41:14,256

RIKIMARU: You don't. Don't be nervous.

2992
02:42:04,776 --> 02:42:05,856
RIKIMARU: When you guys perform,

2993
02:42:05,896 --> 02:42:08,096
RIKIMARU: don't care about
what other people think.

2994
02:42:08,136 --> 02:42:10,096
RIKIMARU: Maybe, some audience

2995
02:42:10,096 --> 02:42:12,656
RIKIMARU: maybe like, they don't like
your performance sometimes.

2996
02:42:12,656 --> 02:42:14,096
RIKIMARU: But don't think about it.

2997
02:42:14,496 --> 02:42:16,456
RIKIMARU: Just having fun.

2998
02:42:17,056 --> 02:42:19,776
OMAR: After taking RIKIMARU's class,

2999
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:20,976

RIKIMARU: Okay. I just noticed...

3002
02:42:25,096 --> 02:42:28,056
RIKIMARU: I just noticed
when you guys perform,

3003
02:42:28,296 --> 02:42:30,856
RIKIMARU: you guys only
focus on the front.

3004
02:42:30,896 --> 02:42:33,136
RIKIMARU: But I want you guys
to focus on the back too.

3005
02:42:33,936 --> 02:42:36,896
RIKIMARU: When you guys are
watching other people dancing,

3006
02:42:36,936 --> 02:42:39,696
RIKIMARU: from the back,
you should also look good.

3007
02:42:39,736 --> 02:42:41,016
RIKIMARU: It's better.

3008
02:42:41,056 --> 02:42:42,576

TIAN QI: I have a question.

3025
02:44:24,176 --> 02:44:28,536
TIAN QI: Our group's dance move
is a bit of sexy.

3026
02:44:28,536 --> 02:44:33,096
- RIKIMARU: A bit of sexy.
- TIAN QI: They say I don't do leg-touching things.

3027
02:44:33,256 --> 02:44:35,136
RIKIMARU: Can you try dancing it for me?

3028
02:44:59,416 --> 02:45:00,616
RIKIMARU: Okay.

3029
02:45:02,936 --> 02:45:04,936
RIKIMARU: Okay, so, first of all...

3030
02:45:05,456 --> 02:45:11,856
RIKIMARU: The feeling is quite sexy.

3031
02:45:11,856 --> 02:45:16,056
RIKIMARU: But when you always like...
When you do this, you always do like this...

3032
02:45:16,056 --> 02:45:19,456
RIKIMARU: It looks like you're
casting a spell, like Harry Potter.

3033
02:45:21,816 --> 02:45:25,216
RIKIMARU: Can you give it a feeling
like the... The one part. You wanna...

3034
02:45:26,736 --> 02:45:27,536
(He can do it right away)
RIKIMARU: One. Seven.

3035
02:45:34,696 --> 02:45:37,176
RIKIMARU: Make it seem like
this part feels coquettish.

3036
02:45:40,096 --> 02:45:42,256
TIAN QI: I think RIKIMARU
is really amazing.

3037
02:45:42,256 --> 02:45:43,816
TIAN QI: Not just about his dance.

3038
02:45:43,816 --> 02:45:45,776
TIAN QI: What I asked him
at that time about

3039
02:45:45,776 --> 02:45:46,976
TIAN QI: other dance.

3040
02:45:46,976 --> 02:45:47,936
TIAN QI: He just saw it once

3041
02:45:47,936 --> 02:45:49,696
TIAN QI: and could tell me
where the problem was

3042
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:51,816
TIAN QI: and how to look sexier.

3043
02:45:51,816 --> 02:45:53,176
TIAN QI: He just needs to see it once.

3044
02:45:53,176 --> 02:45:55,256
TIAN QI: He is really great.

3045
02:45:55,896 --> 02:45:56,896
RIKIMARU: There is
one more important thing.

3046
02:45:56,896 --> 02:45:58,896
RIKIMARU: Your eye contact.

3047
02:45:59,496 --> 02:46:00,976
RIKIMARU: Making eye contact
is important.

3048
02:46:00,976 --> 02:46:02,976
RIKIMARU: Just now, your sights

3049
02:46:02,976 --> 02:46:04,976

just like this.

3050

RIKIMARU: Okay.

3051
02:46:06,896 --> 02:46:08,616
RIKIMARU: Ah! WHEN WE DISCO.

3052
02:46:30,736 --> 02:46:38,096
RIKIMARU: This song is DISCO.
DISCO feels like old school.

3053
02:46:38,816 --> 02:46:42,216
RIKIMARU: But now, what I want to see is

3054
02:46:42,216 --> 02:46:44,256
RIKIMARU: a bit of a retro feel.

3055
02:46:44,256 --> 02:46:47,256
RIKIMARU: When you dance,
that retro touch and the coolness. Okay.

3056
02:46:47,456 --> 02:46:47,816
RIKIMARU: Okay.

3057

RIKIMARU: Like atmosphere...

3066
02:47:14,976 --> 02:47:16,696

RIKIMARU: These two are great.

3071
02:47:23,816 --> 02:47:25,656
RIKIMARU: Attitude to these.

3072
02:47:26,256 --> 02:47:28,616
RIKIMARU: Matching with the music.

3073
02:47:29,456 --> 02:47:30,896
RIKIMARU: Come on, you guys.

3074
02:47:33,216 --> 02:47:36,096
RIKIMARU: When you guys debut,

3075
02:47:36,096 --> 02:47:40,976
RIKIMARU: so, people will see you guys
as professional, even though you are not ready.

3076
02:47:40,976 --> 02:47:44,496
RIKIMARU: So, this time
is very... Like a precious time.

3077
02:47:44,496 --> 02:47:46,576
RIKIMARU: Like an important time.

3078
02:47:46,576 --> 02:47:51,656
RIKIMARU: So more practice, like...
Even if there's no recording, shooting.

3079
02:47:51,656 --> 02:47:53,376
RIKIMARU: You guys practice by yourself.

3080
02:47:53,496 --> 02:47:55,976
RIKIMARU: Behind the scenes,
when no one sees,

3081
02:47:56,016 --> 02:47:57,856
RIKIMARU: you must
practice by yourself. So...

3082
02:47:58,336 --> 02:48:01,016
RIKIMARU: I stay like this...
in my room...

3083
02:48:01,056 --> 02:48:03,976
RIKIMARU: practicing by myself
every time I'm back.

3084
02:48:04,016 --> 02:48:04,816
RIKIMARU: To be honest,

3085
02:48:04,856 --> 02:48:08,336
RIKIMARU: I am used to practicing
behind the scenes.

3086
02:48:08,576 --> 02:48:09,976
RIKIMARU: After like, you are on TV.

3087
02:48:10,216 --> 02:48:12,816
RIKIMARU: After like, you are on TV.

3088
02:48:12,816 --> 02:48:14,056
RIKIMARU: If you make a mistake,

3089
02:48:14,056 --> 02:48:15,896
RIKIMARU: it will stay forever
on the internet.

3090
02:48:18,296 --> 02:48:19,296
RIKIMARU: So...

3091
02:48:19,856 --> 02:48:21,016
RIKIMARU: Do your best.

3092

3093
02:48:27,736 --> 02:48:30,656

where we stay.

to the canteen where we usually eat,
