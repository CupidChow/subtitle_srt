XIONG: I thought...

79
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
XIONG: the song I chose
might not suit them,

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,920
XIONG: or they might not like
this genre.

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,880

82
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,880

just to learn to sing.

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,760

mainly to challenge yourself in dancing.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520

WUXUN: Just a blink of an eye,

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
WUXUN: I felt confused
like everything's tangled up,

106
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
(The Day of Team Formation)
WUXUN: because I promised YUCHEN

107
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800

on the same team with him.

108

XIONG: Need to step like this.

166
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:00,794
(STEP)

167
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:01,834
(That's Why)

168
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:04,434
(STEP)

169
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:04,914
(STEP)
(TURN)

170
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:09,754
(Already Crazy)

171
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:10,794
WUXUN: Sometimes...

172
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,914
WUXUN: the only thing I worry about is
I'll be the team's burden,

173
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,674
WUXUN: because I feel
I might not dance well enough.

174
00:08:14,714 --> 00:08:16,314
XIONG: Uh... how should I put this.

175
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:19,354
XIONG: Since he believes in me,
I have to make it happen.

176
00:08:20,114 --> 00:08:21,794
XIONG: Just learned it for one day,

177
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:24,514
XIONG: he showed me that he

178
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:26,194
XIONG: is intimate with his own body,

179
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:27,794
XIONG: is a talented person.

180
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:28,794
XIONG: He can dance.

181
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:32,154
XIONG: He just needs more time
and a bit more effort.

182
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:32,834
XIONG: Hmm...

183
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,154
XIONG: He can't remember anymore...

184
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,514
- XIONG: You can do it.
- WUXUN: I'll practice more.

185
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,514
- WUXUN: Practice more.
- XIONG: You can do it.

186
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:39,554
WUXUN: Practice more.

187
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,514
XIONG: Actually, he needs to
practice more.

188
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:43,354
XIONG: It will improve dancing.

189
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,034
(GET)

190
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,234
SHEN: Do this a bit more.

191
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:47,474
SHEN: Yes, yes, yes.

192
00:08:47,474 --> 00:08:48,314
XIONG: Then, let the body undulate.

193
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:49,994
SHEN: Yes, exactly like that.

194
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,594
XIONG: In dancing,
there are many such moves.

195
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:53,674
XIONG: Just need to...

196
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:56,114
WUXUN: Keep doing it like this.

197
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,714
SHEN: Yes, let's practice.

198
00:08:57,874 --> 00:08:59,914
(TOGETHER)

199
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,714
(Snake Year, Let's Be "Snakes")
WUXUN: It's focusing on back muscles.

200
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:04,914
WUXUN: I practiced this move all night.

201
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,274
WUXUN: Keep practicing continuously

202
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:09,034
WUXUN: like a little fish swimming there.

203
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:13,194
WUXUN: XIONG is attentive
and highly responsible.

204
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,634
WUXUN: As soon as I said
I wanted to practice,

205
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:15,554
WUXUN: he asked me to practice together,

206
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:16,634
WUXUN: no matter how late it was.

207
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:18,954
WUXUN: I remember once we

208
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,314
WUXUN: went to the rooftop

209
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,674
WUXUN: because there were
no practice rooms left.

210
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:25,594
WUXUN: I wanted to practice,

211
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,234
WUXUN: so he took me to the rooftop,

212
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,234
WUXUN: taught me step by step.

213
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,634
WUXUN: Even if the moves seem simple,

214
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,314
WUXUN: there are countless tiny details,

215
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:34,314
WUXUN: like hand placement,

216
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:35,914
WUXUN: making claw-like hand shapes.

217
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:38,714
WUXUN: He said
because this is the monster's move,

218
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,514
WUXUN: you must exert force
through the fingers.

219
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:43,074
WUXUN: Before this,
I didn't understand dancing at all.

220
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:44,474
WUXUN: These didn't even
look like dance moves,

221
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,474
WUXUN: including training
physical strength too.

222
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:47,874
WUXUN: So, I still have much to practice.

223
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,674
WUXUN: Even before bedtime...

224
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,474
STAFF: Do you know
why XIONG makes you practice?

225
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,554
STAFF: I asked him
during the interview earlier.

226
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:53,474
WUXUN: Really?

227
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,474
WUXUN: What did he say?

228
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,634
(Q: Why should WUXUN
need to practice basic skills?)

229
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:57,634
(Q: Why should WUXUN need to practice basic skills?)
XIONG: In my opinion...

230
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:01,434
XIONG: My opinion is, if WUXUN

231
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:04,954
XIONG: practices the same moves
repeatedly, he'll master them.

232
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:06,794
XIONG: But if he practices other moves,

233
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:10,114
XIONG: he'll have to start over.

234
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:13,834
XIONG: So, I want him
to practice basics extensively

235
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,954
XIONG: so that he can progress
to subsequent moves.

236
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,234
XIONG: I mean he will memorize
choreography faster,

237
00:10:18,234 --> 00:10:21,514
XIONG: or instantly grasp
weight distribution techniques.

238
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,514
XIONG: It's not that barely
mastering one move,

239
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:25,874
XIONG: then moving to the next,

240
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:28,434
XIONG: and repeating the cycle.

241
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:36,114
WUXUN: Honestly, I'm deeply touched.

242
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,034
WUXUN: I've got goosebumps a bit.

243
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,514
WUXUN: If I join you, will you teach me?

244
00:10:40,554 --> 00:10:42,314
XIONG: I'll teach you to dance myself.

245
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:47,114
WUXUN: But actually

246
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,394
WUXUN: XIONG has been working
really hard

247
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,274
WUXUN: to keep the promise
we made together,

248
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,434
WUXUN: and make it happen.

249
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:59,034
(BELIEF)

250
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,274
WUXUN: Could you add
a caption here for me?

251
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:05,194
WUXUN: WUXUN's mentor
is none other than XIONG.

252
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:07,274
WUXUN: Words of praise.

253
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,234
WUXUN: My highly respected mentor,
wait no, not 'respected'.

254
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:13,354
WUXUN: Well, there are no
other words to use.

255
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,794
SHEN: I believe
our team leader is pretty good.

256
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:16,634
(Pretty Good!)

257
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,354
(Quite a lot)
SHEN: There are many details.

258
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:20,034
(Quite Strict)
SHEN: Yes, but it's quite strict.

259
00:11:20,154 --> 00:11:21,074
XIONG: Who's dancing slow.

260
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:22,434
XIONG: Let's do it again.

261
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:24,434
XIONG: Five, six, seven, eight.

262
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:25,034
XIONG: Stop.

263
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,114
XIONG: Center position.

264
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:28,914
(Position Point)

265
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:29,634
XIONG: Okay?

266
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:30,514
XIONG: One more.

267
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,674
WUXUN: When taking class with XIONG,

268
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:38,034
WUXUN: he leads our practice
till the end.

269
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,314
(XIONG is online)

270
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:42,514
WUXUN: XIONG keeps checking
our dance moves.

271
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:44,354
XIONG: Wrong side!

272
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,674
(Incorrect Head Movement)
SHEN: GUANMING? Is it GUANMING?

273
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:48,034
WUXUN: GUANMING, what are you doing?

274
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:50,634
(Encounter with a Group Attack)

275
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:54,194
XIONG: Do it like this.

276
00:11:54,194 --> 00:11:55,354
XIONG: Like this.

277
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:57,874
GUANMING: It's not the monkey jump move.

278
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:01,274
WUXUN: When teaching,
he looks super serious

279
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,194
WUXUN: unlike his usual self.

280
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:04,114
WUXUN: In daily life, he's like...

281
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,674
WUXUN: slow like a little sloth.

282
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:13,074
EARTH: He's genuinely gentle.

283
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,594
EARTH: Talking to him makes me
slightly sleepy.

284
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,594
EARTH: But, I feel that

285
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,554
EARTH: it's his character.

286
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:21,554
XIONG: Come on, take your positions.

287
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:27,954
(GET?)

288
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:37,434
(GET?)
SENA: Mhm!

289
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:38,034
XIONG: Okay.

290
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:38,794
XIONG: Good.

291
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,234
WUXUN: How do you understand him?

292
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,994
- WUXUN: How do you get what he means?
- XIONG: Use intuition.

293
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:45,434
WUXUN: He hasn't even opened his mouth.

294
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:47,634
WUXUN: Oh, okay.

295
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,354
SENA: Our team

296
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,394
SENA: has a rather bright style.

297
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:54,074
SENA: I'm very happy
and quite surprised too.

298
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,234
SENA: We're gradually getting closer.

299
00:12:56,634 --> 00:13:00,434
SENA: I think we're doing great.

300
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:02,474
WUXUN: Yeah.

301
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:03,154
SENA: Okay.

302
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:05,074
- WUXUN: Let's go, bro. Yes!
- SENA: Ready to go.

303
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,514
- WUXUN: You're ready?
- SENA: Okay.

304
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,554
WUXUN: Okay, okay. He's a bit shy.

305
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:14,034
- WUXUN: Startling others.
- XIONG: Startling people completely.

306
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:14,754
WUXUN: I'm sorry.

307
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,394
SENA: It's like my team

308
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,234
SENA: has many introverts.

309
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,514
SENA: If I were to say,

310
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,474
SENA: their singing voices
tend to be soft.

311
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,154
WUXUN: So small.

312
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,474
(Right on Point)

313
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:27,954
(MORE POWERFUL)
WUXUN: More powerful.

314
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,674
(LESS TECHNIQUE)
SENA: Yeah.

315
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:43,314
SENA: Because he sings
better than dances,

316
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:45,314
SENA: he can project his voice

317
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:47,234
SENA: at a louder volume.

318
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:50,154
SENA: When I sang,
he taught me wholeheartedly.

319
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:55,794
WUXUN: Okay.

320
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:57,994
WUXUN: The voice...

321
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,914
- EARTH: Should be like...
- WUXUN: Yes, yes.

322
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:05,154
EARTH: WUXUN gives technical advice.
His approach is like

323
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,114
EARTH: more about voice projection,

324
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,034
EARTH: like someone screaming.

325
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:12,994
EARTH: I feel that
it's an interesting new technique.

326
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,034
XIONG: Okay, SHEN you enter here.

327
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,874
(My turn?)
WUXUN: Any dance moves here?

328
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,474
- XIONG: When he...
- SHEN: None.

329
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,074
- SHEN: After the verse ends like this.
- XIONG: Once he finishes singing, it's done.

330
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:20,514
XIONG: Right.

331
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:22,354
WUXUN: I think most verses

332
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:26,274
WUXUN: assigned to me up to here
seem slightly more than others.

333
00:14:26,354 --> 00:14:27,754
WUXUN: I don't want it this way.

334
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:30,074
WUXUN: Actually,
our team's verse distribution

335
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,154
WUXUN: is fairly

336
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:34,354
WUXUN: equal. Peace.

337
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,794
WUXUN: Actually, I'm slightly concerned.

338
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:40,234
WUXUN: I feel SHEN
got too few singing parts.

339
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:41,754
WUXUN: Oh, this is yours.

340
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,914
XIONG: Yes, this is it.

341
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:43,834
SHEN: Then, he'll get even fewer parts.

342
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:46,514
WUXUN: No, I'm not complaining.
I already had previous parts.

343
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,274
XIONG: As long as he agrees.

344
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:48,794
WUXUN: I agree.

345
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:49,114

XIONG: You follow that.

348
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:50,474
SHEN: Hmm.

349
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,514
(Humbly Accept)
XIONG: Okay.

350
00:14:51,554 --> 00:14:53,834
XIONG: SHEN is like a younger brother.

351
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:57,154
XIONG: How to say it?
He's still a tender-aged youth.

352
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,834
XIONG: Five, six, seven, eight.

353
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,714
(Don't do that!)

354
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:05,474
XIONG: You can't cover
your eyes like this.

355
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,074
SHEN: What should I do?

356
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,274
XIONG: Let me do it.

357
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:09,914
XIONG: Come here.

358
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:15,554
XIONG: Then, he had this cute moment.

359
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,714
(PEEPING)

360
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:18,674
SHEN: I got totally startled.

361
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:22,274
SHEN: I was assessing
the opponent's strength.

362
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:23,594
(Know Your Opponents)

363
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:25,914
XIONG: Tell me how you felt
after seeing it.

364
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:27,394
SHEN: I think
they're completely unreliable.

365
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:28,954
(Dares to ask, Dares to answer)

366
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,554

SHEN: Actually, XIONG just wants to win.

367
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,394
SHEN: So, I thought of using
beautiful dance elements

368
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,074
SHEN: to score more points,

369
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,434
SHEN: like the opening
dance move where...

370
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:40,674
SHEN: Initially, we agreed
to hold this position.

371
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:42,874
SHEN: Now it requires spinning too.

372
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,754
SHEN: And there's the sound
of pulling iron chains.

373
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,834
SHEN: Then, grab XIONG's hand up,

374
00:15:47,874 --> 00:15:48,834
SHEN: make some movements.

375
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:51,394
WUXUN: SHEN is very interesting,

376
00:15:51,594 --> 00:15:52,874
WUXUN: and he often comes up with

377
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:53,994
WUXUN: new ideas

378
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,794
(Dance Training)
WUXUN: that suddenly emerge.

379
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,714
WUXUN: And those are
usually amazing ideas.

380
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:58,794
XIONG: Okay.

381
00:15:58,794 --> 00:15:59,794
(Dance Training)
XIONG: Perfect.

382
00:16:02,634 --> 00:16:05,034

00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:16,674
BAMBAM: How do you feel after watching
these two shows?

499
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:18,368
YAYA: The Attention team.

500
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,760
YAYA: You guys were such a good team.

501
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,330
YAYA: There was so much charisma
on that stage.

502
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,770
YAYA: So, good job.

503
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,810
YAYA: You guys were really cute!

504
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,368
YAYA: MYST, you're so cute!

505
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,088
BAMBAM: Alright, thank you.

506
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,410
BAMBAM: XU MINGHAO (THE 8),
what do you think?

507
00:25:38,874 --> 00:25:42,154
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I might speak
a bit long, okay?

508
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:45,874
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): First of all,
I feel that the Still Monster team

509
00:25:47,274 --> 00:25:50,794
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): should have chosen
a better song than this, and also...

510
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:55,314
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): To be honest,
earlier when I watched you all,

511
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:58,194
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I was very impressed
by XIONG and WUXUN.

512
00:25:58,194 --> 00:26:00,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): And I know that
you all have great talents.

513
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:04,074
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But,
today's performance made me feel that

514
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:09,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): your singing
and dancing have weakened.

515
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:15,234
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): The only one
that impressed me was

516
00:26:15,354 --> 00:26:17,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): SHEN. I feel that

517
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,674
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): in this song,

518
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:24,034
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): what you expressed
was spot-on, very fitting for this song.

519
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:27,434
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But, I can feel that
you all gave your utmost effort.

520
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,474
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Thank you
for this performance.

521
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,554
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): As for Attention,

522
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:36,154
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I don't sense
the teamwork that it should have.

523
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,808
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's like everyone
has their own strengths,

524
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:44,672
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): but if we combine
everyone's strengths,

525
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:49,408
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I feel like
you're not a unified team.

526
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,674
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): If you genuinely
intend to unite as a team,

527
00:26:52,832 --> 00:26:58,674
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you need to think more
thoroughly and enhance your teamwork.

528
00:26:58,994 --> 00:26:59,994
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Keep going.

529
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,274
BAMBAM: And now
the results have arrived.

530
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:10,528
BAMBAM: The MVP of Attention team is...

531
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:13,952
BAMBAM: NINJA.

532
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:16,858
(SUPERB!!)

533
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:19,698
PLENGTHAI: NINJA.

534
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:22,418
PLENGTHAI: NINJA.

535
00:27:27,418 --> 00:27:28,458
BAMBAM: You deserve it.

536
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:32,418
NINJA: Honestly, I never imagined this.

537
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:36,698
NINJA: I didn't expect it at all,
like I said it could have been anyone.

538
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:40,418
NINJA: Today, everything has truly
exceeded my imagination.

539
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:44,138
BAMBAM: You really deserve this.

540
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:45,738
NINJA: Thank you.

541
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:47,578
BAMBAM: You catch my attention the most.

542
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,738
BAMBAM: Sorry, I'm biased, HU YETAO.

543
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:53,938
BAMBAM: But from that show,
I looked at you the most, bro.

544
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,498
BAMBAM: So...

545
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:56,818
BAMBAM: Do you have anything to say?

546
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:01,858
AUDIENCE: Well done. Well done.

547
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:02,578
(So proud of you)

548
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,738
NINJA: MVP shouldn't belong
to just me alone.

549
00:28:05,138 --> 00:28:06,698
NINJA: Teamwork is extremely important.

550
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,480
NINJA: Thank you very much.

551
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,290
BAMBAM: Awesome.

552
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,704
BAMBAM: So, the MVP
of Still Monster is...

553
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,490
BAMBAM: SHEN, congratulations.

554
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,450
SHEN: Let me say something, actually,

555
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,250
SHEN: because truthfully,
I'm a very lazy person.

556
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,730
- TIA RAY: This kid...
- SHEN: It's nothing, I just want to rest.

557
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,690
SHEN: Actually, XIONG is the team leader
who united us all.

558
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,130
SHEN: Moreover, WUXUN has no dance
background at all.

559
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,410
SHEN: XIONG scheduled for us,
with daily self-practice hours.

560
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,410
SHEN: He also led our practices.
We've rehearsed countless times.

561
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,330
SHEN: To me, the most crucial aspect
of being a team is camaraderie.

562
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:09,170
SHEN: It's great. I want this MVP
to belong to all of us.

563
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:13,690
BAMBAM: That's a really good one.
Good job.

564
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,010
XIONG: Back then, I just didn't want...

565
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,090
XIONG: Honestly, I didn't want him
to say things like that.

566
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,290
XIONG: I feel that he thinks
he got MVP because of me.

567
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,290
XIONG: I'm genuinely happy for him.
No need for such remarks.

568
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,850
XIONG: So at that time, I...

569
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,450
XIONG: gave him a pat on the back.

570
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,330
XIONG: But he still...

571
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,810
XIONG: "I wanted to say."

572
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,130
XIONG: Just like that.

573
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,010
XIONG: It really moved me deeply

574
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,210
XIONG: that SHEN expressed
such feelings.

575
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,170
BAMBAM: And now let me announce
the winner of the round three.

576
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,570
BAMBAM: Still Monster and Attention.

577
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,050
BAMBAM: The winner...

578
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,290
BAMBAM: The winner...

579
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,410
BAMBAM: The winner...

580
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,010
BAMBAM: After the commercial!

581
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,450
BIANURA: YenYen.

582
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,210
BAMBAM: You're ready?

583
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,170
BAMBAM: The winner...

584
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,290
BAMBAM: Congratulations, Attention!

585
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,090
GOU YI: That's it!

586
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,650
GOU YI: Yes!

587
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,490
WHYLUCAS: Yeah, bro! We won, man!

588
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,290
WHYLUCAS: I'm so happy to say this.

589
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,170
WHYLUCAS: Like, this is like
the best of all.

590
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,130
WHYLUCAS: I danced so hard that
I accidentally did weird moves.

591
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,010
WHYLUCAS: And I felt so happy. Yeah!

592
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,730
NINJA: Thank you very, very much.

593
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,330
SHEN: I feel that our performance
was really good,

594
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,530
SHEN: but still not as good as
it should be.

595
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,210
SHEN: But, I think throughout rehearsals
until now, we've been very happy.

596
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,610
SHEN: I think it's good enough.

597
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,090
BAMBAM: Bye bye, HU YETAO.

598
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,130
NINJA: Thank you so much.
MVP doesn't matter to me.

599
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,610
NINJA: You guys, thank you.
We won today.

600
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,170
SHEN: I also hoped we'd win.

601
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,450
SHEN: But I feel we've gained a lot.

602
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,330
SHEN: We exercised daily.

603
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,650
SHEN: We were happy every day.

604
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,570
SHEN: I think we've achieved our goal.

605
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,490
- WUXUN: Yes.
- SHEN: I think it was worth it.

606
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,970
SHEN: Right? Being happy is enough.

607
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,690
SHEN: I think in our team,
XIONG always helps teammates

608
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,970
SHEN: to improve our performances.

609
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,170
SHEN: Actually, I think we did our best.

610
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,810
SHEN: The MVP belongs to everyone.

611
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,250
TRAINEES: Three, two, one.

612
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,050
TRAINEES: STEAL YOUR HEART!
STILL MONSTER!

613
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,850
BAMBAM: Please welcome Under The Moon Road
and Super to the stage.

614
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,120
TRAINEES: Wow.

615
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:33,418
BIANURA: SHOYA's face.

616
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:44,954
WUXUN: Black and white.

617
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:46,754
GUANMING: One team gives off
the vibe of a deity cult, while

618
00:32:46,754 --> 00:32:48,394
- GUANMING: the other a demon cult.
- SHEN: TAMU.

619
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:50,434
BAMBAM: Introduce your team, please.

620
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:52,034
DORN: One, two, three.

621
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:54,114
- DORN: We are Super Team.
- TRAINEES: We are Super Team.

622
00:32:54,874 --> 00:32:56,514
DORN: Feels like I turned
into SUN WUKONG.

623
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:01,034
TRAINEES: SUN WUKONG.

624
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:03,154
(FIGHTING!)

625
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:05,794
SHOYA: Hello everyone, we are

626
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,554
TRAINEES: The Moon.

627
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:12,594
PLENGTHAI: I want to say something
to Super team.

628
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:15,594
PLENGTHAI: Dear friend,

629
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:18,274
PLENGTHAI: you're just SUN WUKONG.

630
00:33:18,994 --> 00:33:21,754
PLENGTHAI: Do you know
what this thing can do?

631
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:24,754
PLENGTHAI: One, two, three.

632
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:28,034
SHOYA: I'll break you into pieces.

633
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:36,274
DORN: Considering the outfits, we may
represent fire; you represent water.

634
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,794
DORN: But I wonder who will be hotter.

635
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:45,074
PLENGTHAI: Water puts out fires, buddy.

636
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,074
BAMBAM: You know what, this time

637
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:52,034
BAMBAM: let's not have them
say some before.

638
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,794
BAMBAM: We are mentors.
We're good enough.

639
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:55,274
BAMBAM: We trust our guts,

640
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:58,554
BAMBAM: you know, take a guess right away
from this out of what they have right now.

641
00:33:58,554 --> 00:34:03,474
YAYA: Oh..., man.
It's really, very hard.

642
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,074
YAYA: It's too hard.

643
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:09,794
YAYA: Can they just decide
by rock-paper-scissors?

644
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:12,394
BAMBAM: Oh, let's do that then.

645
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,434
BAMBAM: I like it.

646
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,394
BAMBAM: Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

647
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:17,274
BAMBAM: And who loses, goes first.

648
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,594
BAMBAM: How about that?

649
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:20,514
BAMBAM: SHOYA, the leader?

650
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,954
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

651
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,514
BAMBAM: Only one time.

652
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,754
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

653
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:40,554
HU YETAO: You see it?

654
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,554
- BAMBAM: You know what.
- KOHI: Oh, my God, SHOYA. You can do it.

655
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,594
BAMBAM: Turn back, turn back,
turn back. You, turn back.

656
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:50,754
BAMBAM: When I say one, two, three,
do this, okay?

657
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:55,914
BAMBAM: One, two, three.

658
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:00,434
(We won!!)

00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:10,944
TIA RAY: I love them all.

663
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:13,504
TIA RAY: But I'll go for
UNDER THE MOON ROAD this time.

664
00:35:16,224 --> 00:35:19,424
BAMBAM: XU MINGHAO (THE 8),
Who do you think...

665
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,688
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I need to support
my own song, the latter one.

666
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:24,576
YAYA: What about you guys?

667

673

674
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,538
KOHI: And we have six characters.

675
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:49,778

YAO ZIHAO: Fighting!

692
00:36:40,218 --> 00:36:41,218
HIKARU: Let's go, SHOYA!

693
00:36:41,338 --> 00:36:42,458
(Fighting!)
DONGDONG: SHOYA!

694
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:50,186
SHOYA: I've sung songs
in both English and Japanese before,

695
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:55,346
SHOYA: so I want to try singing
in Thai, Chinese, or Korean.

696
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:57,106
(SHOYA Chooses a song)

697
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:58,626
SHOYA: With fewer options left,

698
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:03,506
SHOYA: I decided to choose this song.

699
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,226
(SHOYA Chose Under The Moon Road)
SHOYA: Naturally, both the song concept

700
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:11,586
SHOYA: and each dance move
felt right for me.

701
00:37:12,266 --> 00:37:13,746
PLENGTHAI: Why did I choose this song?

702
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:15,346
PLENGTHAI: Honestly,
I wanted to choose Super,

703
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,626
PLENGTHAI: I'm usually with SUPER THAI.

704
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:18,666
PLENGTHAI: We're inseparable.
Basically, we're together all the time.

705
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,946
PLENGTHAI: This round is
a big self-challenge.

706
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:27,786
(DORN: Super)
(PLENGTHAI: Under The Moon Road)

707
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:29,666
(Friend = My Dear Enemy)
PLENGTHAI: DORN is my closest friend.

708
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:35,026
PLENGTHAI: It's tough having to compete
against my best friend.

709
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,586
(Do your best, my friend)

710
00:37:38,346 --> 00:37:40,866
WANXIN: When I first heard this song,

711
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:43,986
WANXIN: originally, we all
came to this show

712
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:46,826
(WANXIN Go to Under The Moon Road)
WANXIN: to showcase our talents.

713
00:37:46,826 --> 00:37:48,866
WANXIN: I declare this is my song.

714
00:37:48,946 --> 00:37:54,026
(KOHI Go to Under The Moon Road)
KOHI: For GRAND AUDITION, I did Youngblood.

715
00:37:54,026 --> 00:38:00,906
KOHI: For this stage, I chose this song
to show my sexier side.

716
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:03,826
(GOU YI Go to Under The Moon Road)
GOU YI: I love this song's mood and tone.

717
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:05,346
GOU YI: I chose SHOYA
right after I saw him.

718
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:09,026
GOU YI: I knew that teaming up with him,
1+1 will be better.

719
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:09,586
TZI XUAN: The same.

720
00:38:09,706 --> 00:38:11,746
(Same reason as everyone else)

721
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:12,906
(FIRST PRACTICE DAY)

722
00:38:12,906 --> 00:38:16,026
PLENGTHAI: I joined a group of six
who are from five different countries

723
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:17,546
PLENGTHAI: and I was the only Thai.

724
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,026
(Be not in one's right mind)
PLENGTHAI: I was stressed from the start.

725
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,706
(Be not in one's right mind)
PLENGTHAI: Did I make the right choice?

726
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:21,026
(You're wrong)
PLENGTHAI: Did we make the right choice?

727
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:22,066
(You're wrong)
PLENGTHAI: I've never worked

728
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,306
PLENGTHAI: with these five people.

729
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:28,666
(PLENGTHAI FIGHT!)

730
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,306
(Am I heavy?)
(No Problem)

731
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,946
(Very Light)

732
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:37,866
PLENGTHAI: The challenge of this song is

733
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:39,906
PLENGTHAI: its delicate gracefulness.

734
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,586
PLENGTHAI: If it is just
about the movements,

735
00:38:43,106 --> 00:38:43,986
PLENGTHAI: I think it wouldn't be hard.

736
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:47,066
(Stiff)
PLENGTHAI: But some moves require flexibility.

737
00:38:47,146 --> 00:38:49,706
PLENGTHAI: It's hard
because my body is so stiff.

738
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,346
PLENGTHAI: I've danced hip-hop
my whole life.

739
00:38:51,466 --> 00:38:53,066
PLENGTHAI: So I've had to adjust a lot.

740
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:57,946
PLENGTHAI: Everyone has
their own strengths.

741
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,466
PLENGTHAI: Like this one is good at
dancing and visual interpretation.

742
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:02,186
PLENGTHAI: This one is good
at choreography.

743
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,426
PLENGTHAI: This one is good at singing.

744
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:08,426
PLENGTHAI: For practicing,
whoever's good at it will be the leader.

745
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:11,786
PLENGTHAI: That's why it is
a strength of our team.

746
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:18,666
SHOYA: First of all, since I was
assigned to be the main vocal center,

747
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:21,106
SHOYA: I'm shouldering
a great responsibility.

748
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:22,906
SHOYA: I need to be the role model

749
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,226
SHOYA: and also lead everyone.

750
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:25,746
SHOYA: Yes.

751
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:28,826
SHOYA: Exactly.

752
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,226
SHOYA: Seven, eight.

753
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,186
SHOYA: One, two. three.

754
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,946
SHOYA: Even everyone thinks
they're not good at dancing.

755
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:41,506
SHOYA: They still said
they will strictly practice.

756
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:43,546
SHOYA: There are people
with strong determination

757
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,786
SHOYA: and so enthusiastic
than I imagined.

758
00:39:49,274 --> 00:39:52,274
SHOYA: For the original choreography
of this song,

759
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:53,874
SHOYA: I do like it.

760
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:55,834
SHOYA: But if we do that,
we'd just be a cover dance team.

761
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:58,634
SHOYA: I want to create an impression.

762
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:02,594
SHOYA: So I tried modifying
some original moves.

763
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,354
SHOYA: Better.

764
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:06,394
PLENGTHAI: SHOYA is amazing.

765
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:08,554
PLENGTHAI: I'll call SHOYA teacher.

766
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:10,354
PLENGTHAI: I feel like everyone
really respects him.

767
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:11,354
PLENGTHAI: He is admirable.

768
00:40:16,474 --> 00:40:20,794
SHOYA: For dancing,
I collaborated with GOU YI a lot.

769
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:28,074
GOU YI: And go.

770
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:31,034
GOU YI: Yes.

771
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:31,914
GOU YI: You can.

772
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,674
GOU YI: You do this.

773
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:36,554
GOU YI: We do this.

774
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:38,754
GOU YI: No.

775
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:43,514
GOU YI: We might change something a bit

776
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:44,834
GOU YI: like the flow of the moves

777
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:46,674
GOU YI: and breathing rhythm.

778
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:49,554
GOU YI: Like tightening
any loose screws.

779
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:50,834
- SHOYA: Play the music.
- GOU YI: Okay.

780
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,154
GOU YI: You're a dancer.

781
00:40:58,154 --> 00:40:58,994
KOHI: Dancer...

782
00:40:59,034 --> 00:41:00,034
GOU YI: You're a dancer.

783
00:41:01,754 --> 00:41:03,474
(Being an idol is not easy.)

784
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:10,594
(Build Relationships)

785
00:41:10,954 --> 00:41:12,874
(The dance position is for teaching dance)
SHOYA: For dancing positions...

786
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:16,034
SHOYA: KOHI also stands out
in visual effects.

787
00:41:16,034 --> 00:41:18,754
(KOHI also stands out in visual effects)
SHOYA: He always come up with ideas.

788

789
00:41:26,514 --> 00:41:30,434

KOHI: This part... and then...

790
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:32,594
(I agree)

791
00:41:32,594 --> 00:41:36,034
STAFF: How do you usually discuss ideas?

792
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,874

TZI XUAN: Thank you.

795
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:42,074
TZI XUAN: I'm hungry.

796
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:43,154

797
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:44,794
PLENGTHAI: TZI XUAN
speaks six languages.

798
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:46,474
PLENGTHAI: He can translate everything.

799
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:49,594
(I am a TRANSLATION ROBOT)
TZI XUAN: I would say I take as their translator machine.

800
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,714
KOHI: Because your...

801
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:54,954
KOHI: I saw everything
during the level test.

802

KOHI: But...

803

(Speak Korean)

804
00:41:57,634 --> 00:42:00,154
KOHI: It's not about making it powerful,

805
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,754
KOHI: but you need to make it gorgeous.

806
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:05,154
(Don't stop)
KOHI: So...but the full voice will...

807
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:06,474
(Stop first,
and wait for the translation)

808
00:42:06,594 --> 00:42:08,514
(TRANSLATOR)
TZI XUAN: He said we should practice

809
00:42:08,634 --> 00:42:10,274
TZI XUAN: like mixed voice.

810
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:14,674
(MIX VOICE is hard to sing,
need to find a teacher)

811

812
00:42:31,394 --> 00:42:32,514

KOHI: Right. Perfect.

813
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:33,954
(Perfect)
KOHI: You did it perfectly.

814
00:42:33,954 --> 00:42:36,714
PLENGTHAI: KOHI is the real vocal coach.

815

KOHI: I've learned singing

816
00:42:38,034 --> 00:42:40,674
KOHI: for seven straight years.

817
00:42:40,754 --> 00:42:42,634
KOHI: During my training,
the most important thing

818
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:44,754
KOHI: is to have a perfect foundation.

819
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:48,194
KOHI: Once we have it,

820
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:49,954
KOHI: then we can go on
to the next level.

821
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,306
GOU YI: It has to be fast,
it's a rapping.

822
00:42:58,386 --> 00:43:01,306
GOU YI: Actually when choosing the song,
I didn't even know how fast it was.

823
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:03,506
GOU YI: I couldn't catch the lyrics.

824
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:04,906
GOU YI: Only after seeing the lyrics,
I just realized that

825
00:43:04,986 --> 00:43:07,106
GOU YI: wow, it is a lot and so fast.

826
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:09,026
GOU YI: It is much harder
than the THEME SONG.

827
00:43:10,946 --> 00:43:12,306
KOHI: This is a mixed voice.

828
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:13,146
(This is Mix Voice)
KOHI: Perfect.

829
00:43:15,786 --> 00:43:19,104
(Very strict)

830
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:24,992
KOHI: This feeling.

831
00:43:33,106 --> 00:43:35,106
(Very good)
KOHI: Much better. Really.

832
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,586
SHOYA: For the vocal basic,

833
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,746
SHOYA: everyone is trying
to master mixed voice.

834
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:45,986
SHOYA: KOHI is the main instructor.

835
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:49,186
SHOYA: Because it's a Chinese song,

836
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:53,466
SHOYA: so we need WANXIN's help.

837
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,706
WANXIN: I think I might not dance well.

838
00:44:04,826 --> 00:44:07,466
WANXIN: And the one thing
I might do well

839
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:09,666
WANXIN: is that this song is in Chinese.

840
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:12,306
WANXIN: I think
I do speak good Mandarin.

841
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:15,786
WANXIN: So this is the only thing that
I can help the team.

842
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,952
WANXIN: Help them better
their pronunciations.

843
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:20,512
WANXIN: Yes.

844
00:44:27,392 --> 00:44:31,040
KOHI: Now I feel it lacks power.

845
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,978
KOHI: More power.

846
00:44:33,978 --> 00:44:37,658
KOHI: But some Chinese pronunciations
doesn't exist in Korean.

847
00:44:38,106 --> 00:44:41,786
KOHI: Like shi, chi, ru.

848
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:45,466
KOHI: I feel like,
these make it even harder for me.

849
00:44:47,386 --> 00:44:48,066
PLENGTHAI: From the first day

850
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:49,066
PLENGTHAI: until today,

851
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:51,706
PLENGTHAI: we genuinely improve
and we can see the differences.

852
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:53,546
PLENGTHAI: What I've been worried about

853
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,026
PLENGTHAI: has completely
exceeded my expectations.

854
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,946
PLENGTHAI: I'm so lucky
to be part of this team.

855
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:07,386
SHOYA: Right now...

856
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:10,106
(1 DAY BEFORE SHOW)
SHOYA: At least, really, I'm so confident.

857
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:12,426
SHOYA: We finally practice singing
and dancing.

858
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:14,666
SHOYA: 120%.

XIN: I think the show is so good.

898
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,314
XIN: The first part
is what GOU YI specialized in,

899
00:49:07,354 --> 00:49:08,514
XIN: relaxed movements.

900
00:49:08,954 --> 00:49:10,754
XIN: Then in the latter half, SHOYA

901
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:12,914

and powerful impression.

Under The Moon Road,

PEANUT: Because I don't want to lose.

910
00:49:29,706 --> 00:49:31,706
TADALEE: At the beginning,
I never felt that

911
00:49:31,746 --> 00:49:34,346
TADALEE: we should compete fiercely

912
00:49:34,386 --> 00:49:36,306
TADALEE: or fight to the death.

913
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:39,786

two exceptionally strong teams.

914

we didn't have much pressure on us.

957
00:52:00,906 --> 00:52:03,106
DORN: This will be the last time

958
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,266
DORN: that we can dance
this song together.

959
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:08,346
DORN: Just give our all
in this performance,

960
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:11,946
DORN: making the AUDIENCE
enjoy our show, that's enough.

961
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:15,626
YAO ZIHAO: At first, I didn't
choose the team because of the song.

962
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:17,146
YAO ZIHAO: But I chose it
because of DORN.

963
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,626
(Member Grouping)
JEFF: YAO ZIHAO, choose first.

964

969
00:52:33,306 --> 00:52:34,546
YAO ZIHAO: We are number one.

970
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:39,146
YAO ZIHAO: Everyone might think
YAO ZIHAO isn't fit to be

971
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:40,346
YAO ZIHAO: center of dancing.

972
00:52:40,586 --> 00:52:42,506
YAO ZIHAO: They probably think
DORN is more suitable.

973
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:44,666
YAO ZIHAO: I don't care though.

974
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:47,226
YAO ZIHAO: On the contrary, I prefer
not being the center.

975
00:52:47,226 --> 00:52:48,186
OMAR: Among all these 10 songs, I think

976
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:50,146

has the most talented skills.

977
00:52:50,146 --> 00:52:52,546

978
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,786

982
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:05,186

DORN: and meet up every day.

992
00:53:24,146 --> 00:53:25,986
DORN: I also have to focus on
what I'm doing.

993

JACKSON: The atmosphere is weird.

997
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:57,826
JACKSON: Maybe because we are divided
into two subgroups.

998
00:53:57,866 --> 00:54:00,066
JACKSON: They stay in their parts,
and we stay in ours.

999

JACKSON: We've been practicing like this
for about a week.

1000
00:54:06,746 --> 00:54:08,266
JACKSON: But during self-practice day,

1001
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:12,266
JACKSON: YAO ZIHAO went for makeup or interview,
so he didn't come and practice with us.

(Practice dance break)

1003
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:17,666

JACKSON: After finishing the dance,

1005
00:54:27,026 --> 00:54:28,186
JACKSON: we were so exhausted.

1006
00:54:29,506 --> 00:54:30,666

TADALEE: When it comes to SAY part..

1007

TADALEE: it is not tired.

1008
00:54:33,546 --> 00:54:34,626
TADALEE: But when it comes to...

1009
00:54:34,786 --> 00:54:36,186
TADALEE: I LOVE... Oh, wow.

1010
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,346
JACKSON: Then they suggested
trying to shorten it

1011
00:54:41,506 --> 00:54:43,226

00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:27,826

we're wasting time.

TADALEE: No dance break.

1028
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:34,066
JACKSON: Keep the dance break or...

1029
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:37,586
YAO ZIHAO: This isn't a dance break.

1030
00:55:38,466 --> 00:55:39,746
YAO ZIHAO: It's still a vocal section.

1031
00:55:39,826 --> 00:55:41,920
TADALEE: I know, but...

1032
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,866
TADALEE: Just the dance break
that we called.

1033
00:55:45,106 --> 00:55:48,626
TADALEE: With this part, ENERGY part,
shall we keep it.

1034

TADALEE: Let's vote.

1035

JACKSON: Let's vote.

1036
00:55:52,026 --> 00:55:55,226

like 20 minutes.

1038

1039
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,786
(RICKY didn't come to training due to MV recording)
TADALEE: RICKY wants that part.

TADALEE: He told me in the car.

(SILENCE)

1043

1045

JACKSON: only five people
are here to vote.

1050
00:56:33,506 --> 00:56:35,744
JACKSON: RICKY wasn't here.
But his close friend said

1051
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:39,466
JACKSON: RICKY tole him in the car
that he likes this one.

1052
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,408
JACKSON: He meant we could count RICKY
as having voted.

1053

1054

1055
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,466

(Change Dance Break: Day 3)

You've added the dance break.

1058
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:58,178
DANCE TEACHER: In the last part,
do we have

1059
00:56:58,218 --> 00:56:59,698
DANCE TEACHER: this move...

1060
00:56:59,738 --> 00:57:00,458
DANCE TEACHER: this move?

1061
00:57:00,538 --> 00:57:01,738
PEANUT: Should we start over?

1062
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:03,258
DANCE TEACHER: Do we have it?

1063
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:05,458
- DORN: No.
- DANCE TEACHER: You guys... No, right?

1064
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:09,098
DANCE TEACHER: Then here is the problem.

1065
00:57:09,578 --> 00:57:10,778
DANCE TEACHER: If we don't have it,

1066
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:13,218
DANCE TEACHER: YAO ZIHAO's parts
might be reduced.

1067
00:57:13,378 --> 00:57:16,698
(YAO ZIHAO's parts have been reduced)
DANCE TEACHER: In that case, that position

1068
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:17,498
DANCE TEACHER: that YAO ZIHAO dances...

1069
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:20,218
DANCE TEACHER: Therefore,
you guys need to make a decision.

1070
00:57:25,216 --> 00:57:26,912
(Proactive Communication)

1071
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:30,114
DORN: We had discussed about
the dance break for a long time.

1072
00:57:30,154 --> 00:57:32,874
DORN: Now five of us
already have our own scene.

1073
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:34,874
DORN: We have our own solo parts,

1074
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:35,994
DORN: but YAO ZIHAO doesn't.

1075
00:57:36,074 --> 00:57:39,594
DORN: So I tried to make it fair
for everyone.

1076
00:57:39,634 --> 00:57:41,714
DORN: Everyone should have
their own part and be outstanding.

1077
00:57:42,034 --> 00:57:43,154
DORN: So I decided to

1078
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:46,834
DORN: let YAO ZIHAO dance this.
I tried to make it look good.

1079
00:57:46,914 --> 00:57:50,554
DORN: I never thought that because I'm
the center, everyone should listen to me

1080
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:51,754
DORN: and everyone should follow me.

1081
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:53,554
DORN: I don't have that thought
in my head.

1082
00:57:53,914 --> 00:57:56,714
DORN: Being center
is just being selected.

1083
00:57:57,274 --> 00:58:01,834
DORN: But whether it's good or not,
it depends on our teamwork.

1084
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:05,674
DORN: As I said, at the end,
we go as a team.

1085
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:07,754
DORN: We need to break down barriers.

1086
00:58:08,074 --> 00:58:09,434
DORN: Because we still can't get along,

1087
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:11,354
DORN: we are still not a "team'".

1088
00:58:16,064 --> 00:58:20,034
DORN: I feel like we should
bring in a dance break.

1089
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:25,434
DORN: In the "I love my team" part...

1090
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:29,674
DORN: Because first, I'm concerned about

1091
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:33,194
DORN: that RICKY and JACKSON
rarely attend practice

1092
00:58:33,194 --> 00:58:37,074
DORN: and about rehearsals.

1093
00:58:37,074 --> 00:58:38,594
DORN: It makes...

1094
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:41,634
DORN: The others can't keep up.

1095
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:45,474
DORN: YAO ZIHAO,
what do you think about...

1096
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:49,394
DORN: Hey, this part is funny.

1097
00:58:49,394 --> 00:58:50,914
DORN: What do you think about the show

1098
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:52,674
DORN: if we add a dance break

1099
00:58:54,194 --> 00:58:56,514
DORN: to replace the "I love my team
I love my partner" part?

1100
00:58:57,794 --> 00:59:00,354
YAO ZIHAO: Right,
because this is a survival show.

1101
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:03,634
YAO ZIHAO: When I joined this team,

1102
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:07,234
YAO ZIHAO: I did want to compete.

1103
00:59:07,234 --> 00:59:10,914
YAO ZIHAO: It's like there is a wall
separating us.

1104
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:14,394
YAO ZIHAO: So it leads us to think that
the others are not considering the team

1105
00:59:14,394 --> 00:59:16,754
YAO ZIHAO: but rather focusing on
personal interests.

1106
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:21,354
DORN: Actually, I really want to show
our standpoint that

1107
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,554
DORN: we've never been
prejudiced against you.

1108
00:59:24,554 --> 00:59:26,994
DORN: We genuinely
tried to reach out to you.

1109
00:59:27,554 --> 00:59:28,874
DORN: But due to language barriers

1110
00:59:28,954 --> 00:59:32,274
DORN: and some cultural differences,

1111
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:34,674
DORN: sometime we didn't know
how to approach you

1112
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:35,554
DORN: or how to communicate properly

1113
00:59:35,594 --> 00:59:39,114
DORN: to make you feel comfortable.

1114
00:59:42,914 --> 00:59:44,096
YAO ZIHAO: Yeah, I know.

1115
00:59:44,434 --> 00:59:47,834
YAO ZIHAO: So I apologize
for previous matters

1116
00:59:47,914 --> 00:59:50,874
YAO ZIHAO: that made you uncomfortable.

1117
00:59:50,914 --> 00:59:52,234
YAO ZIHAO: I'm sorry.

1118
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,394
(All misunderstandings
will eventually be resolved)

1119
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:02,914
YAO ZIHAO: At first, maybe because
we spoke different languages.

1120
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:05,514
YAO ZIHAO: So we couldn't
communicate well.

1121
01:00:05,674 --> 01:00:06,474
YAO ZIHAO: But now...

1122
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:08,794
YAO ZIHAO: I think I'll work hard on
learning English with DORN.

1123
01:00:08,834 --> 01:00:09,754
YAO ZIHAO: So we can communicate.

1124
01:00:10,354 --> 01:00:12,794
DORN: I want to talk to you.

1125
01:00:12,794 --> 01:00:16,794
DORN: But I don't know...

1126
01:00:16,794 --> 01:00:18,394
- DORN: What's the word...
- PEANUT / TADALEE: WORD (word)

DORN: English word.

1128
01:00:21,394 --> 01:00:23,674
YAO ZIHAO: I don't know either.

1129
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:27,954
STAFF: Then how do you guys communicate?

1130
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,434
YAO ZIHAO: We use gestures.

1131
01:00:36,794 --> 01:00:38,304
YAO ZIHAO: This and DORN...

1132
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:40,864
YAO ZIHAO: DORN... back... PEANUT...

1133
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,056
TADALEE: I was like, what's that.

1134
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:51,584
TADALEE: Then DORN would be like
"guys, it's this one".

1135
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:53,152
(Blah Blah)
TADALEE: Translating and then...

1136
01:00:54,656 --> 01:00:56,512
TADALEE: How did you know?

1137
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,130
YAO ZIHAO: Just looking into your eyes,
and I knew it.

1139
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:03,570
DORN: After we opened up to each other,

1140
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,010
DORN: I started seeing... pink color.

1141
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,650
DORN: It's becoming rainbow-colored.

1142
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,330
DORN: Because it's starting
to become rainbow-ish,

1143
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:14,010
DORN: I feel like our colors
are starting to change.

BAMBAM: Oh, my God.

1308
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:15,610
BAMBAM: XU MINGHAO (THE 8),

1309
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,290
BAMBAM: what do you think?

1310
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,330
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): I feel that
the performance

1311
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,570
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): was better
than the rehearsal.

1312
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:29,650
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): But personally
I still feel that in some parts,

1313
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,410
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you putted
too much force.

1314
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,650
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): So I think
controlling your force

1315
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,050
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): is one of the skills

1316
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:42,010
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): you need to
gradually practice.

1317
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:46,370
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): It's not that the song
is ferocious so you have to dance harder.

1318
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:51,410
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Instead, you should
know how to control your force,

1319
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:54,050
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): so your performance
will be more appealing to the AUDIENCE.

1320
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:55,610
XU MINGHAO (THE 8): Keep going.

1321
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:02,930
BAMBAM: And the MVP of the SUPER team.

1322
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,970

01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:08,970

01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:10,450

01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,410
- LYU: TADALEE.

1326
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:16,330
NINJA: Too hard.

1327
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,130

1332
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:38,690
SUNNY: I see DORN,
he really captured the camera.

1333
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:42,010
SUNNY: And his facial expression

1334
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,850
SUNNY: and all of the vibe...

1335
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:47,290
SUNNY: He get it.
So really fire the stage.

1336
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:50,450
DORN: Thank you for voting me as an MVP.

1337
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:53,490
DORN: Many people think
the center must be the leader.

1338
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,810
DORN: But actually,
I'm not a good leader.

1339
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,810
DORN: I'm more of a good follower.

1340
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:05,930
BAMBAM: And the MVP
for Under The Moon Road.

1341
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,570
BAMBAM: Turn around.

1342
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,210
BAMBAM: Under The Moon Road MVP

1343
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:13,650
BAMBAM: only got one point
from each other.

1344
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,010
HIKARI: First and second place
differ by just one point.

1345
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:18,530
BAMBAM: So it was really hard.

1346
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:22,250
BAMBAM: But let's see
who's gonna be the MVP.

1347
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,770
DONGDONG: SHOYA.

1348
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:29,130
KEVIN: SHOYA is good,
but I support WANXIN.

1349
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,690
BAMBAM: The MVP is...

1350
01:15:35,690 --> 01:15:38,090

1352
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:59,650
WHYLUCAS: I thought The MVP of Under The Moon Road
should be PLENGTHAI or SHOYA.

1353
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,290
WHYLUCAS: I'm a bit surprised
it was KOHI.

1354
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:02,810
WHYLUCAS: But honestly, I also feel that

1355
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:07,170
WHYLUCAS: KOHI's seating part
was really impressive.

1356
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,170
KOHI: Actually I'm very lucky

1357
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:13,330
KOHI: to be today's MVP,
but to be completely honest,

1358
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:18,370
KOHI: our team barely slept at all.

1359
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,090
KOHI: So many things happened.

1360
01:16:21,370 --> 01:16:25,810
KOHI: I think all of us together
earned this MVP.

1361
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:26,530

1365
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,730
BAMBAM: This is so hard.

1366
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:42,250
BAMBAM: The point is like
really similar.

1367
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,090
BAMBAM: So everyone, turn around.
