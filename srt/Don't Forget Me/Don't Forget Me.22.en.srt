1
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,030
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 22)

3
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,700
Siyuan!

4
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,310
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,770
I don't need you to save me.

6
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,830
Don't be afraid.

7
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,390
I'm here.

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,090
Shen Anren.

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,220
What exactly do you want?

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,830
Isn't it time to return the position of

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,430
the Shen family's head to me?

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,100
You won't even agree to this?

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,410
It looks like you're not

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,590
that important to him.

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,590
Okay.

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,280
I'll give it to you.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,490
Lin Ze.

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,930
Go fetch the Kylin Seal for me.

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,110
What you want

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,430
is not just the position of the family's head, right?

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,150
Just tell me

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,539
what else you want.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,960
The title of Governor Shen

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,729
is quite prestigious in Haidu.

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,350
I have long wanted to experience it.

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,740
The position of Governor

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,160
is not something you can have just because you want it.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,620
That's your problem then.

29
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,710
You don't need to do these things for me!

30
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,740
As you know,

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,570
my life is different from yours.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,230
But you'll still feel pain.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,310
No!

34
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,590
Is this enough?

35
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,190
I don't care for it anymore.

36
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,650
What exactly do you want?

37
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,340
The game has just begun.

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,850
Kneel down.

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,950
Beg me.

40
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,829
Don't do that.

41
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,050
Will you kneel down or not?

42
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,790
Don't kneel down!

43
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,800
Why do you have to kneel down?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,930
I won't die anyway.

45
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,810
I can't just stand by and watch him pointing a gun at you.

46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,880
Shen Zheng, oh,

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,640
Shen Zheng.

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,270
I never thought that you would be like this one day.

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
What a pity.

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,930
What I want is dying together.

51
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,790
There are explosives buried here.

52
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,430
None of us will survive today!

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
You won't be able to escape, either.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,680
Who cares?

55
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,930
Shen Changzhang said that he would be nice to me,

56
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,260
but you're the son he cared about the most.

57
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,120
It was not easy for me to finally find Siyuan.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,010
But you're also the person she cares about the most.

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,150
What about you?

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,740
Ever since I joined this family,

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,460
you've been disliking me in every aspect.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,990
Has anyone ever truly cared about my feelings?

63
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,850
That's because you want too much!

64
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,110
When you first joined the Shen family,

65
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,240
wasn't I nice to you?

66
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,070
It was you who wanted to compete with me in everything.

67
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,540
You were afraid that our father

68
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,400
would favor me.

69
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,050
How could I possibly like you?

70
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,209
Father.

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,019
Here's my report card.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Let me take a look.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,310
It's good.

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,270
What reward would you like?

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,140
I want to learn horseback riding.

76
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,270
Horseback riding?

77
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,230
Okay.

78
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,580
I'll let you learn it.

79
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,010
Good.

80
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,960
Anren.

81
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,170
What about you?

82
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,430
Your grades have dropped a little.

83
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't worry, Father.

84
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,310
I will study hard.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,560
Good!

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,830
I like that statement of yours.

87
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,920
Father, Father.

88
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,310
Anren has been making progress.

89
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,340
It's quite good.

90
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,000
Can we go horseback riding together?

91
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,270
Sure.

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,560
Of course you can go horseback riding.

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
Let's ride horses together.

94
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,760
You just gave me your redundant stuff.

95
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,450
What's there to be so proud of?

96
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,230
I want something that belongs to myself completely.

97
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,550
What's wrong with that?

98
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,150
What did our father do wrong?

99
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,470
Do you dare to say that our father's death

100
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,930
has nothing to do with you?

101
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,909
I killed our father.

102
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,930
But you're the real culprit.

103
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,390
Bastard!

104
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:46,070
Kneel down!

105
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,110
I was already quite excellent.

106
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,100
Everyone called me Master Anren.

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,890
But what about him?

108
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,490
He was determined to find you.

109
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,030
I had no choice but to poison him a little

110
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,150
so that he would be unfit for long journeys.

111
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,150
But what did he do?

112
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,200
He still said that he wanted to go look for you.

113
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,180
As a result, Siyuan accidentally hurt him.

114
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,350
I put aside our past grievances and brought him home to look after him.

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,310
But do you know what he said to me?

116
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,950
He said the same thing as you did.

117
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,250
He said he regretted it.

118
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,710
He regretted adopting me.

119
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,180
So I had no choice but to stop offering his medicine to him

120
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,230
and let him die right in front of me.

121
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,909
Your insecurity and sensitivity ruined you

122
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,720
and made you keep making mistakes.

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,220
I got it painstakingly for myself.

124
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,550
What's wrong with that?

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,070
Shen Anren,

126
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,700
you're truly hopeless.

127
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,850
I don't need to be saved.

128
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,530
I just want you to remember me.

129
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,150
Consider this explosion as fireworks I'm dedicating to you.

130
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,240
What's going on?

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,960
Governor, the crisis has been resolved.

132
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,950
Just now, I did all these things with you

133
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,920
just in order to buy time.

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,710
Do you think

135
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,040
you can threaten me?

136
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,150
These three shots

137
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,190
are for me,

138
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,720
Qin Siyuan

139
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,070
and those innocent civilians who were involved in this incident.

140
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,120
This last shot

141
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,710
is for my father.

142
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,950
Sister.

143
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,990
I...

144
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,330
This time, it was you who reminded me.

145
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,330
Give it to me.

146
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,370
Promise me that

147
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,909
you won't push me away again.

148
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,230
By the way,

149
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,790
what did you want to tell me that day?

150
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,630
Listen carefully

151
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,720
to what I'm about to say.

152
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,710
After you hear it,

153
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,120
make a decision prudently.

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,080
Okay.

155
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,280
You and I are in a life-or-death predicament.

156
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,630
On the day before your 25th birthday,

157
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,410
which is tomorrow,

158
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,330
if the lamp goes out, I'll die.

159
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,710
If the lamp doesn't go out, you'll die.

160
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,990
Between you and me,

161
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,900
only one of us can survive.

162
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,120
So you pushed me away in advance

163
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,760
all because of this reason?

164
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,360
Only until now do I understand that

165
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,780
since we love each other,

166
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,910
then we both have the right

167
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,370
to decide our future life.

168
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,430
I thought I was doing everything for your own good,

169
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,150
but I was actually being selfish.

170
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,480
I hurt you more instead.

171
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,080
So this time,

172
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,290
I'll let you decide it.
