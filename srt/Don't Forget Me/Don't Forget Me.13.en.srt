1
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,040
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,090
(Changzhang Bridge)

4
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,230
I built that bridge.

5
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,320
His kindness was like the spring breeze,

6
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,760
melting snow into rain.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,379
He should be remembered forever.

8
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,430
Thank you.

9
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,080
How's your injury?

10
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,030
Don't worry.

11
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,460
It's completely healed.

12
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,110
What about your wound?

13
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,320
Fortunately, Master Anren had a backup plan.

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,030
On the dagger that wounded him,

15
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,160
poison was applied.

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,229
It seems now

17
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,150
the poison

18
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,220
has taken effect.

19
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,630
(Changzhang Bridge)
has taken effect.

20
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,220
(Changzhang Bridge)

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,700
Throw him into the river.

22
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,390
Yes.

23
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,750
So it's true.

24
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,630
As the Extinguishing Lampshade becomes more complete,

25
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,090
my abilities grow weaker.

26
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,190
Sure enough,

27
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,400
my powers are getting weaker and weaker.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,310
Governor! Governor!

29
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,990
Governor!

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,030
Governor!

31
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,470
He's not here.

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,910
I don't believe you.

33
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,590
The Governor said he was coming to see you.

34
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,860
Did you kill him

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,610
and hide him?

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Watch your mouth.

37
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,200
What exactly happened?

38
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,180
This knife is poisoned.

39
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,750
Let's split up and search.

40
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,270
Shen Zheng...

41
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,100
My powers are too weak now.

42
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,110
I can't even sense his presence.

43
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,980
Shen Zheng!

44
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,590
Shen Zheng!

45
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,790
Shen Zheng!

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,790
Shen Zheng!

47
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,780
Shen Zheng!

48
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,620
You're awake.

49
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,800
(Commander Su's daughter, Su Li'er)

50
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,400
You saved me?

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,010
Of course. I'm beautiful and kind-hearted.

52
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,070
I made my family doctor

53
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,000
spend three days saving your life.

54
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,930
Thank you.

55
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,860
I am Shen Zheng, Governor of Haidu.

56
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,460
If you need any help in the future,

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,940
feel free to come to me.

58
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,900
Just rest well.

59
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,510
My father is the Grand Marshal.

60
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,680
I have everything I want.

61
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,700
Commander Su?

62
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,970
However, he's currently away on official business

63
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,840
and not at home.

64
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,460
Thank you, Miss Su.

65
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,610
After I go back,

66
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,740
I will prepare a gift

67
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,720
and personally come to thank you.

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,790
No need for gifts.

69
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,300
You're so handsome.

70
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,720
Why don't you marry me

71
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,570
and be my husband instead?

72
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,760
Miss Su.

73
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,640
I still have many things to do.

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,600
I don't care.

75
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,800
I've taken a liking to you now.

76
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,240
Will you agree or not?

77
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,790
We're not suitable for each other.

78
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,590
Guards!

79
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,620
Now, do you think we're suitable?

80
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,390
I don't like you.

81
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm so beautiful

82
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,550
and rich,

83
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,290
and my father is the Grand Marshal.

84
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,130
How could anyone not like me?

85
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,190
Unless...

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,170
You already have someone you like.

87
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,870
No.

88
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,880
Then you're just playing hard to get.

89
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,390
Miss Su.

90
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,880
I'll take my leave.

91
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,710
I've always been the one rejecting others.

92
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,240
No one has ever rejected me.

93
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,800
Miss Su.

94
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,770
You can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make it drink.

95
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,660
Whether it'll drink or not,

96
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,330
we'll see after I lead it to the water first.

97
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,810
Anyway,

98
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,710
I

99
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,400
am determined to marry you.

100
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,170
Shen... Shen Zheng.

101
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,260
What are you doing?

102
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,230
I...

103
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,500
Shen Zheng!

104
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,910
I'm telling you!

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,060
What I, Su Li'er, want,

106
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,320
I will definitely get!

107
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,150
Where on earth is Shen Zheng?

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,710
I really don't know.

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,430
Perhaps someone from Zhao's Mansion took him.

110
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,660
Lin Ze has investigated.

111
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,100
It wasn't Zhao's Mansion's doing.

112
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,630
Who else could it be but you?

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,210
Shen Zheng is a Governor.

114
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,270
He has a lot of enemies.

115
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,330
I've been protecting you like this.

116
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,010
Why don't you believe me?

117
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:35,790
Besides, even if Shen Zheng

118
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,830
really died,

119
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,950
so what?

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,830
He treated you so badly.

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,030
He deserves to die.

122
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,470
I've said before,

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,430
the matters between him and me

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,890
are none of your business.

125
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,310
Then kill me.

126
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,720
As long as it makes you happy,

127
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,130
I'm willing to die for you.

128
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,810
You think I don't dare?

129
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,530
Master Anren.

130
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,590
Shen Zheng is back.

131
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,190
Master Anren.

132
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,070
What happened?

133
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,450
Qin Siyuan.

134
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,500
You'll be mine sooner or later.

135
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,620
Governor.

136
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,360
You...

137
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
Don't worry, I'm fine.

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,110
I remember everything now.

139
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,240
Where have you been?

140
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,130
I couldn't find you anywhere.

141
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,549
Without me,

142
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,659
you couldn't find the third fragment.

143
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,590
Of course you were anxious, Ms. Qin.

144
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,549
You...

145
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,410
You remember everything?

146
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,670
I've said before

147
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,510
that I don't want to see you.

148
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,070
Lin Ze.

149
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,040
Escort her out.

150
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,750
No.

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,190
I must get the third fragment.

152
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,190
Shen Zheng!

153
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,920
How did you find this place?

154
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
You told me yourself.

155
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,870
You're Shen Zheng,

156
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,930
Governor of Haidu.

157
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,160
So you must live in Shen's Mansion, right?

158
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,470
I've said, you and I...

159
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,370
I hear you, but I'm not listening!

160
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,300
Anyway, from today on,

161
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,310
I'm staying here.

162
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,710
If you dare to kick me out,

163
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,910
I'll tell my father

164
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,510
that you took advantage of me and wouldn't take responsibility.

165
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,590
Who is she?

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,750
I've arranged accommodation for Miss Su.

167
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,350
Are we letting her stay here in the mansion permanently?

168
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,150
We'll see.

169
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,990
She did save my life after all.

170
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,320
We must not neglect her.

171
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,100
Yes.

172
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,510
While I was away,

173
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,890
did anything happen

174
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,490
in the army or in the mansion?

175
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,690
During this time,

176
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,670
all the evidence pointed to Mr. Qian.

177
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,030
So I had him arrested

178
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,200
and used his assets

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,330
to cover the shortage in military pay.

180
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,770
However, not long ago,

181
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
he died in prison.

182
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,010
Mr. Qian was merely a scapegoat.

183
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,490
The person behind all this

184
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,940
is Shen Anren.

185
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,720
That day in Nanhuai Water Town,

186
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,950
he ordered someone to push me into the river.

187
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,280
He thought I was completely unconscious,

188
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,880
but little did he know I was still slightly aware.

189
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,540
I had the same suspicion, Sir.

190
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,630
After you fell off the cliff,

191
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,120
he hastily sought the position of family head.

192
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,510
But since he didn't have the Kylin Seal,

193
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,570
it was suppressed.

194
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
Should we have him arrested?

195
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,550
We must not act rashly.

196
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,170

197
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,350
is related to him.

198
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,540
I must uncover the truth.
