00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,040
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,970
(Episode 24)

3
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,090
The day is nearing its end.

4
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,270
Yes.

5
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,710
You're about to turn 25.

6
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,830
I wish you

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
a happy birthday in advance.

8
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,650
Give me the Never Forget Lamp.

9
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,390
If you survive,

10
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,010
you'll definitely live in agony.

11
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,970
As your husband,

12
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,320
I can't bear

13
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,790
to see you suffer so much.

14
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,590
Thank you.

15
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,720
Give it to me.

16
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,260
Being in love with you

17
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,310
has been an honor.

18
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,750
I feel the same.

19
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,380
There's a custom in my hometown.

20
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,280
If the Never Forget Lamp

21
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,890
is lit on the wedding night,

22
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,710
the couple can be together forever

23
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,570
and will never forget each other.

24
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,390
When I return in triumph,

25
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,880
will you light it with me?

26
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,730
General,

27
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,980
the lamp is on.

28
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,450
Can you see it?

29
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,330
I'm coming to you.

30
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,380
We must meet again.

31
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,150
You're awake.

32
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,630
Who is it?

33
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,140
Who's speaking?

34
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,780
Is there anyone you want to see?

35
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,930
Of course there is.

36
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,250
As long as you pay a certain price,

37
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,560
you can see him.

38
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,840
Are you willing?

39
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,770
As long as I can see him,

40
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,180
no matter what the price is,

41
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,030
I'm willing.

42
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,740
Even if you'll lose your memories

43
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,990
and your freedom?

44
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,150
I'm not afraid.

45
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,600
Even if your reunion doesn't mean being together,

46
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,860
you're still willing?

47
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,030
I'm willing.

48
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,830
Then stay here

49
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,130
to fulfill others' wishes

50
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,650
till that person appears.

51
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,860
Okay.

52
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,510
Who am I?

53
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,230
Qin Siyuan!

54
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,110
I hate you!

55
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,409
I curse you to be immortal

56
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,810
with endless loneliness

57
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,750
and feel the pain I've felt!

58
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,310
Siyuan.

59
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,070
Siyuan.

60
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,140
Siyuan.

61
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,030
Siyuan!

62
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,310
So our reunion

63
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,000
was because of you.

64
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,250
Our separation

65
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,950
was because of me.

66
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,980
Sorry.

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,860
Sorry.

68
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,180
Sorry.

69
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,160
Sorry.

70
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:00,510
Sorry.

71
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,860
Siyuan,

72
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,040
I love you.

73
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,420
(On the wedding day, the bride died of an illness. Shortly after that, the general died on the battlefield.)

74
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,620
The story is over.
(On the wedding day, the bride died of an illness. Shortly after that, the general died on the battlefield.)

75
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,270
(On the wedding day, the bride died of an illness. Shortly after that, the general died on the battlefield.)

76
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:23,560
Siyuan,
(On the wedding day, the bride died of an illness. Shortly after that, the general died on the battlefield.)

77
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,070
Siyuan,

78
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,910
what have you learned?

79
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,190
Never forget,

80
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,340
and it will reverberate.

81
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,280
Professor,

82
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,510
I'm thinking...

83
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,990
this might be the meaning of the inheritance of the intangible cultural heritage.

84
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,190
Glass transforms into a vessel of love,

85
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,270
concealing affection within the deep sea.

86
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,200
Though a simple object,

87
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,170
it bears and preserves

88
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,530
memories of so many different people.

89
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,200
It has been passed down to this day,

90
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,590
unveiling its story to us.

91
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,150
As a researcher,

92
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,940
I have the responsibility and duty

93
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,740
to help more people understand and learn about it.

94
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,990
You are teachable.

95
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,730
Sorry.

96
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,180
It's alright.
