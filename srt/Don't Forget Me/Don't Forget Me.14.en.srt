1
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,030
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,970
(Episode 14)

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,300
I have the same suspicion, Sir.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,350
After you fell off the cliff,

5
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,840
he hastily sought the position of family head.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,210
But since he didn't have the Kylin Seal,

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,270
it was suppressed.

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,950
Should we have him arrested?

9
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,450
We must not act rashly.

10
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,040
I suspect my father's death

11
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,070
is related to him.

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,370
I must uncover the truth.

13
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,560
By the way,

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,129
regarding the missing military pay,

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,130
I've also found some clues.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,710
After Uncle fell ill,

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,039
he secretly handed over the management of the Chamber of Commerce

18
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,550
to Shen Anren,

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,070
while the transfer of this batch of military pay

20
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,100
happened to have used

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,310
the Chamber of Commerce's connections.

22
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,030
I'm afraid

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,789
this must be related to him.

24
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,050
It's Shen Anren again.

25
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,870
Investigate it for me.

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,270
Yes, Sir.

27
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,850
By the way, Governor,

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,950
your birthday is coming up soon.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,670
Many people have come to deliver gifts.

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,110
Should we hold a grand celebration?

31
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,920
No need.

32
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,590
You may leave now.

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,190
Yes, Sir.

34
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,370
I have the whereabouts of the last fragment.

35
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,690
Get out.

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,789
If you don't agree to help me,

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,960
I'll destroy the entire Shen family.

38
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,280
Are you threatening me?

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,470
Yes.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,490
Fine.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Then kill me now.

42
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,420
I must obtain

43
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,579
the last fragment within half a month.

44
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,320
What exactly do you want me to do

45
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
so you would help me?

46
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,030
I'd rather die than comply.

47
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,320
I heard you've been kneeling here for quite a while.

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,920
You think this would make me feel sorry for you?

49
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,750
Wouldn't it?

50
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,670
No.

51
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,430
Shen Zheng.

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,690
I bet you'll feel sorry for me.

53
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,510
Hey.

54
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,280
Tell me, what's the relationship between those two?

55
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,420
Put me down.

56
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,520
You have a fever.

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,180
You must see a doctor.

58
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,950
Put me down.

59
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,159
I thought you could hold out longer.

60
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,890
You're asking for help so soon.

61
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,840
Shen Zheng!

62
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,080
You've gone too far!

63
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,670
What does the matter between me and her have to do with you?

64
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,200
Brother.

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,460
Don't you know?

66
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,740
She's that Sister I've been thinking about all this time.

67
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,370
Shut up.

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,400
Where are you going?

69
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,080
I will keep kneeling

70
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,930
until you agree.

71
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,760
Let go.

72
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,540
If you don't let go,

73
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,020
I'll take it as your agreement.

74
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,210
So you finally agreed.

75
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,050
Thank you.

76
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,340
I just don't want to be entangled with you anymore.

77
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,270
Don't worry.

78
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,060
Once I get the fragment,

79
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,400
we'll have nothing to do with each other anymore.

80
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,240
That would be best.

81
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,190
Sister.

82
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,000
So you've really ended things with him?

83
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,670
Even if I'm done with him,

84
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,890
things still won't work out between the two of us.

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,330
Stay out of my business.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,130
Sister. Sister!

87
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,590
Sister!

88
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,500
(General Chamber of Commerce of Haidu City)

89
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,420
Shen Zheng is so lucky.

90
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,130
Now that he's back,

91
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,020
your appointment confirmation as the chairman of the chamber of commerce

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,480
has been put on hold again.

93
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,250
Has the military pay from the Chamber of Commerce been dealt with?

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,660
If he were only the head of the Shen family, it would be fine.

95
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,790
But unfortunately,

96
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,140
he's also the Governor.

97
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,070
As of now,

98
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,730
he's got spies all over Haidu.

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,460
It's impossible to ship it out.

100
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,080
I originally wanted to use the missing military pay incident

101
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,550
to destabilize his position as Governor.

102
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,409
Unexpectedly,

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,520
it has become a hot potato for myself in the end.

104
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,900
So what

105
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
should we do next?

106
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,450
Here's the plan.

107
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,740
I've set up connections with foreigners for you.

108
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,340
Get rid of the military pay as soon as possible.

109
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,100
Dragging it out for too long will surely lead to trouble.

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,540
Yes.

111
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,470
Master Anren, Governor Shen is here.

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,100
Siyuan.

113
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,160
You're here.

114
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,260
Siyuan?

115
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,580
You're calling her so affectionately.

116
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,430
I thought you two were supposed to be done with each other.

117
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,090
Why do you care what I call her?

118
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,470
Siyuan.

119
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,510
Didn't you ask him for a favor?

120
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,440
Why are you here?

121
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,670
Someone reported

122
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,040
that there are safety hazards in this building.

123
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,630
As the Governor, I'm here to investigate.

124
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,230
Is there a problem with that?

125
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,970
Of course not.

126
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,390
Please show the official order.

127
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,350
Shen Anren, don't go too far.

128
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,890
Siyuan, if you want to look around, go ahead.

129
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,630
After all,

130
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,150
what's mine is yours.

131
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,420
Don't.

132
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,400
I didn't expect

133
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,330
you'd find someone new so quickly.

134
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,919
Let's find the fragment first.

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,190
Answer me.

136
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,520
It hurts!

137
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,240
So you do know what pain feels like.

138
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,570
Answer me.

139
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,830
Yes.

140
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,380
Haven't you found someone new too?

141
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,530
Shen Zheng.

142
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,210
What on earth do you want?

143
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,620
I can't stand

144
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,480
seeing someone else by your side.

145
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,810
Tell me now,

146
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,850
during the time we were together,

147
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,270
did you ever

148
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,130
have any genuine feelings for me?

149
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,770
Even just a little bit?

150
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,330
Is there any point in talking about this now?

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,660
There is.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
As long as you say you did,

153
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:26,770
I can

154
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,320
pretend nothing happened,

155
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,540
and we can start over.

156
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,100
Shen Zheng, don't be like this.

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,780
Didn't we already agree

158
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,770
that after getting the fragment,

159
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,930
we would have nothing to do with each other anymore?

160
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,620
Just tell me,

161
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,430
did you,

162
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,780
or did you not?

163
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,490
I didn't.

164
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,470
Did you or did you not?

165
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,050
No, I didn't.

166
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,310
I said no, and I mean no.
