1
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,970
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 9)

3
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,850
Why are you protecting him like this?

4
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:47,760
Sister?

5
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,430
Sister.

6
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,880
So now I can do anything I want?

7
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,510
You can hit me like you used to.

8
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,150
If that makes you happy,

9
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,690
go ahead.

10
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,070
Besides, I've been away from Never Forget Studio for too long.

11
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,800
I've almost lost my abilities.

12
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,509
Hitting you would be futile anyway.

13
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,650
These few days,

14
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,110
just stay here.

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,590
No,

16
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,760
there's not much time left.

17
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,610
I must get the fragments as soon as possible.

18
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,730
After I finish today's business,

19
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,430
I'll go with you.

20
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,200
I'll accompany you.

21
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,990
No need.

22
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,210
Just wait for me at home.

23
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,950
It's you?

24
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,120
You are the the Lamp Quencher?

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,000
Let go of me.

26
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,190
Last time at the Never Forget Studio,

27
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,550
don't tell me that was your first kiss.

28
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,030
I built that bridge.

29
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,810
It's named after the chairman of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce,

30
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,100
Shen Changzhang.

31
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,630
Thank you.

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,240
Step aside! Watch out for the rickshaw!

33
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,690
-Go!
-Behave yourself!

34
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,420
Is your hand alright?

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,220
It's fine now.

36
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,680
If on the wedding night,

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,480
this Never Forget Lamp is lit,

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,829
the couple will stay together

39
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,270
and never forget each other.

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,710
That was our past life.

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,490
Past life?

42
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,430
Shen Anren has been in frequent contact with Mr. Qian.

43
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,329
These recent dangerous situations for you

44
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,930
must be related to these two.

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,670
Governor.

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,550
Governor.

47
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,460
So Mr. Qian

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,520
indeed has a reason to kill me now.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
They haven't succeeded yet,

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,970
but they will surely try again.

51
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,670
Governor,

52
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,890
please be careful when you're alone.

53
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,790
Governor,

54
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,390
someone from the mansion just reported

55
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,720
that Ms. Qin is missing.

56
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,920
She left a note

57
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,140
inviting you to meet her in the suburbs.

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,330
This must be a trap.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,690
Governor, you can't go.

60
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,400
Besides, I've been away from Never Forget Studio for too long.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,130
I've almost lost my abilities.

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,240
Help me with something.

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,780
Governor,

64
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,950
all the ambushes around have been cleared.

65
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,650
Have you found Qin Siyuan?

66
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,340
No.

67
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,100
Then let's split up and search.

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,570
Yes.

69
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,720
Let's go.

70
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,440
Let's go.

71
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,510
Qin Siyuan.

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
You're awake.

73
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,330
Who are you?

74
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,660
You... you've lost your memory?

75
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,670
Who am I?

76
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,150
Who are you?

77
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,080
Why am I here?

78
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,060
You are Li Azheng.

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
My name is Qin Siyuan.

80
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,880
Three days ago,

81
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,710
you accidentally fell off a cliff

82
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,830
and have been unconscious since then.

83
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,700
Based on the current situation,

84
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,100
it seems you have lost your memory.

85
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,110
Lost my memory?

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,530
Then what

87
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,640
is our relationship?

88
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,900
Friends?

89
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,150
Family?

90
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,090
Lovers?

91
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,970
Spouses.

92
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,690
We are husband and wife.

93
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,410
Being married

94
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,110
should make it easier to find the Extinguishing Lampshade later.

95
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,260
If we're married,

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,940
why did she hesitate just now?

97
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,950
Honey,

98
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,390
thank you for your hard work these past few days.

99
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,220
Something's not right.

100
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,620
Something's very wrong.

101
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,620
In order to save him

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,120
after he fell from the cliff,

103
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,490
I've been severely weakened.

104
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,950
I need to rest and recover.

105
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,070
I need to recover first before going to the Zhao's Mansion to retrieve the fragments later.

106
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,530
I can't let him notice anything suspicious.

107
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,580
Since we're married,

108
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,670
can't I hug you?

109
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,470
It's not that.

110
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,230
It was all of a sudden.

111
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,030
You scared me.

112
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,190
I'm still brewing medicine.

113
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,320
Let me go check on it.

114
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,659
Take a rest.

115
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,590
Fortunately, we made preparations in advance

116
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,820
and pinned all the blame on Mr. Qian.

117
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,030
However,

118
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,870
Lin Ze took Mr. Qian away

119
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,100
on charges of murdering the Governor.

120
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,510
All his property has been confiscated.

121
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,950
And it conveniently resolved the military pay crisis.

122
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,110
Shen Zheng fell off the cliff.

123
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,030
He must be dead.

124
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,950
Even if the crisis is resolved,

125
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,870
it's useless.

126
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,670
That's right, Young Master.

127
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,870
With Shen Zheng dead,

128
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,830
you've become the head of the Shen family.

129
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,429
The position of the Chamber of Commerce chairman is within reach.

130
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,690
What about Qin Siyuan?

131
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,350
Any news of her whereabouts?

132
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,270
Not yet.

133
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,309
Find her alive

134
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,270
or find her body.

135
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,090
We must find Qin Siyuan.

136
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,980
Yes, sir.

137
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,030
Go ahead and take your bath.

138
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,260
Call me if you need anything.

139
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,870
Wait.

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,990
Help me with it.

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,050
As husband and wife,

142
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,320
isn't that allowed?

143
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,310
Of course, it's allowed between husband and wife.

144
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,950
What are you trying to do?

145
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,910
We're married,

146
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,040
so of course we should sleep together.

147
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,470
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

148
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,960
I toss and turn a lot in my sleep.

149
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,690
I'm afraid I might disturb you.

150
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,390
What's wrong?

151
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,770
Are you afraid of disturbing me,

152
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,210
or are you afraid of what I might do to you?

153
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,840
You are my husband.

154
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,510
What would I be afraid of you?
