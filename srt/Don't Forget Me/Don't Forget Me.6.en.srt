(Episode 6)

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,310
To hold on is to lose.

4
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,710
To remember is in vain.

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,950
To hold on is to lose.

6
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,590
To remember is in vain.

7
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,630
To hold on is to lose.

8
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,890
To remember is in vain.

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,860
(Shen Changzhang, Chairman of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce)

10
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,460
So 13 days ago,

11
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,890
the person who broke into Never Forget Studio

12
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,090
was Shen Changzhang.

13
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,950
I didn't see clearly who it was at that time.

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,750
I thought someone wanted to break in,

15
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,880
so I stopped him.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,230
But I already showed mercy.

17
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,740
How come he died?

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,100
Because he was already sick.

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,280
He couldn't withstand your attack at all.

20
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,200
Sorry.

21
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,460
I didn't do that intentionally.

22
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,860
I didn't know it would...

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,000
Sorry?

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,870
Sorry?

25
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,370
You think saying sorry is enough?

26
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,509
Why was it you?

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,620
Why must it be you?

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,759
Do you know what my father

29
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,030
means to me?

30
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,420
Shen Zheng,

31
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,160
you can't kill me.

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,009
Shen Zheng, you're overwhelmed by anger.

33
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,270
Take care of yourself.

34
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,770
Help!

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,380
-Help!
-Stop!

36
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,250
Help!

37
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,060
Play with us for a while!

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,610
Let me go!

39
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,990
You can't escape now.

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:33,710
Let me go!

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,030
Help!

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,540
Stop!

43
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,340
Let me go!

44
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,400
Are you alright?

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I am Helian Wangu.

46
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,530
Miss, may I know your name?

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,070
Qin Siyuan.

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
There's a custom in my hometown.

49
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,920
If the Never Forget Lamp

50
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,560
is lit on the wedding night,

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,240
the couple can be together forever

52
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,100
and will never forget each other.

53
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,110
When I return in triumph,

54
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,410
will you light it with me?

157

159
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,780
It must be that in the previous life,

160
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,830
the fragments of the Extinguishing Lampshade

161
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,430
were stained with our blood.

162
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,030
So in this life,

163
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,600
after the fragments touched our blood again,

164
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,530

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,530
I see.

166
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,650

167
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,540
there have been irreconcilable grudges

168

169
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,810

170
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,030

172
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,590

174
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,450

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,300

176
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,710

177
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,870
I can give up asking

178
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,070
why you knocked me out

179
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,630
and took that watch yesterday first.

180
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,550
But at least you should tell me

181
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,880
what exactly happened.

182
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,790
Sister,

183
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,270
I'm worried

184
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,310
considering how you are now.

185
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,100
Let go.

186
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,170
Your watch is mine now.

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Master Anren.

188
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,050
Are you alright?

189
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,890
Mr. Qian has been waiting.

190
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,200
I will

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,830
have this woman!

192
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,450
Back then, I sent those assassins

193
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,090
for you, Master Anren.

194
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,600
But they got caught.

195
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,360
This...

196
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,170
We're in the same boat now.

197
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,880
No matter what they confess,

198
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,150
I will protect you.

199
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,430
If it were someone else,

200
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,190
I wouldn't be afraid of anything.

201
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,030
But he...

202
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,710
he is the Governor of Haidu.

203
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,750
Don't worry, Mr. Qian.

204
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,450
I'm afraid

205
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,090
he can't hold that position for much longer.

206
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,790
By the way,

207
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,420
is there anything special about the watch

208
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,770
you gave me yesterday?

209
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,960
What?

210
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,780
There's nothing special about it.

211
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,000
It's just a watch.
