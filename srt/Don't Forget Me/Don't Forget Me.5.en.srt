1
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,060
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,910
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,080
Master Anren, I thought you

4
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,790
could become the head of the Shen family.

5
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,130
That's why I persuaded others

6
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,650
to strongly support you in temporarily being

7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,250
the chairman of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce.

8
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,490
But given the current situation,

9
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,830
we are in an embarrassing position.

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,350
Don't worry, Mr. Qian.

11
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,670
I'm the only one who can be the head of the Shen family.

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,240
But now, this...

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,450
Master Anren,

14
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,650
how can I accept this?

15
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,230
You just need to help me keep

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,580
those merchants in the chamber of commerce calm.

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,580
As long as I can become the chairman,

18
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,500
the promises I made to you before will still stand.

19
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,450
Come on.

20
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,550
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,070
Master Anren, you've given me such a generous gift.

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,520
If I don't return the favor,

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,750
I'd lose face, right?

24
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,520
A few days ago, I won

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,700
an excellent western watch in the gambling house.

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,520
I wanted to keep it for myself,

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,229
but now I'm giving it to you.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

29
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,190
This watch suits me perfectly.

30
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,630
You really know how to play the game.

31
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,760
When your father was the chairman,

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,770
many things were not allowed.

33
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,010
Now it's so difficult to do business.

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,180
Yes.

35
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:27,000
Some deals might not be above board,

36
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,240
but they're profitable.

37
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,230
Don't worry, Mr. Qian.

38
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,320
Now, as long as we can

39
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,030
get rid of Shen Zheng,

40
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,620
we'll be able to make a lot of money.

41
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,710
Come on.

42
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,530
Bottoms up.

43
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,800
Master, Governor Shen is here.

44
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,470
Governor Shen?

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,930
Why is he here?

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,070
Governor Shen is very busy.

47
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,750
Stop.

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,440
Why did he come at this moment?

49
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,070
Have you seen the Extinguishing Lampshade?

50
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,870
No.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,920
Governor Shen, welcome.

52
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,780
Your presence brings honor to my humble abode.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,950
I just took up my post in Haidu.

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,190
Mr. Qian, I've heard a lot

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,040
about your reputation in Haidu.

56
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,620
So I specially came today to pay my respects.

57
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,650
I'm flattered.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,880
This is a gift for you.

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,930
Thank you.

60
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,730
But now it seems

61
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,490
you're quite busy today.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,390
Not at all.

63
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,670
I usually love to dance.

64
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,320
So I invited a few friends here to have fun.

65
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,110
Right,

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,040
Master Anren came to discuss official business with me.

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
So I invited him to join us.

68
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,750
Brother, if I had known you'd come,

69
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,210
I would have come with you.

70
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,290
No need for that.

71
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,630
This is...

72
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,990
I am his...

73
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,920
Fiancée.

74
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,910
Brother, when did you get engaged?

75
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,260
Why didn't I know?

76
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
It's my business.

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,260
Do I need your permission?

78
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,870
Governor, since you are here,

79
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,920
let's dance together.

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
I'll go prepare some dishes.

81
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,680
Let's have dinner together tonight, okay?

82
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,950
Okay.

83
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,520
I'll go make preparations.

84
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,780
Please make yourself at home, Governor.

85
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,150
I sensed it was

86
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,510
in Mr. Qian's house.

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,510
How did it suddenly end up in Shen Anren's hands?

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,760
Looks like their relationship is not ordinary.

89
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,230
Let me go over there now.

90
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,560
I can't wait any longer.

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Sister.

92
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,550
Sorry.

93
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,630
It's alright.

94
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,890
Governor Shen,

95
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,910
you are so handsome.

96
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,950
Shut up.

97
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Sister,

98
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,010
are you really engaged to my brother?

99
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,030
You want to know?

100
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,390
Then you'll have to trade something for it.

101
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,190
Okay.

102
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,710
But it's not convenient to talk here.

103
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,110
Let's go somewhere else.

104
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,670
Okay.

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,270
Governor Shen.

106
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,030
You said you'd help me get the fragments.

107
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,090
But you're so close to another woman.

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,790
The place up ahead

109
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,310
is where Sister and I first met.

110
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,310
If she really is her, she'll definitely remember.

111
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,110
Sister.

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,730
You're unlucky.

113
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,260
I'm in a bad mood now.

114
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,270
Why hasn't she come back yet?

115
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,070
Governor.

116
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,880
Governor.

117
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,790
Governor?

118
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,210
Just do as you just said.

119
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes, sir.

120
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,630
By the way, what did you just say?

121
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,870
I...

122
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,750
Governor,

123
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,440
I think you're in a bad mood.

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,870
Is it because of Ms. Qin?

125
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,190
I saw everything at the banquet.

126
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,030
Governor, since you have feelings for Ms. Qin,

127
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,150
why don't you give her some flowers

128
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,270
and take the opportunity to coax her

129
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,930
and confess your love for her?

130
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,690
It's so late.

131
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,770
He hasn't even come to look for me.

132
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,600
He's not even worried about me.

133
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,510
Jerk.

134
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
Miss, are you satisfied with this lantern?

135
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,930
We have new styles too.

136
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,360
Take another look.

137
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,750
Forget it.

138
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,540
Considering you bought lanterns for me,

139
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll let it go this time.

140
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,510
Why am I doing this?

141
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,330
Oh no, he's in danger!

142
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,340
Shen Zheng, someone wants you dead.

143
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,270
Die!

144
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
Let's go!

145
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,850
What's going on?

146
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,520
Why has my power been consumed so much?

147
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,970
Are you alright?

148
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,040
The bruises on their bodies

149
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,700
were caused by you?

150
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,430
Yes.

151
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,920
How else could I save you without using that technique?

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,410
You killed my father.

153
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,130
I...
