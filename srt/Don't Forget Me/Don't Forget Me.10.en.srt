3
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,480
Honey.

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Are you going to leave me here alone?

5
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,550
Given the current situation,

6
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,430
could it be we truly are a couple?

-Get lost!
-That's right!

13
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,290
Monster, get lost!

14
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,740
Monster, get lost!

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,110
Get lost!

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,300
Get lost! You're a menace!

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,010
Get lost!

18
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:12,840
Monster!

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,120
Get lost!

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,950
Get lost!

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,070
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

22
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,310
You're a menace! Get lost!

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,070
Monster!

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,660
-Monster!
-Monster! Get lost!

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,390
How did the protective barrier break?

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,789
Could it be it doesn't work on Shen Zheng?

27
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:25,030
-Stop harming people here!
-That's right!

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,960
-Get lost!
-You monster, get lost!

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,220
-Get lost!
-All you do is harming people!

30
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,510
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,630
Are you alright?

32
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,110
You monster, get lost!

33
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,940
Get lost!

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,490
Monster! Run!

35
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,320
This is why I didn't let you go out.

36
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,110
Because I'm not an ordinary human.

37
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,170
Then how did we meet?

38
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,920
And how did we become husband and wife?

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,229
That day, you barged into Never Forget Studio.

40
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,509
I kindly took you in.

41
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,120
Gradually, we fell in love.

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,910
And then?

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,030
Then...

44
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,820
in order to save someone,

45
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,550
I exposed my identity.

46
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,260
But they consider me as a monster.

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,740
Only you chose to stay by my side.

48
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,090
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,790
You forgot me.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,790
I was worried that if I told you everything,

51
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,390
you would choose to leave me.

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,290
Are you afraid of me?

53
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,150
No.

54
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,880
Luckily, I read so many storybooks.

55
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,500
Now my acting skills

56
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,860
are truly perfect.

57
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,820
But

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,130
if I can get one thing,

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,070
I can become a normal person.

60
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,310
What's that?

61
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,720
The Extinguishing Lampshade.

62
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,290
Where is it?

63
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,250
In Zhao's Mansion.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,300
Why are we dressing like this?

65
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,470
Because of me, you had a conflict

66
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,310
with the only son of this family.

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,770
Young Master, are you alright?

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,829
Who are you? How dare you kick me!

69
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you know who my father is?

70
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,750
What are you two doing?

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,220
How dare you slack off!

72
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,380
I'll punish you!

73
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,030
Go back to work now!

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,350
Finish the work within half an hour.

75
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,010
Otherwise, get out of the mansion!

76
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,990
Hurry up and work!

77
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,430
Steward,

78
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,270
it was our fault just now.

79
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,420
This

80
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,400
is for you.

81
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,790
I still have some good stuff.

82
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,610
I want to secretly share it with you.

83
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,560
Good things?

84
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,870
Where...

85
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,450
Where are the good things?

86
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,050
So?

87
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,370
Have you sensed it?

88
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,290
Have you sensed it?

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,070
The aura of the Extinguishing Lampshade is getting stronger.

90
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,400
It should be right here.

91
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,409
You really are a monster.

92
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,120
I should have beaten you to death that day.

93
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,980
And you.

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,770
You're Haidu's Governor?

95
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,110
You're dressing like this.

96
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,570
Were you trying to fool me?

97
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,720
Young Master Zhao,

98
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,800
what do you want?

99
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,870
Of course I want to kill you

100
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,630
and leave your bodies exposed for three days

101
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,350
to regain my dignity.

102
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,520
Are you alright?

103
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,120
I'm fine.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,780
I used too much of my power before.

105
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,210
It's a bit tricky now.

106
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,080
You've got some skills.

107
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,510
But I'm afraid you can't

108
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,840
leave here alive today.

109
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,740
If any of you can catch them

110
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,490
or beat them to death,

111
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,290
I'll reward him generously!

112
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,930
Go now!

113
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,220
Siyuan.

114
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Siyuan, let's go.

115
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,140
Come on.

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,650
Search!

117
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
Find those two bastards!

118
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,540
-Yes!
-Yes!

119
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,080
There's no one else here.

120
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,840
No sign of them.

121
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,180
Could it be they've escaped from the water town?

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,130
Let's go! Go back with me

123
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,310
to report to Young Master!

124
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,830
Yes.

125
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,920
Siyuan.

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,010
Siyuan?

127
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,510
Take me to the Wish Fulfillment Hall.

128
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,640
I'll be fine after getting some sleep.

129
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,590
Don't be afraid.

130
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,130
I'll always be here

131
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,370
with you.

132
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,020
Get out.

133
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,160
Get out!

134
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,470
Azheng, what's wrong?

135
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,350
I remember now.

136
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,870
You... remember everything?

137
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,880
Why didn't you tell me?

138
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,020
Let me explain to you slowly.

139
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,900
I...

140
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,760
Thank you.

141
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,480
You risked your life to protect me.

142
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,190
But I doubted

143
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,740
that I wasn't your husband.

144
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,330
What exactly have you recalled?
