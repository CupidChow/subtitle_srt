(Episode 11)

3
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,960
You risked your life to protect me.

4
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,590
But I doubted

5
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,140
that I wasn't your husband.

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,750
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,900
What exactly have you recalled?

8
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,990
So that's what you've recalled.

9
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,550
Oh, right.

10
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,840
I also remember

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
pushing you out the door.

12
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,980
Why did I do that?

13
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,370
It seems his memory is gradually returning.

14
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,390
His birthday is approaching.

15
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,230
I should still keep the truth hidden

16
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:32,030
and get the Extinguishing Lampshade fragments as soon as possible.

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,320
That's because

18
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,670
when we got the Extinguishing Lampshade fragment,

19
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,950
we had an argument.

20
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,270
But after we got it,

21
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,710
we made up.

22
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,390
I see.

23
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,310
Thank you so much.

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,550
How's your injury?

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,870
Don't worry.

26
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,300
It's completely healed.

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,720
What about your injury?

28
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm fine.

31
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,110
Our people have spotted Shen Zheng and Ms. Qin

32
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,370
in Nanhuai Water Town.

33
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,870
Shen Zheng is actually alive

34
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,200
and he's with my sister?

35
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,370
How about this?

36
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,730
Make the arrangements.

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,910
I need to go out for a while.

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,510
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,640
What's wrong, Siyuan?

41
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,450
Siyuan.

42
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,380
Shen Zheng.

43
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,300
It's me.

44
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,440
What did you say?

45
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,470
Siyuan.

46
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,670
I love you.

47
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,710
For all eternity.

48
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,070
Shen Zheng.

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,940
I'm sorry. I love you too.

How do you feel?

52
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,320
Don't misunderstand, my dear.

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,410
I mean, how are your injuries?

54
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,890
Did I hurt your wound?

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,550
It's nothing.

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,540
I've already taken care of it.

57
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,590
But yesterday,

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,060
why were you like that?

59
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,680
It was a punishment.

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,550
Everything you're doing

61
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,740
is related to the Extinguishing Lampshade, isn't it?

62
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,540
Qin Siyuan, oh Qin Siyuan.

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Knowing there's no future,

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,240
why do you keep falling for him again and again?

65
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:13,970
Don't worry.

66
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,650
I will definitely get the Extinguishing Lampshade for you.

67
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,880
Brother?

68
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,830
Who are you?

69
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,030
I'm Anren.

Azheng.

71
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,170
Sister.

72
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,020
I've finally found you.

73
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,710
Who is he?

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,880
He

75
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,080
is a younger brother I once saved.

76
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,270
Younger brother?

77
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,700
No wonder he called me brother.

78
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,230
So he's my brother-in-law.

79
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,270
Brother-in-law?

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,260
Please, have a seat first.

81
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,210
Azheng,

82
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,560
could you go and pour some tea for me?

83
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,570
Sure.

84
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,800
He has lost his memory.

85
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,800
He lost his memory?

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,310
Yes.

87
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,570
He thinks he and I are married.

88
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,160
That's why he called you brother-in-law.

89
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,420
Let's go back to Haidu for treatment.

90
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,230
No, we can't.

91
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,350
Why not?

92
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,870
Because there are people in Haidu who want to harm him.

93
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,920
He can't go back.

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,340
The culprit has been caught.

95
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,220
It was Mr. Qian.

96
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,430
I came here

97
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,790
to take you both back.

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,080
That's still not possible.

99
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,310
He can't be subjected to stimulation.

100
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,440
We have to stay here.

101
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,980
Sister, you only have my brother in your heart.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,840
You consider everything for him.

103
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,920
Do you like him?

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,750
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,720
My hand slipped.

106
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,310
It's alright.

107
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,460
You haven't fully recovered yet.

108
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,990
You should go back and rest.

109
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,820
Alright then.

110
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,830
Anren,

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
you should go back first.

112
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,840
Brother-in-law,

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,510
goodbye.

114
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,950
Sister,

115
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,490
goodbye.

116
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,230
What's wrong with you today?

117
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,010
You seem jealous.

118
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,490
He's not really your brother, is he?

119
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,720
He really is my brother.

120
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,710
I'm a man, I can tell.

121
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,230
Stay away from him from now on.

122
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,030
Otherwise...

123
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,550
Otherwise what?

124
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,409
What are you doing?

125
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,330
Put me down.

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,110
I won't.

127
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,310
Let go.

128
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,260
I won't let go.

129
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,830
I'll hit you.

130
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,670
Go ahead.

131
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,260
Put me down.

132
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,310
Master Anren,

133
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,840
I've found out everything.

134
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,040
They offended Young Master Zhao from the Zhao's Mansion.

135
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,740
Young Master Zhao

136
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,140
from the Zhao's Mansion?

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,390
The aura of the Extinguishing Lampshade is getting stronger.

138
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,720
It should be right here.

139
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,300
Azheng.

140
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,790
Azheng.

141
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,600
Everything you've done

142
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,180
is related to the Extinguishing Lampshade?

143
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,670
Could he have gone to the Zhao's Mansion?

144
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,800
Hurry up and search.

145
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,190
Don't let them escape.

146
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,410
You go that way.

147
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,490
Yes, come with me.

148
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,150
Alright.

149
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,260
Search thoroughly.

150
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,850
Don't let them get away.

151
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,230
Yes.

152
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,680
Let's go.

153
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,830
This way, this way.

154
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,550
Finally found you.

155
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,340
Let's see where you can run now.

156
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,990
We originally planned to frame Shen Zheng,

157
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,400
but Lin Ze beat us to it.

158
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,070
He's probably already at the Never Forget Studio.

159
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,870
Useless.

160
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,040
If Master Anren finds out about this,

161
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,170
he won't let you off.

162
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,230
Get out of here now.

163
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,990
Yes.

164
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,550
Master Anren?

165
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,630
Could it be...

166
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,500
You're the one who killed our young master!

167
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,700
I've never even met him.

168
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,830
Why would I kill him?

169
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,780
You still dare to deny it?

170
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,910
That day you made an enemy of our young master.

171
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,750
Today you've come for revenge.

172
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,390
I'll kill you

173
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,040
to avenge our young master!
