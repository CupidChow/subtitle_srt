00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,010
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 21)

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,070
Siyuan,

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,910
promise me.

5
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,150
You must not make the mistake I made.

6
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,190
You can't fall in love with anyone.

7
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,430
Otherwise, they won't show any mercy.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,920
Sister.

9
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,850
I need you to promise me.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,330
I can lose everything,

11
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,830
but I can't lose you.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,290
I promise you.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,310
I promise you.

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,490
Siyuan.

15
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,480
Siyuan.

16
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,590
Siyuan, wake up.

17
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,810
Siyuan.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,259
I was wrong.

19
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,140
I shouldn't have killed Helian Wangu.

20
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,430
I shouldn't have separated you two.

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,700
Please wake up, will you?

22
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,690
Siyuan.

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,590
Siyuan, I was wrong.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,830
Siyuan.

25
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
I shouldn't have killed Helian Wangu.

26
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,900
I was wrong!

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,160
Wake up.

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,230
Will you?

29
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,910
I was wrong.

30
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,470
I shouldn't have killed Helian Wangu.

31
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,070
I shouldn't have separated you two.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,440
I was wrong. Please wake up, will you?

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,190
Siyuan, I was wrong.

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,880
I was truly wrong.

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,870
Wake up.

36
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,820
Please?

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,120
Ms. Qin has hurt you so badly.

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,230
Yet you still want to believe her?

39
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,640
If she really wanted to hurt me,

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,540
why would she avoid the vital areas?

41
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,490
She just wanted to force me to leave.

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,390
She must have been threatened by Shen Anren.

43
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,700
Even so,

44
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,850
where should we start investigating?

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
There's one place we can check.

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,870
Give it to me.

47
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,660
Sister.

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,050
What mission have you received?

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,280
It's not an important mission.

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,520
You don't need to worry.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,560
I can handle it.

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,350
Siyuan.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,880
I have to leave for a while.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,900
You must take good care of yourself.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,320
Don't worry, Sister.

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,940
You also need to take good care of yourself for me.

57
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,780
Siyuan, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,760
What I owed you in the previous life,

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,640
in this life,

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,590
I will repay you in full.

61
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,490
What do you want from me?

62
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,390
You need to take Qin Siyuan away from here quickly.

63
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,360
Why?

64
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,310
As long as she's here,

65
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,840
Shen Zheng won't fall in love with me.

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,690
What does that have to do with me?

67
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,670
Is there anything else, Miss Su?

68
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,430
You're so selfish.

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,470
You only care about yourself.

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,460
You don't care about me at all.

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,420
Miss Su,

72
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,200
if there's nothing else,

73
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,030
I'll take my leave.

74
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,180
How did you...

75
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,090
Next time, don't hide the gun in your handbag.

76
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,630
It's quite obvious.

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,190
How did you...

78
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,550
It was Shen...

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,640
Shen Anren.

80
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,670
Siyuan.

81
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,290
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,620
I shouldn't have treated you like that.

83
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,030
As your sister, I shouldn't have treated you like that.

84
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,950
Sister?

85
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,430
It's me.

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,740
Qin Sicheng.

87
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,190
I...

88
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
I shouldn't have killed the person you loved most.

89
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:33,590
All of this should have been my burden to bear.

90
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,390
Sister,

91
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,960
this journey is dangerous.

92
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,860
I'll go to the enemy city as a spy in your place.

93
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,550
You've always protected me before.

94
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,590
This time,

95
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:51,830
it's my turn to protect you.

96
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,750
You really are...

97
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,510
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,890
I couldn't protect you well.

99
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,590
Wait for me a moment.

100
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,750
No need.

101
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,990
It's alright.

102
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,870
I'll take you to see a doctor.

103
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,470
Let's go.

104
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,030
No need.

105
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,270
Siyuan,

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,740
are you still willing

107
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,090
to call me Sister again?

108
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,990
I am willing.

109
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,860
I am willing.

110
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,050
Sister.

111
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,710
Sister.

112
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,470
Sister!

113
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,630
Sister!

114
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,830
Sister!

115
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,600
I called you.

116
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,260
Sister!

117
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
Sister!

118
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,790
I called you.

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,330
Please respond, will you?

120
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,260
Sister.

121
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,590
Sister.

122
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,230
Sister.

123
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,870
Sister.

124
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,170
I'm going to kill you!

125
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,750
With how Su Li'er treated you before,

126
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,470
isn't it better that she's dead?

127
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm going to kill you.

128
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,510
On our wedding night,

129
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,190
you said the same thing to me.

130
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,310
Now there's no need to wait for you to act.

131
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,460
I'll do it for you.

132
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,680
What do you mean?

133
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,110
Since you don't love me,

134
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,740
let's die together then.

135
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,580
Shen Anren,

136
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,590
I really regret saving you.

137
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,920
I know the person you love is Shen Zheng.

138
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
I've already sent someone to invite him.

139
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,750
Soon,

140
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,190
I'll let you see

141
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,100
how he dies in front of you.

142
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:28,590
Siyuan.

143
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,880
What are you doing here?

144
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,070
I don't need you to save me.

145
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,320
Don't be afraid.

146
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,210
I'm here.

147
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,870
Shen Anren.

148
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,790
What exactly do you want?

149
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,120
Isn't it time for you to return

150
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,050
the position of the Shen family's head to me?
