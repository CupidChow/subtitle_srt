1
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,120
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 7)

3
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,000
Find the Lamp Quencher,

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,190
and everything will end.

5
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,010
Where is he?

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,500
I'll go find him right now.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,300
When the Lamp Quencher appears,

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,380
the Never Forget Lamp may change color,

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,240
and a red glow may appear in an instant.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,400
Then tell me,

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,390
is it a man or a woman?

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,320
How old are they?

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,680
I need some direction.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,080
I can't just sit and wait.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,950
In every lifetime,

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,170
the Lamp Quencher dies at 25 years old.

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,650
When the lamp goes out, he appears.

18
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,510
When the lamp shines, you appear.

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,090
The fragments.

20
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,830
Now, it's less than two months

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,950
until Shen Zheng's 25th birthday.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,510
I must find all the fragments.

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,390
He can't die.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,110
Ms. Qin accidentally killed Master Shen?

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,070
I'll go arrest her right away.

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't touch her.

27
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,950
If you can't do it,

28
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,310
I will.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,470
I said,

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,140
don't touch her.

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,920
The truth behind my father's death is still unclear.

32
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,610
Go investigate for me.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,870
Why was my father

34
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,910
in Nanhuai Water Town at that time?

35
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,980
And why did he suddenly rush into the Never Forget Studio?

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,510
This might have something to do with Mr. Qian.

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,290
Do you remember that you asked me

38
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,490
to investigate why Uncle Shen

39
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,810
insisted on meeting

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,450
Mr. Qian at that restaurant?

41
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,450
I learned from the old butler that

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,070
since your father fell ill,

43
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,390
he's been constantly thinking about you.

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,829
But due to the war at that time,

45
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,910
your father couldn't enter Rongcheng.

46
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,640
Coincidentally, Mr. Qian had some connections,

47
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,930
so your father entrusted him with a task.

48
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,240
So you're saying

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,770
Mr. Qian knows my father's whereabouts?

50
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:45,880
Also,

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,680
the group we caught last night

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,170
did reveal one person,

53
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,390
but by the time we arrived,

54
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,050
that person was already dead.

55
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,240
I followed up on this person

56
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,000
and found out they were connected to Mr. Qian.

57
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,320
I just don't understand

58
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,300
why Mr. Qian would target you and your father.

59
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,230
Go investigate for me

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,080
who has been closest to Mr. Qian recently.

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,420
Focus on Shen Anren.

62
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,980
Yes, sir.

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,750
Oh, right.

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,330
There's one more thing I need to report to you.

65
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,440
I discovered that a sum of military pay that should have been deposited

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
has disappeared.

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,370
Bring the person in charge here.

68
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,970
Actually,

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,750
all these years, the military pay

70
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,990
has always been managed secretly

71
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,720
by Uncle Shen when he was alive.

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,380
That's why you were able to...

73
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,230
Uncle Shen didn't want me to tell you.

74
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,140
He said you still resented him

75
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,920
and he didn't want you to worry.

76
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,000
Governor,

77
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,090
please don't be too upset.

78
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,550
What we should be more concerned about now is

79
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,600
whether we can make up for this missing military pay.

80
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,470
I'm worried that

81
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,880
this might affect your position as Governor.

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,480
There are some merchants in Haidu,

83
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,710
who made quite a fortune from the national crisis.

84
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,990
Go tell them

85
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,180
the new master of the Shen's Mansion

86
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,780
is hosting a family banquet.

87
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,790
These people

88
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,770
are rolling in money.

89
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,670
They should cough up some of it.

90
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,520
Wait.

91
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,830
Help me throw away that pot of flowers.

92
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,870
Come with me.

93
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,470
I have a lead on the fragments.

94
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,120
It's at the Zhao's Mansion in Nanhuai Water Town.

95
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,730
Let's go.

96
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,250
Come on!

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,260
What exactly are you trying to do?

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,380
I know you're angry right now,

99
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,190
but if we don't get the fragments and extinguish the lamp,

100
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,220
you'll die.

101
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,250
To get the fragments,

102
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,170
you'd even tell such a lie?

103
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,990
I'm not lying.

104
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,120
You really will die.

105
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,870
Here, I'm returning this to you.

106
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,560
Now do you believe my sincerity?

107
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,790
Will you come with me now?

108
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,270
This was mine to begin with.

109
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,430
What do you want me to do

110
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,690
for you to come with me?

111
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,060
Whatever you say,

112
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,530
I can definitely do it.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,170
Then be my servant

114
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,270
until I'm satisfied.

115
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,340
Alright.

116
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,440
I'll do it.

117
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,710
What do you want me to do?

118
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,830
Assist me with bathing and changing clothes.

119
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,550
Alright, go ahead and take your bath.

120
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,350
Wait.

121
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,380
What?

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
You don't want to?

123
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,580
I do.

124
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,800
How could I not be willing?

125
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,590
I don't like your expression right now.

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,350
Do you like it better now?

127
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,420
You can do the rest yourself.

128
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,700
I told you to clean the room,

129
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,230
not to break things.

130
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,890
I don't usually do housework,

131
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,310
so it's natural to make mistakes when I'm not experienced.

132
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,510
You dare to talk back?

133
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,290
That's another half hour of punishment.

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,790
Sister,

135
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,909
why are you carrying this on your head?

136
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,040
Put it down quickly.

137
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,600
It's none of your business.

138
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,830
Did my brother make you do this?

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,830
He's gone too far.

140
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,890
I'll go talk to him.

141
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,670
Come back.

142
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,130
I've already told you,

143
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,370
I'm not your sister.

144
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,920
Why treat me so well?

145
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,030
Whether you're my sister or not,

146
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,790
I still want to be good to you.

147
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,950
Even if I killed Shen Changzhang,

148
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,430
would you still be good to me?

149
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
W-What?

150
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,590
Why did you kill him?

151
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,770
It was an accident, of course.

152
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,140
I need some time to accept this,

153
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,480
but I won't hate you.

154
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,460
Is it because I look like

155
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,480
your sister?

156
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,530
Is your sister

157
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,890
that important to you?

158
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,720
Of course.

159
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,250
She's very important.

160
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,790
If it weren't for her,

161
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,490
I would have died long ago.

162
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,760
I was so rude to you before.

164
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,200
I never expected

165
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,420
you would be so loyal.

166
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,350
It's alright.

167
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:35,929
By the way,

168
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,830
are you and he really engaged?

169
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,350
No, we're not.

170
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,320
Then why are you with him?

171
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,410
It's complicated.

172
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,130
I need something from him.

173
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,950
Let's talk about you instead.

174
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,060
You seem so gentle.

175
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,420
How did you provoke him?

176
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,910
I was adopted by my father.

177
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,350
My brother thinks I've taken away

178
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,850
some of our father's love for him.

179
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,520
So,

180
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,070
he's always disliked me.

181
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,430
Run slower!

182
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,940
(Young Shen Zheng)

183
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,080
Let me wipe that for you.

184
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,480
This banquet is very important.

185
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,160
Everything must be arranged perfectly.

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,670
There can't be any mistakes.

187
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,730
Do you understand?

188
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,720
Don't worry, sir.

189
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,110
