1
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,000
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,980
(Episode 16)

3
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,130
I won't let you escape either.

4
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:53,980
Shen Zheng.

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,190
Shen Zheng!

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,270
(General ledger)

7
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,880
Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

8
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,539
I failed to protect the Governor properly.

9
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,860
If it hadn't been the other side that exploded,

10
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,460
I...

11
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,960
I really deserve to die.

12
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,300
Where is Qin Siyuan?

13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,830
Qin Siyuan, Qin Siyuan.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,020
Is Qin Siyuan all you can think about?

15
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,210
I've been taking care of you these past few days.

16
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,830
Lin Ze.

17
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,539
Where is Qin Siyuan?

18
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,260
Tell me!

19
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,320
In Master Anren's courtyard.

20
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,410
Governor.

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,820
Qin Siyuan.

22
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,670
Qin Siyuan.

23
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,800
Qin Siyuan!

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,450
Siyuan.

25
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,110
Thank goodness you're still here.

26
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,500
I told you, whether you have me in your heart or not,

27
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,150
I won't let you go.

28
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,990
Come home with me.

29
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,780
Who are you?

30
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,990
Siyuan.

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Anren.

32
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,810
What have you done to her?

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,430
She's lost her memory.

34
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,910
I just told her the truth.

35
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,910
Who is he?

36
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,850
His name is Shen Zheng.

37
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:22,950
He's a bad person.

38
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,380
You say I'm a bad person?

39
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:28,960
Didn't you once make her your servant?

40
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,870
Didn't you ignore her

41
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,579
and made her kneel in the courtyard for two whole days,

42
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,870
and even let her get soaked in the rain.

43
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,510
Wasn't it because of you that she entered the fire and lost her memory?

44
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,390
Just tell me,

45
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,870
which of these isn't true?

46
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,320
Come with me.

47
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,760
I won't go with you.

48
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,750
You just admitted to everything.

49
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,880
How could I possibly go with you again?

50
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:48,950
I admit it.

51
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,870
I did do those things.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
But I can explain.

53
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,829
But he has ill intentions.

54
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:56,960
You can't stay here.

55
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,950
I have ill intentions?

56
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,130
Have I ever done anything to harm Siyuan?

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,370
Maybe I've forgotten you,

58
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,040
but right now I know who's good to me.

59
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,500
Anren treats me very well.

60
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,350
I trust him.

61
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,730
I don't trust you.

62
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,660
Let me tell you.

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,230
I will definitely expose your true colors.

64
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,430
We'll see about that.

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,630
Oh, right.

66
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,390
Do you remember this?

67
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,790
You said

68
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,760
this was a special mark just for me.

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
I don't remember.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,830
Why was he so cruel to me before?

71
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,430
Because he took a liking to you.

72
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,260
You were unwilling to be with him,

73
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,460
so he threatened you,

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
forcing you to depend on him.

75
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,590
What a vicious mind.

76
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,310
I originally wanted to wait until your injuries healed a bit

77
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,640
before taking you away.

78
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,800
But now,

79
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,640
he certainly won't let this go.

80
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,830
Are you willing to come with me?

81
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,100
Why...

82
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,660
Are you so kind to me?

83
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,050
Because I promised

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,290
that you are the most important person to me.

85
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,250
Even though I don't remember you yet,

86
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,490
at this moment,

87
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,930
whoever is kind to me,

88
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,710
I will be kind to them in return.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Just because of a woman,

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,790
you want to give up everything?

91
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,230
Don't we still have a chance

92
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,300
to fight for it?

93
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I miss you so much.

94
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,270
Without her,

95
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,020
what's the point of fighting to the death?

96
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,450
I'd rather

97
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,200
spend a peaceful life with her.

98
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,710
What about that lamp?

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
Don't worry. It's in the box.

100
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,360
What is

101
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,990
the true meaning of this lamp?

102
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,790
I don't know.

103
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,670
I just feel it's very important.

104
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,490
What are you doing?

105
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,870
Shen Anren is suspected of embezzling military pay

106
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,510
and murdering

107
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,460
the former chairman of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce, Shen Changzhang.

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,260
Take him away.

109
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,230
On what grounds?

110
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,490
Where's the evidence?

111
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,420
This is the account book I risked my life

112
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,600
to obtain from the Haidu Chamber of Commerce.

113
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,950
It records in detail

114
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,030
all the tricks you've played

115
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,730
to embezzle military pay.

116
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,830
Shen Anren,

117
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,490
do you want me to explain it to you point by point?

118
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,390
I don't know about this.

119
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,590
This can't be his.

120
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:00,390
Take him away.

121
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,990
Yes, sir.

122
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,590
Move!

123
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,190
Let him go!

124
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,830
What are you doing?

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,590
Let him go!

126
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,190
Siyuan!

127
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,670
Anren!

128
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,750
Let go of me!

129
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,210
It hurts!

130
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,450
Why do you have injuries on your body?

131
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,130
Shameless!

132
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,230
You're truly as Anren said,

133
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,360
utterly shameless!

134
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,800
What are you doing? Let go of me!

135
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,420
Let go!

136
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
I see your wound is bleeding.

137
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,330
Let me apply some medicine for you.

138
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,090
Get out!

139
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,870
Get lost!

140
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,870
Your back is injured too.

141
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,909
It's none of your business!

142
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,310
Are you going to leave or not?

143
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,310
Think carefully.

144
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,200
Each time you delay applying the medicine for 15 minutes,

145
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,930
Shen Anren will be beaten once.

146
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,710
Let's see which one of you can hold out longer.

147
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,570
How about that?

148
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,350
You're truly shameless.

149
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I'll do it myself.

150
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,720
Let me help you apply the medicine.

151
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,720
Give it to me.

152
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,150
Do you remember

153
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,280
that you have a lamp?

154
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,330
How do you know?

155
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,610
Where is it?

156
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,200
I don't know.

157
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,030
If you don't apply the medicine now,

158
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,870
then get out.

159
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,040
Does it hurt?

160
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,110
No, it doesn't.

161
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,090
Don't move.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,640
Governor,

163
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,970
is this lamp

164
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,680
the one you're looking for?

165
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,000
How's it going with Shen Anren?

166
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,360
He's still being stubborn.

167
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,970
Increase the pressure.

168
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:24,500
Yes.

169
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,240
Why is the lamp still lit

170
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,710
after trimming the wick?
