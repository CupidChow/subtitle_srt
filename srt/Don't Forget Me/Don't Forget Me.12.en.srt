00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,010
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,980
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,430
How dare you still deny it?

4
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,590
You started a feud with our Young Master that day.

5
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,590
Today, you're here to seek revenge.

6
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,560
I'll kill you

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,870
to take avenge for our Young Master!

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,440
Everyone, stop right now!

9
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,310
Governor.

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,880
I've finally found you.

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,230
Governor.

12
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,590
You're the Governor?

13
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,100
How dare you!

14
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,180
How dare you beat the Governor of Haidu up?

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,180
But he killed our Young Master.

16
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,260
If you keep slandering him,

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,039
be careful as I might kill you!

18
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,720
Governor, let's go.

19
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,030
Let's go.

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,080
Governor.

21
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,200
You're saying that I'm the Governor of Haidu?

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,190
But my name is Li Azheng.

23
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,370
Have you mistaken me for someone else?

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,550
Your name is Shen Zheng actually.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,350
How could I possibly mistake you for someone else?

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,300
Have... Have you lost your memories?

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,080
Did Qin Siyuan do something to you?

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,910
You know my wife?

29
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:40,890
Wife?

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,590
Qin Siyuan can't possibly be your wife.

31
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,060
Why?

32
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,310
Because she killed your father.

33
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,640
That's impossible.

34
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,620
Governor.

35
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,259
Have you forgotten the scar on your father's chest?

36
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,580
Don't be fooled by her.

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,200
She...

38
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,360
That's impossible.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,940
I trust my wife.

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,030
Governor.

41
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,800
Don't follow me.

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,640
Governor!

43
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:28,910
Sister.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,530
Where have you been?

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,370
I've been looking for you for a long time.

46
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
Why did you frame Shen Zheng?

47
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
Sister.

48
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,380
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,090
You still want to pretend?

50
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,070
I did all these things

51
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,600
just for your sake, Sister.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,700
Don't use me as an excuse.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,670
He bullied and humiliated you so badly before.

54
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,200
If he regains his memories,

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,090
how could I

56
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,730
just stand by and watch him treat you like that?

57
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,180
What's between him and me

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,230
is none of your business.

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,110
Because I like you.

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,870
I've liked you for ten whole years.

61
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,079
How can you expect me to watch you being bullied?

62
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,079
Don't do this again.

63
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,260
If you dare to hurt him again,

64
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,840
I won't let you off easily.

65
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,810
What's so good about him?

66
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,210
Why are you protecting him like this?

67
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,910
Is it because you want something from him?

68
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,470
So you're even willing to pretend to be his wife

69
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,130
and betray your own feelings?

70
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,910
Sister.

71
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,390
What exactly do you want?

72
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,190
I'll help you.

73
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
I've told you that

74
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,850
you're not able to help me.

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
You killed my father.

76
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,110
Siyuan.

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,840
The city gate has been breached. Come with me!

78
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,070
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

79
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,920
You like hugging and cuddling others.

80
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,580
How come I didn't realize that

81
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,390
you actually like those things?

82
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,280
What's wrong with you?

83
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,710
Are you hurt?

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Let me take a look.

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,570
The fragment.

86
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,980
Are you crazy?

87
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,670
Why did you get it yourself?

88
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,580
Are you hiding something from me?

89
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,010
Let me check your wound first.

90
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,070
Have you been lying to me or not?

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,490
Yes or no?

92
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,840
Let me check your wound.

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,000
Just now, someone told me that

94
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,659
my name is Shen Zheng.

95
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,520
He said it was you

96
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,230
who killed my father.

97
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,780
I didn't believe it.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,960
When I came back just now,

99
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,610
I overheard you telling Shen Anren that

100
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,430
we're not husband and wife.

101
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,990
You're with me

102
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,750
because you want something from me.

103
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,290
I still didn't believe it.

104
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,710
Just tell me now

105
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,200
whether I should believe it or not.

106
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,480
Just tell me now

107
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,720
whether our relationship

108
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,150
has been real or not

109
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,280
from beginning to end.

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,920
As long as you say it,

111
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll believe it.

112
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,050
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
Why?

114
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,230
Why did you lie to me?

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,659
Why?

116
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,110
Why did you lie to me?

117
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,630
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,430
You're sorry?

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,700
You think saying sorry is enough?

120
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,350
For the sake of the fragment,

121
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,680
you're willing to sacrifice everything.

122
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,050
If you want it so badly,

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
no problem.

124
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,140
Try to be nice to me now.

125
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,860
Then I'll give it to you.

126
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,230
What's wrong?

127
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,380
Shen Zheng.

128
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,670
Don't you understand?

129
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,740
Shen Zheng, forgive me.

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,060
I have to do this for the fragment.

131
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,260
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫
You are the the Lamp Quencher.

186
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,290
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

187
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,290
Let go of me!
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

188
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,510
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

189
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,680
In every lifetime,
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

190
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:16,700
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

191
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,350
the Lamp Quencher dies at 25 years old.
♫The wind blows gently, leaving no trace♫

192
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,670
the Lamp Quencher dies at 25 years old.

193
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:18,990
♫Birds disappear in the clouds♫

194
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,420
When the lamp goes out, he'll appear.
♫Birds disappear in the clouds♫

195
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,480
When the lamp shines, you'll appear.
♫Birds disappear in the clouds♫

196
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,340
♫The night deepens, and the stars slowly rise♫

197
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,220
Why?
♫The night deepens, and the stars slowly rise♫

198
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,730
♫The night deepens, and the stars slowly rise♫

199
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,690
♫I walk alone down a quiet, long street♫

200
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,980
Why am I punished like this?
♫I walk alone down a quiet, long street♫

201
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,510
♫I walk alone down a quiet, long street♫

202
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,430
♫I didn't hear the moon's secrets♫

203
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:37,910
♫Time slips like water through my fingers♫

204
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,390
Why?
♫Time slips like water through my fingers♫

205
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,450
♫If we meet again in a dream, will we remember?♫

206
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,400
♫Footsteps have gone far away♫

207
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,270
♫Parting is inevitable♫

208
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,000
Why am I punished like this?
♫Parting is inevitable♫

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,050
Why am I punished like this?

210
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,910
♫Why go back to the past?♫
Why am I punished like this?

211
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,580
♫Why go back to the past?♫

212
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,150
♫A meteor streaks across the sky, illuminating the boundless sky♫

213
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,950
♫Watching over your dreams day and night♫

214
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,170
♫There's no sorrow or joy♫

215
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,070
♫As the seasons shift, the world changes♫

216
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,830
♫Blown away by the wind, returning to dust♫

217
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,080
♫Memories fade away silently♫

218
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,180
♫The morning light spreads across the land again♫

219
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,720
♫The four seasons come and go♫

220
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,150
♫A soft breeze brushes past my ears♫

221
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,470
♫Memories fade away♫

222
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,040
