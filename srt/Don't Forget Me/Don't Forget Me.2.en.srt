Let go.

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,170
Let go of me.

5
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,640
Let go!

6
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,270
No need to look.

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,350
Your wounds have healed.

8
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,960
You treated my wounds?

9
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,180
Thank me.

10
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,760
What is this?

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,300
Of course it's a symbol of being my man.

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,470
Don't waste your energy.

13
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,600
You can't remove it.

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,490
I told you not to waste your energy.

15
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,190
Come on.

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,020
Take off your clothes.

17
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,130
Don't even think about it.

18
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,670
I like obedient people.

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,180
Do it yourself,

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,039
or should I do it?

21
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,260
A man may be killed, but not humiliated.

22
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,770
What do you think I want to do?

23
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,410
I've always been a tidy woman.

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,010
If you want to be my man,

25
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,710
you should be clean.

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,200
Go.

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,450
When can you find a way to extinguish the lamp?

28
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,840
I don't know.

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,470
Anyway,

30
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,510
you can't leave

31
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,510
until the lamp is extinguished.

32
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,430
I can stay.

33
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,990
But I need freedom.

34
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,350
What kind of freedom?

35
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,960
Today is the Lantern Festival.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,960
I want to go out for a walk.

37
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,460
I think

38
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,910
you want to escape.

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,550
What?

40
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,430
You don't think you can make me stay?

41
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,110
The provocation strategy

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,790
doesn't work on me.

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,310
If you still won't take a shower,

44
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,020
I can help you.

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,890
Why don't we die together?

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
I already died once anyway.

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,270
It was not easy to save your life.

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,100
Are you willing to give it up?

49
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,510
Living without freedom

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,100
is worse than being dead.

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,200
Besides,

52
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,630
if you kill me,

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,640
extinguishing the lamp...

54
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,870
I can agree to that.

55
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,870
But I must go with you.

56
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,350
And

57
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,710
we'll return whenever I say so.

58
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,910
Okay.

59
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,810
Why are you still standing there?

60
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,890
Hurry up and take a shower.

61
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,640
Come to work after you're done.

Good boy.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,780
That's more like it.

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,530
Go.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,620
Start working.

67
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,970
You actually need to sell lamps?

68
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,820
Of course.

69
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,310
I need to make money to eat.

70
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,430
Eat?

71
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,630
You actually need to eat?

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,630
You're nagging.

73
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,280
Do you still want to go out for a walk or not?

74
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,180
Thank you.

75
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,300
The style is great.

85

are you alright?

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,810
Does it hurt?

87
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
No.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,950
Look at you.

89
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,670
You were so careless.

90
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,670
I didn't expect you

91
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,930
to be so kind-hearted.

92
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,770
Don't think I'll let you go just because

93
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,170
you said something nice.

94
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,420
You can't escape.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,670
Releasing lotus lanterns is a custom on the Hungry Ghost Festival.

96
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,570
Why are there lotus lanterns today?

97
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,030
Because they're for mourning a good person.

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,430
Today is the seventh day after his death.

99
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,910
This good person was truly remarkable.

100
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,910
So many people are here to mourn him.

101
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,320
The Changzhang Bridge?

102
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
Why is it called that?

103
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,150
It's named after the chairman of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce:

104
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,420
Shen Changzhang.

105
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,110
What...

106
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,390
What did he do?

107
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,770
Back then, his son ran away from home.

108
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,590
So he went to look for him.

109
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,120
He passed through Nanhuai Water Town

110
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,710
and happened to encounter a heavy rainstorm.

111
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,710
He was stranded here and joined the locals in emergency rescue efforts.

112
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,790
Afterwards, he even donated money

113
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,990
to repair the water conservancy facilities and the bridge.

114
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,320
From then on, people no longer needed to worry about floods.

115
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,030
Was that bridge

116
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,030
built by him too?

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,280
I built that bridge.

118
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,370
His kindness was like the spring breeze,

119
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,760
melting snow into rain.

120
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:40,330
He should be remembered forever.

121
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,950
Thank you.

122
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,630
What?

123
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,070
Nothing.

124
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Let's make a wish.

125
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,309
I told you

126
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,010
that you can't escape.

127
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,830
Ms. Qin,

128
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,630
we meet again.

129
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,580
Get out of my way.

130
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,690
How dare you push me!

131
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,650
Take her down!

132
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,950
Where are you going, Ms. Qin?

133
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,050
I'm afraid Ms. Qin from Never Forget Studio

134
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,290
is a monster.

135
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,490
Her eyes are red like a monster's.

136
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,620
She's lying motionless on the ground.

137
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,860
There are also many wounds on her body.

138
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,770
And she has lost a considerable amount of blood.

139
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,770
I bought this lantern from her shop.

140
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,250
What bad luck!

141
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,050
My lantern!

142
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,220
Let's go.

143
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,610
Others are afraid of you,

144
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,610
but I'm not.

145
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,740
Arrest her.

146
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,590
Seriously?

147
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,130
So many people are watching me.

148
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,990
Are you trying to make me lose face?

149
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,650
Arrest her!

150
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,630
You're so useless!

151
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,520
You still dare to scare people?

152
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,850
Young Master, are you alright?

153
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,680
Who the hell are you?

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,810
How dare you kick me!

155
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,510
Do you know who my father is?

156
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,090
Go back and tell your father

157
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm Shen Zheng, Governor of Haidu.

158
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,870
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

159
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,380
Don't go.

160
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,150
The moon is veiled by dark clouds.

161
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,970
I feel great pain.

162
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,070
But why does the pain gradually fade

163
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,910
when I'm close to him?
