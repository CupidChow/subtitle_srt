Professor,

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,650
I'm preparing to research

5
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,030
the glass craftsmanship in intangible cultural heritage.

(Intangible Heritage - Ancient Glass)

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,870
Starting with the "Never Forget Lamp."

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,310
In ancient China,

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,430
glass was rare.

12
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,180
The ancients

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,340
also called it "the five-colored stone."

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,580
It was once valued even more than jade.

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,550
Professor,

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,240
why does this "Never Forget Lamp"

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,150
have three cracks on it?

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,300
Regarding this Never Forget Lamp,

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,950
its owner

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,580
and you

21
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,490
have some connection.

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,650
He was also named Qin Siyuan.

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,210
(Owner of Never Forget Studio - Qin Siyuan)

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,870
To hold on is to lose.

26
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,390
To remember is in vain.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,030
Obsession fades,

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,350
and fire renews.

29
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,070
It is said that everyone who enters Never Forget Studio

30
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,470
will fulfill the desire in their heart.

31
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,420
So it seems.

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,390
Thank you, Miss.

33
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,350
Your wish is fulfilled.

34
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,380
No need to linger.

35
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,550
Thank you, Miss.

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,800
This is already the 999th lamp.

37
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,390
When will the person

38
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,410
I'm waiting for finally come?

(Haidu Military Governor - Shen Zheng)

40
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,460
My uncle was attacked by an unknown assailant

41
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,660
and died from his injuries.

42
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,740
(Lieutenant - Lin Ze)
and died from his injuries.

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,490
I must return to Haidu,

44
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,190
find the killer,

45
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,160
and avenge my father.

46
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,030
Stay silent.

47
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,550
What if I don't?

48
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,400
Courting death?

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,630
That's right.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Go ahead.

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,660
You…

52
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,170
Shen Zheng,

53
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,500
you can't escape today.

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,340
If you don't want to die, come out obediently.

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,280
Shen Zheng?

56
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,730
Your name is pretty ordinary.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,720
Who would've thought

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,500
that the esteemed Haidu Governor

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,580
would now be hiding behind a woman?

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,230
Pathetic.

61
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,110
Exactly.

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,270
Truly spineless.

63
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,360
Just now you said you wanted to kill me,

64
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,340
and now you're trying to save me.

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,060
So contradictory.

66
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,370
Interesting.

67
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,770
Soon, you'll meet your father in the underworld.

68
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,350
Who do you think you are

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,810
to even mention my father?

70
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,600
Kill him!

71
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,770
What's happening?

72
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,350
What's going on?

73
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,410
Did a ghost do this?

74
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,630
No.

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,950
You've encountered me.

76
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,589
Who are you?

77
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,760
What do you want?

78
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,079
Me?

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,260
By seniority,

80
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,830
calling me your ancestor wouldn't be enough.

81
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,790
As for what I want…

82
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,680
Do you want to back off,

83
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,940
or

84
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,550
die?

85
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,020
I'll back off right now.

86
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,150
Now,

87
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,750
shall I settle the score with you?

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,500
You're the first

89
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,990
to dare point a gun at me.

90
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,350
Who exactly are you?

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,590
It's been a thousand years.

92
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,120
And every time someone asks me this question.

93
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,510
A thousand years?

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,950
I don't know

95
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,350
what trick you just used,

96
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,460
but stop pretending to be supernatural in front of me.

97
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,790
Others said the same thing.

98
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,930
But it doesn't matter.

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,410
Each time,

100
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,190
I patiently explain.

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,720
My name is Qin Siyuan,

102
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,720
and I am the owner of Never Forget Studio.

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,190
In this mortal world,

104
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,790
I only do two kinds of business.

105
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,240
During the day, I run a shop,

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,830
welcoming esteemed guests from the living,

107
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,890
and sell lanterns.

108
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
At night,

109
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,030
I welcome wandering souls from all directions,

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,290
fulfilling the last wishes of the dying,

111
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,400
helping them fulfill their unfinished desires.

112
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,030
Who would believe

113
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,700
such nonsense?

114
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,880
Do you believe me now?

115
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,870
Do you believe me or not?

116
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,750
I believe you.

117
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,060
Who am I?

118
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,600
How long must I be trapped here?

119
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,140
I've had enough.

120
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,530
Just let me die already.

121
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,950
As long as the lantern is lit, you live.

122
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,030
When the lantern goes out, you perish.

123
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,830
How could this lantern be extinguished?

124
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,340
You just want me to be immortal,

125
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,039
living forever in loneliness.

126
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,309
What sin did I commit

127
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,909
to deserve this punishment?

128
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,240
Find the Lamp Quencher,

129
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,390
and everything will end.

130
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,950
Where is he?

131
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,250
I'll go find him right now.

132
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,770
When the lamp goes out, you can be free.

133
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,530
The Never Forget Lamp may change color,

134
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,660
and a red glow may appear in an instant.

135
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,500
Don't move.

136
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,110
You woman.

137
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,480
How can you be so strong?

138
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,990
It's you?

139
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,110
You are the the Lamp Quencher.

140
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,120
Let go of me.

141
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,790
You woman,

142
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,310
have you no shame?

143
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,250
Extinguish it.

144
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,830
Do it.

145
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,230
As long as you put it out,

146
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,230
I'll let you go.

147
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,230
Really?

148
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,990
Why would I lie to you?

149
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm not afraid to fight you.

150
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,270
Go on.

151
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,990
It's out.

152
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,550
Finally, it's out.

153
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,630
Can I leave now?

154
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,270
Blow.

155
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,290
Blow.

156
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,630
Blow again.

157
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,510
You just won't let me leave, will you?

158
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,570
If you don't want me to go, just say it.

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,570
Where are you?

160
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,550
Why won't the lamp go out?

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,190
Show yourself.

162
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
Where are you?

163
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,530
Come out!

164
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,830
What is this place?

165
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,460
I have to escape.

166
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,160
Why am I back here again?

167
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,200
Don't run anymore.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,990
I've already found a way to put out the lamp.

169
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,270
You can't escape.

170
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,640
What if I insist on leaving?

171
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,750
No way.

172
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,390
You have to put out the lamp

173
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,390
before you leave.

174
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,470
What if it never goes out?

175
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,750
Then you'll stay here forever.

176
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,370
I'll look after you until the end.

177
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,850
You want to trap me for a lifetime?

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,910
Why not?

179
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,380
Unless

180
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,480
you kill me.

181
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,380
Sorry.

182
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,420
I can't die.

183
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,680
If it were that easy,

184
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,160
I'd have died long ago.

185
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,340
Not only did you point a gun at me,

186
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,870
but you even fired at me.

187
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,070
How should we

188
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,630
settle this score?

189
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,660
What exactly do you want?

190
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,240
I want you

191
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,540
to be mine.
