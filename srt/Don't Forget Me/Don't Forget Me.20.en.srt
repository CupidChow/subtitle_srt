1
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,110
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,100
(Episode 20)

3
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,230
Doctor, how is he?

4
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,030
The wound looks serious,

5
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,070
but the stab perfectly avoided the vital areas.

6
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,070
He's safe for now.

7
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,960
Then why hasn't he woken up yet?

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,590
Perhaps he's having a dream.

9
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,150
Run slowly.

10
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,230
Don't fall.

11
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,830
Be careful.

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,820
Let me play with you.

13
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:16,280
I want it too.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,190
Give it to me.

15
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,390
You already have one.

16
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,470
Let me have it.

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,710
This is mine.

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,190
They're kids.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,110
It's normal for them to tumble and fight.

20
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,240
It's all your fault.

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,680
You've taught them to be so disobedient.

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,780
Okay, it's all my fault.

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,660
My bad.

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,539
The children have grown up.

25
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,320
They'll only come back during Chinese New Year.

26
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,200
It's okay.

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
You still have me.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,930
I'll always be by your side.

29
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,820
What are you doing?

30
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,730
You want to die

31
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,550
just because of a woman.

32
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,670
Are you even a man?

33
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,570
Give it back to me!

34
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,920
Give it back to me!

35
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,190
Give it back to me!

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,520
Sister,

37
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,360
I don't want to be a spy anymore.

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,800
This war is meaningless if it continues.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,329
It'll only hurt the people.

40
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,510
I think Helian Wangu has bewitched you.

41
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,180
Guards.

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,750
Tie her up.

43
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,180
Yes.

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,530
What are you going to do?

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,230
What do you want to do?

46
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,560
What are you going to do?

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,910
Don't you hurt General Helian!

48
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,890
Qin Sicheng,

49
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,750
don't you hurt General Helian!

50
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,800
Leave!

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,030
Since you don't have the heart to do it,

52
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,110
I'll help you do it.

53
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,050
Qin Siyuan,

54
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,970
the city gate has been breached.

55
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,750
Come with me!

56
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,550
The spy in the city...

57
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,640
is you?

58
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,710
Execute him

59
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,159
and hang him on the city wall

60
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,260
as a warning.

61
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,070
Qin Siyuan!

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,050
I hate you!

63
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,510
I curse you to be immortal

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,920
with endless loneliness

65
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,830
and feel the pain I've felt!

66
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,960
Qin Siyuan,

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,480
remember!

68
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,030
This is my punishment on you.

69
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,010
Siyuan,

70
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,640
no matter how the relationship between the two cities is,

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,870
as long as they find out,

72
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,730
they'll certainly hunt you down.

73
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,990
I can't bear to see you in danger again.

74
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,470
So she...

75
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,220
has never lied to me.

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,010
Instead, she has suffered for 1,000 years

77
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,310
because of me.

78
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,470
What was that just now?

79
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,520
Why am I crying?

80
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,920
You saw it too?

81
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,580
Don't move.

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,930
So you were Siyuan's elder sister,

83
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,360
Qin Sicheng, in the previous life.

84
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,350
Previous life?

85
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,090
It was you.

86
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,270
You made me hurt the person I loved the most so deeply.

87
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,950
I always thought she killed me.

88
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,350
I was so stupid.

89
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,710
It was my fault.

90
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,890
I made her suffer for 1,000 years.

91
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,880
It was my fault.

92
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:01,810
A thousand years?

93
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,510
You mean she...

94
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
It was your fault.

95
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,980
You ruined everything.

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,410
You killed her.

97
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,670
It was your fault.

98
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,670
It was your fault!

99
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,150
I'm not Qin Sicheng.

100
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,170
I am Su Li'er.

101
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,430
I'm not Qin Sicheng.

102
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,620
I am Su Li'er.

103
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,030
I am Su Li'er.

104
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,950
I am Su Li'er.

105
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm not Qin Sicheng.

106
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,870
I am Su Li'er.

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,510
I'm not Qin Sicheng.

108
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,600
I am Su Li'er.

109
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,350
I am Su Li'er.

110
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,550
I'm not. I'm not!

111
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,340
I'm not Qin Sicheng.

112
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,770
I am Su Li'er.

113
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,270
I'm not.

114
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,070
Sister, isn't this Mr. Zhou's fan?

115
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,550
Someone's going to fall in love.

116
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,350
Keep your voice down. Give it back to me.

117
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,910
No, I'm not giving it back.

118
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,310
I'd like to see

119
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,220
whether he deserves you or not.

120
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,950
We haven't even got to first base.

121
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,150
Give it back to me now.

122
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,710
Are you giving it back or not?

123
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,200
No.

124
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,870
Are you giving it back or not?

125
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,230
No.

126
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,840
Are you giving it back or not?

127
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,280
No.

128
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,630
Give it back to me.

129
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,510
Are you giving it back or not?

130
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,110
No.

131
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,180
Go inside!

132
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,550
Faster!

133
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:51,860
Sister.

134
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,760
How are you?

135
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,110
Mr. Zhou is dead.

136
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,550
He saved me at the cost of his own life.

137
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm going to them.

138
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,290
I'm going to seek justice for you!

139
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,430
Siyuan, don't go!

140
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,390
Calm down!

141
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,850
Sister,

142
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,060
we are so loyal.

143
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,210
Why are they treating us like this?

144
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,750
Maybe since the very beginning,

145
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,400
we've been on a path of no return.

146
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,710
Siyuan,

147
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,470
promise me.

148
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,830
You must not make the mistake I made.

149
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,340
You can't fall in love with anyone.

150
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,250
Otherwise, they won't show any mercy.

151
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,540
Sister.

152
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,660
I need you to promise me.

153
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,810
I can lose everything,

154
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,390
but I can't lose you.

155
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,850
I promise you.

156
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,950
I promise you.
