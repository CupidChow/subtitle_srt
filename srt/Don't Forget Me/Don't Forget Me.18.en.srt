00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,070
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:39,030
(Episode 18)

3
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,050
It's alright now.

4
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,460
It's alright now.

5
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,830
It's alright now.

6
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,890
You're awake.

7
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,520
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,180
Just eat it now.

9
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,030
Yesterday, I not only saved you...

10
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,830
What else did you do?

11
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,560
What?

12
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,720
You kissed me yesterday.

13
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:34,690
Have you forgotten it so quickly?

14
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,900
I...

15
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,350
I don't really remember.

16
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,910
Then let me refresh your memory now.

17
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,100
Your face...

18
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,470
How is this possible?

19
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,000
Let go of me!

20
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,510
What are you doing?

21
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,810
Let's go.

22
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,940
She's a monster.

23
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,780
Currently, all the evidence points to Yu Bo.

24
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,930
I've released Shen Anren

25
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,930
and arrested Yu Bo

26
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,810
according to your instructions.

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,390
It's really so frustrating that we've let Shen Anren

28
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,650
off the hook like this.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,460
If you want to catch a big fish,

30
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,720
you have to be patient.

31
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,980
I'll get evidence against him sooner or later.

32
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,320
Since he likes to play games,

33
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,620
then I'll play the game with him.

34
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,019
Is there anything else?

35
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:20,269
When we were interrogating Yu Bo, we discovered that

36
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,070
he was the one who had drugged Uncle Shen back then,

37
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,420
which led to a relapse

38
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,620
of his old disease.

39
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,340
After he got injured,

40
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,710
he died of his injuries.

41
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,350
So,

42
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Qin Siyuan was not the murderer who killed Uncle Shen.

43
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,990
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,130
I didn't do that intentionally.

45
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,530
I didn't know it would...

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,320
You're sorry?

47
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,390
You're sorry?

48
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,960
You think saying sorry is enough?

49
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,230
Why was it you?

50
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,050
Why must it be you?

51
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,670
It turns out that I've been wrongly blaming her all this time.

52
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,360
Governor,

53
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,190
why have you been guarding this lamp today?

54
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,070
She is my life.

55
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,400
Anren!

56
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,190
Anren!

57
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,900
Anren!

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,180
Miss Su said that

59
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,870
she would find someone to beat her up badly.

60
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,600
Don't let her come back.

61
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,730
Leave through the back door.

62
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,120
Make sure that you won't be discovered.

63
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,910
Don't worry.

64
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,270
Where is Qin Siyuan?

65
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,240
What do you mean?

66
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,150
Have you let Qin Siyuan go missing?

67
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,610
How did you look after her?

68
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,550
Governor.

69
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,870
One of our subordinates said that

70
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,800
he saw Miss Su outside the mansion.

71
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,530
My Lady.

72
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,960
She's really a monster.

73
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,400
She's been beaten for so long, but she still hasn't died yet.

74
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Shen Zheng,

75
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,520
why are you here?

76
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,090
Have you regretted that...

77
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,220
Where is Qin Siyuan?

78
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,970
Why are you still looking for her?

79
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,170
She's just a monster.

80
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,710
You guys have been deceived by her.

81
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,510
Where is she?

82
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,000
You're actually pointing a gun at me for her?

83
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,870
Is there anyone else who wants to come up?

84
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,150
This person is a monster and won't die.

85
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,150
If any of you don't believe it,

86
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,260
just give it a try.

87
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,870
Shall we give it a try?

88
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,390
Let's go.

89
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,450
Let's give it a try.

90
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,070
This woman is quite pitiful.

91
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,870
That's right.

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,680
People have beaten her up so badly like that.

93
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Check this place.

94
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,310
It's my fault.

95
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,210
I'll take you back right away.

96
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,780
I'll take her to leave here.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I've told you that

98
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,260
we shouldn't

99
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,430
meet again in the future

100
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,150
to avoid causing annoyance.

101
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,670
You remember it now?

102
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,560
As a dying person,

103
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,060
I shouldn't leave him with any lingering thoughts, should I?

104
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,870
Okay.

105
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,860
You can't go with him.

106
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,150
If you dare to stop me again,

107
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,500
I'll kill you.

108
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
The wound hasn't healed yet,

109
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,480
and my abilities have disappeared, too.

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,630
But I'm not dead.

111
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Why is that?

112
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,570
Where's my lamp?

113
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,770
Where is my lamp?

114
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,570
Now you're looking at me

115
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,610
in utter disgust.

116
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,570
Can't we be the same as before?

117
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,310
Just

118
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,110
dream

119
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,750
on!

120
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,750
Since you hate me,

121
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,830
why did you want to leave with me

122
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,830
and give me hope?

123
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,950
Are you trying to use me to push Shen Zheng away?

124
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,870
Forget it.

125
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,730
None of this matters.

126
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,640
As long as you can still stay by my side,

127
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,810
I'll be content.

128
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,900
Get lost!

129
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,390
Am I really so unworthy of your affection?

130
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,120
How am I inferior to Shen Zheng?

131
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,430
You're not as good as him in every aspect.

132
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,800
As for the grudge that you lied to me,

133
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
after I get the lamp,

134
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,050
I'll get even with you properly.

135
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,110
She's a monster that can heal herself after getting injured.

136
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,440
Why are you and Shen Zheng both on her side?

137
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,470
You're the real monster.

138
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,990
If you make up stories to slander her again,

139
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll kill you!

140
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,260
Let go of me!

141
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,700
If you don't want to lose her,

142
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,140
I have a way to help you.
