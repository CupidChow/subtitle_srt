1
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,050
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 19)

3
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:44,950
Do you know

4
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,630
where Shen Anren's suitcase is?

5
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,360
I don't know.

6
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
This feeling is so familiar.

7
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,440
It's just like when my wound healed last time.

8
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,670
You...

9
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,350
This is...

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,520
How are you?

11
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,990
Has your wound healed?

12
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,050
So that's why my wound healed so quickly.

13
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,310
You've been using your own blood

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,270
to heal it.

15
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,310
It's because

16
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,690
I'm too afraid of losing you.

17
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,590
Although my abilities have completely disappeared,

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,970
I'm still immortal.

19
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,960
Our debts to each other have been settled.

20
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,360
Why do you have to make me owe you more?

21
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,400
You've never owed me anything.

22
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:34,670
I owe you this.

23
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,600
I wrongly blamed you

25
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,370
for my father's death.

26
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,560
It doesn't matter anymore.

27
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,240
Just consider it as fate playing tricks on us.

28
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,150
Some people

29
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,720
are destined not to be together.

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,670
As long as the lantern is lit, you live.

31
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,800
When the lantern goes out, you perish.

32
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,140
As long as the lantern is lit, you live.

33
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,630
When the lantern goes out, you perish.

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,930
Find the Lamp Quencher,

35
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,860
and everything will be over.

36
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,870
I've found both the Lamp Quencher and the Extinguishing Lampshade.

37
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,190
Why am I still not dead?

38
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
Tell me,

39
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,070
when will this lamp finally go out?

40
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,960
When am I going to die?

41
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,530
The Lamp Quencher

42
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,600
is 25 years old.

43
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,420
On the day before your birthday,

44
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,090
you'll die, and he'll live on.

45
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,870
Siyuan.

46
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,910
Siyuan.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,500
Siyuan.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,630
Siyuan.

49
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,890
Shen Zheng, if you were about to die,

50
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,150
but you had someone you loved dearly,

51
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,650
what would you do?

52
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,750
Shen Zheng.

53
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,510
If...

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,149
Governor, bad...

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,670
Bad news.

56
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,500
What were you about to say?

57
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,630
It was nothing.

58
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,580
Go ahead and take care of your business.

59
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,190
I'll be back soon.

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,670
According to Commander Su's order,

61
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,990
Governor of Haidu, Shen Zheng, and his subordinates

62
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,670
(Arrest Warrant)
Governor of Haidu, Shen Zheng, and his subordinates

63
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,070
are suspected of losing military pay
(Arrest Warrant)

64
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,010
and unauthorized confiscation of others' property.
(Arrest Warrant)

65
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,950
and unauthorized confiscation of others' property.

66
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,810
Please submit to investigation.

67
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,159
Sister.

68
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,550
Why did the wound on her face disappear?

69
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,880
Could it be like what Su Li'er said...

70
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,350
Why is it you?

71
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,530
I'm afraid you won't get to see Shen Zheng, Sister.

72
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,860
He's already in prison.

73
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,730
You're trying to frame him again.

74
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,880
I didn't do anything this time.

75
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,120
It was his own doing.

76
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,590
I told you,

77
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,230
if you dare to hurt him again,

78
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,470
I'll kill you.

79
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,120
If I die,

80
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,190
no one will be able to save Shen Zheng.

81
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,490
How can he be saved?

82
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,430
Marry me.

83
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,960
What did you say?

84
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,470
As long as you marry me,

85
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,710
I'll let him go.

86
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,580
Otherwise,

87
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,200
you'll be collecting his corpse.

88
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,080
I should have killed you long ago.

89
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,409
What a pity.

90
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,430
It's too late now.

91
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,230
Sister, will you marry me or not?

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,890
On our wedding day,

93
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,909
I'll marry you,

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,230
and you'll release Shen Zheng.

95
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,020
No problem.

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,710
As long as the wedding ceremony is completed,

97
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,710
I'll release him.

98
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,270
You and Shen Anren did it, right?

99
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,270
It's all because you pointed a gun at me for her that day

100
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,500
and ordered me not to enter Shen's Mansion.

101
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,390
You were the one who hurt her first.

102
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,590
I warned you long ago.

103
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,160
I merely punished Qin Siyuan a little.

104
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,350
Why are you so unwilling?

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,380
Is she that important to you?

106
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

107
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,090
Then what are you feelings for me?

108
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,640
I've never had feelings for you.

109
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,050
Fine.

110
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,150
You value her so much,

111
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,750
but she's about to marry Shen Anren.

112
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,150
You're finally mine.

113
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,320
Where's Shen Zheng?

114
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,800
As long as you and I are on good terms,

115
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,790
he'll be safe.

116
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,490
But if you dare to leave me,

117
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,340
I have all the ways in the world to perish with him.

118
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,559
You think you're the only one who can make threats?

119
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,830
It's not a threat,

120
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,830
but a choice.

121
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,310
I've had this plan for a long time.

122
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,750
It's just because you happened to be in low spirits

123
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,230
and I wanted to run away with you

124
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,630
that I hadn't made a move.

125
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,830
If you don't believe me,

126
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,070
you're welcome to take a gamble.

127
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,190
Anyway, whether I'm in this plan or not myself

128
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,550
doesn't matter.

129
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,870
Let's go.

130
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,270
Siyuan!

131
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,510
Are you really going to leave me?

132
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,280
But if you dare to leave me,

133
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,100
I have all the ways in the world to perish with him.

134
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,750
What are you doing here?

135
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,530
Get out.

136
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,390
Did he threaten you?

137
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,560
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

138
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,930
What do you think our relationship is

139
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,430
that I need your protection?

140
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,830
Don't flatter yourself.

141
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,740
Get out.

142
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,460
That day, you had something you wanted to tell me.

143
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,260
What was that?

144
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,850
What could it be?

145
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,470
I just wanted to cut ties with you completely.

146
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,420
Even if I die here today,

147
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,560
I must take you with me.

148
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,510
Then go die.

149
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,650
You...

150
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,260
Shen Zheng!

151
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,350
Governor!

152
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,110
Murdering the Governor

153
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,440
is punishable by death.

154
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,970
I'll see who dares!

155
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,730
Shen Zheng passed out.

156
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,150
Let's go.

157
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,440
I will kill you sooner or later.

158
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,670
To die by your hands, Sister,

159
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,190
I'm willing.

160
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,600
I must find out

161
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,780
what Shen Anren's plan is.
