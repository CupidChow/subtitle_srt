00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,970
(Episode 23)

3
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,660
You and I are in a life-and-death predicament.

4
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,870
On the day before your 25th birthday,

5
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,790
which is tomorrow,

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,720
if the lamp goes out, I'll die.

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,180
If the lamp stays lit, you'll die.

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,220
Between us,

9
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:02,930
only one can survive.

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,980
Is this why

11
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,190
you've been pushing me away?

12
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,610
Only now do I understand

13
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,150
that since we love each other,

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,300
we both have the right

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,500
to decide our future.

16
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,789
My presumptuous attempt to do what's best for you

17
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,050
was actually selfish,

18
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,830
and it hurt you even more.

19
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,670
So this time,

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,280
I'm giving you the right to choose.

21
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,660
Let's get married tomorrow.

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,610
Okay.

So you just wanted to take me here for a walk.

140
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,470
I had a dream before.

141
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,590
In that dream,

142
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,130
we had a son and a daughter.

143
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,260
We would often hold hands like this,

144
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,870
walking on and on,

145
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,110
until we grew old.

146
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,110
Then today,

147
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,930
I'll take a long walk with you.

148
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,670
Sir, would you like to buy some flowers?

149
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,730
Sir, why don't you buy a bouquet of flowers for the lady?

150
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,590
Governor, since you have feelings for Ms. Qin,

151
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,670
why don't you buy her some flowers,

152
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,710
make her happy, and take the opportunity

153
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,240
to confess your feelings to her or something?

154
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,430
Here.

155
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,030
Okay.

156
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,510
Thank you.

157
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,850
This is for you.

158
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,870
I should be the one buying flowers for you,

159
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,270
not the other way around.

160
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,520
Don't you like them?

161
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
Then I'll give them to someone else.

162
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,230
You wouldn't dare.

163
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,470
You really wouldn't.

164
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,929
You really, really wouldn't.

165
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,030
Let's sit for a while.

166
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,870
In my childhood, when I was feeling down,

167
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,030
I'd come here.

168
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,070
To cry?

169
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,950
Do I look like someone who cries?

170
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,350
Well, I think

171
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,710
you do.

172
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,080
Today is almost over.

173
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes.

174
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,740
You're about to turn 25.

175
