00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,990
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,970
(Episode 17)

3
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,430
The wick has been cut,

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,130
but why is the lamp still luminous?

5
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,890
How come the wound is gone?

6
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,460
Is his medicine

7
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,530
that miraculous?

8
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,590
Shen Zheng.

9
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,479
There seems to be a strange noise in your bedroom.

10
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,470
A strange noise?

11
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,390
Come quickly.

12
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,120
Who is in

13
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,140
this room?

14
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,070
How can they do this in broad daylight?

15
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,390
Miss Su!

16
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,910
Miss Su, save me!

17
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,710
Miss Su, save me!

18
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,950
I don't know you.

19
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,079
Why should I save you?

20
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,790
You're the one who told me to come.

21
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,210
You said after the task was finished,

22
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,710
you would be the Governor's wife.

23
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,460
Then I would...

24
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
Don't frame me!

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,720
Guards!

26
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,829
Take him away!

27
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,310
Go!

28
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,140
Don't kick me out just because you no longer need my help!

29
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:56,780
Miss Su!

30
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,490
Shen Zheng.

31
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,060
-I really don’t know him.
-Miss Su!

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,720
It turns out that you're really the mastermind.

33
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,440
I had long sensed that someone was outside the room.

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,010
I deliberately pretended to be unconscious.

35
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,270
That was why I didn't fall into your trap.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,670
Don't slander me!

37
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,740
My father is the Commander.

38
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,150
So what if you're the Commander's daughter?

39
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,750
As the Commander's daughter, you think you can

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,550
bully other girls as you please?

41
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,390
Today, I'm going to

42
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,270
teach you a lesson properly for your father,

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,710
who is the Commander.

44
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,470
Shen Zheng!

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,380
Shen Zheng, I once saved your life!

46
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,160
You can't just watch her

47
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
do this to me, can you?

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,390
Shen Zheng!

49
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,320
Shen Zheng, I once saved your life!

50
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,610
You can't just stand by and let her hurt me!

51
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:37,270
Shen Zheng!

52
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,900
Shen Zheng, save me!

53
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,910
Shen Zheng, save me!

54
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,590
Shen Zheng, are you alright?

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,270
You made a mistake today.

56
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,930
I was punished on your behalf.

57
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,520
I've repaid you for your former

58
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,100
kindness to me.

59
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,690
From now on,

60
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,990
we're even.

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,790
Get out!

62
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,490
I...

63
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,450
Get out!

64
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,840
I don't want to be even with you.

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,500
You tried so hard to protect her.

66
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,800
Are you alright?

67
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,680
It's none of your business.

68
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,640
Where is your wound?

69
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,690
Wasn't it cured by your medicine?

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,110
What's going on?

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,780
Could it be related to the Never Forget Lamp?

72
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,100
The brighter the candlelight is,

73
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,560
the stronger Qin Siyuan's vitality will be.

74
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,050
When are you going to let me go?

75
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,830
I'll ask some people to protect you.

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,630
I won't let you get hurt again...

77
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,790
until you remember me.

78
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,650
Now that Master Anren has been caught this time,

79
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,780
I'm afraid there will be great danger.

80
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,870
So there's no room for negotiation?

81
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,380
For all those things which Master Anren has done,

82
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,780
if any evidence is found,

83
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,470
he can't escape punishment at all, can he?

84
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,300
What should we do now?

85
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,720
Go tell our buddies that

86
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,240
it looks like we need to get ready

87
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,370
to leave this place.

88
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:05,520
Yes.

89
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,350
Is there really something wrong with Anren,

90
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,810
and is that why Shen Zheng tried to catch him?

91
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,590
Qin Siyuan.

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,360
Where are you going?

93
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,840
Su Li'er.

94
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,000
What do you want to do this time?

95
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,930
Of course I want to beat you up.

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,570
Who do you think you are?

97
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
How dared you treat me like that yesterday?

98
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,570
You were the one who set me up first.

99
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,430
So what?

100
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,070
I've never been treated like this

101
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,870
in my entire life.

102
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,670
I'm going to punish you severely.

103
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
Aren't you afraid this knife

104
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,540
will be used on you again?

105
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,190
That's ridiculous.

106
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,710
Do you think you can escape today?

107
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,060
You can stay in this mansion

108
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,070
only because of your pretty face

109
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,670
that has seduced Shen Zheng.

110
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,940
If you lose this face,

111
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,110
I'll see how you can seduce him.

112
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,970
Aren't you afraid this knife

113
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,909
will be used on you again?

114
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,430
You do it.

115
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,080
My... My Lady.

116
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,750
I don't dare.

117
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,790
You're so useless!

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,230
I just want to see

119
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,160
whether Shen Zheng will still care about you!

120
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,910
My Lady!

121
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,620
Where on earth is that woman?

122
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,170
Who do you think you are?

123
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,130
How dare you hit me!

124
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,010
I'll beat you to death!

125
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,450
My Lady.

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,270
Did you hurt her?

127
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,950
She hit me first!

128
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,770
If you dare to hurt her again in the future,

129
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,890
I'll kill you!
