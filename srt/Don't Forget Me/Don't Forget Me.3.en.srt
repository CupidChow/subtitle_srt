(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,910
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,150
Back then, the Goddess once said that

4
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,470
when the red bell rang,

5
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,620
it would guide me to the answer.

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,849
Now I've got news about the fragments of

7
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,050
the Extinguishing Lampshade finally.

8
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,830
What do you want to do this time?

9
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,330
Why are you so afraid?

10
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,090
I won't eat you.

11
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,990
Have you recovered?

12
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,910
I'm feeling a bit unwell suddenly.

13
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,410
I might really need to eat...

14
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
I'm just kidding.

15
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,190
I've already recovered.

16
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,910
Look.

17
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,170
Last night, why...

18
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,390
did you do that?

19
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,640
It was just punishment.

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,250
But why did you

21
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,190
save me last night?

22
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,470
You could have escaped first.

23
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,760
Why did you come back to save me?

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,550
It was nothing.

25
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,070
I'm regretting it. I'll leave now.

26
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,350
I saved you last night.

27
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,510
Are you going to repay kindness with enmity

28
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,570
and continue to keep me trapped here?

29
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,510
Extinguishing the light is my lifelong pursuit.

30
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,670
I have no choice.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,329
I live in the Governor's Mansion in Haidu.

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,230
When you find a way to extinguish the light,

33
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:01,910
come to see me.

34
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,670
I will definitely help you extinguish it.

35
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,430
No.

36
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,240
Your abilities are so weak.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,710
What if you get killed?

38
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,900
I had waited for so long

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,430
before I finally found you.

40
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,310
But it's alright.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,150
I've already found a way to extinguish the light now.

42
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,210
It won't take up too much of your time.

43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,400
What is the method?

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,870
As long as we find the Extinguishing Lampshade,

45
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,070
we'll be able to do it.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,230
However,

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,920
the Extinguishing Lampshade has been passed down for a thousand years.

48
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,510
Currently, it has been divided into three fragments and hidden in the world.

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,370
It may appear in its original form

50
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,910
or turn into anything.

51
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,190
If we want to find it,

52
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,040
it's necessary for us to have intimate contact

53
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,590
so that I can sense it

54
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,910
and you can see it.

55
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,040
Intimate contact?

56
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,190
Just do it like this.

57
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,570
(Don't forget the mortal affairs. The past is covered by the lamp. Those three fragments are scattered in the world. Gather them all to return to the nature.)

60
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,500
A woman who can use supernatural power?

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,310
Yes.

62
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,150
She can stop bullets instantly?

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,010
Yes, yes, yes, Master An.

64
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,270
So...

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,050
I failed to kill Shen Zheng.

66
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,150
When you lie next time,

67
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,630
say something believable.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,580
Yu Bo.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,990
Young Master, don't worry.

70
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,990
I've already reached an agreement with the Shen family's elders.

Today, I will bring the Kylin Seal

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,070
and pass the position of the family's head to you.

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,100
What else?

77
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,030
Don't worry.

78
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,600
I won't let Shen Zheng enter Haidu alive.

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,630
If anyone dares to interfere,

80
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,760
I'll kill them, too.

81
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,920
Thank you for your efforts, Yu.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,660
Alright. I'll go make arrangements right away.

Where's the Extinguishing Lampshade?

92
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,150
Let me take you somewhere.

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,770

-Yes!

109
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,470
Governor, I'm late.

110
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,390
I'm sorry for having startled you.

111
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,670
I deserve to be punished.

112
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,470
It's alright.

113
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,570
I will take them back and interrogate them thoroughly.

114
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,430
Governor, the clothes are ready.

115
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,670
Take them all back!

-Yes!

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
-Go!
-Behave yourself!

118

Is your hand alright?

119
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,390
It's fine now.

120
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,830
It's alright.

121
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,350
Aren't you supposed to be very capable?

122
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,480
Why did you get hurt?

123
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,900
I just didn't react quickly enough.

124
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,610
Besides,

125
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,930
as long as you're fine,

126
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,820
it's not a big deal that I got hurt.

127
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,990
I know that you're not an ordinary person,

128
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,950
but next time,

129
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,070
don't do this.

130
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,220
You're talking too much.

131
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,580
Where's the Extinguishing Lampshade?

132
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,880
It's in the Shen's Mansion.

133
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,870
After I find the Kylin Seal,

134
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,270
I'll help you look for it.

135
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,380
Today is a big day for the Shen Clan.

136
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,180
I hereby declare that

137
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,410
from today onwards,

138
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,490
the position of the Shen family's head

139
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,530
will be inherited by Second Young Master, Shen Anren.

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,090
How can the position of the Shen family's head

141
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,140
be inherited by an outsider?

142
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,390
Sister?

143
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,330
It turns out that you're Shen Changzhang's son.

144
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,680
But no matter who you are,

145
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,410
I'm running out of patience.

146
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,540
Solve the problem as soon as possible.

147
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,610
I know.

148
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,750
Eldest Young Master.

149
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,070
What are you doing?

150
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm the eldest son of the Shen family.

151
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,030
Of course I'm here to inherit the position of the family's head.

152
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,710
Brother.

153
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,190
You're back finally.

154
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,400
It's been a long time since we last met.

155
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,090
Who is this young lady?

156
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,350
Thank you.

157
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
(Shen Anren in his boyhood)

158
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,070
It's indeed been a long time.

159
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,170
Thanks to you,

160
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,110
you persuaded our father

161
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,010
to banish me from our home.

162
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,630
Brother.

163
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,290
You've misunderstood me.

164
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:20,840
Eldest Young Master.

165
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,310
You...

166
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,760
In front of me,

167
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,390
just stop pretending to be

168
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,790
so innocent and pitiful.

169
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
Our father has just passed away,

170
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,470
and you've already become the acting chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Haidu.

171
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,720
Now you're in such a hurry to inherit the position of the family's head.

172
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,310
You really can't wait to do that.

173
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,110
Young Master.

174
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,750
Our father was murdered.

175
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm heartbroken.

176
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,210
How I wish I could tear the murderer to pieces.

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,140
But even though I've used all my connections to investigate the case,

178
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,060
I still haven't caught the murderer yet.

179
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,680
The Shen family is in chaos now.

180
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,030
To protect the Shen family's assets,

181
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,690
I have no choice but to do this.

182
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,820
As for our father's case,

183
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,110
I will personally figure out the truth.

184
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,210
But as an outsider, he has no right

185
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,520
to inherit the position

186
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,260
of the Shen family's head.

187
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Eldest Young Master.

188
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,910
When your father, Shen Changzhang, was alive,

189
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,740
he intended to pass the position of the family's head

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,070
to Second Young Master.

191
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,660
However, over the years,

192
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,800
it's Second Young Master who has been

193
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,710
busy managing the family affairs.

194
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,360
The position of the family's head should be given to him.

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,870
You haven't cared or asked about anything all these years.

196
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,330
Don't you think you're...

197
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,250
I'll say it again.

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,260
The position of the Shen family's head won't belong to him.

199
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,550
Yu Bo.

200
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,550
Give the Kylin Seal to me.

201
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,830
Even if I die here today,

202
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,270
I won't give it to you.

203
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,670
You're so slow.

204
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,360
I got it.

205
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,910
In exchange,

206
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,660
tell me where the Extinguishing Lampshade is.

207
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,070
Give it to me.

208
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,950
You actually have no idea where the Extinguishing Lampshade is.

209
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,790
You came back

210
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,330
just in order to get this, didn't you?

211
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,570
As long as you give it to me,

212
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll help you find it myself.

213
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,230
Shen Zheng.

214
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,700
How dare you lie to me?
