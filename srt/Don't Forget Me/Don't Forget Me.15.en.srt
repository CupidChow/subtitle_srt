00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,050
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,000
(Episode 15)

3
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:54,910
A fragment.

4
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,729
Qin Siyuan,

5
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:37,650
I'm going to ask you one last time.

6
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,640
Have you ever loved me sincerely?

7
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,460
In every lifetime,

8
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,840
the Lamp Quencher dies at 25 years old.

9
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,350
When the lamp goes out, he appears.

10
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,470
When the lamp shines, you appear.

11
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,630
How long can I live after the lamp is extinguished?

12
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,120
Less than 15 minutes.

13
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,470
Extinguish the lamp.

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,280
Young Master, just now I was upstairs

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,829
and saw Lin Ze coming this way

16
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,100
with many soldiers.

17
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,150
So sudden.

18
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,700
Wasn't everything taken care of before?

19
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,140
Everything was taken care of.

20
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,470
Even if they suspect us,

21
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,400
they have nothing on us.

22
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,050
Looks like they want to do it the hard way.

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,780
In this chaotic world, guns have the biggest say.

24
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,570
But there is nothing we can do.

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,040
Then destroy everything here.

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,530
Yes.

27
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,560
Why do you insist on extinguishing it?

28
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,120
It's none of your business.

29
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm not in a good mood today.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,660
I suddenly don't want to extinguish it.

31
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,520
No. There's not much time left.

32
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,170
Then you should think carefully

33
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,570
about how to make me happy.

34
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,140
Qin Siyuan,

35
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,810
what kind of person do you think I am?

36
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,750
What exactly do you want?

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,080
That's something you should think about.

38
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,900
I still have official business to handle.

39
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,020
Think carefully

40
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,950
about what I truly want.

41
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,460
These days,

42
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,710
I've been firmly persuading myself

43
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,550
to extinguish the lamp and not to be greedy,

44
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,000
to be decisive and not to be hesitant.

45
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,250
I'm worried if I delay longer,

46
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,640
I'll lose control of myself again.

47
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,030
So the lamp

48
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,090
must be extinguished today.

49
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,160
You're controlling me.

50
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,830
Stop.

51
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,160
Stop.

52
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,060
Stop!

53
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
Stop!

54
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,560
From now on,

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,210
we shouldn't meet again.

56
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,510
Don't ever come to me

57
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,330
so that you won't annoy me.

58
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,270
Annoy you?

59
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,500
You think I'll go to you?

60
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,790
You overestimated yourself.

61
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,070
Great.

62
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,630
Live your life well.

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,160
I wish you...

64
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,430
a long life.

65
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,560
Governor, they have arrived.

66
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
Everything is ready.

67
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,920
Take action now.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,420
Yes.

69
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,870
Miss, what would you like?

70
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,670
I'll buy it.

71
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,620
No.

72
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,450
How dare you say no!

73
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,900
No.

74
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,850
I insist.

75
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,770
Pay for it.

76
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,159
I have no money.

77
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,950
What's going on?

78
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,430
It's already 15 minutes.

79
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,710
Why am I still alive?

80
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,190
But my power has disappeared.

81
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,630
Could there be something wrong with the Never Forget Lamp?

82
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,450
Why is the Chamber of Commerce's building on fire?

83
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,330
Who knows?

84
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,280
I heard many military policemen are trapped inside.

85
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,070
How did it catch fire?

86
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,030
Yeah. It's a huge fire.

87
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,990
-What should we do?
-Yeah.

88
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,000
(General Chamber of Commerce of Haidu City)

89
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,180
I thought you left.

90
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,310
Why did you come back?

91
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,510
Where's Shen Zheng? Is he still inside?

92
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,770
It's dangerous inside.

93
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,600
Don't go in.

94
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,950
Master Anren,

95
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,309
have you forgotten what's put inside?

96
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,120
It's so dangerous.

97
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,130
Yeah.

98
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,720
(General ledger)

99
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,830
Shen Zheng!

100
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,260
Are you alright?

101
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,410
Why are you here?

102
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,670
Go, quickly!

103
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,030
We can't stay here.

104
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm going to get you out.

105
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,670
Be careful!

106
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,430
Siyuan,

107
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,980
listen to me.

108
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,800
I've figured it out.

109
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,330
Whether you love me or not,

110
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,590
I like you.

111
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,630
I just hope that you can be by my side

112
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,930
every single second.

113
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,410
You can't escape.

114
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,530
And I won't let you escape.

115
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,630
Shen Zheng.

116
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,870
Shen Zheng!
