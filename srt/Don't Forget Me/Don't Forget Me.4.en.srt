1
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,060
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,960
(Episode 4)

3
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,230
After all these years,

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,370
you're the first person

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,870
who dared to deceive me.

6
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,350
If you kill me,

7
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,610
how will you extinguish the lamp?

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,830
Are you threatening me?

9
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,830
I was wrong

10
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,000
to deceive you.

11
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,200
I will do my best

12
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,250
to help you find the Extinguishing Lampshade.

13
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,229
Not just your best.

14
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,710
You must.

15
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,390
If you can't find it...

16
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,550
What then?

17
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,150
Then I'll use this

18
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,830
to destroy the Shen family completely.

19
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,210
The reason you want to inherit the position of the Shen family head

20
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,260
is simply to protect what your father

21
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,820
left behind, isn't it?

22
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,420
With the Kylin Seal,

23
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
one can control the Shen's Mansion.

24
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,630
If you can't find the fragments,

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,770
then the family you want to protect

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,030
will be

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,310
finished.

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,350
Don't worry,

29
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,970
I will definitely find it.

30
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,380
I am the esteemed Governor.

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,200
This doesn't seem quite right.

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,950
Only this way can you truly feel

33
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,510
the fragments of the Extinguishing Lampshade.

34
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,590
It's been quite a while now.

35
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,950
Have you found anything?

36
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,750
No.

37
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,160
Look carefully.

38
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,190
If those are indeed fragments of the Extinguishing Lampshade,

39
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,320
could they be from another lampshade?

40
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:42,630
Wait a moment.

41
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,570
What would you two like to see?

42
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,050
This is perfect for newlyweds.

43
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,579
We're not newlyweds.

44
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,780
I'm his master.

45
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,590
Nothing I want. Let's go.

46
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,550
Look how fashionable it is!

47
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,829
Nowhere else has anything like it.

48
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,910
It can even spin.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,790
Really?

50
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,740
It's actually quite interesting.

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,170
What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,930
Are you feeling shy?

53
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,450
Last time at the Never Forget Studio,

54
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,580
don't tell me that was your first kiss.

55
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,279
I'm not

56
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,560
as experienced as you.

57
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,550
Who's experienced?

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,870
Newlyweds are so sweet.

59
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,510
Madam, why don't you buy one?

60
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,750
I want it.

61
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:32,650
No.

62
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,270
You dare refuse?

63
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:35,880
No.

64
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,830
I insist.

65
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,930
Pay for it.

66
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,050
I have no money.

67
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,230
Madam, do you still want it?

68
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,530
Sister, why are you here?

69
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,659
Let me buy it for you.

70
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,430
That's great!

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,440
Who are you?

72
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,880
Sister, don't you remember me?

73
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,590
It's you.

74
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,540
The person Shen Zheng really dislikes.

75
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,970
Do you remember this?

76
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,630
Isn't this my handkerchief?

77
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,740
Get lost.

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,660
You're taking this lamp, sir?

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,310
I've paid for it.

80
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,230
-Thank you.
-Let’s go.

81
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,030
Take care.

82
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,590
Please come again!

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,130
Sister, I've finally found you.

84
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Do you know him?

85
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,670
No, I don't.

86
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,020
Then why did he call you "sister"?

87
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,640
You should ask him.

88
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,840
Why are you asking me?

89
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,270
Stay away from him from now on.

90
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,490
I couldn't care less about your business.

91
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,080
I just want the Extinguishing Lampshade.

92
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,060
That's good.

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:00,870
Oh, right.

94
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,070
Why are we here?

95
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,590
To look around.

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,820
In case there's...

97
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,280
Where are you going?

98
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,640
Men's room.

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,570
Do you want to go?

100
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,300
How is it?

101
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,790
I've asked around.

102
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,470
Before his death, your father met

103
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,350
with Mr. Qian alone.

104
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,150
He then immediately left Haidu.

105
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,470
When he returned, he was already severely injured.

106
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,090
Mr. Qian?

107
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,330
The general manager of the Haidu Chamber of Commerce branch.

108
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,290
Qian Zhenghao.

109
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,060
Although the Qian family has been in business in Haidu for a century,

110
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,460
their methods are dirty.

111
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,100
How could my father have associated with him?

112
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,260
I'll send someone to investigate right away.

113
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,430
Good.

114
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,620
Oh, right.

115
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,640
Take a look at this.

116
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,890
There was a flower-shaped red bruise

117
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,120
on your father's chest.

118
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,410
The autopsy report shows

119
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,030
that he suffered a severe blow.

120
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,390
The combination of old and new injuries

121
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,790
caused his heart to fail,

122
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,150
leading to his death.

123
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,190
Alright.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,710
Let's follow this lead.

125
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,590
We must find the culprit.

126
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,460
Also,

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,310
regarding the people who tried to assassinate you,

128
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,190
so far,

129
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,720
we haven't found any clues.

130
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,790
They will surely act again.

131
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,920
This time,

132
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,670
we must catch them red-handed.

133
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,590
Yes.

134
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,750
By the way,

135
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,790
Governor,

136
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,790
are we going to have a wife of the Governor soon?

137
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,860
What wife?

138
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,580
That Miss Qin.

139
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,350
I saw you two were quite intimate today.

140
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,990
Don't talk nonsense.

141
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,630
We have important business to attend to.

142
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,830
Important business?

143
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,760
What kind of important business requires...

144
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,630
I'm going to investigate the case.

145
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,630
Why did you come here?

146
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,390
Of course, I came to find you.

147
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,110
Why were you so late in returning?

148
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,240
You made me get lost.

149
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,590
Don't run around.

150
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,580
Look at you.

151
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,070
Are you worried about me?

152
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm worried about the seal.

153
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,630
It's not safe here. Let's go.

154
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,510
Easy, easy. Be careful.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,800
Qiang, quickly deliver the items.

156
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll deliver it to the Qian's Mansion right away.

157
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
I didn't mean to do that just now.

158
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,070
It's okay.

159
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,820
It's not the first time anyway.

160
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,820
I can't sense it anymore.

161
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,610
It seems that person is connected to the fragments of the Extinguishing Lampshade.
