1
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,010
(Don't Forget Me)

2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,970
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,280
Governor, I understand

4
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,310
what you mean.

5
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,630
But as you know,

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,020
it's not easy to do business.

7
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,190
We really don't have that much money.

8
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,820
That's right.

9
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,080
None of us has made any money this year.

10
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,250
Governor, you want to do it

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,040
the hard way?

12
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,830
You have objections?

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,380
I'm afraid this might arouse public anger.

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,270
Compared to you,

15
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,470
the public anger against me is nothing.

16
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,770
Governor, you're being too serious.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,729
The army exists for us civilians, after all.

18
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,009
No matter what you demand,

19
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,110
we'll do our best to cooperate.

20
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,860
Man,

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,880
go

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,920
have a proper drink with Governor.

23
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,150
Governor,

24
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,460
a toast to you.

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,270
Sure.

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,820
Cheers.

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,590
But Governor,

28
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,900
we are businessmen after all.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,680
We can't just give it to you without gaining anything, right?

30
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,110
What do you want?

31
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,230
Sorry.

32
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,510
What kind of tone is that?

33
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,740
If you want to apologize,

34
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,780
do it properly.

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,310
I don't know how.

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,510
Why don't you show me?

37
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,220
I...

38
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,220
Get out.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,230
If I remember correctly,

40
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,610
you're Governor's fiancée, aren't you?

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,100
Governor Shen,

42
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,620
why is your future wife

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
doing the work of a servant?

44
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,530
Is that any of your business?

45
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,120
Governor, you just asked me what I want.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,850
I want her.

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,170
Will you give her to me, Governor?

48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,710
I just want a woman.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,530
Surely you won't be reluctant, Governor, right?

50
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,870
If you're reluctant,

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,360
we're also reluctant

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,690
to give you the money.

53
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,780
Okay, Mr. Qian.

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,740
I'll go with you.

55
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,130
Okay, Mr. Qian.

56
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,310
I'll go with you.

57
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,630
This woman.

58
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,080
Go to Qian's Mansion

59
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,950
and bring Qin Siyuan back to me.

60
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,630
If I can control him

62
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,460
and get the money for Shen Zheng,

63
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,390
I can ask him to go with me to find the Extinguishing Lampshade

64
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,520
as soon as possible.

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,360
You're favored by the two young masters of the Shen family.

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,250
Your personality is indeed...

67
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,630
Oh no.

68
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,700
How come I can't even do this?

69
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,080
Mr. Qian!

70
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,780
You can't touch her.

71
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,080
You're right, Master Shen.

72
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,750
I was just teasing Ms. Qin.

73
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,480
Why are you here?

74
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,260
I'm here for you.

75
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,510
I'll take you back.

76
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,310
Why should I go with you?

77
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,700
Since I belong to Mr. Qian now,

78
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,350
I should stay here.

79
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,780
Don't.

80
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,970
Ms. Qin,

81
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,530
you should leave quickly.

82
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,190
You didn't come here willingly.

83
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,470
I can give you

84
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,690
whatever you want.

85
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,990
I want money.

86
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,060
A lot of money.

87
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,450
Okay.

88
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,630
Governor,

89
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,120
Ms. Qin has been taken away by Shen Anren.

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Sister.

91
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,830
Is everything ready?

92
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,530
That's a lot of money.

93
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,380
You need to give me some time.

94
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,630
You only have one day.

95
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,690
You went to Qian's Mansion

96
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,020
and asked for so much money

97
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,280
for my brother, right?

98
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,880
He treated you like that,

99
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,290
but you still want to help him.

100
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,750
What exactly do you want him to help you with?

101
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,470
Sister.

102
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,070
Anren?

103
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:09,980
Sister.

104
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,030
You finally remember me.

105
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,230
You've grown up.

106
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,940
I didn't recognize you.

107
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,610
But I recognized you at first glance.

108
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,740
It's been ten years.

109
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,730
You haven't changed a bit.

110
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,870
Women

111
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,180
are good at taking care of themselves.

112
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,980
Sister,

113
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,800
I've been looking for you all these years.

114
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,390
I miss you so much.

115
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,310
What?

116
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,960
I came at the wrong time?

117
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,840
Brother, why are you here?

118
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,680
Come. Go back with me.

119
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,760
You can't take Sister away.

120
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,860
I'm taking my woman with me.

121
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,230
Do I need to explain to you?

122
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,600
You gave her to Mr. Qian.

123
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,790
I brought her back.

124
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,040
So she's my woman now.

125
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,020
Your woman?

126
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,830
Now you know

127
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,530
whose woman she is, don't you?

128
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,260
Let's go.

129
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,520
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

130
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,300
You like to hug and cuddle others.

131
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,940
How come I didn't realize

132
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,850
you actually like those things?

133
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,410
Shen Zheng,

134
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,510
that's enough.

135
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,340
What?

136
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,960
You don't like to hear that?

137
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,870
Take your anger out on me.

138
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,680
Don't get him involved.

139
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Why are you defending him like this?

140
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,450
Sister?

141
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,050
Sister,

142
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
can I do anything I want now?
