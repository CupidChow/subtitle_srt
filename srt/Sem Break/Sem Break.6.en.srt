1
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:15,820
You know, my auntie told me that
since we're graduating students,

2
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:17,555
We're closer to danger.

3
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,017
Is this the home of Madame Conching?

4
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:22,752
"Nana" Conching.

5
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:32,306
We passed a lighthouse
on the way here.

6
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:33,665
Can we go there?

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,358
Don't even think about going there.

8
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:43,993
I think I lost my necklace.

9
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:46,287
You must have lost it at
the lighthouse.

10
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,955
- Hey!
- Lighthouse?

11
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:50,923
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,884
I wanted to help you so I made
you go to that cleansing.

13
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:56,261
Come with me.

14
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:00,427
She doesn't want to hurt you.

15
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:02,287
She just wants to play.

16
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,180
What the fuck do you want from me?!

17
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:08,088
I need Jasmin.

18
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:11,578
How are you feeling?

19
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,638
Are you okay?

20
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:18,580
I will be going to the lighthouse.

21
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,662
- Babe!
- I'll look for your necklace.

22
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:31,421
Cora!

23
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,422
Cora!

24
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,507
Mich...

25
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,968
Has anything been bothering you?

26
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:40,097
Have you been feeling anything strange?

27
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,059
We already know that you,
Cora, Timmy and Arlo.

28
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,144
went to the lighthouse.

29
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,273
Doesn't it hurt you, Pipo?

30
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:51,108
Don't you feel insulted?

31
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,444
I don't like you, Timmy.

32
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,042
What happened to you?

33
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,603
What happened? Are you okay?

34
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,121
Burn it.

35
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,588
Didn't you have spirit cleansing?

36
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:12,847
Don't you feel anything or do you
have any visions?

37
00:02:13,322 --> 00:02:14,990
Shut up!

38
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:20,053
Arlo, good evening.

39
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:24,474
Have you seen Mich?
I can't seem to contact her.

40
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:26,393
No, Auntie.

41
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:37,738
Jasmin!

42
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:39,823
Jasmin!

43
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:56,334
Have mercy on our
poor child, Eduardo.

44
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,627
That's no child of mine.

45
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,881
What else do you want me do?

46
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:04,968
I am telling you the truth!

47
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:09,222
I have never cheated on you, Eduardo!

48
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:13,143
I have never even thought about it.

49
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,771
Not even once.

50
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,690
Not even once, Eduardo.

51
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,825
Stop it, you little shit!

52
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,234
Won't you stop?

53
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:46,732
Won't you stop?!

54
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:48,818
Won't you stop?!

55
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,405
Won't you stop?!

56
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,389
Enough.

57
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,314
I said stop it!

58
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:57,806
Eduardo!

59
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,273
Eduardo!

60
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,365
That's enough, Eduardo!

61
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:04,623
Eduardo!

62
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,157
Jasmin.

63
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:11,506
Jasmin, baby.

64
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:12,869
Jasmin.

65
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,787
Wake up, Jasmin!

66
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,373
Please wake up!

67
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:19,543
Jasmin!

68
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:24,279
Eduardo!

69
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,842
What have you done?!

70
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,760
What have yo--

71
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:31,568
Jasmin.

72
00:06:31,972 --> 00:06:33,139
My child.

73
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:36,421
My child.

74
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,115
Jasmin...

75
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,047
My daughter...

76
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,977
She's my daughter.

77
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,232
Jasmin, wake up.

78
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,069
Baby, please.

79
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,833
Eduardo, don't!

80
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,096
They'll put me in prison for her.

81
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:17,441
And I don't want you
with another man, Lilia.

82
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:20,061
So, I'm taking you with me.

83
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,875
We'll all be together.
Even in the next life.

84
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:27,902
With our daughter.

85
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:37,410
That's right, Eduardo.

86
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:40,123
We'll be together.

87
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:41,958
Just the three of us.

88
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:44,085
Until the end.

89
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:51,635
We'll be together from now on.

90
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,035
Cora,

91
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:00,453
is Mich there with you?

92
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,455
Eduardo?

93
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:12,945
Lilia.

94
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,220
I'm with our daughter.

95
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:35,989
Our family will be back together again.

96
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:39,701
Nothing will ever come between us.

97
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:43,621
With these new bodies

98
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,666
we'll be free to do anything we want.

99
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:51,963
What about these people's families?

100
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:56,259
We own these bodies now, Lilia.

101
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,429
What do you mean, Eduardo?

102
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,837
We've been granted
a second chance at life.

103
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,052
We'll be together until the end.

104
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:43,014
Can you believe it?

105
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:46,851
Even in these bodies

106
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,729
and this new life

107
00:10:50,814 --> 00:10:52,857
we've been brought together.

108
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,287
Lilia

109
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,040
forgive me for what I did.

110
00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:16,047
You have nothing to ask forgiveness for.

111
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:20,343
We're here now.

112
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,304
We can start over.

113
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,752
It was a little late

114
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:28,726
but that was the plan.

115
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,522
Thank you, Eduardo.

116
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:09,225
We can't do this by ourselves.

117
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:12,061
We need to ask for help.

118
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:17,150
I think I have Nana Conching's number.

119
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,610
I can call her.

120
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:20,869
Okay.

121
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:21,937
Let's go?

122
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:22,754
Let's go.

123
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,085
We should call a taxi.

124
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,533
Let me out!

125
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:54,729
Aren't you going to stop?

126
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:55,939
Come here!

127
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:58,149
Won't you stop?!

128
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,526
Won't you stop?!

129
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,779
- Eduardo, please stop!
- Won't you stop?!

130
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,072
- Don't do this!
- Won't you stop?!

131
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,198
You can't do this again!

132
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:06,532
Eduardo!

133
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,581
Won't you stop?!

134
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:17,543
- Don't do this again, Eduardo!
- Stop that!

135
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,544
Stop, let me go!

136
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:30,230
No! Jasmin!

137
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,145
Secure the hands.

138
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:44,688
I'll handle this!

139
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:45,641
Go, go!

140
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,251
I'll get Arlo's car.

141
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,538
That's enough!

142
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,806
Jessie.

143
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:26,612
Timmy.

144
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,189
It's me, Mich.

145
00:14:29,574 --> 00:14:31,034
Please believe me.

146
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,202
It's me.

147
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:36,956
Mich, I'm sorry.

148
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,543
But we just have to be sure.

149
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,594
Timmy, it won't be long.

150
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:53,890
We'll be able to get some rest soon.

151
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,276
Timmy!

152
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,612
You're in love with me,
aren't you Timmy?

153
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,866
How could you do this to me?

154
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:16,532
You've loved me for a
long time, haven't you?

155
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:19,874
Timmy?

156
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,464
Don't listen to her.

157
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:26,077
That's not Cora.

158
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,395
I love you too, Timmy.

159
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,207
I have for a while now.

160
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:35,086
Don't you want to rest?

161
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,296
Come here.

162
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,298
You can sleep beside me.

163
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:40,383
Come on.

164
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,927
Timmy, please.

165
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,429
- Come on, Timmy.
- Timmy?

166
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,514
Come here.

167
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:51,444
- Come here.
- Timmy?

168
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:52,979
- Timmy.
- Timmy.

169
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:55,273
Timmy focus.

170
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,348
Timmy, look at me.

171
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:03,013
Just listen to me.

172
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,541
Only me.

173
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:07,947
This is not Cora anymore.
Okay?

174
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:14,566
You've wanted me all
this time, haven't you?

175
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:17,820
You even drew me.

176
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,281
You're not Cora.

177
00:16:22,678 --> 00:16:23,992
You're not Cora.

178
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,280
That's not Cora.

179
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,724
You're weak.

180
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,844
A weakling.

181
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,929
You have no balls.

182
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:46,265
You're weak. Weak!

183
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,648
I found the car!

184
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,032
Let's go!

185
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:26,309
Nana Conching.

186
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:32,575
Hello?

187
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:35,119
Nana Conching, we need your help.

188
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:39,109
It's about our friends.

189
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:46,325
Allow your spirit to be free.

190
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:51,493
Mich, follow this sound.

191
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:53,665
Friend.

192
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,771
How are you, son?

193
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,467
How do you feel?

194
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,790
Yes.

195
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:09,728
Meet me at the lighthouse.

196
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:32,788
How does it feel to be an
embarrasment to your lover?

197
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,959
Pipo, just focus on the road.

198
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,794
Don't mind him.

199
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:41,713
Well, it's true isn't it?

200
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:43,882
Just shut up.

201
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:51,723
Fine, ignore me.

202
00:18:53,225 --> 00:18:54,935
We're the same either way.

203
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,852
They'll still be ashamed of us.

204
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,429
I said, enough!

205
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,564
Let's just go.

206
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,323
We're running out of time.

207
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,315
Nana Conching!

208
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:24,358
- Thank you so much.
- Let's go.

209
00:20:25,609 --> 00:20:26,860
- Hurry up.
- Let's go.

210
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,473
Come on.

211
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,379
Through this ceremony

212
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:29,631
we bring together the living

213
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:31,299
and the dead.

214
00:21:32,092 --> 00:21:33,885
O you who dwell within

215
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,137
leave them alone.

216
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:37,805
Depart!

217
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:41,351
Depart you envious thieves!

218
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,019
Depart!

219
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,077
Jasmin, where are we?

220
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:43,747
We're back.

221
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:46,262
I don't want to be here.

222
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:02,953
Why are we here?

223
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:46,893
Mich?

224
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:50,480
Cora!

225
00:23:52,274 --> 00:23:53,525
Jessie!

226
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,320
Tim!

227
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:01,116
Pips!

228
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,673
Mich..

229
00:24:16,492 --> 00:24:18,527
- Cora...
- Nana Conching?

230
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,184
And Arlo...

231
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:29,410
You must lead them into the light

232
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:33,637
where they must all face judgement.

233
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:39,871
Make haste and do this
as soon as you can.

234
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:51,699
Mich, I'm scared.

235
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,474
Jasmin...

236
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:15,911
You have to be strong.

237
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,157
It is way past your time to go.

238
00:25:30,288 --> 00:25:31,957
I have no doubt

239
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:39,047
that on the other side there's a place

240
00:25:40,936 --> 00:25:43,355
where you can finally be happy.

241
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:53,021
No one can hurt you there.

242
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,902
There's lots of food.

243
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:03,003
You'll never go hungry.

244
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:14,049
You'll never be afraid.

245
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,385
Will it be heaven?

246
00:26:20,377 --> 00:26:21,628
Yeah.

247
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:25,770
Give my regards to my Mom and Dad

248
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,464
when you see them there.

249
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,497
Don't cry.

250
00:27:28,698 --> 00:27:31,242
Leave now, Lilia.

251
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,702
Your time is up.

252
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:34,787
No.

253
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:36,748
We've been granted a second chance

254
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:38,708
to be together again.

255
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:43,129
This is my body.

256
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,715
You have no right.

257
00:27:45,715 --> 00:27:47,217
I don't care.

258
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:12,826
A weakling after all.

259
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:33,680
Stop this now!

260
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:41,029
Stop this now, Lilia!
Enough!

261
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:00,290
When you hear this sound

262
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:02,458
return to your vessels.

263
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:18,333
Cora.

264
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,530
Cora.

265
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:23,354
- Cora.
- Are you okay?

266
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:28,022
Mich.

267
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:29,827
Mich.

268
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:33,983
- Mich.
- Mich.

269
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,909
- Mich.
- Are you okay?

270
00:29:58,723 --> 00:29:59,641
Bro.

271
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,319
Babe.

272
00:30:03,645 --> 00:30:04,687
Babe.

273
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,243
Babe.

274
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:18,660
Nana Conching!

275
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:49,542
Nana Conching?

276
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,920
They're still in danger.

277
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:54,339
Dear God!

278
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,878
Wait!

279
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,571
I'm still here!

280
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,172
Hey! Wait!

281
00:32:24,501 --> 00:32:26,086
Help!

282
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,667
Help!

283
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,598
Babe!

284
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:38,370
Babe!

285
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,611
Babe!

286
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,244
Mich!

287
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:04,082
Babe!

288
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:20,336
Arlo, follow the sound.

289
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:33,379
Timmy and the others.

290
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:37,520
Friend! Wake up!

291
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,787
Faster!

292
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,328
I'll miss this.

293
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:18,663
I'll miss this trip.

294
00:37:21,082 --> 00:37:22,583
Let's do this again sometime.

295
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:28,506
Two years.

296
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,675
I think we can wait.
