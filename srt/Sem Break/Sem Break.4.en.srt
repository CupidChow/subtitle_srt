1
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,169
Hello, Mich.

2
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:12,768
Friend!

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:14,435
You were wasted last night.

4
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:15,894
Are you alright?

5
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:19,106
What the fuck do you
want from me?!

6
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:21,341
I need Jasmin.

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,107
Please don't give me to her.

8
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:29,575
What does she need from me?

9
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:31,521
She doesn't want to hurt you.

10
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:33,524
She just wants to play.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,291
I've been ignoring it these past
few days but lately,

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,460
The visions have been getting worse.

13
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:42,091
Do you also feel something?

14
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,340
But why it's only the two of us?

15
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:48,260
I'll be going to the lighthouse.

16
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:51,555
- Babe, don't --
- I'll look for your necklace.

17
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:54,720
We won't gain anything from
your youngest.

18
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,680
He's so dumb.

19
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,224
Hon, don't say that.

20
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:03,937
I'm just telling the truth.
Atleast, his older brother is much better.

21
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,317
He's our only hope.

22
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,494
Arlo.

23
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,038
Arlo, come back now.

24
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,132
How are you feeling, Arlo?

25
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:34,593
Are you okay?

26
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,228
Yes, I am.

27
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,313
Hello, Dad.

28
00:04:08,585 --> 00:04:10,930
Let's have lunch tomorrow
with your mom.

29
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,568
Have Mich come too.

30
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:14,716
Let's discuss your plans about Austraila.

31
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:16,602
Okay Dad, sure.
No problem.

32
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,010
But--

33
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,779
Jasmin, why did they lock you up?

34
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,408
I don't know.

35
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,289
Haven't you asked?

36
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:48,792
Not really.

37
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,675
Sometimes,

38
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,887
our parents do things that

39
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:01,597
we don't understand.

40
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,601
You really don't want to
be with them?

41
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:09,521
I don't want to.

42
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:16,164
Why?

43
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:19,156
Won't they miss you?

44
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,327
Come on.

45
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:27,623
I don't have parents either.

46
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:29,958
They're in heaven now.

47
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:34,213
Heaven?
What's that?

48
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:37,715
Heaven.

49
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,593
It's a nice place.

50
00:05:40,302 --> 00:05:44,514
It's where all the nice people go.

51
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,184
I know they're waiting
for you there.

52
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,560
Because you're nice too.

53
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:06,577
Babe.

54
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,079
Hello, babe.

55
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:09,705
Babe!

56
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,918
- Hello?
- Hello!

57
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,963
- Sorry, I can't understand you.
- Hello, babe? Hello?

58
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,839
My phone's broken.

59
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:19,049
Babe!

60
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:20,759
- Hello!
- Hello!

61
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,594
Why are you yelling?

62
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,545
I said my phone's broken.

63
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,725
I'll call you back when I can
understand you.

64
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:36,273
Mich!

65
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:38,068
Who were you talking to?

66
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,818
Oh! Timmy.

67
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:22,279
What brings you here?

68
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:25,741
Nothing.

69
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:27,367
Just checking in.

70
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:28,493
Huh?

71
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,578
Why?

72
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,204
Well this is weird.

73
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,414
Come in.

74
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:41,715
Can I get you anything?

75
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:42,632
Water?

76
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:55,687
But that's fine. You?

77
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:04,488
Hey, Timmy.

78
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,156
What's up?

79
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:07,908
Hello, Jess?

80
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:10,243
Could you come here?
To Cora's?

81
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:11,995
Why?
What happened?

82
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:14,414
I don't know.

83
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:17,584
I just have a bad feeling.

84
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:19,627
Huh? A problem?

85
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,879
Timmy?

86
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:32,223
What was that about?

87
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:36,520
Something's wrong with Cora.

88
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:39,356
Cora stop!

89
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,024
- Why are you kicking me out?
- Get out!

90
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:42,984
Just go and leave me alone!

91
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:44,528
Leave us alone!

92
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,570
"Us?"

93
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:47,989
What do you mean "Us?"

94
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:49,324
Cora!

95
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,576
Cora!
What do you mean "Us?"

96
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:54,746
The woman in the lighthouse, Timmy.

97
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,873
That woman.

98
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,287
The lighthouse?

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,751
Huh?

100
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:02,671
Cora, please explain!

101
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:03,922
Cora!

102
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,676
Cora, please explain!

103
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,095
Cora!

104
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,429
Cora!

105
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:25,360
He's calling again.

106
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:29,739
Timmy?

107
00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:30,949
Hello, Jess?

108
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,118
Jess, please, you need to help me.

109
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,494
You need to help Cora.

110
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,163
What's happening?

111
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:38,290
A woman!

112
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,126
She mentioned a woman
from the lighthouse!

113
00:09:41,737 --> 00:09:42,780
Lighthouse?!

114
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,422
Is Pipo with you?

115
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:50,278
Bro?

116
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,405
Timmy is that you?

117
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:51,214
Cora!

118
00:11:51,214 --> 00:11:52,382
Cora!

119
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:53,383
Guard!

120
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:55,172
Guard, help!

121
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,232
Where are they?

122
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,608
Where are they?

123
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,180
All I know is

124
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,141
the lighthouse keeper
murdered his entire family.

125
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:47,062
No one knows exactly why.

126
00:12:54,361 --> 00:12:56,821
Some say, he turned crazy after the war.

127
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:00,075
Others say, he got possessed.

128
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:03,870
Some even blame the family.

129
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:06,748
They say his wife cheated.

130
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,459
Their child is from a different man.

131
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,796
Maybe because of guilt,

132
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,714
he also killed himself.

133
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,841
And up to this day,

134
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:19,386
their souls are still in the lighthouse.

135
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,096
Still unsettled.

136
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,203
Arlo, pick up.

137
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:52,836
He's not answering.

138
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:53,878
Try calling Mich.

139
00:13:55,171 --> 00:13:56,214
Mich.

140
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:41,818
Well?!

141
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:45,740
Don't you want to
see your daughter?

142
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,241
Do you?!

143
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,877
Sir, we have to help our friend.

144
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,505
Sir! I need your help!

145
00:16:05,677 --> 00:16:07,095
Wait! One second!

146
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,390
Are you alright, miss?

147
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:12,892
I'm fine, sir.

148
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,978
Sorry, I fell asleep.

149
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:18,273
I'm sorry about my
friends bothering you.

150
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:20,983
Alright.

151
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:22,318
Thank you, sir.

152
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:24,195
Alright.
You take care.

153
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:26,781
Come in, you guys.

154
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,243
Are you really fine, Cora?

155
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:34,998
What's been happening to you?

156
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,014
Someone's been visiting me.

157
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,183
It's a violent ghost.

158
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:57,895
Or entity, or whatever.

159
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Sorry.

160
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:07,822
But I fought it off.

161
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:09,324
She's gone.

162
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:10,950
I've--

163
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,368
I've gotten rid of her.

164
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:15,204
Are you sure?

165
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,044
I got rid of her.

166
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:22,628
She's gone.

167
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,423
Completely gone.

168
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,843
I'm back to my real self.

169
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,663
Can we stay with you, Cora?

170
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:36,517
Just for the night.

171
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,456
Just so we can watch over you.

172
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:39,646
Yeah.

173
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,783
Sure.

174
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:52,659
No problem.

175
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,328
But believe me,

176
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,374
I'm me.

177
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:00,958
I'm fine.

178
00:18:38,913 --> 00:18:39,997
Here.

179
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:45,753
What's this?

180
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,880
A cellphone.

181
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,923
My spare.

182
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:52,677
Only dating apps on there.

183
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,057
You use dating apps?

184
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:00,101
I used to.

185
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:01,936
Not anymore.

186
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:04,939
Well?

187
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:10,278
Don't you want a phone to
call your boyfriend with?

188
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:14,115
Or would you rather review
my dating app history?

189
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,245
I'd like to see your dating history.

190
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,663
Oh really?

191
00:19:20,663 --> 00:19:22,415
You won't have a phone then.

192
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:24,333
Thank you, Auntie.

193
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,210
You're welcome.

194
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,505
Go ahead.
Change the sim card.

195
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:43,478
Hello, Jess?

196
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:46,522
Sorry, I missed your call.
What was it about?

197
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:47,940
Mich!

198
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:49,066
Hi!

199
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:52,987
How have you been
these past couple days?

200
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:56,741
Has anything been bothering you?

201
00:19:58,367 --> 00:19:59,285
Not really.

202
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,661
Why do you ask?

203
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,206
Mich.

204
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:04,957
Come on.
You can tell me.

205
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,461
I already know that you,
Cora, Timmy and Arlo

206
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:09,879
went to the lighthouse.

207
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:13,007
So, again,

208
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:15,426
have you been feeling
anything strange?

209
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:25,937
I really haven't.

210
00:20:25,937 --> 00:20:26,729
Why?

211
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:27,855
What happened?

212
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:30,525
Okay.

213
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:31,400
Uh, well...

214
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,445
We're at Cora's condo.

215
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,948
She's been feeling
something from

216
00:20:36,948 --> 00:20:39,325
the woman from the lighthouse.

217
00:20:40,493 --> 00:20:41,202
What?

218
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:45,540
Please take care of Cora for me.

219
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:47,959
I'll be going there,
but not tonight.

220
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:52,463
If anything happens,
let me know.

221
00:20:53,297 --> 00:20:54,674
Okay, will do.

222
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:56,133
You too.

223
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:58,553
Take care of yourselves, please.

224
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:52,564
Hello?

225
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,902
Are you ready to talk?

226
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:00,323
Sorry babe, I was just
a little tired.

227
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,492
Aren't you going to
ask what happened?

228
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:05,661
What happened?

229
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:08,915
I broke my phone.

230
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,878
I'm using Auntie's phone right now.

231
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,298
Sorry, I didn't even ask.

232
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,843
Babe, tomorrow...

233
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,513
Mom and Dad are
asking to have lunch.

234
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,223
Oh?

235
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:27,642
Is it their anniversary?

236
00:22:29,143 --> 00:22:32,313
No, it's not that.
They just want to talk.

237
00:22:32,313 --> 00:22:34,565
And I'd like you to come with me.

238
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:39,278
You know that when it comes
to my parents

239
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,490
I somehow always feel a bit down.

240
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:45,993
So I need someone to boost my spirits.

241
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:49,705
Sure, babe.

242
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,040
I'll be there.

243
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:52,583
I'll take care of you.

244
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,711
Thank you, babe.

245
00:22:55,711 --> 00:22:56,754
I love you.

246
00:22:57,254 --> 00:22:58,339
I love you.

247
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,024
You're safe.

248
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:43,277
You're safe now.

249
00:25:22,274 --> 00:25:23,317
How are you?

250
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:28,531
I'm doing okay.

251
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:30,491
What about you?

252
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,912
How long have you been
with Jessie?

253
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:43,129
Three months?

254
00:25:44,964 --> 00:25:46,132
Three months.

255
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,177
And she's still hiding the fact that
you're dating?

256
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,764
What's the shame in going
out with you?

257
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,898
It probably isn't like that.

258
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,444
Doesn't it hurt you, Pipo?

259
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:09,697
Don't you get offended?

260
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:40,102
Are you okay?

261
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,021
I'm good.

262
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,565
Do you want anything?

263
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,399
Sit.

264
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,628
Do you want water?

265
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:55,033
Sure.

266
00:26:58,662 --> 00:26:59,662
Here.

267
00:27:11,425 --> 00:27:15,095
You don't have to put on
this brave act for me, Timmy.

268
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,977
I don't need your protection.

269
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,538
I don't like you, Timmy.

270
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:33,656
I don't like men

271
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:35,927
without balls.

272
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:39,633
Sorry, Timmy.

273
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:09,315
Just a minute.

274
00:28:12,903 --> 00:28:13,903
Babe!

275
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:17,157
Shit. Lunch is today.

276
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:20,577
Why aren't you ready?

277
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,080
Don't worry, babe.

278
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,914
Give me five minutes.

279
00:28:25,249 --> 00:28:26,249
Come in.

280
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,811
Wait for me.

281
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:29,586
Wait.

282
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:31,087
It'll just be a minute.

283
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:11,670
What's bothering you?

284
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,718
Arlo?

285
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:18,814
He's a nice guy.

286
00:29:23,474 --> 00:29:24,474
Babe!

287
00:29:25,017 --> 00:29:26,017
Come on!

288
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:31,982
I'll be quick.

289
00:29:54,922 --> 00:29:55,922
Cora

290
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:57,800
we'll be leaving now.

291
00:29:58,217 --> 00:30:00,344
Are you sure you'll be alright?

292
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,013
Of course. I'll be fine.

293
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:21,031
Here.

294
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:25,018
If something happens,
you'll have a way in.

295
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:28,371
Okay.

296
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,164
Alright, then.

297
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:32,793
Take care.

298
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:34,586
You too, take care.

299
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:40,175
Are you sure you're okay?

300
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:59,903
What's your plan after graduating?

301
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:03,991
I've been meaning to land a job.

302
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:08,203
Actually, at my last internship

303
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:09,872
they're offering me a position.

304
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:11,956
In which field?

305
00:31:13,984 --> 00:31:15,043
Transport.

306
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:18,039
It's only a startup though.

307
00:31:18,797 --> 00:31:19,339
Oh no.

308
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:20,507
A startup?

309
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:22,426
That's especially difficult.

310
00:31:22,801 --> 00:31:24,344
Especially, the local ones.

311
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:29,367
It's better to go to an
established company first.

312
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:31,018
Learn from them.

313
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:34,521
It would be much better
to do what Arlo did.

314
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:37,441
Get a masteral degree to learn more.

315
00:31:39,122 --> 00:31:41,278
That's the thing with you Gen-Z's.

316
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:43,322
You're always rushing things.

317
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:50,913
Where is Lilia?

318
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:53,582
Where is Lilia?

319
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:56,834
Are you okay, babe?

320
00:31:59,171 --> 00:31:59,671
Yea--

321
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:02,716
Arlo's mind is somewhere else again.

322
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:06,929
When will you ever change that?

323
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:09,014
Can't you be present?

324
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:15,938
You're only a substitute for your sibling.

325
00:32:15,938 --> 00:32:18,440
An unloved replacement.

326
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,942
Shut up!

327
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,201
Sorry, sorry.

328
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:30,786
Sorry, Dad. Sorry, Mom.

329
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,206
As I was saying,

330
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:37,960
won't an LDR setup
be hard on you, Mich?

331
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,214
Um, actually--

332
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:45,842
Mich already decided
to go to Australia.

333
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:48,011
With me. Both of us.

334
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:05,028
This is good news that you're going
with Arlo to Australia.

335
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:07,155
Someone can take care of him.

336
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:09,700
You'll be able to clean

337
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,285
and cook for him.

338
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:15,747
Arlo here is very excited to go.

339
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,125
He's excited to learn more.

340
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:20,459
Right, son?

341
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,772
Really?

342
00:33:23,797 --> 00:33:26,425
I'm just a substitute because your
last kid was an addict.

343
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:27,943
Arlo!

344
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:29,094
Watch your mouth!

345
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:30,679
It's the truth.

346
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:32,781
Where is your favorite, anyway?
Still in rehab?

347
00:33:32,806 --> 00:33:35,332
You better be grateful

348
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,988
if you don't want to lose
your allowance

349
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:39,938
and live on the street.

350
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:49,781
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- No, sit down.

351
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:05,963
Arlo!

352
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:10,302
What's wrong with him?

353
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:17,975
Babe.

354
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:19,477
Babe!

355
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:22,322
What the fuck, Arlo?

356
00:34:22,898 --> 00:34:23,982
What are you doing--

357
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:25,025
Are you insane?

358
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:29,904
Arlo,

359
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,742
I haven't agreed to go to
Australia with you.

360
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,370
What? Don't I have a choice?

361
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,705
What are you even
complaining about?

362
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,707
It's the best thing for the two of us.

363
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:41,792
Us?

364
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,795
For you, maybe.
But for me?

365
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:51,718
I still have plans here, Arlo.

366
00:34:52,427 --> 00:34:53,427
So, please.

367
00:34:54,596 --> 00:34:56,598
My world doesn't
revolve around you.

368
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:07,693
You can't even control her.

369
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:09,111
Weakling.

370
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:11,905
You should control her.

371
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,323
You're a weakling!

372
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,910
You should control her.

373
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:18,495
You're a weakling!

374
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,961
That kid is still the same.

375
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,088
Still a wuss.

376
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:32,092
He's the dumbest one.

377
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:35,303
At least the eldest is smart.

378
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:37,806
He's the best one.

379
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:50,193
We're leaving.

380
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:16,552
Jasmin.

381
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Who's there?

382
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Babe.

383
00:36:57,844 --> 00:36:58,845
We're leaving.

384
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:51,147
Mich, help me. Mich!

385
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:04,828
Babe, please give us a chance.

386
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:08,832
Hello, friend.

387
00:38:08,832 --> 00:38:10,041
What happened to you?

388
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,835
What's happening?
Are you okay?

389
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,089
Burn it.

390
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:17,841
You also had

391
00:38:18,216 --> 00:38:19,426
spirit cleansing, right?

392
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:21,678
Didn't you

393
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,222
feel anything or if you're
having visions?

394
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,459
Leave me alone.

395
00:38:31,313 --> 00:38:33,189
I can't believe what happened
in the lighthouse.

396
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,775
That's why it's haunted.

397
00:38:38,194 --> 00:38:39,029
My child,

398
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,480
we need to follow what
your father wants.

399
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:44,868
We need to be together again.
