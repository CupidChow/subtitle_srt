1
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,435
You know that when
it comes to my parents

2
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,741
I always feel so down.

3
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,091
So I might need someone
to boost my morale.

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,520
Sure babe.

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,647
Why aren't you ready yet?

6
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,098
Give me five minutes.

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,375
Stay right there.

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,013
How've you been these
past couple days?

9
00:00:32,815 --> 00:00:34,901
Has anything been bothering you?

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,827
Not really.

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,371
Why do you ask?

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,665
We already know that you,
Cora, Timmy and Arlo

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,667
went to the lighthouse.

14
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:49,194
They don't love you.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,601
Shut up!

16
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:03,154
Cora!

17
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,906
Cora!

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,431
She must be ashamed of you, Pipo.

19
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:14,271
Doesn't it hurt your ego, Pipo?

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,917
Don't you feel insulted?

21
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,461
I'm sorry, Timmy.

22
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,662
But I'm not attracted to you.

23
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,054
I don't like cowards

24
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:26,980
and men without balls.

25
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:31,516
Mich already decided to go to Australia.

26
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,017
With me.
Both of us.

27
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,187
We're leaving now.

28
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,773
Are you sure you'll be alright?

29
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,400
Of course.
I'll be fine.

30
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,492
Are you sure you're alright?

31
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,828
So you're giving me no choice?

32
00:01:52,537 --> 00:01:53,996
Why are you even complaining?

33
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,124
It's for the best of both of us.

34
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:57,458
For us?

35
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:01,545
- For you maybe, but for me...
- You should have full control over her.

36
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:03,589
You are a weakling.

37
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,134
You should have full
control over her.

38
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,386
You are a weakling.

39
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:30,035
I'm sorry, Eduardo.

40
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:31,619
I just

41
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:37,519
got a bit occupied

42
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:41,093
so I...

43
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,833
I burnt them.

44
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,422
The...

45
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,908
This reminds me of something.

46
00:04:57,054 --> 00:04:58,889
I had a friend in the platoon.

47
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,348
A brother.

48
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,476
Trusted him with my life.

49
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,512
Mario.

50
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:10,109
He got shot so he was sent home.

51
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,902
And then I find out

52
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,908
that he laid with my wife.

53
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,254
That's not true.

54
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,674
Do you know what I do to people

55
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,385
who try to fool me, Jasmin?

56
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Huh?

57
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:41,307
I burn them alive.

58
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,917
The youngest hasn't
changed at all.

59
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,359
Still a wuss.

60
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:01,792
He's the dumbest one.

61
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:04,883
At least we have the eldest.

62
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,084
He's our only hope.

63
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,972
We're leaving.

64
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,942
Babe.

65
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:35,987
We're leaving.

66
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:45,537
Why?
What about your parents?

67
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,538
Forget about them.

68
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:47,748
We need to talk.

69
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,833
Babe

70
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,825
my family is taking care
of everything.

71
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,383
Why won't you come?
What's the issue here?

72
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,689
Babe, won't you give us
a chance?

73
00:07:16,156 --> 00:07:17,324
Mich!

74
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,446
Help me!

75
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:20,448
Mich!

76
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,324
Sorry babe, I have to go.

77
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:26,536
Babe?

78
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:43,428
Hello, Cora

79
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,680
sorry I got cut off.
What happened?

80
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,933
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

81
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,538
I just need to see you, Mich.

82
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:52,815
There are things we need to
talk about.

83
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:55,680
Alright then.

84
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:56,956
I'm on my way.

85
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,786
I've been ignoring it
for the past days

86
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,897
but lately

87
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,341
the visions have
been getting worse.

88
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,272
You've been seeing them too?

89
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:20,831
Come with me.

90
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,338
Come with me, Jasmin.

91
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:29,077
Don't let her take me.

92
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,677
Burn it all.

93
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,079
Burn it all.

94
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,498
Burn it all.

95
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,461
Burn it all.

96
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:01,215
Burn it all.

97
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:05,010
Burn it all.

98
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,616
- Cora.
- Mich.

99
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:35,123
Sorry I couldn't make it
last night.

100
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,709
Do you feel alright?

101
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,836
I'm fine.

102
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:42,273
What about you?

103
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,299
Are you okay?

104
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,251
Arlo and I had a fight.

105
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,056
What? Really?

106
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,348
Hold on.

107
00:10:09,658 --> 00:10:11,242
Here, drink this.

108
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,120
It'll help.

109
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,831
Thank you, Cora.

110
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,848
Why did you call?
What happened?

111
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,733
Where is Jasmin?!

112
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:39,099
- Jes, I'll be going.
- Yeah. See you.

113
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:46,749
Three months...

114
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:50,884
And she still hides the fact that
you're going out.

115
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,305
I think she's ashamed of you Pipo.

116
00:11:59,727 --> 00:12:00,727
Hey!

117
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,649
What are you looking at?!

118
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,376
Asshole!

119
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,420
Doesn't it hurt to
be treated like that?

120
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,072
Don't you feel insulted?

121
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,466
Pipo...

122
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,103
Bro.

123
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,632
Where have you been all day?

124
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,182
We couldn't reach you.

125
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,208
Well?

126
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:10,941
What was that?

127
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,092
Where have you been all day?

128
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,761
We've been trying to contact you.

129
00:13:17,481 --> 00:13:19,629
Um... We...

130
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:22,309
Mich and I just went to lunch.

131
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:24,451
Oh yeah.

132
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,741
With your parents, right?

133
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,066
Sorry.

134
00:13:31,388 --> 00:13:33,332
The thing with Cora got intense.

135
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,301
It got shitty.

136
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,910
Wait.

137
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:44,915
Didn't you go to a spirit cleansing too?

138
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,671
I did.

139
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,049
Do you...

140
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:57,636
Get those visions too?

141
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,703
Are you alright?

142
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,816
Of course.

143
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:37,354
Sorry, we're closed.

144
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,507
What's wrong?
What happened?

145
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,545
Hey,

146
00:15:55,546 --> 00:15:56,964
did you know?

147
00:15:57,941 --> 00:15:59,901
Something terrible did
happen at that lighthouse.

148
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,970
No wonder it's haunted.

149
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:05,264
Get this.

150
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,724
The father was a monster.

151
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,563
This asshole

152
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:14,314
killed his entire family before
killing himself.

153
00:16:18,738 --> 00:16:20,229
Who's even capable of that?

154
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:58,777
Good evening Arlo,
have you seen Mich?

155
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,905
I can't seem to reach her.

156
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,615
Uh, no...

157
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:05,242
I haven't seen her, Auntie.

158
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,243
Is that so?

159
00:17:06,268 --> 00:17:09,687
Let me know if you see her.

160
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:50,813
Cora, have you seen Mitch?

161
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,999
I can't seem to reach her.

162
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,345
No, Auntie.

163
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:01,340
Oh, then let me know if you
hear from her.

164
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:02,966
Yes, Auntie. I will.

165
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,594
Thank you!

166
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,025
Just leave it.

167
00:18:48,346 --> 00:18:50,415
Someone might see you.

168
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:54,360
- Pipo...
- It's a shame.

169
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,759
It's not like that.

170
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,923
I'm sorry.

171
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,032
I'm not ashamed of you.

172
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:16,541
I just feel that I still have so
much to prove to my parents.

173
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,276
That...

174
00:19:28,253 --> 00:19:30,881
That I moved here

175
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,547
and that I made the right decision

176
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:36,587
to become independent.

177
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:43,318
To prove that I could fulfill my
dreams and not theirs.

178
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:50,642
And Pipo, I'm still not there yet.

179
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,831
And I'm sorry.

180
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,585
I'm sorry

181
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:10,011
that I can't introduce you
as my boyfriend.

182
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:17,048
But it's not because you are
unworthy I promise you.

183
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:18,699
It's just me.

184
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,603
It's that I just have so
much to prove.

185
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:26,798
I'm really sorry that I
made you feel this way.

186
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:31,906
Jessie,

187
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,160
you are enough.

188
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,595
Enough for me.

189
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,211
You're the most important
person for me.

190
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,170
I can wait.

191
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,600
I'll wait until

192
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:04,232
you're proud enough to
introduce me as your boyfriend.

193
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,729
Hello?

194
00:21:43,646 --> 00:21:44,772
Cora,

195
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,747
is Mich there?

196
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,564
Jessie!

197
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,518
Pipo?

198
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,572
Are you two dating?

199
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:48,408
He's my boyfriend.

200
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:16,441
I'm sorry dear,

201
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:17,944
but I have to do this.

202
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:21,530
I can't let my daughter get away.

203
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:27,118
Jasmin,

204
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,705
we must obey your father.

205
00:25:30,706 --> 00:25:33,000
We must be whole again.

206
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:49,415
Stop crying.

207
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,186
Why did you leave?

208
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,231
Can't I go?

209
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,041
Can't we leave the lighthouse?

210
00:25:59,944 --> 00:26:03,864
I just want to play outside.

211
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,967
You can always play with me.

212
00:26:08,202 --> 00:26:09,745
But Ma...

213
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:11,845
Jasmin,

214
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:14,375
let's just do what your father wants.

215
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,455
Jasmin,

216
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,675
don't be stubborn

217
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:30,588
Why is Dad always angry with me?

218
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:33,228
Doesn't he love me?

219
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,017
That's not true.

220
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:39,150
- But Ma...
- That's not true.

221
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,680
Your father loves us.

222
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:53,664
That's the reason why he does this.

223
00:26:54,665 --> 00:26:56,458
Understand?

224
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,402
Why are you here, anyway?

225
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:37,500
I think something's wrong with Cora.

226
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:39,960
Arlo too.

227
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,464
Arlo?

228
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:45,508
Yeah.

229
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:48,552
I can't explain it.

230
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,022
Cora.

231
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,915
Is Mich there?

232
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,570
Eduardo?

233
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:15,788
Lilia.

234
00:28:54,285 --> 00:29:00,499
Come home, Mikay, my love.

235
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:08,549
Come home, Mikay, my love.

236
00:29:09,842 --> 00:29:16,432
Come home, Mikay, my love.

237
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,981
Come home, Mikay, my love.

238
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:49,315
Jasmin?

239
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,841
Jasmin!

240
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,444
Jasmin!

241
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,305
Jasmin!

242
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:04,224
Jasmin!

243
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:48,018
Babe!

244
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,856
Mich,

245
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:59,342
I'm sorry for not trying
to understand.

246
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,712
But ever since I went to
Nana Conching

247
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:09,635
I've begun understand more and more.

248
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:20,092
You went too?

249
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,056
It sounded like Arlo was speaking
to someone.

250
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:30,811
Their names were Lilia
and Eduardo, I think.

251
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:36,885
Lilia and Eduardo?

252
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:41,955
They were

253
00:33:42,892 --> 00:33:45,096
the couple that died in the lighthouse.

254
00:33:47,032 --> 00:33:51,723
And the elder folk used to say

255
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:54,793
that they've haunted that
place ever since.

256
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:56,781
But

257
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:04,094
how would they
possess Arlo and Cora?

258
00:34:06,638 --> 00:34:08,265
Fuck.

259
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:13,729
Is this because of the
spiritual cleansing?

260
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:16,564
'cause what I know is that

261
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:20,027
Mich and Cora went to a
shaman near your province.

262
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:23,976
You mean Nana Conching?

263
00:34:24,448 --> 00:34:25,615
Yes.

264
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,546
Arlo mentioned it.

265
00:34:28,164 --> 00:34:30,291
He went back for a cleansing too.

266
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,725
You went to the lighthouse.

267
00:35:12,204 --> 00:35:13,664
Eduardo?

268
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:18,813
I'm with our daughter.

269
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,776
We own these bodies now.

270
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,136
What do you mean, Eduardo?

271
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,610
Nothing will come between us now.

272
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:06,070
- Don't!
- Let me go.

273
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:10,301
We can't do this alone.

274
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:12,848
We need to ask for help.

275
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:20,229
Jessie,

276
00:36:21,857 --> 00:36:22,857
Timmy,

277
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,986
It's me. It's Mich.

278
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,071
Won't you please believe me?

279
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:32,034
This is about our friends.

280
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:40,879
This isn't right.

281
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,046
You're nothing.
A weakling!

282
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,734
Through this ritual

283
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,051
we will encounter the

284
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:52,594
living and the dead.

285
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:07,943
The three of us will be together.

286
00:37:07,944 --> 00:37:09,307
Even in the next life.

287
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:11,448
Us and our daughter.

288
00:37:13,575 --> 00:37:17,120
How does it feel to be
a disgrace to your lover?

289
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,240
Why? It's the fact, right?

290
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:22,501
Just shut up.

291
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,461
You and I are the same.

292
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:30,342
How can they love us if
they are ashamed of us?

293
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,136
That's enough!

294
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:37,556
Won't you stop?!

295
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:38,766
Won't you just stop it?!

296
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:41,228
That's enough, Eduardo!
