1
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,445
Did you ever wish that you
could freeze time?

2
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,033
I want to freeze this moment.

3
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,581
Babe?

4
00:00:36,135 --> 00:00:38,137
You always knew I could see them.

5
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:39,931
Ever since I was young.

6
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:43,434
Babe, I believe you but

7
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:45,560
It could just be paranoia

8
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:47,563
from that spirit cleansing.

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,360
I made you go to the cleansing because
I wanted to help you.

11
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:53,818
To help us.

12
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:55,988
It seems like it got even worse.

13
00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:03,287
Have you seen my sketchpad?

14
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:04,946
Did you take it by any chance?

15
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,457
No. What would I do with that?

16
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,629
You and Arlo take care of yourselves.

17
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,550
Come with me.

18
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,406
Jasmin?

19
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,399
My child, Jasmin!

20
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:27,682
Come here, child.

21
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,890
Come here.

22
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:32,603
Are you okay?

23
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:33,603
Jasmin.

24
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:36,856
Eduardo!

25
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,563
Eduardo, help!

26
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,818
My child.

27
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,152
Are you okay, Jasmine?

28
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,219
- Eduardo!
- Friend!

29
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you okay?

30
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,044
Are you okay?

31
00:03:58,838 --> 00:03:59,838
Friend?

32
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,341
Come, Jasmin.

33
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:05,093
What did you say?

34
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:09,231
Ow, ow...

35
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Hey, you're hurting me.

36
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,200
Friend, you're hurting me.

37
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,232
Coraline May de Jesus...

38
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,109
Can you still go on?

39
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:21,401
Huh?

40
00:04:21,944 --> 00:04:22,944
Are you alright?

41
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,534
What's wrong?

42
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:34,456
What is it?

43
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:36,082
Are you okay?

44
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,058
Want me to come with you?
I could stay over.

45
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:46,402
No need.
I'll be fine.

46
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,144
And you have that...

47
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:50,681
That tutoring job tomorrow morning.

48
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:53,975
Are you sure?

49
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,298
Guys, bye.

50
00:04:59,523 --> 00:05:02,025
I had a great, great birthday.

51
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,736
You all made it so special.

52
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:05,321
It was so touching.

53
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:08,281
I love you guys!

54
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:10,659
- I love you!
- I love you, Cora!

55
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,827
I love you, too.

56
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,608
So yeah,

57
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:15,997
I'll go ahead too.

58
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,081
Mich..

59
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,874
Take care of yourselves.

60
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
Take care!

61
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,107
So?

62
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:26,725
It's us three again.

63
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,595
You know what that means.
Arrozcaldo.

64
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:33,056
Hang on.

65
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:34,098
What?

66
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,936
Is Cora going to be okay?

67
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,858
She'll be fine.

68
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:44,860
You know how she gets,

69
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,361
right?

70
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,490
She gets like this everytime
her birthday comes up.

71
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:56,080
It's just that she's been cold lately.

72
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:00,960
Did I offend her?
I'm overthinking if I did something.

73
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,713
Don't overthink it.

74
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:07,466
She's always had her demons.

75
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:11,511
You know it's too early for
you to dampen the mood.

76
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:12,847
Come on, let's go get Arrozcaldo.

77
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Wait, wait.

78
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Man,

79
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:19,078
could we get someone else to cook it?

80
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:20,433
Because, bro

81
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:24,625
I'm sorry but we all threw up

82
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,170
- last time you did the cooking.
- Huh?

83
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,569
Really?

84
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,047
You're joking.

85
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,949
Alright, don't you worry because

86
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,659
this time, we'll order take out.

87
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,411
What do you want?

88
00:06:35,412 --> 00:06:37,913
- What do you want to order?
- No, nevermind. I'm fine.

89
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:39,038
No need.

90
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,833
I'll just sleep in the car.

91
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,418
You guys enjoy being alone.

92
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,444
Okay, no take backs.

93
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,200
I was planning to foot the bill.

94
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,672
Oh, wow.

95
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:53,012
Anyway, enjoy yourselves.

96
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,723
- Just Arrozcaldo?
- Of course.

97
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:59,109
- "Just Arrozcaldo." No take backs.
- Of course, what are we gonna do?

98
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:00,853
What else? We're just ordering.

99
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,311
Yes, sir?

100
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:27,731
An order of black coffee.

101
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,650
For here or to go?

102
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:31,526
For here.

103
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,944
Two hundred pesos.

104
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:48,209
I missed you.

105
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:53,779
Cora and the others were
looking for you.

106
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,719
I already told Cora.

107
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,471
Nobody was covering my shift.

108
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:01,162
I didn't want a pay cut.

109
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:08,938
Where is the thing I asked?

110
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,357
- Did you even do it?
- I said sorry, didn't I?

111
00:09:10,358 --> 00:09:11,734
Hello, ma'am, sir.

112
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:13,584
Don't make a scene!

113
00:09:13,652 --> 00:09:14,862
Hi, ma'am, sir.

114
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,237
Just order so we can go.

115
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:18,072
Ma'am, I'd like a...

116
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:19,049
No more.

117
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,232
I've lost my appetite.

118
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,325
Order for your own!

119
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:23,276
I'll just drink coffee at home.

120
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,631
Let's not be like that.

121
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,968
Communication is the key.

122
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:51,982
Look at them.

123
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,151
Let's be that in 30 years.

124
00:09:56,403 --> 00:09:57,945
30 years?

125
00:09:57,946 --> 00:09:59,239
More like 40 years.

126
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:09,683
Here's your black coffee.

127
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,708
Drink.

128
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,210
Thanks.

129
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,467
You know,

130
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:23,639
even when I get diabetes,
I'll still order a Mocha frappe.

131
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:28,227
Because I know you'll be
there to take care of me, right?

132
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:30,687
You'd be crazy

133
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:31,687
and alone.

134
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:34,733
I'm being serious.

135
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,385
We won't be able to do this soon.

136
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,142
Come on.

137
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,101
We can still eat Arrozcaldo online.

138
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:13,202
The timezones aren't that far apart.

139
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,151
They don't have Arrozcaldo
in Australia.

140
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:20,087
I won't...

141
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,655
We won't be able to get that there.

142
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,246
But only if you say, yes

143
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,166
to the plan.

144
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,019
Well,

145
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,592
actually it's my plan.

146
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:38,713
Not ours.

147
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:41,675
Because you have yours.

148
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:42,758
A plan of your own.

149
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,220
And I respect that.

150
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,103
Oh and...

151
00:11:54,396 --> 00:11:57,107
I'm going back to the lighthouse.

152
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,186
- Babe!
- I'll look for your necklace.

153
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:01,211
Don't do that.

154
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,403
Why?

155
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:04,274
But it was important to you.

156
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:05,853
Your mom gave you that necklace.

157
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:19,338
When she gave me that necklace,

158
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:23,717
she promised me she'd
protect me no matter what.

159
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,848
That's why I'll look for your necklace.

160
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,016
And don't worry.

161
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,230
I'll protect you, too.

162
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,243
Why are you crying?

163
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,791
I'm not crying here, you are!

164
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,625
What? No!

165
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,709
- You're crying.
- No, I'm not.

166
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:01,046
You're crying.

167
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,662
No, its you!

168
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:05,383
No, I don't!

169
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,639
I only seem that way
because I'm drunk.

170
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:12,598
How could you get drunk?
You're not even allowed.

171
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:15,227
You had to drink light.
You're the designated driver.

172
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:16,019
Wow, you think I drank light?

173
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,062
Wow!

174
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,229
Yeah!

175
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:22,150
You can't drive if you're drunk.

176
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,194
I love you so much.

177
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,272
I love you too.

178
00:13:32,703 --> 00:13:33,905
You big sap.

179
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,655
Let's get going,
you're corny as hell.

180
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,584
I want to go to bed.

181
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:39,001
Bruh,

182
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:43,174
we weren't done eating.

183
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:49,385
Well, hurry up.

184
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,221
- I am.
- Finish up already.

185
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,097
Babe?

186
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,588
What are you humming?

187
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,627
Why are you humming?

188
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:03,108
This was what mom used to sing.

189
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,902
So we could get home safely.

190
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,782
A song to get home safe?

191
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,180
Teach it to me.

192
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,171
You try.

193
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Is that right?

194
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,806
No, that sounds like Superman.

195
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:37,486
What is that?

196
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:39,431
We'll come home safe.

197
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:41,937
Okay.

198
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,207
Mich?

199
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,544
Were you expecting a visitor?

200
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:48,422
I wasn't expecting Echo
'til later at 10am.

201
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,131
It's too early.

202
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,264
Babe!

203
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,683
Breakfast delivery, ma'am.

204
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,393
You didn't have to.

205
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,480
Didn't we just get a midnight snack?

206
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:06,982
This is nothing.

207
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,630
I'll never get tired of feeding you.

208
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:11,242
Oh, you...

209
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,822
Tita, this is Arlo.

210
00:16:14,823 --> 00:16:15,823
Breakfast!

211
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:18,480
Come in, have some coffee.

212
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,179
Thanks for accompanying me in my shift.

213
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,456
No problem.

214
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,019
Oh hey, Pipo and Jess!

215
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,902
- How are you?
- Anthony, hi!

216
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,074
You're together early.

217
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,216
We were just on our way to school.

218
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,428
I thought I'd go with her to enroll.

219
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:40,473
You can do that online, though.

220
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:42,808
Uhh, well...

221
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:47,814
We're going to the registrar
to sort out some problems.

222
00:16:48,023 --> 00:16:50,775
Oh, give my regards to Mich and Cora.

223
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,861
Bye Anthony, see you next time.

224
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:54,862
Bye, take care!

225
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,176
Oh no, I just realized Arlo.

226
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:19,971
We'll miss the free food when you go.

227
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,434
Uhm...

228
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,604
I could still send you
some even from abroad.

229
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:29,814
There's online food delivery.

230
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:31,566
- Really?!
- Yes!

231
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:33,269
Then I'll be counting on that!

232
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:36,636
Well, of course it'd be cash on delivery.

233
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:37,756
What?

234
00:17:37,781 --> 00:17:38,781
Nevermind!

235
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,367
How cheap!

236
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:45,746
Oh!

237
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:48,458
You two...

238
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:50,919
What did they say on TV...

239
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:56,299
I'm rooting for you.
We're all rooting for you.

240
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,051
Did I say that right?

241
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:00,554
Yes, thanks Auntie.

242
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,206
What you have is something special.

243
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:09,646
It's rare to find that kind of love.

244
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:15,485
Uh, Auntie,

245
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:18,738
don't you think it's
a little early to... uhm?

246
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:21,575
Is Auntie drunk or...?

247
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,327
No I'm not.
It was just an observation.

248
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:28,998
I for one

249
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:30,917
have never had a relationship.

250
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,421
Doesn't mean I'm blind to them.

251
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,695
What do they say nowadays?

252
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,406
"Problematic?"

253
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,436
"Full of red flags?"

254
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,461
Right?

255
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:45,390
Red flags?

256
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,632
Yes, red flags!

257
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:48,767
But you two,

258
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,640
are green flags!

259
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,895
And why?

260
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:56,066
Have you seen Melba's vegetable stall?

261
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,945
It's looks gray compared
to how green you are.

262
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,239
Auntie, if I may

263
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:03,283
what's happening?

264
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,134
Well...

265
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:05,159
Why?

266
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,700
Did I say something wrong?

267
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:08,996
It might have been
the food you brought.

268
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,833
You must've put
something in it, didn't you?

269
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:29,184
Pardon Auntie, I think she did
have something to drink.

270
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,936
It's fine. It's actually really cute.

271
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,605
She's so, so cute.

272
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,081
This early?

273
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:37,358
Hey.

274
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:42,113
I'm almost 50 but my ears are still sharp.

275
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,616
Those are some ears, Auntie.

276
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,201
But you might've misheard us.

277
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:48,787
- Oh, you!
- Let me carry that.

278
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,246
This is heavy.

279
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:51,331
Mich,

280
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,082
I'll be coming home late tonight.

281
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,044
I have to go to a funeral.
It was the Mayor's mistress.

282
00:19:57,879 --> 00:19:59,505
Oh, okay Auntie.

283
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:01,049
Let's go, I don't want to be late.

284
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,553
Thank you for driving Tita to city hall.

285
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:07,514
It's fine. I really don't mind.

286
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:09,306
Oh yeah!

287
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,558
Are you busy today?

288
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:12,768
Uh...

289
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:16,564
Uh yeah, yeah.
Errands with Mom.

290
00:20:17,565 --> 00:20:19,651
I'll probably be gone for the day.

291
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:21,777
Ohh..

292
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:24,086
Alright. Take care.

293
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:27,616
Love you.

294
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,078
I love you, too.

295
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:37,126
Take care.

296
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,603
Of course.

297
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,302
The city hall's not far.

298
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,173
This is really heavy.

299
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,845
Take care, Auntie.

300
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:26,009
Carry me.

301
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,248
I let myself in.

302
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,340
The gate was open.

303
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,633
Are you okay, Mich?

304
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,510
I'm fine. Come in.

305
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,918
6 minus 2?

306
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:46,088
Let's use our fingers.

307
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,173
Count to six.

308
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:49,412
Take away two.

309
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:50,871
How many is that?

310
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,219
Four.

311
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,971
Very good!

312
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,256
Easy isn't it?

313
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:57,934
- Okay, let's try..
- Did you get that?

314
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,839
Young lady,

315
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:30,464
someone's with you.

316
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,022
Hello, Mich

317
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Cora!

318
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,442
You were wasted last night.

319
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,659
- how are you feeling?
- Is this correct?

320
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:53,277
Cora.

321
00:23:56,784 --> 00:23:58,119
Mich, I think you were right.

322
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,663
I've been ignoring it these
past few days but lately,

323
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:04,855
The visions have been getting worse.

324
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:10,495
You've been seeing them too?

325
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,096
Was this because of the lighthouse?

326
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,350
Maybe.

327
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:22,809
It's possible.

328
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:25,730
But we weren't the only ones.

329
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,400
The moment you hear this sound

330
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,904
you must go back to your rightful selves.

331
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:36,531
Mich!

332
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:42,079
You must now be cautious.

333
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,206
Because they will follow.

334
00:24:44,207 --> 00:24:48,211
The positive energies
may attract the opposite.

335
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:51,756
We were the only ones who
went to the spirit cleansing.

336
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,549
Gosh I'm so sorry, Mich.

337
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,052
No, no. Don't say that!

338
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,006
This is not on you.

339
00:25:00,736 --> 00:25:02,446
Whatever it takes, we'll fix this.

340
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:39,178
Hi, Cors!

341
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,810
Hi, Cora!

342
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:56,279
Belated happy birthday, wanna
hangout tonight?

343
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:04,829
How are you?
I hope you're fine.

344
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,601
Cora,

345
00:26:29,228 --> 00:26:30,908
did something happen
between you and Timmy?

346
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,107
No! Are you crazy?

347
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:36,943
Well,

348
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:41,574
he told me that you were being
cold towards him.

349
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,285
Did he do something?

350
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:49,559
Hey, I'm back at the condo.

351
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,105
Thanks,

352
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:57,233
for listening to my long story.

353
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:01,445
I had to get that off my chest.

354
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,322
You were the only one I could tell.

355
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:10,079
Okay, well talk soon.

356
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:11,913
Bye.

357
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:13,999
Okay, Cora.
Happy Birthday.

358
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,125
I love you.

359
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,252
I love you too.

360
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,165
Where is Jasmin?!

361
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,583
Where is she?!

362
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,269
Echo, would you like some juice?

363
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,481
Yes, please.
Make it two.

364
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,368
Yes, of course. I'll tell Mich.

365
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:32,369
Don't worry.

366
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:46,342
Thank you, Mich.

367
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:58,437
Tastes good, right?

368
00:29:59,313 --> 00:30:01,274
Shit!

369
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,780
Mich, that's a bad word.

370
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:21,668
Echo.

371
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:23,879
Who were you talking to?

372
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,341
Her name is Jasmin, ate.

373
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,262
What does she need from me?

374
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,222
She doesn't want to hurt you.

375
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,891
She just wants to play.

376
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:51,782
Hi, babe. How was your day with your mom?

377
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:55,870
It was good.
We're on our way back.

378
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,331
What about you? Are you okay?

379
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:01,125
I'm fine. We're almost done here.

380
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,170
Okay, call you later.

381
00:31:04,795 --> 00:31:05,795
Alright, babe.

382
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,356
Okay.

383
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:08,799
Take care.
Love you.

384
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,550
Love you, too.

385
00:31:16,015 --> 00:31:17,015
Echo?

386
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,316
Echo?

387
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:29,434
Echo?

388
00:31:37,261 --> 00:31:38,261
Echo?

389
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,289
Echo?

390
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,177
Find us if you can!

391
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,436
Come home, Echo,

392
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:04,897
my love.

393
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,444
Come home,

394
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:12,487
Echo,

395
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:18,509
Mich!

396
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:19,786
Echo!

397
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:32,257
Echo!

398
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:36,886
Echo!

399
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:38,513
Echo!

400
00:32:38,842 --> 00:32:39,842
Mich!

401
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,224
Echo!

402
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,231
Why are you crying?

403
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:49,900
We're only playing.

404
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,569
Nothing.

405
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:55,447
Sit down.

406
00:32:57,658 --> 00:32:59,076
This'll be our secret, okay?

407
00:32:59,743 --> 00:33:00,995
Promise?

408
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,830
Promise.

409
00:33:16,343 --> 00:33:17,428
Did you go through with it?

410
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:20,931
Yeah, man.

411
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:22,515
Huh?

412
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:23,766
Why?

413
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:26,645
How'd you find your way?

414
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,440
Mich told me.

415
00:33:33,194 --> 00:33:34,194
You know, man

416
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,030
I just really want to understand Mich.

417
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,825
And true enough,
I started to feel better.

418
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,787
I confronted the memory
I've been avoiding for years.

419
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,417
What the fuck do
you want from me?!

420
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,049
I need Jasmin!

421
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:19,442
Jasmin, what do you want from me?

422
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,945
I've had enough of these games.

423
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:32,615
Don't let her take me.

424
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:42,735
Babe!

425
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,610
- Hello?!
- Hello?!

426
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:45,988
Why are you yelling?

427
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:56,956
Mich?

428
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:59,333
Has anything been bothering you?

429
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:01,795
No. Why do you ask?

430
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:05,123
Have you been feeling
anything strange?

431
00:38:16,393 --> 00:38:17,573
You're safe.

432
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,729
You know that when
it comes to my parents,

433
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:23,631
I'm always feeling down.

434
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:27,237
So, I need someone
to boost my morale.

435
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:29,071
Sure, babe.

436
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,115
I'll do it.

437
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:34,578
What's been going on with you?

438
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:37,539
I've been seeing them.

439
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:40,875
Arlo?

440
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,336
But he's a good guy.

441
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,630
Babe!

442
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:47,215
Let's go.
