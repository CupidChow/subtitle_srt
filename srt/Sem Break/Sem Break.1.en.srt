1
00:00:34,893 --> 00:00:36,562
Mikay?

2
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:50,325
Mikay?

3
00:01:09,553 --> 00:01:11,221
Mikay, dear

4
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:13,265
what's wrong?

5
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:18,478
Come here.

6
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,399
Come.

7
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:29,407
Is everything okay?

8
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:31,909
Papa's waiting for us.

9
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,370
But, Ma...

10
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,081
You wouldn't want Papa
to get mad, do you?

11
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:42,686
Ma, I saw you and Papa...

12
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:43,879
In the car,

13
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:46,298
covered in blood.

14
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:48,716
What?

15
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:55,224
Baby, those are not real.

16
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,269
Those are just nightmares.

17
00:02:00,145 --> 00:02:01,397
But, Ma...

18
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,316
Come here.

19
00:02:07,986 --> 00:02:13,701
♪ Don't cry, Mikay, my love... ♪

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,750
♪ Don't cry, Mikay, my love... ♪

21
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:29,925
♪ Don't cry, Mikay, my love... ♪

22
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:50,368
♪ Go home, Mikay, my love... ♪

23
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,991
Why'd you keep singing that?

24
00:02:55,075 --> 00:03:00,497
Mom, used to sing it to me
everytime we'd go out.

25
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,084
so we don't leave
the child's soul behind.

26
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,796
You really believe that?

27
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
Why not?

28
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:29,344
Hey...

29
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,403
Baby,

30
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,782
Mama's right here.

31
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,450
I'm not leaving you.

32
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:56,548
Babe? What's wrong?

33
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,468
You okay?

34
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:01,719
Are you alright?

35
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,222
I'm fine.

36
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,143
Why did you have to wake up, friend?

37
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,062
I'd rather someone else wake up.

38
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:11,563
How annoying.

39
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,360
Wow,

40
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,279
even when I'm asleep,
you're still obsessed with me.

41
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,770
Oh, wow. The nerve!

42
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,825
And how did you even know
I was referring to you?

43
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:25,410
I did not even mention your name.

44
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:27,829
You know,

45
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,207
even when I'm asleep I can
still sense that big mouth.

46
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,018
Eww,

47
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:33,919
obsessed.

48
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:35,712
"Eww, notice me."

49
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,008
I don't snore like that, do I babe?

50
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,594
Of course, not.

51
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:44,137
You're much worse.

52
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:44,888
It's like,

53
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,264
"Arlo!"

54
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,517
"Arlo!"

55
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:49,893
As if!

56
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,150
You idiot. I'd never do that!

57
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,371
That's enough, you love birds.
Save it for later.

58
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:56,775
Arlo, eyes on the road.

59
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,868
You know, my auntie told me that
since we're graduating students,

60
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:03,991
We're closer to danger.

61
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,827
Hey, don't be so sure that
we all get to graduate!

62
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:07,619
Oh,

63
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,706
you're one to talk Ms. Graduate.

64
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:13,166
You haven't even done
your part for the thesis.

65
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:14,332
Me? Really?

66
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,753
How am I the burden here?

67
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:18,255
I've done more work than you.

68
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,466
Wow, I'm the burden?

69
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:24,970
Pipo and I did Chapter One and Two!

70
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:26,596
The nerve!

71
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:27,848
Between you and Pipo,

72
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,891
he's the one capable of defending it.

73
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:32,602
All you did was doodle on the side!

74
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,814
Sure, take all the credit
while he's not here.

75
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,065
Hey, woah.

76
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:38,692
I call fake news.

77
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,819
Fine, let's put it up for a vote.

78
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:46,033
Hands up, if you think Timmy
is getting carried by the group.

79
00:07:47,325 --> 00:07:47,951
Friend,

80
00:07:48,326 --> 00:07:50,370
Hey, come on.

81
00:07:52,414 --> 00:07:57,044
Alright. Hands up, if you think
Cora's dragging us down.

82
00:07:58,003 --> 00:08:00,922
The nerve!

83
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,924
Bro.

84
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:04,968
- Oh, did you say something?
- Hands-up.

85
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:06,486
- Oh?
- Oh!

86
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:07,846
Hey, back me up here.

87
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:08,847
On what?

88
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,640
Just raise your hand, and...

89
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,100
I'll do the laundry for two weeks.

90
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,519
- Wow!
- Unbelievable.

91
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:15,771
Come on, three weeks!

92
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,398
One month!
Come on!

93
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:20,817
Like Jessie said:
Eyes on the road,

94
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:22,778
hands on the steering wheel.

95
00:08:23,612 --> 00:08:25,405
Let's just call it a tie.
Alright?

96
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,451
Guys,

97
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,871
let's make the most
of this last vacation

98
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:36,958
before the start of our
thesis next semester.

99
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:41,171
It'll be our graduation soon.

100
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,256
Will this be our last trip?

101
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,591
What's wrong with you?

102
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,967
Don't say that.

103
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:47,135
Knock on wood.

104
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:49,930
- Okay.
- Wood? Where?

105
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,616
There's no wood.

106
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,434
There! That's wood.

107
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,436
Here, this is made of wood.

108
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:58,129
Don't make fun of my car.

109
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,109
Hey Arlo, don't forget.
We've got to go to the grocery.

110
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,068
Yeah, here we go.

111
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:05,862
Pipo's still waiting
for us at the resort.

112
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:06,988
Okay, okay.

113
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:10,951
Man, who would have thought

114
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,285
Pipo was a rich kid.

115
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,872
Of course not. He and auntie
are caretakers at the property.

116
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:19,501
Wow, "auntie?"
You're that close?

117
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:20,784
"Auntie?"

118
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,421
Oh, go on.
Keep snoring.

119
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,340
I'd have gone back to
sleep if it weren't for you.

120
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,802
You're the one disturbing
us with all your snoring.

121
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,263
Why don't you go to sleep
and stop complaining.

122
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,508
We need to find a grocery.
Let me open maps.

123
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:29,653
Babe?

124
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,573
Babe, are you okay?

125
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,367
Babe?

126
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,955
What if,

127
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,000
we just go home?

128
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:45,103
Huh?

129
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,128
Why, babe?

130
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:51,334
Babe,

131
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,793
everything's fine. Okay?

132
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,103
Yeah, you're right--

133
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,982
Sorry, it's nothing.

134
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:08,485
It's just-- Nothing.

135
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:11,988
Let's go?

136
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:13,949
Mich,

137
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,870
why don't you stay in the car
while we go to the grocery, okay?

138
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,456
I'll stay with you, too.

139
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:23,416
Wow,

140
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,418
you just don't like
carrying groceries.

141
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,883
Are you sure you're okay?

142
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:33,968
Yeah!

143
00:11:39,224 --> 00:11:40,892
Okay, let's go.

144
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:55,699
A new outbreak has worried official--

145
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:01,663
There might be thunderstorm along
north. According to PAG-ASA's report --

146
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:11,006
I already warned you,
don't proceed. Get away--

147
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:14,843
I don't know what to do with
my sister anymore,

148
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:19,180
is she already mentally ill? I hope
you can help us.

149
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,352
Are these all the radio stations?

150
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,528
Hey, I know you're not okay.

151
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,543
Are you having recurring
nightmares again?

152
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,492
I saw--

153
00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:44,914
I saw visions of burned people.

154
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,460
I can't explain it but...

155
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,838
It felt too real.

156
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,765
We should get a spirit cleansing.

157
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,352
There's a popular spirit cleanser
not that far from here.

158
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,640
Spirit..

159
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:11,691
I have a friend in my charms
group who says it helped her.

160
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,152
What is it?

161
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,281
Basically, it's a way, a ritual
to rejuvenate the soul.

162
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:22,327
I already know that there's
something bothering you deep down.

163
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,004
This might help you.

164
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,709
We have time to go now.

165
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,587
We can be back before
they're done with the groceries.

166
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,425
Don't worry.

167
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,636
I'll join you.

168
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,012
I also need it.

169
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,100
Friend, you need this.

170
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,280
It'll just be a minute. Uh...

171
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,465
We'll be back,

172
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,699
before you finish your grocery.

173
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,017
Is that safe?

174
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,995
Of course, babe.

175
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,163
We're sure it's safe.

176
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,314
Cora's driving.

177
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,002
Alright, fine.

178
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:14,379
Just take care.

179
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,797
Okay, babe.

180
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,301
Thank you.
I love you.

181
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:19,426
Okay, I lov--

182
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,978
Okay, let's go.

183
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,873
Hi, hello ma'am.

184
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,625
Is this the home of Madame Con--

185
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,335
"Nana" Conching.

186
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,510
The reason we came--

187
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,846
I've been expecting you two.

188
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:05,860
Come in.

189
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,018
Hurry, let's go!

190
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:13,146
Let's go!

191
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:34,042
The ritual is intended to
grant peace to your spiritual selves.

192
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:39,214
This may lighten your burdens.

193
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,132
For this to happen,

194
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:44,302
it is essential to give,

195
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:50,058
open up your souls

196
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:51,768
and face

197
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,729
that which burdens them the most.

198
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,065
Especially you, dear.

199
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,583
Free your hearts and minds.

200
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:20,255
Let your souls travel
wherever they please

201
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,923
to a dream

202
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,592
or a memory.

203
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,847
But the moment you hear this sound,

204
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:33,393
you must return to your selves.

205
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,477
Is that clear?

206
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,106
Let us begin.

207
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:26,946
I miss you.

208
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,366
Pa, Ma...

209
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,791
I hope you're watching from above.

210
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,424
I hope I've made you proud.

211
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:05,193
Don't leave!
You like it here, don't you?

212
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:08,946
Stay here!
This was your fault!

213
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,121
Hey, hey. Wake up!

214
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,499
Mich! Wake up, friend!

215
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,505
Friend! Wake up!

216
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:27,507
Mich!

217
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,300
Follow this sound!

218
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:31,385
Louder!

219
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:34,138
Friend! Wake up!

220
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:44,273
Don't cry.

221
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,114
Mikay...

222
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:48,757
You did nothing wrong.

223
00:18:50,722 --> 00:18:53,475
♪ Don't cry, Mikay, ♪

224
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,877
♪ my love. ♪

225
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,374
♪ Go home, Mikay, ♪

226
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,459
♪ my love. ♪

227
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:08,339
Mich!

228
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,596
Friend!

229
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,058
Friend!

230
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:41,706
Are you okay?

231
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,876
Are you okay?

232
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,673
I'm okay.

233
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,801
Alright.

234
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,223
Arlo and the others...

235
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,478
Okay, let's go.

236
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:05,188
Let me help you.

237
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:21,621
Friend,

238
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,417
we better not tell them what happened.

239
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,920
Especially, Arlo.

240
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,423
I don't want him to worry about me.

241
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,803
Sure, but

242
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,513
how are you?

243
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:41,849
I actually feel better.

244
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,976
That's good!

245
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:46,062
And you?

246
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,980
How do you feel?

247
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:50,566
Better.

248
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:53,820
You know what

249
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:56,572
before this sembreak ends,

250
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:59,617
I think I should reconnect with my mom.

251
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:01,619
It's about time.

252
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:07,917
Let's go.

253
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:19,345
Now that you have
unburdened yourselves,

254
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,639
you must be careful.

255
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:24,058
Because they will follow.

256
00:21:24,058 --> 00:21:27,854
The positive energies
attract the opposite.

257
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,056
Sorry.

258
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:48,351
Hey,

259
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,626
yeah, that will do.

260
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,295
They're here.

261
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,383
Yeah, will do.

262
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
See you.

263
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,147
Are we lost?

264
00:22:54,857 --> 00:22:58,527
I'm not sure, babe.
The maps say it's here.

265
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,238
Hey, look! It's beautiful.

266
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:03,991
Let's just come back later or tomorrow.

267
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:07,453
That's not on our itinerary.

268
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,822
Phew.

269
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,262
We missed you, Pipo!

270
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,598
That was a long drive.

271
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,892
Oh wait, I have to ask,

272
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:32,228
where are your parents?

273
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,565
Mom's at the other property,

274
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,401
and the owner's not here.

275
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,610
So,

276
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,820
we have this to ourselves for the weekend.

277
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,154
- Whoa!
- Perfect!

278
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:46,659
Hey, sorry we arrived so late.

279
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:49,613
It's alright. Jessie called ahead.

280
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,499
Okay well, guys remember,

281
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,127
girls' room on the left and
boys' room on the right.

282
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:56,877
Okay?

283
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,337
- Okay.
- Okay.

284
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,630
We should get settled.

285
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,424
Oh, by the way,

286
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,843
we passed a lighthouse
on the way here.

287
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,219
Can we go there?

288
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:08,264
Don't even think about going there.

289
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:10,391
Huh? Why?

290
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,226
Don't be a killjoy.

291
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,774
Okay.

292
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,026
- Let's go.
- Come on.

293
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,569
Let's go, let's go boys!

294
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:24,363
Give me that.
I know you expect me to do this.

295
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:50,681
I... I still see it, babe.

296
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,560
It's gotten worse.

297
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:02,818
I've... I've been seeing these...

298
00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:07,490
Visions of burned people.

299
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:11,535
Like premonitions.

300
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,165
They're scaring me.

301
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,753
Wait.

302
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:24,631
Okay.

303
00:25:25,174 --> 00:25:26,759
Do you remember this song?

304
00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:33,766
I remember this song.

305
00:25:35,851 --> 00:25:38,187
It was the first song they played

306
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:43,609
when I asked you to dance
at the 2nd year block party.

307
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,369
This memory

308
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,288
is one of my favorite memories.

309
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:01,335
My hands were so sweaty

310
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,046
and my knees were shaking.

311
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:08,926
But what I felt that night,

312
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:12,221
I know.

313
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:14,932
It'll always...

314
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,018
Stay with me forever.

315
00:26:27,236 --> 00:26:28,612
I can't make you forget

316
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:34,535
those tragic memories of yours.

317
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,288
That fear of rain.

318
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:44,461
That's part of you and

319
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:46,797
who you are.

320
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:52,136
Who you are now,

321
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:54,847
is the person I love the most.

322
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,354
I promise you, babe

323
00:27:03,272 --> 00:27:06,609
that I will not stop making good memories

324
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:08,941
with you.

325
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:14,909
I hope those good memories

326
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,733
will eventually overpower

327
00:27:19,914 --> 00:27:21,428
what bothers you.

328
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:25,998
Whatever these

329
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:28,850
premonitions are...

330
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:39,163
I will make sure that you
and our friends are safe.

331
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,280
I'll take care of you, babe.

332
00:27:46,347 --> 00:27:47,710
I love you.

333
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:50,778
I love you too, babe.

334
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,450
Let's dance some more.

335
00:27:58,285 --> 00:27:59,662
Oh, you...

336
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:44,498
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

337
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:53,007
Bottom's up!

338
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,970
Go ahead.

339
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:06,478
Nice! Almost!

340
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,235
- Dance, Cora!
- Yeah!

341
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,574
Nice! Nice!

342
00:29:22,202 --> 00:29:23,495
Dance!

343
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,676
Dude, shut up!

344
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,001
Aww, the wind!

345
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:31,746
Don't!

346
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:46,142
My slippers.

347
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:12,832
Okay, guys...

348
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:17,216
- You okay?
- I'll sleep now.

349
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,883
Yeah!

350
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,972
Do you guys need anything?

351
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,808
We're good.

352
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,643
- Go rest.
- Is she okay?

353
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:32,398
Let me know if...
you guys need anything.

354
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:38,362
- Night, Jessie!
- Goodnight!

355
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:48,107
So guys,

356
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,499
I'll go ahead.

357
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:53,627
I'll clean this up tomorrow.
Just leave it, okay?

358
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,921
No, no. We've got this dude.
Go get some rest.

359
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,443
Goodnight.

360
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:15,357
Timmy.

361
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,857
How are you and your parents?

362
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:20,654
Are you close with them?

363
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:23,568
Of course, I am.

364
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,701
You know I'm a family man.

365
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,758
I can't relate.

366
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:53,437
- Hey.
- Hey.

367
00:31:54,355 --> 00:31:56,231
- Cora, here.
- Wow.

368
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:57,608
- For you.
- Thank you!

369
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:00,051
Some Arrozcaldo to get sober.

370
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:01,286
Have a taste of her cooking.

371
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:13,748
It's great!

372
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:18,253
I feel like I'm sobering up already.

373
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,803
You know, guys,

374
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:31,558
since the killjoys are out cold...

375
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:33,685
Let's go!

376
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,395
- Where?
- Huh? What?

377
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:37,272
Where?

378
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:42,152
Come on, we gotta do the 3 A.M. Challenge.

379
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:43,529
At the lighthouse.

380
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:44,780
3 A.M. Challenge?

381
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,928
Cora...

382
00:32:46,076 --> 00:32:47,199
Let's not.

383
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:51,203
Aww, come on.

384
00:32:52,902 --> 00:32:54,771
Let's go, guys!

385
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:57,834
Here, look!

386
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,537
I'll give you all one of these.

387
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:02,045
They're effective against bad spirits.

388
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,258
I've got loads in my bag.

389
00:33:04,258 --> 00:33:05,050
Come on!

390
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,927
Oh, we shouldn't.

391
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,849
You know we're not into this stuff.

392
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,562
Please?

393
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:21,191
Come on.

394
00:33:55,475 --> 00:33:57,477
I'm feeling nervous.

395
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:03,108
Alright. We're here!
Let's go.

396
00:34:22,002 --> 00:34:23,837
Hello, guys!

397
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:26,465
Cora, Mich, Arlo and Timmy here!

398
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,051
We're doing the 3 A.M. challenge.

399
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:30,407
We're at--

400
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,513
We're here at a lighthouse

401
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:36,266
which apparently is haunted.

402
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,018
But is that true?

403
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:39,311
We'll see!

404
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:49,946
Guys, did anybody hear that?

405
00:34:49,946 --> 00:34:51,406
No. Hear what?

406
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:30,779
Timmy! Where the hell are you?

407
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,406
Cora!

408
00:35:32,406 --> 00:35:33,699
Cora!

409
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,617
Mich! Babe!

410
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:02,644
Babe?

411
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,448
Cora?!

412
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,291
Timmy?!

413
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,469
Stay with me.

414
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,970
We're safe.

415
00:36:38,054 --> 00:36:39,556
We're safe.

416
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:11,755
Hurry up!

417
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:13,131
Huh? Why?

418
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:15,403
Just hurry up!

419
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:18,345
- Hurry up!
- Yeah, we are!

420
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,516
Mich! What happened?

421
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,267
Everybody get in!

422
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,771
What's wrong?

423
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,814
Um, guys...

424
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,568
I think we should keep this to ourselves.

425
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:16,570
Nobody tell Jessie and Pipo.

426
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:21,867
Let's all chill.

427
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,786
Look, a gas station.

428
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:31,334
Friend, do you want to pee?

429
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:36,464
I'll go with you.

430
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:38,925
There should be a restroom there.

431
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:09,371
Okay.

432
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:21,216
Are you okay?

433
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:22,718
Yeah.

434
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:27,952
Let's go.

435
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,490
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

436
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,367
There's someone with you.

437
00:39:55,418 --> 00:39:56,878
In the car.

438
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:18,566
Cora, are you okay?

439
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:28,827
Cora?

440
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,308
Did you wash your hands
before hugging me?

441
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,126
Yeah, see? Clean.

442
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:38,920
Are you okay?

443
00:40:42,465 --> 00:40:43,550
Alright.

444
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,337
Uh, babe?

445
00:41:22,464 --> 00:41:23,256
Babe?

446
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:27,719
I need to tell you something.

447
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,010
Let's go.

448
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,860
I think I lost my necklace in the water.

449
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:28,196
Maybe it's in the lighthouse.

450
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,698
Lighthouse?

451
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:33,159
Promise you won't go to the lighthouse.

452
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,870
Babe!

453
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:41,793
These two suit each other,
they have that spark.

454
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:44,170
You know I could see them

455
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:45,964
since I was young.

456
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:48,800
But now it feels more real.

457
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,220
I'm really sorry.

458
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:54,139
It was my fault.

459
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:57,517
I got you to come to the
cleansing so I could help you.

460
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,899
When I count to three, you
should have hidden.

461
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:06,359
One,

462
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,153
two,

463
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:09,612
three!

464
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:10,780
Auntie?!

465
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,448
Auntie?!

466
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:15,076
Auntie?!
