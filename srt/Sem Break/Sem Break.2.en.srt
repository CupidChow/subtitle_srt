1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:14,723
I've been seeing these
visions of burned people.

2
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:23,932
We passed by a lighthouse.
Can we go there?

3
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,996
Don't even think of going there.

4
00:00:26,747 --> 00:00:29,165
Since the killjoys are out cold,

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,168
let's do the 3 A.M. challenge.

6
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,335
At the lighthouse.

7
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:37,424
Hello guys, Cora, Mich,
Arlo and Timmy here!

8
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:40,218
We're doing the 3 A.M. challenge.

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,719
We're here at a...

10
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,015
Timmy, where are you?

11
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:45,866
Mich,

12
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:46,891
babe!

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,606
Guys, we should keep this to ourselves.

14
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,315
Nobody tell Jessie and Pipo.

15
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:02,856
Don't be so scared.

16
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:05,108
Come on,

17
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:06,442
You need to learn how to do this

18
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:08,445
if you're going to
live independently.

19
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,906
You won't have help in Australia, right?

20
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:12,865
Mhm hmm.

21
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,410
You got it?

22
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:17,037
Mhm hmm.

23
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:18,037
Yup.

24
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,916
Can I ask how did Mich react?

25
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,762
How long will you be there?

26
00:05:37,223 --> 00:05:38,223
Two years.

27
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,817
It'll only be two years 'til
I get my masters.

28
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,357
It won't be that long.

29
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:49,778
I have no choice.

30
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:51,947
It's my dad's will.

31
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:54,156
You understand, right?

32
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:00,120
After that it'll be just like before.

33
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:01,122
We'll be back to normal.

34
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,292
You're okay with that, right?

35
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,087
LDR?

36
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:15,845
If...

37
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:17,347
If that's what you really want

38
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,475
of course I'll support you, babe.

39
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,314
It'll only be temporary, babe.

40
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,444
I will never leave you.

41
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,949
I will never leave you.

42
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:39,995
You know,

43
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,456
it is something quite
drastic for the both of you.

44
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:47,168
I do think you should give
Mich time to process it.

45
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,882
But I know it's not gonna be easy,

46
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,719
but I'm rooting for the both of you.

47
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:03,393
I couldn't sleep just
thinking about it.

48
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,897
They're right, you know.

49
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,443
It's the single people
who give the best advice.

50
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,820
Oh wow, you think I
don't have a love life?

51
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:15,655
How are you so sure?

52
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:17,741
Oh! So you're seeing someone?

53
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:19,408
Why don't you introduce him?

54
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:20,785
Come on, I was just kidding.

55
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,371
Oh, no. You're not off the hook.

56
00:07:23,621 --> 00:07:25,248
- Spit it out.
- I really don't.

57
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:25,915
Do we know him?

58
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,481
- I said I don't.
- Give me a lett...

59
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:38,428
For how long?

60
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:41,514
Two years.

61
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:44,184
He's getting a masters degree.

62
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:45,768
And you let him?

63
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:53,818
Of course, it's probably his
parents' decision.

64
00:07:53,985 --> 00:07:56,571
He's got no say in it
and neither do you.

65
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,032
Are you ready for an LDR?

66
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,703
More tilapia.

67
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,749
Those look good.

68
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,750
Of course.

69
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,003
Guys, everything on the table,

70
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:14,672
Arlo cooked it for us.

71
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:18,093
That explains the taste.

72
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:21,637
Don't make fun of it
while it's in your mouth.

73
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:25,183
I for one think Arlo's
almost ready to get married.

74
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:28,853
On second thought,
maybe in a year or two.

75
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:32,232
I'll be the best man.

76
00:08:35,235 --> 00:08:35,777
Sorry,

77
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,872
but I'm already going to be
Arlo's best man.

78
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,947
We actually promised that

79
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:42,074
we'd be each other's bestman at the
other's wedding, so...

80
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:43,284
You snooze, you lose.

81
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,746
Why don't you put your energy into
finding a girlfriend first?

82
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:50,041
There they go again...

83
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:53,169
Eat up, guys.

84
00:08:55,713 --> 00:08:56,713
Hey,

85
00:08:56,756 --> 00:08:57,756
are you alright?

86
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:02,387
I think I lost my necklace.

87
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:03,804
What?

88
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:06,182
You must have lost it at
the lighthouse.

89
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,850
Hey!

90
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,435
Lighthouse?

91
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
What?

92
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,524
Poolhouse!

93
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,151
I said the poolhouse.

94
00:09:16,484 --> 00:09:19,112
Right there, Mich must have dropped it
at the poolhouse.

95
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,616
Just, promise

96
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:26,828
that you'll never go to that lighthouse.

97
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:37,088
You lost your necklace?

98
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,468
I probably just misplaced it.

99
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:44,678
Let's eat.

100
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,056
I want to try the tilapia.

101
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:38,232
Guys! Timmy, Jessie, Pipo

102
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,817
time to go ashore and let's eat.

103
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:41,944
Okay, wait up!

104
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,071
It's here already.

105
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:04,342
Do you ever wish that you
could freeze time?

106
00:11:09,305 --> 00:11:10,305
I do.

107
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:13,142
I want to freeze this moment.

108
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,312
Just us.

109
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:18,606
Just the two of us.

110
00:11:19,692 --> 00:11:21,277
Sunset by the beach.

111
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,239
No problems, no worries.

112
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,576
Don't be so sure.

113
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:36,791
We have the thesis defense coming up.

114
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,212
Aww, babe.

115
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:44,007
You just had to ruin it.

116
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:45,967
I was just joking.

117
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,556
Well...

118
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,270
After graduation,

119
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,273
you're going away

120
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:03,151
for two years.

121
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,362
It's a long time.

122
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:14,370
I'd freeze this moment with you.

123
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:18,082
I'm happy to be here

124
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,916
with you.

125
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,046
The rest are just a bonus.

126
00:12:45,026 --> 00:12:46,026
Babe!

127
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:49,739
What happened?

128
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:56,204
I think it's just spasms.

129
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,417
Guys, let's go.

130
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:02,627
The tide's rising.

131
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,680
Pick a song.

132
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,475
You, choose your favorite song.

133
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:22,062
Timmy!

134
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:24,398
Sing with me.

135
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,317
No.

136
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:27,735
Come on, sing!

137
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,439
Sing with me.

138
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,488
You're always drawing there!

139
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,823
- No, see...
- Come on, man.

140
00:13:32,824 --> 00:13:34,324
- Can't you be bothered to?
- Why don't you sing?

141
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,826
You've got the better voice.

142
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,370
Hey, come on.

143
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:43,459
The days are full and brighter

144
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:47,630
when we spend them

145
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:50,925
- together.
- Together.

146
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:57,682
As if nothing could ever
ruin them

147
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,726
forever.

148
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,362
Why did it have to be

149
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,949
today

150
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,453
that it ends?

151
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,872
You guys suit each other.
You've got the spark.

152
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,418
Come on!

153
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:32,675
when you go?

154
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:47,564
Didn't you promise me,
you'd never leave me?

155
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:55,114
That you'd never let
me spend a day alone?

156
00:14:56,032 --> 00:15:04,032
Didn't you say we'd grow old...

157
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:11,213
Why'd you go on ahead

158
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:15,008
to the afterlife?

159
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:18,804
- Yes!
- Woah, nice!

160
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Going to the restroom?

161
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,352
Come with me.

162
00:15:25,353 --> 00:15:26,604
Sure! Sure, friend.

163
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:28,773
- Hey,
- So hot.

164
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,733
Hey, don't skip 2645
while I'm away.

165
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,693
- It's my song!
- Okay.

166
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:34,819
We'll press stop.

167
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,154
Don't skip it!

168
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:37,906
I'll be quick!

169
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:41,452
- Yeah, be quick!
- Alright, fine! I have to pee!

170
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:44,913
Bro, wanna get some beer?

171
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:46,707
Yeah, I'll go too.

172
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,376
Hey, sing also.

173
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,336
What about you, Arlo?

174
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:37,508
Calm down, Mikay, calm down.

175
00:16:40,928 --> 00:16:46,851
Calm down, Mikay, calm down.

176
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:10,499
Hey, are you okay in there?

177
00:17:22,553 --> 00:17:23,553
Let's go.

178
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:27,600
What happened in there?

179
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,685
Nothing, let's sing.

180
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:08,616
Ma?

181
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:28,429
Boo!

182
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,643
Did I scare my baby girl?

183
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:37,604
Told you, you would find me.

184
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,689
I didn't.

185
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:40,983
I'm the best at hiding.

186
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:10,137
Can we talk?

187
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,184
Babe, please believe me.

188
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,186
Babe, I do believe you.

189
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:19,563
But, you know...

190
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,443
It might be just paranoia from

191
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:27,863
that spirit cleansing.

192
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,119
You know I could see them

193
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,871
ever since I was young.

194
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,583
But...

195
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:45,840
Now the feel real.

196
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,260
They're not visions anymore.

197
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:10,239
Okay, uhm...

198
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,787
whatever that is...
that's bothering you,

199
00:21:19,915 --> 00:21:21,375
I'm just here to protect you.

200
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,547
I'll always be here.

201
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,134
And we'll leave that here.

202
00:21:41,812 --> 00:21:42,812
Sorry babe,

203
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,732
but I don't think you understand.

204
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:58,579
Mich.

205
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:00,580
You're still awake.

206
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,041
What's wrong?

207
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:08,130
I'm okay.

208
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,791
I'll tell you in the morning.

209
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:13,719
Just don't forget, okay?

210
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:15,846
Sweet dreams.

211
00:22:39,244 --> 00:22:41,496
We're going in 15 minutes, okay?

212
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,374
Oh yeah, sure.
Let me just put this in the car.

213
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:44,582
I'll start it too.

214
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:46,542
At the toll gate.

215
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:51,882
Did you lose something?

216
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:57,345
Have you seen my sketchpad?

217
00:22:57,346 --> 00:22:58,346
Is it with you?

218
00:23:00,683 --> 00:23:02,059
No, what would I need it for?

219
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,519
Fuck.

220
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:08,523
You know,

221
00:23:08,565 --> 00:23:10,317
I really think this place is haunted.

222
00:23:10,526 --> 00:23:11,944
Things keep disappearing.

223
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:15,571
Hey,

224
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:17,073
I grew up here.

225
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:18,409
There's nothing like that.

226
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:21,327
You know,

227
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:24,456
you don't have to blame
ghosts for the stuff you lose.

228
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:26,249
But,

229
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,086
I'll ask my mom if she finds anything.

230
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,796
I'll let you know.

231
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:33,382
- Hurry up, okay?
- Yeah.

232
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:35,046
Yeah, give me five minutes.

233
00:23:37,636 --> 00:23:38,636
Fuck.

234
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:49,106
Girls, hurry up.

235
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:50,815
Okay.

236
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:52,985
Okay.

237
00:23:58,407 --> 00:23:59,491
I'm going down.

238
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:09,626
Hey,

239
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,211
hey!

240
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:14,965
Sorry,

241
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,341
this is my fault.

242
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,888
I wanted to help you so I made
you go to that cleansing.

243
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:22,096
Me too.

244
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:24,641
It seems like it got even worse.

245
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,267
What's wrong with you?

246
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:27,853
I'm okay.

247
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:33,901
And then, I even made
you go to that lighthouse.

248
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:37,404
It might've made it worse.

249
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:39,031
No! Come on.

250
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:42,951
It's just...

251
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:45,871
I might be overthinking things.

252
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:47,706
For no reason.

253
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,294
Cheer up.

254
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:57,758
I'm going down.

255
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,468
Come along when you're ready.

256
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:01,261
Okay, I'll be along.

257
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:02,678
Okay.

258
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,265
Why? Where are you
going again?

259
00:27:23,195 --> 00:27:24,321
I'll be at the condo later.

260
00:27:24,863 --> 00:27:26,383
You'll have it to yourselves til then.

261
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:31,245
It seems like you need to
have a deep talk.

262
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,121
Let's go, I'll help you.

263
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,205
Mich, Cora.

264
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:37,291
Guys, I'll go ahead now.
I've got a shift soon.

265
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:38,584
Bye bye.

266
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,211
Bye bye, take care.

267
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:41,420
Take care.

268
00:27:41,421 --> 00:27:42,781
- Take care.
- Take care lovebirds.

269
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:47,052
You and Arlo both take care.

270
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:57,938
Come with me.

271
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:00,106
Huh?

272
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:05,320
Hey, what's wrong?

273
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:09,657
I'm okay.

274
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:10,701
Cora!

275
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:11,909
I'm okay.

276
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:12,869
Your luggage.

277
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:14,245
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:16,289
I'm your bellboy now?

279
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:18,291
You're annoying.

280
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:21,127
Bye, Mich.

281
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,128
Bye, bye.

282
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:23,964
Take care!

283
00:28:24,548 --> 00:28:25,548
Guys...

284
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,275
We're back in Manila.

285
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:47,112
Along with our problems.

286
00:28:57,622 --> 00:28:59,958
Babe, I know LDR is hard

287
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,131
but there's another option.

288
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,507
No!

289
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:10,468
Don't do that.

290
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:13,429
Go for it.

291
00:29:14,681 --> 00:29:16,433
It's for the best.

292
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:19,935
Go through with it.

293
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:23,607
Babe, I spoke to Dad.

294
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:27,778
About possibilities.

295
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,531
He'll handle everything.

296
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:35,702
Just come with me to Australia.

297
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:37,244
Be with me.

298
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:41,958
Babe!

299
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:43,502
Babe, it doesn't have to be right now.

300
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:47,004
Just...

301
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:49,633
Take it or consider it.

302
00:30:33,051 --> 00:30:34,051
Hey, Jess!

303
00:30:34,094 --> 00:30:35,470
I thought it was your day off.

304
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:36,997
Aren't you going out with friends?

305
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,223
We just got back.

306
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:42,978
And I could still make it
so I decided to work.

307
00:30:43,937 --> 00:30:45,647
You're a real hardworker.

308
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:49,526
Jessie, the Patron Saint of Productivity.

309
00:30:51,027 --> 00:30:52,487
Alright, I'll go get changed.

310
00:31:07,544 --> 00:31:10,046
It's your turn to be it.

311
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,759
On the count of three,
you should hide!

312
00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:17,928
One...

313
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:21,892
Two...

314
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:24,352
Auntie!

315
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:25,687
Three!

316
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:27,230
Auntie?!

317
00:31:34,404 --> 00:31:36,031
You missed me this much?

318
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,867
It's only been two days.

319
00:31:40,494 --> 00:31:41,494
Mich!

320
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:44,705
What's wrong?

321
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:46,499
What happened?

322
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:49,002
It's nothing.

323
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:51,712
Are you okay?

324
00:31:58,386 --> 00:31:59,387
I'm okay.

325
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:16,131
What do you need from me?

326
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,854
Mich?

327
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:32,314
What happened?

328
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:35,400
Are you alright?

329
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:46,202
Auntie,

330
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:50,457
have you ever been in an LDR?

331
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:58,465
You know, after your parents passed

332
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:02,927
I didn't have much time for those things.

333
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,514
So, no Mich.

334
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,392
I don't know the first thing about an LDR.

335
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:11,727
Sorry, Auntie.

336
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:12,936
Oh?

337
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:14,481
Don't apologize.

338
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:19,319
It was my pleasure to
raise you right.

339
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:22,739
You are my crowning glory.

340
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:26,909
Go ahead,

341
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:30,371
tell me what this "LDR" is.

342
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:31,998
What made you ask?

343
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,461
It's Arlo.

344
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:42,092
He's going to Australia to study.

345
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:46,680
So, probably,

346
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:48,765
we'll be in an LDR.

347
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,310
Long Distance Relationship.

348
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:54,978
But...

349
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,608
He invited me to go.

350
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:00,859
In fact,

351
00:35:01,111 --> 00:35:02,862
he made arrangements.

352
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,368
He's just waiting for me to say yes.

353
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,247
Oh then,

354
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:16,835
what do you plan to do there?

355
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:21,923
You know, Mich

356
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:24,300
Look at me...

357
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:29,222
I gave my life to make sure
you grew up well.

358
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,768
I did that because I love you.

359
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:39,065
And you love Arlo, don't you?

360
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:41,151
Of course, Tita.

361
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,236
I love him so much.

362
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,447
Let me ask you.

363
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:54,247
Do you love Arlo enough
to leave your life here behind?

364
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,604
Goodnight, I love you.

365
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:32,159
Goodnight, I love you.

366
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,997
Goodnight, I love you too.

367
00:36:38,792 --> 00:36:41,419
Goodnight, I love you too.

368
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:50,344
Hello, babe?

369
00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:52,806
I miss you already.

370
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:54,014
So soon?

371
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,112
Why are you here?!

372
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:17,455
I just really missed you, love.

373
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:21,876
I just really missed you, love.

374
00:37:39,477 --> 00:37:42,021
We're doing the 3 AM Challenge.

375
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:44,482
We're here inside a ligh...

376
00:37:46,234 --> 00:37:48,570
Apparently, it's haunted.

377
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,656
But how true is it?
We'll see!

378
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,919
Where is my child?!

379
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:20,435
I think you were right.

380
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:23,012
The visits are getting worse.

381
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:26,475
Did something happen to you, too?

382
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,753
I let myself in, Mich.

383
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:32,030
The gate was open.

384
00:38:33,914 --> 00:38:35,123
Thank you.
