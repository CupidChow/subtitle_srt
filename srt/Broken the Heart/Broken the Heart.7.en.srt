(A New Me)

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,760
This

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,000
is your request?

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,200
You came from afar.

6
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,800
You gotta have a taste of it
before leaving.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Take a sip.

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,520
Is it good?

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Where are you going

10
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,480
after leaving?

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,320
In such a big world,

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
there must be a shelter for me.

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,200
General,

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,840
thank you for your attention these days.

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
I'll never forget the help and care

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
you and your family gave me.

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,000
If one day...

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,920
If one day,

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,040
we meet again,

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,040
is it possible for us to...

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,520
What are you doing here in the kitchen?

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,720
I even thought there is a thief.

23
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,800
Shunqin.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Shunqin, I just wanted Ruo...

25
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,320
I just wanted Miss Qin
to have a taste of the crispy cheese here.

26
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Have you never had it, Miss Qin?

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,920
You should've told me.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,400
I'll have it prepared

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,280
every day.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
Don't bother, Shunqin.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,520
I've been bothering you so much.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,030
Is he here to visit the Crown Prince?

33
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,000
There are plenty of rooms,

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,720
and I'll get him one.

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,480
No need.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
He's leaving now.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
Thank you, my lord.

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,960
Stop it.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,360
I have a task for you.

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
General.

41
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Your Highness.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,880
General and Mrs. Lin,

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,760
where are you going?

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
Your Highness,

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,080
the plague is raging in the city,

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
so we're going to collect some herbs
for distribution.

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,760
This is an important thing.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
I'll go with you.

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Master, the carriage is ready.

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,320
We don't need the carriage.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,320
We'll be back soon.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,960
Get one for His Highness.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,120
Your Highness,

54
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,960
Lady Lin has something urgent
to report to you.

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
You can rest assured.

56
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,560
My sister has distracted His Highness.

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,040
This boat will take you to the border.

58
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
You take care

59
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,960
on your way back.

60
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
Thank you, General.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,880
Take care.

62
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,640
Your Highness.

63
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,960
Shouldn't you be collecting herbs now?

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,240
Why are you lingering at the riverside?

65
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,400
You may not know this, Your Highness.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,920
The herbs are on the mountain nearby.

67
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,560
But it's getting difficult to travel
on the mountain roads after the rain,

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,520
we've decided to go there by boat.

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
Where is Mrs. Lin?

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
She just heard her mother's health
was getting worse,

71
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,160
so she hurried back to home.

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,840
Lin Cangwu,

73
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,960
you really think
I'll fall for your nonsense?

74
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,480
This is my family affair,

75
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,200
which shouldn't bother Your Highness
to ask.

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
I apologize for that.

77
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,840
You'd better figure out

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,120
who is your master!

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Calm down, Your Highness.

80
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,960
Ruoyao's mother has been ill for so long,

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
but it had got worse suddenly,

82
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
before we could report it to you.

83
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,440
I'll get her back right now.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,400
Please calm down, Your Highness.

85
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,160
General, you've established
glorious achievements for the South State,

86
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,040
and are really a rare talent.

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,000
I believe

88
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
you wouldn't collude with the enemy,
would you?

89
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,440
Cangwu.

90
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,440
I'm always loyal to Your Highness
and the South State.

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,960
If Your Highness suspected that
I've done something disgracing our country,

92
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,920
you can punish me as you want,

93
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
and I have nothing to complain,

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
but you really don't have to
get my family involved!

95
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,000
I really don't care about
your family affairs.

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,680
But if a person of the Yin State hides here,

97
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
you tell me what you're gonna do!

98
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,280
It's just an innocent person

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,040
with unspeakable reasons,

100
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
and I, as a warrior,

101
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,160
will never kill any innocent person
arbitrarily!

102
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Then what if

103
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,440
my woman is gone

104
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
in your house?

105
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,560
Your Highness!

106
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,360
Cangwu.

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,880
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,360
Ruoyao?

109
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Your Highness,

110
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,360
I learned that my mother got sicker.

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Considering Funing Town is not far
from here,

112
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,440
I hurried back to check on her.

113
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,120
Fortunately, it was just a false alarm.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
My mother asked me to bring some fish,

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,120
but she didn't know Your Highness was here,

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,680
or she would have been so embarrassed

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,640
for making me bring you these cheap things.

118
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
Mrs. Lin,

119
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
did you come back

120
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,320
because you worried about the General?

121
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,520
Since Cangwu is being with Your Highness,

122
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
there's nothing to worry about.

123
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,080
Ruoyao, how could you...

124
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,800
I can't stand by

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,240
when you are in danger for me.

126
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,040
We might talk about it

127
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,400
after His Highness leaves.

128
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Cangwu,

129
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
His Highness is waiting for you.

130
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,720
You go back with him,

131
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,480
and Ruoyao and I will follow on.

132
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Leng Qiu.

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
Shunqin,

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
what's up?

135
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,000
You think you can conceal everything
by pretending to have lost memory?

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,600
If you wanna avenge yourself,

137
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,960
come at me.

138
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't get Cangwu involved.

139
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,320
Shunqin.

140
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:46,960
Look.

141
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,700
(Leng Qiu, Lin Cangwu's late wife)

142
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,760
Shunqin!

143
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,600
