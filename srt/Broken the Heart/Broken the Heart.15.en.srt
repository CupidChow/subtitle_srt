(Substitute)

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
Shunqin?

4
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,600
The attackers at the wedding banquet

5
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,480
were also your men, I guess?

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,120
You've attempted to kill me so many times.

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,840
Is it about Leng Qiu?

8
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,240
Leng Qiu

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,600
is Cangwu's late wife.

10
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,320
(I know Cangwu just treats me
as his sister,)

11
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,920
(but I don't think the same way.)

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
(So,)

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,400
(as long as I could be with him,)

14
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,720
(that would be enough for me.)

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,160
(Until one day...)

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
(Shortly after they had got married,)

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,600
(Leng Qiu fell severely ill.)

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,920
(But no one volunteered to treat her.)

19
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,360
(Cangwu wasn't afraid of infection
and studied medicine for her,)

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,440
(but it was still of no avail.)

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,960
(Knowing that it was hopeless,)

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,080
(Leng Qiu pleaded me
to take care of Cangwu.)

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,520
(But unexpectedly she fainted
falling into the river,)

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
(while I...)

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,920
Shunqin!

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,760
Help!

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,680
(After Leng Qiu died,)

28
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
(Cangwu got a serious illness,)

29
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,720
(losing all memories about her.)

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,200
(In order not to remind him of
these painful memories,)

31
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,040
(I locked all the stuff about Leng Qiu)

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,520
(in this room.)

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
I didn't mean to kill you,

34
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,840
but take you away,

35
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,800
because I knew who you are.

36
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,480
I wasn't sure about your feelings

37
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,240
for Cangwu,

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,120
but I knew Cangwu
had already fallen for you.

39
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,160
If you keep staying here,

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
he would definitely rebel for you,

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
then the whole family would be destroyed.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,040
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,800
Shunqin, what are you doing?

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Cangwu, I'm sorry.

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,360
But I can't let you destroy yourself.

46
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,800
(Cangwu.)

47
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,960
Shunqin,

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
what's this?

49
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,560
(Cangwu.)

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,040
(Cangwu.)

51
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,120
(Cangwu.)

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
Cangwu.

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,360
General.

54
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Cangwu!

55
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,200
(Cangwu.)

56
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
General.

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
Cangwu.

58
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,360
Master, Your Ladyship,

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,180
His highness hasn't come back
from the mountain.

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
A heavy rain is coming soon,

61
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,520
and the road will get muddy.

62
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,680
What are we gonna do?

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
What?

64
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,880
Where is His Highness?

65
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
The returned soldiers said

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,400
they had been attacked by Yin's people
in the mountain.

67
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,760
His Highness got separated from his men,
and now is still missing.

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,160
What are we gonna do?

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,000
Your Ladyship,

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,820
I'm reporting it to Master.

71
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,120
Do you know which direction His Highness
headed for?

72
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,480
Eastward in the mountain.

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,200
Miss Qin,

74
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
you are pregnant now.

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Tell General

76
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,000
that I'll be right back.

77
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,160
Go!

78
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Did you remember all?

79
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,320
Then are you gonna avenge Leng Qiu?

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,600
I don't blame you.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
But I was gonna kill Miss Qin.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,960
I know you value affection
and personal loyalty so much

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,720
that you can't tolerate what I just did.

84
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
If you blame me for trying to kill her,

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,520
you can kill me now.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,800
I was raised in your family.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,360
How could I even kill you?

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,000
This

89
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
is my fault.

90
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,640
I just can't face you any more.

91
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,520
Tomorrow,

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
I'm gonna leave for the frontline.

93
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
If I died in the war,

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
you can just burn me with a fire.

95
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,320
I didn't take care of you well,

96
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,400
so I don't deserve to share the family tomb
with our parents.

98

the Yin's prisoners,)

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,520
