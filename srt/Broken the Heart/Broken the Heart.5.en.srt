(Guardian)

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,240
Is the Crown Prince…

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
your nightmare?

5
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,400
I know you don't want to attend the banquet.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,520
But if you don't show up,

7
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,000
it'll be very suspicious.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,800
Don't worry.

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,400
I've got everything ready.

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,920
I'll be there with you

11
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,760
to face it.

12
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Be careful.

13
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,120
Don't make any mistake.

14
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,440
Master,

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,320
why did His Highness come out of blue?

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
You don't have enemies in the court,
do you?

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
How's the thing
I asked you to inquire out?

18
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
As expected, the Crown Princess is missing.

19
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,240
What's more,

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,360
the Crown Princess is said
to have been married from the Yin State.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,400
You can speak louder!

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Master,

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,960
His Highness...

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
is he here for Miss Qin?

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
How come you saved a girl

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,320
and His Highness came just in time.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
Miss Qin can't be the escaped
Crown Princess, can she?

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Stop talking nonsense!
Keep an eye on everything.

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,080
Tell them Miss Qin is my fiancee,

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,600
and we're about to get married.

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
What?

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,240
How did this happen?

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
Way to go, Master!

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
You're really a doer!

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,440
Stop it!

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,090
Do you have too much free time?

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,560
If so,

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,960
why don't you do something for me?

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
No, I don't.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
Your Highness, your private visit here

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,680
is really an honor for us people
in Liao City.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,240
It's because General Lin the Junior
has governed this place so well,

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,320
and Lady Lin is really a heroine,

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,500
so the soldiers and civilians
are of one heart here.

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,600
It's the brilliance and wisdom
of His Majesty and Your Highness

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,240
that makes people of all levels
unite as one.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,440
General Lin the Senior have spent half
of his life fighting for the South State,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
and established his prestige in Liao City.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,360
And General Lin the Junior
is young and promising.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm afraid in people's heart,

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,160
I, the Crown Princess far away,

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,440
can't compare with you,
General Lin who loves his people.

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,200
Mrs. Lin, which family are you from?

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,840
Your engagement is huge,

55
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
then how come I didn't know that?

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,560
We met again after a long separation,

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,640
and I'd never thought that would happen.

58
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,480
I am the one
who rushed into the engagement.

59
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,930
I didn't obtain His Majesty's permission
before that,

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
and I am to blame.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,600
You met again after a long separation?

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
When did you meet again?

63
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,440
Was it

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,480
this very moment seven days ago?

65
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,880
Not really.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,280
Then at this very moment seven days ago,

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
where was the Mrs. Lin?

68
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,760
Any witness?

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,240
Your Highness, why are you asking this?

70
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
Lately I heard

71
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,560
a spy of the Yin State sneak into
the border area in Liao City,

72
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,240
and your fiancee showed up at this moment.

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,160
It's really suspicious.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,720
Then,

75
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,120
if it is really necessary to investigate...

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
Ruoyao was with me seven days ago.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,000
We went shopping together, didn't we?

78
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,320
And you picked this bracelet for me.

79
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,160
Don't you remember?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
It's true.

81
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Seven days ago,

82
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,800
I was with my sister-in-law.

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,120
Is there any problem, Your Highness?

84
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,680
You met again after a long separation,

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,760
and I should congratulate you two.

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,880
It's just you

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
look like the person I knew.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,440
What a coincidence.

89
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,080
It's my honor.

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,850
Your Highness, may I ask
when you go back to the Palace?

91
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,360
I can arrange for my men in advance
to escort you back.

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm not going back.

93
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm here for business in Liao City.

94
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm afraid

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
I have to stay here

96
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
for a while.

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
General.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560
Sorry for tonight.

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,480
You can have a rest now.

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
I'll be right outside the door.

101
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm the one who should be sorry

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,160
for bothering you so much.

103
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
You are the host of this house.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,440
You go have a rest as usual.

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,200
I can't fall asleep anyway.

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,320
General,

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm actually...

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
I knew it.

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,440
You're the princess married from Yin,
aren't you?

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,560
How did you know that?

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,300
A person with extraordinary
speech and manner,

112
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
insisting on going the north

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
and afraid of the Crown Prince

114
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,200
in the South State,

115
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
can be nobody but the Crown Princess.

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,760
Now that you knew who I really am,

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
why did you help me?

118
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,280
I thought

119
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,480
everyone in this state hates me.

120
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,760
No one is innocent in wars.

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,080
I always think

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,960
that the disadvantaged people
shouldn't be involved in wars.

123
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,560
You shouldn't be treated like this

124
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
just because you're from the Yin State.

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
And I always feel

126
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,480
familiar with you.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Please rest assured, General.

128
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
As soon as they leave,

129
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
I'll leave at once.

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
I won't bother you any more.

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,600
I didn't mean that.

132
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Miss Qin,

133
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,480
have a good rest.

134
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,000
Since you're honest to me,

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll never betray you.

136
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Yin Ruoshui.

137
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
My name is Yin Ruoshui.

138
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,040
I've always thought

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,960
there was quite a distance
between the Palace to Liao City.

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
But lately I've found

141
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,880
that one can directly come to Liao City

142
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,800
when jumping from the cliff here.

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,880
If,

144
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,920
someone escaped from the Palace later

145
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
and jumped from here,

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
I would know

147
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,160
where I could find this person.

148
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
I

149
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,480
came from a humble place.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
I've never been here.

151
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
I've never thought

152
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,560
it's so near

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,880
to the magnificent Palace.

154
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,800
I'll be really honored to visit there
if possible.

155
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,760
Fronting water and with a hill at the back,

156
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,520
Liao City is a rare treasure land
in the South State.

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,800
Mrs. Lin,

158
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,680
where are you from?

159
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
Your Highness,

160
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm from Funing Town of Liao City,

161
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
a humble place
with only thousands of residents.

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,920
It abounds with sugar oranges,

163
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,120
and I've asked my families
to have them delivered here,

164
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
so Your Highness can also have a taste.

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,120
Raise your head.

166
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,120
It's an offense

167
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,960
to look at you directly.

168
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Mrs. Lin seems quite familiar
with this area geographically,

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,480
but,

170
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,440
not climatically.

171
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
The South State has a varied climate.

172
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,770
Judging from the meteorological phenomena
yesterday,

173
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,920
it's probably gonna rain today.

174
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
But the residents here

175
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,760
have got used to it.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,920
Am I right?

177
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
But Mrs. Lin,

178
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
why are you trembling?

179
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,360
Your Highness,

180
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,520
it's getting dark.

181
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,890
It'll be difficult to travel
on mountain roads if it keeps raining.

182
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,360
We'd better go back now.
