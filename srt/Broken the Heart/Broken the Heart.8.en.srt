=Episode 8=
(Split Memory)

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
If you wanna avenge yourself,

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,920
come at me.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,520
Don't get Cangwu involved.

6
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,080
It's been quite a while
but you didn't show up.

7
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,480
I was wondering

8
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,280
what is so beautiful here

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
that made you stay for so long?

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,520
Your Highness,

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,760
Ruoyao hardly went out,

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,160
so we stayed here for a little longer.

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Now we're going back.

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,320
Let's go.

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,080
Sorry.

16
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,080
If it hadn't been for me,

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
you could have left.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
Don't say that.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,120
It was my hasty decision

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
without a careful plan.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,000
What's more,

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,520
if I left this way,

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Yuwen Sheng wouldn't give it up.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,000
Then it might get you into trouble,

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,080
and even your family.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
Now His Highness has even more doubts.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm afraid he will stay here for a while.

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
If it's inevitable,

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,160
I'll be just in time to let him know

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm not Yin Ruoshui that he knew before.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,440
By the way,

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,560
today,

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Shunqin

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,080
called me Leng Qiu.

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,760
Why?

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
Leng Qiu?

37
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,080
(Cangwu.)

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
(Cangwu.)

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,360
General.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,800
(Cangwu.)

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
General.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
General.

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,560
(Cangwu.)

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,920
(Cangwu.)

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,960
(Here is your tea.)

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
General.

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
Are you okay?

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
You got poisoned?

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Did he use the sword

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
on purpose?

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,480
I'll get you the antidote.

52
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,640
Don't!

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,240
No matter he did this on purpose

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
or for malicious entertainment,

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
it's obviously a trap.

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,920
If I really got poisoned,

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
I'll have my men to find the antidote.

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
But only he

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
has the antidote,

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,760
because I gave it to him.

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,400
That is the only antidote for the poison.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,080
I have only one bottle left.

63
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,320
You must keep it well.

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't have your name, though.

65
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
Are you a native?

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
Or are you here to avoid being killed?

67
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,880
I...

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Somebody's coming.

69
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,400
Sir,

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,800
what's up?

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,800
Have you seen an injured man?

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,040
A head taller than you.

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,400
No.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,200
There is only me.

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,960
You live here alone?

76
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
What do you mean?

77
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,040
Living here alone,

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,840
aren't you scared?

79
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,400
I heard a noise over there!

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,140
Let's go and have a check.

81
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
Let's go!

82
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,460
(State Border)

83
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
The flute must be important to you.

84
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,480
You even picked it up back.

85
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
Have you ever been there?

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Do the people over there

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,160
hate us?

88
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Maybe.

89
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
If they come at us,

90
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
will they kill the Emperor?

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
I gotta go.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Where are you going next?

93
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,120
Probably go home.

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
Is it far away?

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
What about you?

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
Where is your home?

97
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,840
I don't have a home,

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,120
but a cage that I can never escape from.

99
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
This flute is from my mother.

100
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
This half is for you.

101
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,880
One day,

102
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,040
I will take other half

103
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
back to repay you.

104
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
Let's take it as a token.

105
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
But next time when we meet,

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,760
it'll be probably different.

107
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,080
Why?

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,080
What if my father the Emp...

109
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,040
What if my father makes me marry a man

110
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't love and probably hates me?

111
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
Then I'll kill him.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,320
Who are you?

113
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,720
Was it because

114
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
the moment you saw the cut on General Lin,

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
you recognized

116
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,200
it was the insect poison
peculiar to the Yin State

117
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,360
that you came here for the antidote?

118
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
(Oh God! It was a trap.)

119
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
It's quite hard to detoxify
the Yin's insect poison.

120
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,240
General

121
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,680
sent me here to ask for the antidote.

122
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,920
But I didn't find Your Highness,

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,500
so I entered this room
out of sheer desperation.

124
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm to blame.

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
A general's wife in Liao City

126
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,000
recognized Yin's insect poison?

127
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,320
Who are you?

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
My fiance

129
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,200
has been fighting against Yin for years,

130
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,840
so it's no surprise that I recognized it.

131
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,000
But you, Your Highness,

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
have tested us so many times.

133
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,640
Is it directed to me

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
or the General's family?

135
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,800
If I have ever offended Your Highness,

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm ready to accept any punishment.

137
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,640
But Lin's family has been loyal
for generations,

138
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,680
so they couldn't stand being wronged
like this.

139
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
What are you gonna do

140
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,280
no matter it's directed against you
or the Lin's family?

141
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,880
A woman who has the same voice

142
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,840
with the one I'm looking for

143
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
appeared in this mansion,

144
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,480
but I didn't arrest and torture them.

145
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,520
I've already had mercy on them.

146
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
The one you're looking for?

147
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,480
Is it the Crown Princess

148
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,000
married from the Yin State?

149
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,760
Now you came to the General's Mansion
for her.

150
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,800
If the message
that the Crown Princess is missing

151
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,320
spreads to the Yin State,

152
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,560
what would happen?

153
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,560
She's just a humble princess least favored

154
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,800
in the Yin State.

155
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
Do you really think

156
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,920
they would attack in force for her?

157
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
They just lack an excuse

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,160
to attack in force.

159
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
Now is there any excuse

160
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,920
better than a missing princess?

161
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,840
What?

162
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,120
Your Highness,

163
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
everything's ready as ordered.

164
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,560
You can leave now.

165
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,320
Tomorrow I'll hold a banquet in the mansion

166
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
to entertain General Lin

167
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,040
and Mrs. Lin.

168
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,640
By the way,

169
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,440
it's paint rather than poison on the sword.

170
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
You tell General Lin to have a good rest,

171
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,200
so he could attend the banquet tomorrow.
