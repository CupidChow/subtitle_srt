(New Pact)

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,320
Ruoyao.

4
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,300
I wanna ask Your Highness

5
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,120
for a promise.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,120
I'm listening.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,600
Before the wedding banquet,

8
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,390
there should be no war
between the two states.

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,240
Or my husband will
have to go to the frontline.

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
Are you really getting married?

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Your Highness granted this marriage
in person.

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,600
How dare I refuse it?

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
Great.

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,200
And one more thing,

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,520
you've promised to set free the prisoners.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,840
I hope you'll keep your promise.

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,040
Cangwu,

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm tired.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,360
Let's go home.

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Your Highness,

21
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,680
please excuse us.

22
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
Yin Ruoshui,

23
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,760
do you think I can't recognize you

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,600
with a new face?

25
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,360
General,

26
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,200
Yuwen Sheng said he would leave

27
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
after the wedding banquet.

28
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,000
Then,

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
I'll...

30
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,000
What if

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
I hope it's true?

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
You mean...

33
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Our marriage.

34
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
If I wasn't the general of the South State,

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,440
is it possible for us to...

36
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,040
My heart

37
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,200
has already died in the Palace.

38
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
If she isn't you,

39
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
where are you now?

40
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,660
(WEDDING)

41
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,600
I've been bothering you for days.

42
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
On your wedding day today,

43
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,200
I've prepared gifts for you.

44
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

Why did you break into General's Mansion?

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,920
We're here to take Mrs. Lin.

63
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Stay out of this,

64
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
or I'll kill you.

no one ever dares touch my woman.

67

Tell me,

68
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,080
who sent you here?

69
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,960
Your Highness,

70
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,760
I was just afraid he would attack you.

71
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,160
What I did is just to protect you.

72
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,320
Send for the imperial physician.

73
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
Yes.

74
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,800
Doctor, please follow me to His Highness.

75
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,280
Who is Mrs. Lin?

76
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,960
Doctor,

77
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,540
why are you looking for my wife?

78
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,200
His Highness specially asked me

79
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,780
to feel the pulse for Mrs. Lin,

80
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,220
so as to assist Mrs. Lin
in her future labor.

81
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,360
It's really thoughtful of Your Highness
to care so much about my family

82
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
that you even asked
the imperial physician here.

83
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,400
Lin's family

84
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,320
has been fighting for the South State.

85
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,120
Of course, I should care more about you.

86
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,660
Besides, I heard it's been
less than a month

87
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,560
since Mrs. Lin came here
before she got pregnant.

88
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,860
I have to make sure
there's nothing wrong with her.

89
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,120
It's just

90
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,960
that my father

91
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,000
knew your family has been loyal
for generations,

92
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,400
so he trusts your family without any doubt.

93
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
Over these years,

94
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,000
he has asked me to support your family

95
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,760
in hope that one day General Lin

96
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
would grow strong enough to compete
with Nangong family.

97
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,280
But,

98
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
if I found

99
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,040
you'd deceived me,

100
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm afraid
I couldn't save your whole family.
