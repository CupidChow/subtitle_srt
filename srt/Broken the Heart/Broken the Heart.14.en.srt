(Our Ending)

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,560
Your Highness,

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,680
General,

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Mrs. Lin has been pregnant
for more than 3 months,

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,720
and the pulse condition is good.

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,280
Please be assured.

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,000
General.

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,940
Ruoshui.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,000
I...

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,720
What?

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,400
I need to be pregnant.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
No.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
I mean

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,160
Yuwen Sheng

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
is so rigorous and suspicious

17
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,500
that he wouldn't fall for
the pregnancy thing so easily.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,640
So I have to make my pulse feel
exactly like pregnant.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,440
I know you're proficient in medicine.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
I was just wondering if you have any idea.

21
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
My master did mention a kind of medicine

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,760
which can make one's pulse
feel like pregnant after being taken.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
But I've never used it,

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
so there's gonna be risks.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
I trust you.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,280
This is huge,

27
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,720
and His Highness must make responses
to this matter.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Ruoshui,

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
have you prepared yourself for this?

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
If we don't do it this way,

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,960
Yuwen Sheng will never stop suspecting me.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,620
I can't let your whole family

33
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,520
always live in panic with me.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
If we make it,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,120
the old scores between me and him

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,160
will be cancelled once for all.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
If not,

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
I'll manage not to
get your whole family involved.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
I'll take full responsibilities

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,280
all alone.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,080
No matter what happens,

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
I'll be there with you.

43
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Doctor,

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
are you sure?

45
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,320
Your Highness,

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,960
I've checked her pulse carefully,

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,720
but her pulse condition and symptoms

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,680
are nothing like Her Grace.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
They are definitely not the same one.

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,620
Congratulations.

51
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
Your Highness.

52
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,040
Mrs. Lin,

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,440
I've mistaken you for her

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,760
and offended you so many times.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
I hope you won't mind.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Do you really hate the Crown Princess
so much

57
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,260
that you've been so bent on finding her?

58
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,560
I don't hate her. I love her.

59
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
With years of resentment and hatred
between the two states,

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,640
shouldn't you hate her?

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,920
How could you even possibly love her?

62
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,760
I hope I could hate her.

63
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
However,

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,880
I couldn't.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
It's always been said
you two couldn't get along.

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,880
The Crown Princess from the Yin State

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,640
was insulted and abused in the South State.

68
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
If you really love her,

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,600
how do you explain this?

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,440
That was just the tip of the iceberg.

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
I didn't wanna hurt her,

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
but my hands were tied.

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,680
As the Crown Prince
only second to the Emperor,

74
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,560
who can control you?

75
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,260
Is it the Nangong family?

76
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,040
The Nangong family helped the late emperor
build this country,

77
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,260
which is undeniable.

78
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,040
But since my father got sick,

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,960
they attempted to control me
with Nangong Xi.

80
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,880
After Ruoshui married me,

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,260
Nangong Zhao even tried to hold her hostage

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,560
for the battles on the frontline.

83
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,600
What makes you so happy, General?

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
Just had fun with my sister.

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
Had fun?

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
Your Highness,

87
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,400
Her Grace made the Yin's woman
get on her knees,

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
but she resisted with all her might.

89
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
So she was taken to the mountain
to be buried alive.

90
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,920
It's really exciting
to see her almost faint

91
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,020
when struggling for a breath.

92
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,960
Don't worry, Your Highness,

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
these Yin's jerks will pay
sooner or later.

94
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,680
When we don't need this Yin's woman
any more,

95
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
you and my family

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
will be sure to make the South State
last forever.

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
(The Nangong family members are vicious,)

98
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
(and even regard Yin's people
as worthless.)

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,600
If I had ever showed
my feelings for Ruoshui,

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,320
the Nangong family would have killed her
by all means.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
So heartbroken as I was for her,

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,680
I still had to conceal my feelings for her.

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Otherwise,

104
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,560
I would have put her in danger.

105
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,280
(To protect her...)

106
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,340
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

107
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,320
(I've been always tolerating
the Nangong family.)

108
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,920
(However,)

109
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,600
(we've been drifting apart for this.)

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,920
I'd been always waiting

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,560
for her to have a baby,

112
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,600
so I could make her
the justifiable Crown Princess.

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
Then,

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,280
in the Palace,

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
no one would ever dare to harm her.

116
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
But who knows...

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,640
She must have born deep hatred for me
since long before.

118
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,080
It's so embarrassing

119
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,720
to tell you this.

120
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,480
Tomorrow,

121
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,040
I'll go to the front
to cheer for the soldiers,

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
and go back to the Palace after that.

123
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,440
Good luck

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,960
to you and General Lin.
