(Strike Back)

3
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,000
From now on,

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,080
you'll be officially Mrs. Lin.

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

6
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,000
Stand up.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
It's a happy event.

8
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,640
Congratulations.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,920
As for the prisoners,

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
we'll deal with it another day.

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,240
But,

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
the Yin State has been invading us
for years,

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,560
so I won't let them go like this.

14
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,680
Your Highness,

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,600
you'd better think

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,120
how to explain this to our men.

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Back to the Palace!

18
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,800
Are you alright, Miss Qin?

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,760
I'm fine.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm fine.

21
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,560
Surround this mansion,

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
and don't let anyone in or out.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes.

24
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
Since I've granted you a marriage,

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,720
I'll surely help you to the end.

26
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,200
This is a huge event, after all.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
If anything goes wrong,

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,600
or anyone is missing,

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
it'll be terrible.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
You don't have to worry so much,
Your Highness.

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,680
This is my mansion,

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,840
and I'll ensure there's nothing wrong
with my fiancee.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,320
Your Highness is really thoughtful.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
I, on behalf of Lin's family,

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,900
thank you.

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Mrs. Lin, you are pregnant.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
Why are you out?

38
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
Your Highness,

39
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,960
there are too many soldiers and weapons,

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,320
making me restless in bed.

41
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,480
If so,

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
how about

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
hanging out with me?

44
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Your Highness,

45
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
isn't it inappropriate?

46
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,640
Yesterday,

47
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,080
you begged me to have mercy on prisoners.

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,560
Whether I agree or not

49
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,040
depends on you.

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,920
Your Highness,

51
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,080
my fiancee is pregnant,

52
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
so she should avoid riding a horse.

53
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

54
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
I want to go with you.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
I can promise you

56
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,400
to let the prisoners go,

57
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,440
but I wanna play a game with you.

58
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
What game?

59
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
See the border over there?

60
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
At my order,

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
the prisoners should run
with their eyes blindfolded.

62
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,000
If they run across the border,
I'll stop chasing them.

63
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
But for those who fail that,

64
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,160
you can't blame me
no matter what I do.

65
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
It's a deal.

66
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,920
Act when this arrow falls on the ground.
