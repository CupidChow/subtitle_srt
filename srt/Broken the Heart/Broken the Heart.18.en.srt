(Back to the Cage)

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:51,920
Was it

4
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,240
when I was gonna go back with you
that you found it out?

5
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
I know you're not her,

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,360
but how come

7
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,760
every bit of you is just like her?

8
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,440
Come on. Don't be silly any more.

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,200
So how are you gonna punish me?

10
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
You tell me.

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,080
I deserve death

12
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,240
for deceiving Your Highness.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
I accept it.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Surely I'll punish you.

15
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,640
I've had your palace prepared for you,

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,280
next to your mother's.

17
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
Go talk to your mother,

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,720
and I'll come later.

19
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,440
Announce

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
that the Crown Princess had got sick,

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,350
so she was sent to the mountain
for rehabilitation.

22
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,780
Unfortunately, she got disfigured
in a fire,

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,000
and now she is back after recovery.

24
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,320
To comfort her for the hardships,

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm granting her the Jade Pot.

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
Nobody is allowed to interrupt her.

27
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,720
Yes.

28
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,720
Then,

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,120
what about General Lin?

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,880
What?

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you really into him?

32
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,600
Or you don't wanna be the Crown Princess,

33
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,080
but a general's wife?

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,760
No.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,360
General Lin is innocent.

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
I begged him for help.

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,200
He deceived me and can never be spared.

38
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,720
He will be beheaded
seven days later.

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,000
It's good to see you're alright.

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
I've never thought our last meeting

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,520
would be at such a place you hate the most.

42
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,680
Don't feel guilty.

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,200
I believe my sister

44
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,600
will never let the whole family ruined.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
There is only one thing

46
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,960
that I still feel sorry for.

47
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,880
What is it?

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Will you leave again?

49
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,000
There are several times as many guards
at the door.

50
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,960
How can I even possibly escape?

51
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,820
You mean

52
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,640
that you still wanna escape?

53
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,400
In your heart,

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,680
who am I?

55
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,880
You are who you are.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,120
No matter in the past or now,

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
I've never regarded you as a

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,320
princess married here for peace.

59
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,880
In my heart,

60
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
no matter who you are,

61
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,840
it doesn't matter.

62
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Doesn't matter?

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,960
With these simple words,

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,560
are you trying to eliminate the old grudge

65
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
over these three years?

66
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
- I have my reasons.
- I know you have your reasons.

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,260
But you broke my heart
over and over again,

68
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,400
and it still hurts now and then.

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,840
Even if you tell me

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
you hurt me out of love,

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,760
it won't make me feel less painful

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,160
in my heart.

73
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,880
Ruoshui.

74
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,800
Over these years,

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,960
it's always been the boy

76
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
with a sharp tongue but a tender heart,

77
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,640
not the Crown Prince in this hall.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Bad news, Your Highness!

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,500
The prisoner was rescued form the jail.

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Which prisoner?

81
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
General Lin.

82
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
Get me the crispy cheese.

83
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,640
Yes.

84
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
Shunqin,

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,920
it's really typical of you.

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
Where is he?

87
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,160
In the dungeon.

88
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,760
There is only one thing

89
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,960
that I still feel sorry for.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
What is it?

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,200
I believe one day,

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,320
you'll escape from the cage.

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,200
But I feel so sorry that

94
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
I can never see that.

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,200
I won't let you die.

96
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
Do as the note says.

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,880
Are you gonna go with me?

98
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,120
No, I won't.

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,720
Have you

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,080
ever had,

101
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,160
