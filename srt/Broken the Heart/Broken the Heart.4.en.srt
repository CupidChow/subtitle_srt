(The Second Encounter)

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Are you injured?

4
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,840
Are you injured?

5
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
Who are you?

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,800
Your Highness,

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,760
there is no trace of the Crown Princess.

8
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,640
Answer me!

9
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Young man,

10
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
what are you doing here?

11
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Why are you doing this to Miss Qin?

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
This is your last chance.

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
Your Highness.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,960
I, Lin Cangwu, am here

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,120
to pay my respects to Your Highness.

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,480
Move away.

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
My wife is too shy to speak.

18
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,320
If she offended Your Highness,

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,640
I'm here to beg your pardon.

20
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,720
Your wife?

21
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,120
You're General Lin the Junior?

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,200
I didn't know Your Highness visited here
in person.

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,260
And I'm sorry for my poor treat.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
Now I'm arranging for a reception for you.

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,640
Not necessary.

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,640
My visit here must be kept secret.

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,720
Then,

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,240
please excuse us.

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,280
Come.

30
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,200

Master,

57
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
why does Miss Qin shut herself in the room,

58
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,760
(Duo Fu)
without even having dinner?

(Butler of Lin's Mansion)
Did you two fight?

60
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Stop it.

61
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
I have something for you to do.

62
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Okay.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
You're bringing Miss Qin something to eat?

67
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,040
You really don't have to do this in person.

68
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,120
How's her injury?

69
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
She hasn't come out for dinner today.

70
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm afraid it's getting worse.

71
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
Maybe she hasn't got used to it yet.

72
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,440
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,960
Cangwu,

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,680
when did you meet Miss Qin?

75
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,400
How come I've never heard of it from you?

76
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Miss Qin is an old friend.

77
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,840
She came here to take refuge.

78
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,960
Sorry for bothering you by taking her home

79
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
without asking for your permission.

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't ever say sorry to me.

81
