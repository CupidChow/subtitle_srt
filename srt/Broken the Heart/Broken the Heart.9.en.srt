(Birthday Gift)

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,460
Tell me.

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,140
Who is she?

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Why does His Highness care about her?

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Shunqin,

7
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,800
I can't tell you anything right now.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,360
Our family has been loyal to the court
for generations.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,560
Do you really want our whole family
convicted for deceiving His Highness

10
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,600
just because of your childish romance?

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
I can only tell you

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,360
His Highness knew her before.

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,640
There is no history between us.

14
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,440
I just try to help her

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,240
conceal her identity from His Highness.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,640
Aren't you marrying her?

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,640
We only met by chance.

18
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,240
I haven't even thought about that.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,360
It's just a humanitarian assistance.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,360
Don't worry.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,320
Even if you're involved in this matter,

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,800
I'll be there with you,

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
and I'll never have you harmed by anyone,

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,280
including His Highness.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,240
There is one more thing

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
I wanna ask.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,520
Was it you

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
who turned her face into this?

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm just

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,620
familiar with this face,

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
and then did it

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,080
unconsciously.

33
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
Your Highness.

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,520
We are sorry

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
for being late.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,720
You haven't completely recovered,

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,760
so you don't have to be sorry.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,880
To be honest,

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,480
today,

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,640
is my wife's birthday.

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,400
(It's my birthday?)

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
(I don't even remember.)

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,000
But now she is nowhere,

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,120
leaving me alone in sorrow.

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
So I invited you here

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
for a drink.

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,400
It's our honor.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Please.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Mrs. Lin,

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,640
when were you born?

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,760
Your Highness,

52
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,840
I was born in the year of the tiger.

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,440
Not from your look.

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Have a taste.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,600
I specially asked the kitchen

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,660
to cook the fish you've brought back.

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
My wife is allergic to fish.

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,720
When she eats fish,

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,760
she will be covered in a rash

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
before a joss stick is burnt out.

61
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,760
I haven't had fish for years either.

62
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll get you some good wine.

63
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
No need.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
I've had the wine prepared.

65
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
With good wine,

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,720
how about playing the drinking game?

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
Do you have word of order, Your Highness?

68
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes.

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,960
How about

70
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
we taking false as the order?

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll start first.

72
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,820
When seeking for the truth from falsehood,

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,360
I found the difference between them.

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Who among those lords
will likely lend me a hand?

75
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,820
It's hard to gain an intimate friend
in the world!

76
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
General,

77
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,920
you're really adept with
both the pen and the sword.

78
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
To you,

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,640
General Lin.

80
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,800
In this world, truth and falsehood
are never absolute,

81
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,880
but only love remains unchanged.

82
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,560
How about

83
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,040
we taking love as the order?

84
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
General,

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,040
your deep love to your fiancee

86
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
really impressed me.

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Mrs. Lin,

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,460
what do you think?

89
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,760
The one who doesn't love seems to
suffer less than the one who loves,

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,260
whose every inch of craving would
million strands of melancholy create.

91
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,160
Even if spending a thousand
for Xiangru's poem,

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
my overflowing love to whom
could I make known?

93
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,260
Never love anyone next life if you could,

94
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,120
because the lovesickness is unbearable
in this world.

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
How careless I am!

96
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
Sorry for spoiling your mood.

97
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
I'm getting changed now.

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,240
It's just in time

99
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,160
that I prepared a gift for you.

100
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
Get changed right here.

101
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,080
Your Highness,

102
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
it's inappropriate.

103
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
I said,

104
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
get changed right here.

105
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
You...

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
