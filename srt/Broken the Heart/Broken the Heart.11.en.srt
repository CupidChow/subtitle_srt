=Episode 11=
(Officially Mrs. Lin)

3
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,960
Today, we defeated the enemy
with great force.

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
To Your Highness.

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,280
Where is Mrs. Lin?

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,640
Your Highness,

7
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,160
Ruoyao has been little sick lately,

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
so she might come later.

9
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,160
Sorry.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,760
General Huang.

11
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Who are you?

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm here to save you.

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,200
Their Crown Prince is now at the banquet.

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,120
You run away now.

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,600
Their? You're not of the South State?

16
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't leave my men behind.

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
Just go. It's none of your business.

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,880
The border is not far away.

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,520
How did you get caught here?

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Our little princess was married here,

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,760
but now she is missing.

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
Even if I got killed here,

23
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
I would fulfill my commitment to our Queen!

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,920
Don't worry.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,520
I won't let you die here,

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Uncle Huang.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Highness,

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,600
Mrs. Lin isn't in her room.

29
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
Guards!

30
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,680
Your Highness.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,200
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

32
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Since you hold such a grand banquet here,

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,600
I'd like to play some music for the guests

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,680
on behalf of the General's family.

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,320
It's called Strangers,

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,040
the ancient rhyme of Liao City.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,240
By this,

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,280
I also wanna pray for blessings
for all of you.

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,360
On behalf of Lin's family,

40
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,160
I'm here to wish long live the South State.

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,520
Long live the South State!

42
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,240
General and Mrs. Lin,

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,800
you are perfect for each other.

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,500
How did you know each other?

45
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,720
Your Highness,

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,180
I'd had a fight with my father that day
and left my family,

47
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,260
but I got hurt in the mountain.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Fortunately, General

49
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
found me during his hunting.

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,240
He looked after me for days,

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
and we gradually had feelings
for each other.

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,720
As soon as I got recovered,

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,000
he proposed a marriage to my family.

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,760
Sounds really like

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,760
my story.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,600
Did you also have a romantic story,
Your Highness?

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,960
It probably should be like this.

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
Your Highness,

59
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,000
it's quite boring here.

60
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,960
When do we watch the show

61
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,480
we've planned?

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,720
Give me my sword.

63
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,500
I'm gonna...

64
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll do it.

65
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,440
These gang of Yin people

66
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,160
sneaked into our country,

67
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
doing harm to our people
and intending to plot chaos.

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,760
Today I'm gonna kill them by myself

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,760
to comfort the soldiers
who died for our country.

70
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,120
Your Highness,

71
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,820
you hardly visit my house.

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Shall we not let the bloody killing

73
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
spoil your good mood?

74
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,400
How about...

75
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,000
Today,

76
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,320
whoever begs for mercy for these Yin people

77
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,360
would be a traitor.

78
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,160
Or,

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,440
the Yin's spy I'm looking for

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,240
is actually in this mansion.

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,260
Your Highness!

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
Your Highness!

83
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,720
I have something to report.

84
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
Please have mercy.

85
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,080
Say it.

86
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm pregnant.

87
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
Killing is not good for a pregnant woman.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Please have mercy

89
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,680
on these prisoners,

90
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
blessing Lin's descendant.

91
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Your Highness!

92
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,480
Do you know the consequence
of deceiving me?

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
It's true.

94
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
I dare not deceive you.

95
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Okay.

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Then today,

97
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm gonna grant you a marriage.

98
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,720
From now on,

99
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,120
you'll be officially Mrs. Lin.
