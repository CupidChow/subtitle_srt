(Back Armed)

3
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,400
Sorry, I fell asleep.

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
Where are you from?

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
The poison on your wound

6
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,280
is peculiar to the Yin's military.

7
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,880
Why did they chase you?

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,560
What's your name?

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Ruoshui.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,360
You can call me Ruoshui.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,040
Ruoshui.

12
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
You're awake?

13
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
Have you been here all the time?

14
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
No. I'm in shifts with Cangwu.

15
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
How are you feeling now?

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,840
Much better.

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
I owe so much to General Lin's family.

18
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
Then do you remember...

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

20
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,000
Nothing.

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,600
I'll go and call Cangwu over.

22
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,880
(Two relationships about one same face.)

23
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,120
(Are you still the one)

24
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
(I really love?)

25
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
General.

26
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
His Highness has woken up.

27
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm coming.

28
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,960
Ruoshui,

29
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,200
about you face,

30
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm really sorry.

31
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
It's all right.

32
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,200
I am the one who should be sorry

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,120
for reminding you of the bitter past.

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,840
Don't feel guilty.

35
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,320
Guards!

36
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,960
How is His Highness?

37
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,080
He is fine.

38
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
Watch out!

39
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,940
(Token)

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,400
You are from the Yin State?

41
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,760
- From the Yin State?
- Your Highness.

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,480
Your Highness,

43
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
he is of the war party in the Yin State.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,920
They have been supressed by
the peace group represented by the Queen,

45
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,640
but they've constantly provoked disputes
on the border recently.

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
The Queen?

47
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Now she is nothing but a prisoner.

48
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,760
What?

49
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,920
You arrested the Queen of the Yin State?

50
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,640
We didn't have to do that.

51
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,480
The Queen has been imprisoned
by the Emperor,

52
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
and will be beheaded on schedule.

53
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
She is Ruoshui's mother,

54
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
so I can't stand by.

55
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,640
Act tonight.

56
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,240
We can't underestimate their strength.

57
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
It must be dangerous there.

58
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,920
I volunteer to rescue the Queen.

59
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
I'll go myself.

60
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,200
Eat something.

61
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
My mother's family

62
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,520
helped my father fight to win state power.

63
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,520
But my mother

64
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,760
is a peace-loving person by nature,

65
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,360
hating wars.

66
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,760
Since my mother's father died,

67
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
her family

68
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,760
has been gradually declining.

69
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,280
My father became increasingly brutal,

70
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,360
and even treated my mother

71
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,120
with violence.

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,800
I and my elder brother

73
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,880
are the children

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
that my father liked the least.

75
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,640
Your elder brother?

76
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,040
Where is he now?

77
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,160
He died in the war.

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,960
Sorry.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
It's not your fault.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,720
You also had to protect your people.

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,440
So,

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
is it because of this

83
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,080
that you can't forgive His Highness?

84
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Forgive him?

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
Whether I forgive him or not

86
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,000
doesn't matter.

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,400
All I want is that my mother

88
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,760
will be safe

89
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,840
and healthy.

90
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,800
If it's necessary,

91
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,400
I can tell him who I really am.

92
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,880
I'll go with him back to the cage.

93
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Your Highness,

94
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,680
how'd everything go?

95
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
The Queen has been taken to the Palace,

96
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,640
safe and sound.

97
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,840
I'm gonna go back too.

98
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
These days,

99
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,040
thank you for your hospitality.

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll always remember your loyalty.

101
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,160
Your Highness,

102
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,320
since there were assassins the other day,

103
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,120
I'm afraid there are their fellows nearby.

104
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
This journey back is full of dangers,

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,640
so how about...

106
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,080
How about...

107
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,240
How about I escorting Your Highness back.

108
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,240
My wife also said she wanted
to visit the Palace.

109
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,160
So Your Highness, would you mind

110
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,680
if I go together with my wife?

111
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,520
No problem.

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,920
General,

113
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,480
what's your opinion on these Yin's people?

114
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,560
They are of the internal force
of the Yin State.

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
While the internal strife is rampant
in their country now,

116
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
they came here
to assassinate Your Highness.

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,040
It's really weird.

118
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,720
Maybe there has been a troublemaker

119
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
contributing to the wars
between two states.

120
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
You mean...

121
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Nangong family.

122
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,520
Here we've come to the border,

123
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
and it's easy to take cover
to ambush enemies.

124
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
We have to be careful.

125
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
How about

126
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,320
we diverging from here.

127
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll lead the main troop,
pretending to be the core force,

128
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
and Your Highness and Ruoyao

129
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,040
make a detour back
with a small crack troop.

130
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
We'll meet in the Palace.

132
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,720
Who sent you?

133
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Any news about General Lin?

134
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,910
They're arriving
outside the Imperial City,

135
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,280
and will be here soon.

136
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,800
Mo...

137
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Mother,

138
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm sorry for being late.

139
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,700
(Qin Shuyao, the Queen of the Yin State)

140
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,000
This is...

141
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
Seeing your mother,

142
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,560
aren't you surprised?

143
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,360
