(Broken the Heart)

3
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,960
Ruoshui!

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,280
Your Highness,

5
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,160
you must have been exhausted
from pretending these years.

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,440
I really believed you were merciless
to this woman,

7
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,040
and exclusively favored my sister.

8
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,120
I've never thought

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,560
you would dare to put my sister in jail!

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
You really wasted my support to you
these years.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,940
Since you are so ungrateful today,

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,920
why would I consider the past friendship.

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,280
What do you want?

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
The throne?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,200
What I want

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,420
is up to you.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,400
For the sake of my sister's affection
for you,

18
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,880
if you kill the Crown Princess,

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920
and let my sister's son
be the Crown Prince in the future,

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,600
I won't

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,480
make a big deal out of it.

22
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
What do you say?

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
Now it's only for your order.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
No way.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,520
Yuwen Sheng,

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,240
I meant to let my brother give you
one more chance,

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,080
but you should turn against us

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,680
just for this woman from the enemy state.

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm telling you, Yuwen Sheng,

30
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,720
the Crown Princess can only be me.

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,840
Unless I die here today,

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,960
no one can leave here alive.

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,480
General Lin's family
has the Imperial Edict.

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,320
Even if I die,

35
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,360
there is no chance for your Nangong family.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,760
Doesn't matter.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,560
I was called back by my sister
for an emergency tonight.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,320
Yin Ruoshui, the spy from the Yin State,
attempted to assassinate the Crown Prince,

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,900
and the Nangong family spared no effort
to fight against the spy.

40
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,680
Unfortunately, they failed to save
His Highness.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Before death, His Highness honored

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,880
Concubine Xi's brother Prince Regent

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,600
to manage the state affairs.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,080
Your Highness,

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,600
does this story make sense?

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,960
Yes,

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,160
it does.

48
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,760
But there is only one thing

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
I don't like.

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,880
What is it?

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
If you don't have my handwritten order,

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,320
it's hard to convince the people.

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
But,

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,620
if you promise me to let go of Ruoshui,

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,120
I can give you my handwritten order

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
that honors you the Prince Regent.

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,760
Then,

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,160
no one will doubt your story.

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Yuwen Sheng,

60
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,280
we grew up together.

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,040
You really think I don't know
what you're gonna do to me

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
if I let you go?

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
You must die today!

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Yuwen Sheng,

65
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
we shouldn't have fallen in love,

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
but I've never regretted

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
saving the boy

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,720
at Mount Wuwang back then.

69
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
No!

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Xi!

71
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,240
I'm gonna kill all of you

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,360
to avenge my sister!

73
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,720
Yuwen Sheng.

74
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,880
