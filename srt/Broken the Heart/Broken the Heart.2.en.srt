1
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,140
=Broken the Heart=

2
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,180
=Episode 2=
(Uncaged Bird)

3
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,080
(Your Lady, are we gonna say this way?)

4
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,040
But,

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
His Highness had the golden cage
specially customized,

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,760
so it's as solid as a rock.

7
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,520
If...

8
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,880
Even if I die,

9
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
(I won't die in this Palace.)

10
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
I'm to blame for negligence.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,360
But we've tortured and abused her cruelly,

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,800
so she couldn't have run too far.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,720
Your Highness,

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,960
please have mercy and spare my life!

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,640
Abused her?

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,600
Yes.

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,440
The nasty woman from the Yin State

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,680
drove Your Highness mad,

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,360
and I just wanted...

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,390
Your Highness,

22
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,810
(Leng Feng)
this secret passage leads to a valley.

23
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,150
(Crown Prince Guard)
I've sent a troop to chase her.

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,070
She shouldn't have gone far.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,520
Get me a horse.

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,080
Yes.

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,760
It's raining.

28
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,120
Follow me!

29
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,240
There it is!

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,160
Yes!

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
Hurry!

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,720
Hurry!

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,720
Ahead of us!

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Over there!

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Any sign of her?

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,440
No!

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
Keep searching carefully.

38
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
Check there!

39
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
- Yes!
- Yes!

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,040
Watch your feet!

41
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Miss.

42
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,120
(Lin Cangwu, the South State)
Don't be scared, Miss.

43
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,360
I'm taking you to a clinic.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,400
Please

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,440
don't

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
ever

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,240
take me to a clinic.

48
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't let anyone know I'm here.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,040
You look cute when smiling.

50
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,160
(Don't I look cute)

51
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
(when not smiling?)

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
(Not so much.)

53
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,600
This tie is special,

54
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,160
and can accelerate your recovery.

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,240
Just hang on there.

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,520
How is it special to make a tie?

57
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,880
It's full of my care for you.

58
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,600
(It's unique in the world.)

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,880
(Yin Ruoshui,)

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
you're asking to die!

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,720
(Yin's people who have seen me)

62
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,520
(are all dead.)

63
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,040
(No!)

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,960
(Three years ago)
Here we respectfully welcome Yin Ruoshui,

65
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,840
the Princess of the Yin State,

66
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
as the Crown Princess!

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
(One day,)

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,160
(I'll take the other half of the flute)

69
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
(back to repay you.)

70
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
(My father made me marry a man)

71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
(that I don't love and probably hates me.
What am I gonna do?)

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
(Then I'll kill him.)

73
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,960
It's you?

74
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,680
Your Highness.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,880
(Nangong Zhao,
Grand General of the South State)

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,520
Did Your Highness and this woman from Yin,

77
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,520
no,

78
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,920
Her Grace the Crown Princess,

79
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,720
have a history before?

80
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
All Yin's people who have seen me

81
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,000
are dead.

82
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
The ceremony is ready.

83
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,640
Your Highness,

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,640
and Your Grace, please.

85
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,480
All you distinguished guests
from the Yin State came from afar,

86
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,960
so I specially asked my brother
to make preparations.

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,880
Let's give a warm welcome

88
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,640
to this princess from the Yin State.

89
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,320
What does it mean?

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,200
What are they doing?

91
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,520
What's happening?

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
No idea.

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,400
Act when this arrow falls on the ground.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,560
Run!

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,800
Run!

96
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,880
Your Highness...

97
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,880
I'm gonna kill the Emperor
of the Yin State,

98
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,640
and she must be on site.

99
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,520
Sounds interesting.

100
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
Since Yin sent us a toy,

101
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,520
I should keep it for fun.

102
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
Run quickly.

103
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,720
Not funny at all.

104
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,960
Miss, did you have a bad dream?

105
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,560
Who are you?

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
Where am I?

107
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,560
Liao City.

108
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,720
Liao City?

109
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,680
It's in the South State, isn't it?

110
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,520
No.

111
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
I can't be found.

112
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
Let me go!

113
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Miss.

114
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,480
Stay away from me!

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,680
Miss!

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,400
You don't have to do this.

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
Your Highness,

118
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,560
the place where Her Grace
finanlly disappeared is on the border

119
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
between Jin City and Liao City.

120
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,960
Liao City is up ahead,

121
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
and I've sent people to search for her.

122
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
If she is found by Nangong's men first,

123
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
I'll kill you at once.

124
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes.

125
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,760
Now I'll ask them to find her

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,760
no matter she is alive

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
or dead.

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
Only alive.

129
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,280
Sorry, Miss.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
You got injured in your face too bad

132
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
to recover,

133
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
and I know a little about medicine,

134
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,160
so I just took you home for treatment.

135
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,040
You are...

136
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
My name is Lin Cangwu.

137
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,880
You saved me?

138
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,400
I'll surely repay you

139
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
for this.

140
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
May I have your name?

141
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,600
My name is...

142
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,040
Qin...

143
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,600
Ruoyao.

144
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,840
I'll haunt you down
even to the ends of the earth

145
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,160
to find you.
