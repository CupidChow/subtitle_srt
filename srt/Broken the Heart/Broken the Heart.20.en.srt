(Never Let Go)

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,720
Yuwen Sheng!

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,560
No!

5
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,040
No!

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Stay back!

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,960
Stay back!

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,400
Stay back!

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,560
Stay back!

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,280
Are you okay?

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,080
You know what?

12
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,120
I often dreamed about you

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,160
in a bad way.

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,440
I've treated you the wrong way,

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,120
but it won't happen anymore.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
No matter in the past

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
or in the future,

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
as long as you're the Crown Prince
of the South State,

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,200
and I'm from the Yin State,

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,000
we'll be doomed.

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
I can give up the identity
as the Crown Prince.

22
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
But your Father

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
spent a lifetime

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
making the South State

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,120
grow strong enough to be a match
for the Yin State.

26
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,620
Now the Nangong family
is casting covetous eyes on the throne.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,760
Can you just walk away like this?

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
I've planned all this for years

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,840
just for one day

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
we can be together in just ways.

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,620
Just wait for me a little longer.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Wait for us.

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Okay?

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
Things are really different now.

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,900
Even a maid dare talk back to me!

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Stop it!

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,320
It's not your place to punish her here.

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Good for you, Mrs. Lin.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,840
How dare you even deceive me?

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,800
However,

41
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
you gotta know

42
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,320
you'll be beheaded

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,120
for deceiving me.

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,720
The country

45
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,040
doesn't belong to your Nangong family yet.

46
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Yin Ruoshui,

47
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,840
you really think my brother
keeps Yuwen Sheng in power

48
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,820
because he dreads Yuwen Sheng
as the Crown Prince?

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,200
Who will be the Crown Prince

50
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,800
is totally up to my brother.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
If my brother prefers someone else,

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
no one can save his position.

53
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
The old Emperor is now being
at death's door.

54
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,040
My brother now is keeping
Yuwen Sheng's position

55
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,640
just for me.

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,040
But Yuwen Sheng even brought you back
recklessly,

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
regardless of my feelings.

58
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,640
I've notified my brother to come back
from the front.

59
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,760
We'll see what's gonna happen.

60
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Your Grace,

61
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,440
I was just caught and brought back
by His Highness.

62
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,990
We've been bearing so much grudge
against each other,

63
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
and you knew it.

64
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,400
How about I giving you one more chance?

65
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,880
If you kneel down to me and beg for mercy,

66
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
maybe the Nangong family

67
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,800
will let go of what His Highness did.

68
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
But you're already back,

69
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,480
and you'll spend the rest of your life

70
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
regretting for this decision.

71
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
Your Grace,

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
does it still hurt?

73
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
What did you do?

74
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,320
I'll let them pay dearly

75
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
for what they did to you.

76
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,800
What did you do to Nangong Xi?

77
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
I threw her into the dungeon.

78
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,640
I won't spare anyone

79
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,080
of the Nangong family.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
Are you insane?

81
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,720
You've been enduring so much for years.

82
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,900
How can you let your previous efforts
wasted this way?

83
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,760
Previously,

84
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,320
I treated you the wrong way.

85
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,040
But now,

86
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
I won't spare anyone

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
who did harm to you.

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,280
Even if there is no the Nangong family,

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,800
there still might be other families.

90
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,080
Do you remember the time

91
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
we first met?

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,520
I told you

93
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
that

94
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,400
I didn't have a home.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
I just lived in a place

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,240
where there was no freedom.

97
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
Now I have the same feelings

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
for this place.

99
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,080
You know what, Yuwen Sheng?

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,560
How much I wanted
to have a baby with you.

101
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,240
But the old score between us

102
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,840
can never be eliminated.

103
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
