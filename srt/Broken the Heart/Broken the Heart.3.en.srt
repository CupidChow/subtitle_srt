00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,140
=Broken the Heart=

2
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,940
=Episode 3=
(Renewal of Bad Romance)

3
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,160
Lady Qin,

4
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,320
Master Lin has been out,

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,320
and he asked us to show you around.

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,640
Okay.

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
They seem to be afraid of me.

8
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,400
It's probably because Master Lin

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,800
has never been so close to a lady.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,240
They were just shocked by this.

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,600
This is Her Ladyship of the house.

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,360
A plague has been raging in town recently,

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,680
and Her Ladyship has been out
to help the victims.

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
She's just got back today.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
You...

16
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,880
(Lin Shunqin, the daughter of Lord Lin
of the South State)

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,840
Who are you?

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,160
Your Ladyship,

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,360
Lady Qin is Master Lin's good friend.

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,360
Sorry for bothering you.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Lady Qin?

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,960
My name is

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Qin Ruoyao.

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Now that you are Cangwu's friend,

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,560
you can stay longer as you like.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,040
Actually, Master and the Lady Lin

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
are not connected by blood.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
Master Lin was adopted
by the old lord and his wife,

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
but they are as close as ones by blood.

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,450
The old lord also passed on
the title of general to Master Lin.

31
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,160
Master Lin has made
many military achievements

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,640
for the South State.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,800
Military achievements?

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,440
He's a general of the South State?

35
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,280
Yes.

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,720
He just defeated Yin's army a few days ago,

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
and got rewarded by the Crown Prince.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,200
Brother!

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,520
No!

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,880
Master Lin's back!

41
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,720
Seriously, isn't she Lady Leng?

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,240
Your Ladyship.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,560
Go.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
General Lin,

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,040
could you get me a boat

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
to the north?

47
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,760
The north?

48
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,120
This is on the border.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,920
If you go up north further,

50
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,000
you'll be in the Yin State.

51
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
Okay.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,240
I'll try to get a boat.

53
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Anything else?

54
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,320
Right,

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,840
I heard the plague has been raging.

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
I know a little about medicine.

57
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Maybe I can do something.

58
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,120
Good.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,760
I found it!

60
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,120
She found it.

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,080
This kind of herbs often grow by river,

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,240
and they can kill the plague
when taken as powder.

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
But they can't be eaten directly,

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,920
so don't ever try to eat them

65
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
when collecting them.

66
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,760
Got it.

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,760
You're impressive.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,560
These herbs have been growing here
for decades,

69
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,600
but we didn't know they had such effects.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Right. Miss Qin, you're so knowledgeable!

71
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
How lucky our general is

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
to have you!

73
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,880
Am I right?

74
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Yes.

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
You're right.

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
How lucky!

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,080
Let's go and look for the herbs.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,040
These herbs are not common in this place,

80
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
how did you know the toxicity of them?

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,240
I've been to a place,

82
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,960
where there were plenty of these herbs.

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
Is there such a place in the South State?

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,920
I've run away from my family

85
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
and stayed there for nearly two months.

86
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Then,

87
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
I met someone,

88
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,800
and continued to stay there.

89
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,240
Then what happened?

90
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
Then,

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,920
everything changed.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,120
I'd thought it was a blessed dream,

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
then it turned out to be a nightmare

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
that I could never get rid of forever.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,840
No matter how bad the nightmare is,

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,920
you've woken up now.

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,920
Thank you, General Lin.

98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,520
You're right.

99
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,960
It's just a nightmare rather than a truth.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
I'm wrong!

101
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
(Such a good-for-nothing as your mother!)

102
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,960
As soon as you grow up,

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,840
I'll marry you out at once!

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,760
I'm wrong!

105
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,560

I heard His Majesty's getting worse.

122
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,920
I was worried about you,

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
so I'm here to make sure you're okay.

124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,960
I really appreciate it

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,040
that you're so concerned about me
and my father

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
even when fighting at the front.

127
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,560
You don't have to worry about the front,

128
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,520
and I'll surely make the Yin's people

129
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,720
pay for what they did.

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
Since I was little,

131
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
my father often said

132
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,080
that Nangong Zhao was really a young hero.

133
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,960
I

134
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,680
have so much

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,480
to learn from you.

136
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
You flattered me.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
It's time for bed.

138
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Excuse me.

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,960
How longer can the old man live?

140
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,520
No more than two months.

141
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
Keep an eye on the Crown Prince.

142
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Have you heard that?

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
About last night.

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,480
I've never thought that would happen.

145
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Don't you know that?

146
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,360
Previously, Master Lin...

147
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Miss Qin,

148
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,040
morning.

149
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,160
It's already afternoon.

150
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
The crispy cheese prepared
by the kitchen at lunch

151
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,040
is the specialty in this place.

152
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,680
Have you had it?

153
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll have it delivered to you.

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,440
Don't bother.

155
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,360
Why don't we have it together?

156
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
Really?

157
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Miss Qin,

158
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
why don't you eat fish?

159
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,920
My sister especially had it cooked for you.

160
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,480
Shortly after I eat fish,

161
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll be covered in a rash.

162
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,640
I'm so sorry

163
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,600
that I let you down.

164
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
By the way,

165
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
where are you from, Miss Qin?

166
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,520
Have you got used to this place?

167
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,680
Shunqin,

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,520
Miss Qin hasn't recovered yet.

169
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,520
Don't make her talk too much.

170
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
Cangwu,

171
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Miss Qin hardly visited here.

172
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,000
Why don't you hang around with her?

173
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,280
Ruoyao,

174
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,880
shall me go to collect some herbs now?

175
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,960
Then we should travel to more places.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Lady Lin, excuse us.

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,680
Miss Qin, let me take this.

178
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,440
It's okay.

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,080
I'm fine.

180
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
