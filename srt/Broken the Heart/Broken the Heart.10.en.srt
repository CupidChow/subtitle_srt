(The Old Enemy)

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,200
Your Highness.

4
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,160
You're here.

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,120
Why didn't you tell me?

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,640
Today I've prepared a gift for you.

7
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,280
But,

8
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,800
she is so near

9
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,800
and yet so far.

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,800
I love fireworks so much.

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
Why did you come out?

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,080
You've been out for so long.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,960
I miss you.

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
I don't like being followed.

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,900
I heard from my brother

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,800
that there are assassins from the Yin State
on the border lately.

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,040
I was so worried about you

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,320
that I hurried over at night.

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,240
After such a hurried overnight journey,

21
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,800
you might as well have an early rest.

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,760
I put some medicine into the wine

23
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,060
to delay your allergic symptoms.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,520
But it only works for a little while.

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,080
Now you should go back for some rest.

26
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,400
You actually anticipated this?

27
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,680
When he said he was gonna hold a banquet,

28
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
I just smelt a rat.

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,600
It's just

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,400
I didn't know it's your birthday today,

31
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,240
so I didn't prepare the gift for you.

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,960
You don't have to.

33
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Would you care for a drink with me?

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,600
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

35
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,860
The whole thing about Her Grace

36
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,230
remains unknown to the Nangong family.

37
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,240
How is it going with my plan?

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Everything is ready

39
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
for your order.

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,960
Make no move now.

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes.

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,560
How is

43
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,880
my father's condition now?

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,120
It's stable for now.

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
Don't be too upset, Your Highness.

46
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Your Highness,

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,800
once we make it,

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,120
we're sure to take the Nangong family
at one stroke,

49
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
relieving His Majesty's worries.

50
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,720
Excuse me.

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,960
I've done so much for her,

52
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
but finally,

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
I still lost her.

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,480
A moment

55
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,120
that ought to have lasted for ever

56
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
has come and gone before...

57
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,240
Have you ever had true feelings for me?

58
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,880
The person

59
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,080
is not me,

60
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
right?

61
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,760
Are you all right?

62
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,260
Sorry.

63
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
Last night,

64
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
was I ill-mannered?

65
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,960
How is your headache?

66
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,160
I'll have

67
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,000
some antialcoholic desserts for you.

68
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
Don't bother.

69
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
It's good to have a headache.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
I deserve it.

71
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,240
Master,

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,680
why did Her Ladyship get so drunk
last night?

73
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,520
Are you getting married?

74
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,440
Get drunk?

75
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
You wanna see it?

76
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Isn't it inappropriate?

77
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,240
Now I'm drunk and gonna hit you!

78
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,200
I got it.

79
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
Got it.

80
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,700
Be careful.

81
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,480
Put it here.

82
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Your Grace's for...

83
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,760
Learning General Lin's getting married,

84
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm here to congratulate you.

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,600
It's too much for me.

86
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,600
Lin's family

87
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,920
has been fighting for the South State,

88
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
and General Lin is even promising.

89
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,640
Now that you'll marry General Lin,

90
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
in later days,

91
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,280
we should get closer to each other.

92
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,640
Which family are you from?

93
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,240
Since you can marry General Lin,

94
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,540
you're supposed to be

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,040
of noble origin.

96
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
Your Grace,

97
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm

98
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,160
from a military officer's clan.

99
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,320
Military officer?

100
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Then which family?

101
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,080
And which pass does your family guard?

102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Since Your Grace is so curious about it,

103
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm gonna show you that.

104
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
You...

105
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,540
A military officer's daughter
is really vulgar.

106
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Your Ladyship,

107
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,160
she is just a side concubine,

108
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,480
but she is still snobbish

109
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,760
and arrogant.

110
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,640
No wonder His Highness didn't go back
last night,

111
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
leaving her all alone all night.

112
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
He didn't go back?

113
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,660
Yes.

114
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,440
She traveled all the way here,

115
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
but His Highness just ignored her.

116
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,840
Hurry.

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,040
Hurry.

118
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,080
On your knees!

119
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,760
(Uncle Huang.)

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,080
(How was he taken by Yuwen Sheng?)

121
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,120
Mrs. Lin seems to be quite interested

122
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,960
in these prisoners.

123
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,240
Are these Yin people?

124
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,920
I've never been out of this land
since little,

125
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,840
so this is the first time
I've seen the people from another state.

126
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
They look no different

127
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,440
from us.

128
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
The leader

129
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
is the general of the Yin State.

130
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
It's said

131
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
that he was also the guardian of my wife
back when she was little.

132
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
Unfortunately,

133
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
he won't be able to catch up with my wife.

134
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,600
I took these people alive today,

135
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,960
so I'm gonna throw a celebration party

136
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,540
to reward my army.

137
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Since,

138
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,920
you're so interested in it,

139
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,520
why don't you come with me?

140
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
Then,

141
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,600
I'll sentence these prisoners to death

142
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,520
to entertain people there.
