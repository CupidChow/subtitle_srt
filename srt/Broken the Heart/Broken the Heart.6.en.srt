(A Different Rainy Day)

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,960
Your Highness,

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,120
it's getting dark.

5
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,450
It'll be difficult to travel
on mountain roads if it keeps raining.

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,960
We'd better go back now.

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
I'm wrong!

8
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
I'm wrong!

9
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm wrong!

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,940
♪Previously I left behind♪

11
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,140
♪The flower I was gonna present you♪

12
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,660
♪It took root and sprouted
all over the garden♪

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,840
(Every bit of her is just like Ruoshui,)

14
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
(but why isn't there a scar
on the back of her neck?)

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,640
Why is the strong response
to the rainy day, Mrs. Lin?

16
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,600
Is there any unspeakable reason?

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,120
Your Highness,

18
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,960
it got cold sharply last night,

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,160
and I probably caught a cold.

20
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm sorry for spoiling your good mood
for the sightseeing tour.

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
I beg your pardon.

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,900
♪My thoughts of you can never lie♪

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,820
♪But they lingered deep in my heart,

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,340
♪I feel like being in your arms as before♪

26
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,780
♪But years of separation
makes it impossible to hug♪

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,460
♪Before flowers bloom all over♪

28
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,660
♪The sky is getting red from the horizon♪

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,180
♪I thought it's gone without even a trace♪

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,220
♪But it became alive in my memory♪

31
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,720
Let's go back.

32
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,520
(You've been invading other states
for so many years,)

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
and now you're punished for that.

34
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
How can you attribute all this to me
and my daughter?

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Hadn't I married you first, I could have
married the daughter of the chief minister,

36
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,240
whose family would have helped me
destroy the South State.

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,360
Why don't you just kill me?

38
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,240
I wanted to die long before!

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,480
Great!

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,800
As you wish!

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,320
Father!

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Back off!

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,000
Nannie.

44
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,400
Nannie.

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,320
I'm wrong!

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,640
You're as useless as your mother!

47
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,280
As soon as you grow up,

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll marry you out at once!

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,440
Look!

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
All of these people died

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
because of you!

52
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm wrong!

53
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I'm wrong!

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,160
I'm wrong!

55
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,360
General.

56
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
You're up?

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,840
It's just good to drink.

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Great.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
The fever is gone.

60
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,120
Thank you

61
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,960
for saving me again.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
You really knew His Highness,

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,240
and expected he would check on the scar,

64
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,760
so you prepared a piece of fake skin
as a disguise.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
When he found out no scar on your neck,

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
the suspicion of you
should be greatly relieved.

67
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,440
He is too ready to suspect.

68
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,480
Once he suspects,

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,720
he'll never stop

70
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,560
until he finds the truth.

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,200
You wanna leave?

72
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,760
If I continue to stay close
with Yuwen Sheng,

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
I'll be exposed

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
sooner or later.

75
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
I got it.

76
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,480
You can leave tomorrow.

77
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,550
The boat will be at the ferry place
for you.

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
Tomorrow?

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,280
But if I leave suddenly,

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
what about you?

81
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I can handle it.

82
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,360
How could I

83
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,440
let you live in panic all day?

84
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,440
But I have a request.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Your Highness,

86
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,500
his family has been living in Funing Town
for generations.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Your...

88
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,040
Your Highness.

89
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't be scared.

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,840
You just tell me the truth.

91
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Your Highness,

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,440
there was indeed a girl in Qin family,

93
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
but she left the town long time ago.

94
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
So I know nothing about her.

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,560
Is there anyone in this world

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
that you can't let go of?

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Your Highness,

98
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,480
I'm too stupid to understand.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
There is for me.

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,880
Anyone who might make me lose her

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,560
must pay.

102
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,560
Is she

103
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
the Miss Qin you just mentioned?

104
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,080
Your Highness!

105
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll tell you everything.

106
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
Her mother was Lord Qin's
unmarried concubine.

107
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
All Qin's families didn't know them.

108
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,760
They left the town long before.

109
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,800
The daughter is just the lady
in the picture.

110
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,480
Are you sure?

111
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,160
You must know the consequence
of lying to the Crown Prince.

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,200
I didn't lie!

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,120
I didn't lie!

114
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
This is just Miss Qin.

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,320
I can't be wrong.
