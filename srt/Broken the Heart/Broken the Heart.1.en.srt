00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,980
=Broken the Heart=

2
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,800
Do you think I can't recognize you

3
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
with a new face?

4
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,260
=Episode 1=
(Reborn)

5
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,940
(Imperial City, The South State)

6
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,180
(Yin Ruoshui,
Crown Princess of the South State)

7
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,840
(One day,)

8
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
I'll take the other half flute

9
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
back to repay you.

10
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Let's take it as a token.

11
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,480
Your Highness.

12
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Your Highness.

13
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,860
(Yuwen Sheng,
Crown Prince of the South State)

14
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,160
Your Highness,

15
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,680
(Nangong Xi, Crown Concubine)
the front army led by my brother

16
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,880
took another city of the Yin State.

17
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,960
We should celebrate.

18
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
Why do you take me here?

19
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Today

20
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,840
is the third anniversary
of this beauty from the Yin State

21
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,920
marrying me for peace.

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
It's the rule in the Palace,

23
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
so I have to come.

24
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Fine.

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,280
Nothing can stop us having fun, anyway.

26
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Stop.

27
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Did I let you go?

28
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,200
Come up.

29
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,000
Hurry.

30
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
What's this?

31
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,160
A perfume bag.

32
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,120
Yin Ruoshui,

33
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
you really think I know nothing

34
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,160
about poison
and the mean tricks in your state?

35
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
Guards!

36
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,640
Tell me the truth,

37
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
otherwise,

38
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,640
I'll kill you all!

39
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,760
Your Highness, spare me!

40
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,440
Tell me!

41
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
Your Highness!

42
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Your Highness!

43
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,150
Your Highness!

44
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,760
I'll tell you!

45
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,480
I'll tell you!

46
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
This is the poison that prevents

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,530
the Crown Princess from getting pregnant.

48
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
Yin Ruoshui,

49
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,480
do you wanna die?

50
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,560
I'd rather die than live here.

51
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,240
Why don't you just kill me?

52
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,400
I won't kill you,

53
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,680
and I've also prepared a surprise for you.

54
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,980
(The Yin State)

55
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,360
Brother!

56
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
Brother!

57
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,880
Let go of me!

58
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,400
Brother!

59
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,160
Brother!

60
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,440
Brother!

61
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,220
(Yin Yan)

62
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,040
Brother!

63
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,040
This is a gift for you

64
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,960
in celebration of our third anniversary.

65
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
You can wait.

66
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Next will be your mother the Queen

67
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
and your father the Emperor.

68
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
Put her in the dungeon!

69
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,480
Yes!

70
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,400
No!

71
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
No!

72
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
Brother!

73
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm taking a nap.

74
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
You keep an eye on her.

75
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,000
Guards!
