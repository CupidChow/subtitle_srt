(Us in Another World)

3
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,650
Bad news, Your Highness!

4
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:50,900
The prisoner was rescued form the jail.

5
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,300
Which prisoner?

6
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,200
General Lin.

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,480
Our men have gone to chase him.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,200
Stop chasing him.

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,240
You're excused.

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,880
Yes.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,480
Happy now?

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,520
Aren't you mad?

13
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,840
I didn't meant to kill him.

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,680
I was just jealous of him.

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
For what?

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you even asking me?

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,920
He almost

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,940
married my wife.

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,360
Since I want you back,

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,040
this is what I had to do.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
Why didn't you tell me?

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,960
About the Nangong family...

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,320
I didn't have total confidence

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,880
in destroying the Nangong family,

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
so I had no choice but to protect you.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
In addition,

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,640
I thought

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
you hated me to the core.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,880
Can we go back to that time?

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
Sweetheart,

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
does it hurt?

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Mother,

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
now you have me,

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
and I will never let you suffer.

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
Let's live an ordinary life.

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
Don't do this, Mother.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,440
If only I had known

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,200
you were so thoughtful to Ruoshui.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I wasn't always that good

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,320
as you think.

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Have a seat.

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,000
Ruoshui,

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,720
I remember when you were little,

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,400
you were most excited
about the lantern show.

45
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,160
It's probably because that was

46
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,520
the only chance that I could go out.

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,880
Have some too, Mother.

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,720
Shunqin,

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
thank you.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
She planned all this.

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,760
I just assisted her in doing this.

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,920
I knew,

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,640
you hadn't killed Leng Qiu.

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
But when she fell into water,

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't save her,

56
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
which also caused your serious injury
and memory loss.

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,120
Finally,

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,200
you met a girl who cheered you up,

59
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,200
but I even wanted her to disappear.

60
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
Stay here.

61
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,520
You're needed here now

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,920
and always.

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,480
The frontline is in desperate need of
provisions and fodder.

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,160
Why did Your Highness
stop the appropriation?

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Years of wars has almost emptied
the national treasury.

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
Massive people's life-blood

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,840
was sent to the front in the name of war,

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
but provisions and fodder
are still in desperate need.

69
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
General Nangong,

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,160
you don't investigate the corruption
in your army,

71
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,520
but come here to ask support.

72
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
I was just wondering

73
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,800
who is it that

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,120
has been deceiving you like this?

75
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,960
Your Highness, this matter is huge.

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,480
It must be reported to His Majesty.

77
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,960
General,

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,120
His Majesty has entrusted
all civil affairs to His Highness.

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,280
Is warfare also a civil affair?

80
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,520
We've recovered lost territory.

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
Let's call a truce.

82
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,080
No, we can't.

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,510
A civil strife is happening
in the Yin State,

84
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,320
and it's a good time
to launch a massive attack.

85
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,480
We strike back to take back
what we've lost,

86
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
not to invade them.

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,000
The people in both states
have been fed up with wars.

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,680
Reward the whole army.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,520
You're excused.
