16
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,480
Your Ladyship,
please go back for some rest.

17
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,400
We'll be here.

18
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,770
Our Master has had everything arranged.

19
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,440
Your Ladyship,

20
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,320
why is the wound on His Highness

21
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
still bleeding and unable to form a scab?

22
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,840
I'll find General.

23
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,900
How is His Highness now?

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,480
The wound has been bleeding,
and unable to form a scab.

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,600
The wound was poisoned before.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
After having been soaked in the rain water,

27
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,920
the poison began to spread.

28
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,560
That's why.

29
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,990
If it continues to develop like this,

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
he will lose a lot of blood.

31
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,720
Any solution?

32
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Only the edelweiss in the South State.

33
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
Edelweiss?

34
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
General.

35
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,680
I'll go to find the edelweiss.

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,260
It can only be found in rough
and dangerous places.

37
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,000
- I'll go...
- He is the Crown Prince after all,

38
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,160
so it's also my duty as his subordinate.

39
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,280
Moreover,

40
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
he can lose a general,

41
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,440
but he can't

42
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,200
lose you.

43
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
Take good care of His Highness.

44
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,720
I'll bring the edelweiss back.

45
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,740
Take care of everything in the mansion.

46
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,200
Your Ladyship,

47
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,160
I've already had them search
for the edelweiss.

48
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,680
I'll keep you informed anytime.

49
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,680
By the way,

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,560
have the prisoners gone back
safe and sound?

51
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,640
Please be assured, Your Ladyship.
His Highness

52
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,600
never let soldiers hurt prisoners.

53
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Your Highness,
since the morale is on the rise,

54
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,760
we should cut the Yin's prince
into pieces in the public.

55
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,520
If we did this,

56
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,800
it'll be no different
from what they did to us.

57
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
The two states have been at war
for so many years,

58
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,390
bringing the greatest bitterness
to the soldiers and common people.

59
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,480
The old grudge has been borne so deeply,

60
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,400
so we should never add any new grudge.

61
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
Just burn them.

62
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,120
No!

63
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,200
So what kind of person are you

64
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
exactly?

65
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,080
The anonymous person who saved me

66
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,280
regardless of danger?

67
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,960
Or the Crown Prince
taking pleasure in my pain?

68
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Or,

69
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,880
the Crown Prince
having unspeakable reasons?

70
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,640
If there hadn't been misunderstanding
between us,

71
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
would we...

72
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
Ruoshui,

73
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
is it you?

74
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,920
Let's go home.

75
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
I'll never

76
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
let you leave me.
