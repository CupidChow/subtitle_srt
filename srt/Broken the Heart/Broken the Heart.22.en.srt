- Yuwen Sheng!
- Stay back!

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,960
Since we were at Mount Wuwang,

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,680
I've been telling myself,

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,400
if one day

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,600
I defeat the Yin State,

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,300
I'll come back to marry you.

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,600
I've never thought

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,400
all of these

11
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,880
were wrong.

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,880
Stop saying that.

13
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,040
I knew

14
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
you've still been thinking about leaving.

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
I also knew

16
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,920
we could never go back to where we were.

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,080

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800

In next life,

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,320
