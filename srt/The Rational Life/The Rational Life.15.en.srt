1
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
You're back?

2
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
- You're going out?
- Yes.

3
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,240
Ruoxin's mom got hit by a car
and fell down,

4
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,280
so she needs to be looked after
these days.

5
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
Ruoxin is busy
and she keeps working overtime

6
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,800
so she wants me to help her
to look after her mom.

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
I'm leaving now.

8
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,360
- Let me send you off.
- No need.

9
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
Be careful!

10
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,360
Hello, Ruoxin. Can you do me a favor?

11
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Tell me.

12
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,600
Zou Cheng came home early today
and he saw me leaving just now.

13
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,320
I lied to him that I'm going to your house
to look after your mom.

14
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,960
Please don't spill the beans.

15
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,320
So you called me to collude with you?

16
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,520
<i>Dear, you're the best.</i>

17
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
Why don't you tell him?

18
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Didn't Zou Cheng want a child?

19
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,760
If I tell him that
I found a job at a bar kitchen,

20
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,520
he wouldn't be able to accept it.

21
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Besides,

22
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,680
this job isn't stable yet,
so let's see how it goes.

23
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
Based on my years of experience,

24
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,320
countless lies are needed
to cover up one lie.

25
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Don't cause a backfire on yourself later.

26
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
I can't take care of so much now.
I'll hide it as long as I can.

27
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,560
All right.

28
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't worry and just go.
I won't tell anyone.

29
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Kisses to you.

30
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,320
It smells so good.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
Ziyan, what are you cooking?

32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,080
It's pan-fried cola chicken wings.

33
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,720
My husband hasn't had dinner yet.

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,720
Ziyan,

35
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,560
you're such a good wife and mom.

36
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
I'll accept the praise of a good wife,
but not the good mom.

37
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm not planning to have children.

38
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Let's stop talking.

39
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,200
- Here, I made some for you guys too.
- Thank you, Ziyan.

40
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,320
Why are you here?

41
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,280
You're early today.

42
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,600
I heard from the boss that
you've improved the food menu,

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,200
so I wanted to try them out.

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,160
When I just arrived,
I witnessed a bunch of PDAs.

45
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,040
It's my signature dish, try it out.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,560
Bring your husband here next time.

47
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
I'll sing him a song.

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,520
For the sake of harmony in our bar,
just forget it.

49
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Okay.

50
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,040
<i>Qi Xiao,</i>

51
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
<i>how's the vibe at your company?</i>

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,600
Our company has a lot of activities.

53
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,640
Everyone is hustling when we're busy.

54
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,000
There's just one feeling
in the company that I joined,

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,880
lifeless.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
The company has a quiet environment.

57
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,880
Isn't that good for your creation?

58
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Don't mention creation.

59
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,800
My first task is
to design a movie book cover.

60
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,800
I couldn't understand
the client's requests at all.

61
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,960
He wants it elegant
and then he wants it common.

62
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,840
He wants it plain
and then he wants it conspicuous.

63
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,640
He was babbling for an hour.

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,640
The more I listen,
the more I don't understand.

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
- So confusing.
- I understand now.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,200
This is the client who doesn't understand
anything about designing.

67
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
Actually, in this situation,

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,960
he doesn't even know what he wants.

69
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,880
You should just give him an option
and not let him speak aimlessly.

70
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,720
You'll surely get confused.

71
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
Hello?

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Mr. He, don't worry.

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I'm preparing the proposal now.

74
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
All right.

75
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll do my best.

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
WIFE

77
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,600
Hello?

78
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,720
Zou Cheng, have you received your meal?

79
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,040
The takeout today is good.

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,440
Where did you order it from?

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,880
<i>Why is it so noisy on your end?</i>

82
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,000
<i>What are you doing?</i>

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
I…

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,920
Ruoxin's mom is watching TV.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,880
All right.

86
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,920
Take care.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Takeout?

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,760
He can't even differentiate my cooking.

89
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,840
Those pan-fried cola chicken wings
that I made before were wasted.

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,280
What a waste of effort!

91
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Who are you scolding?

92
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,200
Nothing.

93
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
I heard everything.

94
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,840
Why are you here and not singing outside?

95
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm having a break and I'm hungry,
so I came here to eat.

96
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,680
Don't let the boss deduct
your performance fee.

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,680
It's delicious.

98
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
Tell me.

99
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
Are all men unreliable?

100
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
Ziyan, you've been married
for so many years.

101
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,440
How can you still not understand men?

102
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
You got angry
and started speaking like my girlfriend.

103
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,960
Never mind.

104
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Let's put it this way.

105
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Before falling in love,

106
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
men were like hunters.

107
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,840
When they meet a woman they like,
they'll put in all the passion and energy.

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,960
But after falling in love,
the woman becomes the hunter.

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
The man's energy will be distracted.

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,680
Maybe it's because of work or video games.

111
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
There could be other reasons too.

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
But the woman will feel that
this man has changed into another person.

113
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,800
But that's actually his true colors.

114
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Where did you learn all this from?

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't let me
tell your girlfriend, Xiaoman.

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,960
Mom, I can finally sleep longer
during the weekend.

117
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
What are you doing?

118
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
My little princess,

119
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,520
it's already 7:00 a.m.

120
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,000
I woke up at 5:30 a.m.

121
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,840
I didn't even dare to flush the toilet.

122
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm only making breakfast now.

123
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,880
What are you doing?

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,040
Isn't there breakfast in the house?
There's bread and milk in the fridge.

125
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm not used to eating those.

126
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
I like to eat my own egg pancakes.

127
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,360
Can I order a takeout for you instead?

128
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,000
Takeout?

129
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,680
Didn't you watch the news?

130
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,640
Don't always order takeouts.

131
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,760
Cook it yourself if you can.

132
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
It feels better to eat home-cooked meals.

133
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,520
You can cook whatever you want to eat.

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,040
Let me do it, look at your hand.

135
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,360
- Stop, put it down.
- Hold on.

136
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,800
Go brush your teeth and wash your face.

137
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll brush it later.
Put it down. Let me do it.

138
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,040
Commander Zhou,
you tell me and I'll do it.

139
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
Add some water.

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,720
Water?

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,680
Just a little bit.

142
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
It's too much.

143
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
Add some flour.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,720
You're such an interesting girl.

145
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
How many years have you been living alone?

146
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,720
- Why are you still so clumsy?
- Who do I blame that for?

147
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Who told me this when I was young?

148
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,600
Other than academic results,
I don't have to do any housework.

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
That's why I'm worried about you.

150
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,880
You should have someone
who can take care of you.

151
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Add some onions.

152
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,240
Be gentle.

153
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,880
Go away, I'll do it myself.

154
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,760
- Don't move.
- Go away.

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,640
You can't move your hand. I'll fry it.
I know how to fry it.

156
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,440
You tell me and I'll do it.

157
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,680
- Don't add too much oil.
- Okay.

158
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,360
I know that you're worried about me.

159
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,360
You want me to get married

160
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
so that someone can take care of me.

161
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,920
But have you ever thought

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,360
about what that person
and his mom would think?

163
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,840
Don't you know all too well

164
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,680
that in most marriages,
women gave in more than men?

165
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,720
When you divorced Dad, what did you say?

166
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,320
Why do you keep comparing it to me?

167
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,600
You should compare it with the good ones.

168
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Song Ziyan.

169
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
Her husband is so good to her.

170
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,960
You should bring home one who's this good.

171
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,920
Mom, here.

172
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,160
Taste the soy milk, it's freshly made.

173
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,400
Not bad.

174
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
One should never be greedy.

175
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
I just hope that you can have
a simple and easy love.

176
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
I mean it, I don't mind.

177
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
The person that you meet

178
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,160
whether he's full of weaknesses
or full of flaws,

179
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,880
I only care whether he's good to you.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Here, taste this, is it well-cooked?

181
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
It's well-cooked, but it's a bit bland.

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,440
- Add some salt.
- No need to add more.

183
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Bland is better for your health.

184
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,240
Every family has its own problem.

185
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,600
You think that Song Ziyan is living well.

186
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,400
That's just how it looks like outside.

187
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,280
Song Ziyan has her own problem too.

188
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,320
Her husband wants a child now.

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,320
She's bothered by that,
so she found herself a job.

190
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,280
That's what happened?

191
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,200
But if they have a child together,

192
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,720
their relationship will be better.

193
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,080
The concern isn't about the child now.

194
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,480
That's what they've agreed to before
and he doesn't want to admit that now.

195
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
He changed just like this.

196
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,600
You think I'm insured once I'm married?

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,720
There are many variables in the future.

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Now you think it sounds bad
that your daughter is not married.

199
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,080
What if you say this in the future,
"My daughter is divorced."

200
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,680
Are you proud of that?

201
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
Divorce?

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,160
At least you've tried?

203
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,840
Unlike now.

204
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,960
The new car isn't out of the factory yet,
not even on the road yet,

205
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,400
but it's already scrapped
in the warehouse.

206
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
Ma'am,

207
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,600
breakfast is ready.

208
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,160
Please enjoy your meal.

209
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
I'm going to get ready.

210
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,960
Go sleep on the bed.

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,440
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR CHANGES? NO.

212
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,760
It's been a long time
since I got up so early on a weekend.

213
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,000
That's good.

214
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,720
After you finish breakfast,
follow me home.

215
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,840
Why are we going home?

216
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,280
Didn't we take everything here?

217
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,200
I want to take my teaching materials.

218
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,040
I really…

219
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,760
I want to go back to teaching
at the University for Seniors.

220
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,120
I feel so bored staying idly at home.

221
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,840
Teaching? Your hand hasn't recovered yet.

222
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,760
Did the principal agree to let you back?

223
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,920
Let me tell you, I've applied
for two months' leave at your school.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,920
They've found an interim teacher
for two months.

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,520
What should they do
if you go back suddenly? Don't go.

226
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,680
My dear little girl…

227
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,160
Are you controlling me now?

228
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,840
Who shall I blame that for?
I learned it from you.

229
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,640
It's for your own good.

230
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,120
Think about it.

231
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Can you go there in your current state?

232
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm taking you for a checkup
this afternoon.

233
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,240
You can ask the doctor, he will tell you.

234
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't deviate from the topic.

235
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,920
To go for a checkup
at your dad's hospital?

236
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,920
Please don't cause me trouble.

237
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Hello, Mr. Xu?

238
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,080
Yes, it's me who's handling it.

239
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,600
The advertising company
hasn't replied yet.

240
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
I'll check on them again.

241
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Is that so?

242
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,040
I'll go to the office later.

243
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,880
Okay, I got it. All right.

244
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
Is that Mr. Xu again?

245
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,280
Yes, he wants me to go to the office.

246
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,640
He's chasing you tightly.

247
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,200
Saturday and Sunday,
he still keeps you close by his side.

248
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,040
Mom, what are you saying?

249
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,720
Have you heard of
the "Nine-Nine-Six" work system?

250
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,000
We're always on standby,
ready to sell ourselves to our boss.

251
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm just reminding you.

252
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,120
You two are just business associates.

253
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,040
It's fine to talk about work.

254
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,200
Just be careful.

255
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Him,

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,040
as a man,

257
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,320
is quite good.

258
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,760
He has power and wealth.

259
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,680
I believe he will be generous to you too.

260
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,840
But if you want to be with him, why?

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,560
Want to get rid of poverty
and become better off?

262
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,160
You're not poor.

263
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,160
If you feel bored, you guys can hang out,
grab a coffee together.

264
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't put in your true feelings.

265
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,360
You'll get hurt in the end.

266
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Mom, what are you talking about?

267
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,760
My mind is clear.

268
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,720
Do you think I don't know
how complicated things are at work?

269
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,720
The boss is always the boss.
There are no other thoughts.

270
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,880
Don't get defensive at me.

271
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,160
This Mr. Xu,
as your senior in the workplace,

272
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,760
we can now assess his health management.

273
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,680
In the workplace,
he's been working for more than a decade.

274
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,560
His health must be affected.

275
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,480
High blood sugar, high cholesterol,
and high blood pressure, all three.

276
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
He can't escape from any of these.

277
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,040
I'll describe him as
a more selfish person today.

278
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,320
Now he wants to find a capable girl

279
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,120
who can serve him wholeheartedly

280
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,920
for the rest of his life.

281
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,080
But would that be fair for you?

282
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,240
Mom, I'm done talking.

283
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
I have to go. I'll go change my clothes.

284
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,040
This is not right.

285
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,240
I need to take you to the checkup later.

286
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,720
I won't be able to make it.

287
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,720
Don't worry.

288
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm having a hand fracture now,

289
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
not a leg bone fracture.

290
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,720
I can go by myself.

291
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,680
How can I be assured of you
going alone in this state?

292
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,640
Of course I can't.

293
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,440
Hello, Ruoxin?

294
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,839
This afternoon?

295
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,200
Yes, of course. I'm free.

296
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,920
All right, see you later.

297
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,840
- Ruoxin.
- Qi Xiao.

298
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,760
Mr. Xu asked me to go to the office.

299
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
There are some issues
with the test-drive event's venue.

300
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,120
I need to go back
to the office to discuss this.

301
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,520
Accompany my mom to the hospital.
Please take care of her.

302
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,760
- You're not going?
- That's right.

303
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,720
Why are you wasting his time?

304
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,960
He's a guy.

305
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,920
It's inconvenient for him and me,
with him being here.

306
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,760
Besides, he has helped us a lot last time.

307
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,760
We haven't even thanked him properly.

308
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,680
Qi Xiao.

309
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,920
As soon as my hand recovers,

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,600
I'll definitely invite you
to have a meal at our house.

311
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
I'll make sure to thank you properly.

312
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
Today,

313
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,920
I don't need your help.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Go, go. It's Saturday today.

315
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,840
Go and have fun.
Accompany your girlfriend.

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Ms. Zhou.

317
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
I'm free in the afternoon.

318
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
I don't have a girlfriend either.

319
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,720
I'm Ruoxin's assistant. I'm willing
to accompany you for your checkup.

320
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,280
Mom, Qi Xiao is very reliable.

321
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,600
When you had the accident,
he accompanied you too.

322
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,320
Qi Xiao, please take care of her
this afternoon.

323
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,320
Keep me updated on what the doctor says.

324
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm leaving.

325
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,480
Mom, I'm leaving.

326
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Ms. Zhou.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
Let me tell you.

328
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,520
You're her office assistant,

329
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
not her life assistant.

330
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Her personal affairs are not your concern.

331
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Also, is she paying you for overtime?

332
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,240
Ms. Zhou, I don't need overtime fees.

333
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,840
Ruoxin is very good to me,
she really looks after me.

334
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,320
You treat me very well too.

335
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,680
Besides, if you go alone for the checkup,

336
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,080
Ruoxin will be worried
and I'll be worried too.

337
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,880
If that's so, Qi Xiao…

338
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm really sorry

339
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,560
to have to bother you today.

340
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,960
It's all right.

341
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,440
By the way, should we add
each other on WeChat?

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,000
You can reach me easily
if you need my help next time.

343
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,760
Okay. My phone is there.

344
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,560
I'll help you do it.

345
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,000
ZHOU YILAN

346
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,080
REQUEST TO ADD AS FRIEND

347
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,880
It's done.

348
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,880
This is me.

349
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
Hello.

350
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,480
Qi Xiao. I'm Ms. Zhou.

351
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,960
Please reply if you hear this.

352
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,920
Ms. Zhou, I'm Qi Xiao.

353
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
Message received, over.

354
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,880
<i>Ms. Zhou, I'm Qi Xiao.</i>

355
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,320
<i>Message received, over.</i>

356
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,040
This is so convenient.

357
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,080
I know, right?

358
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,000
Let me tell you, young man.

359
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
You're so quick-witted.

360
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
You're very tall too.

361
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,040
Let's compare our heights.

362
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,880
All right.

363
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,840
Next time, when I meet someone suitable,

364
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,640
I'll definitely introduce her to you.

365
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Ms. Zhou…

366
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
Actually, you don't have to.

367
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,960
I already

368
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,920
have someone that I like.

369
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,520
Sorry, I talked too much.

370
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,000
It's okay.

371
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,320
Take a seat.

372
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,080
How long have you been Xinxin's assistant?

373
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,680
It's been a few months.

374
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,080
This is my first job after graduating.

375
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm grateful to Ruoxin
for giving me this opportunity.

376
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,040
Otherwise, I might not even be able
to afford my rent now.

377
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes, it's really difficult
to find a job these days.

378
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,760
One step at a time, don't worry.

379
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,640
But is this company really this busy?

380
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,960
You still need to work overtime
every Saturday and Sunday?

381
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,600
It's like this, Ms. Zhou.

382
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,520
We're currently in
the New Energy Department,

383
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,000
a newly established department.

384
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,400
We're launching a new product now,
so we're busier.

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
Moreover…

386
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,720
Mr. Xu really trusts Ruoxin,
he relies on her for everything.

387
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,320
This Mr. Xu, what's his background?

388
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,280
Is he a friendly person?

389
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,600
He was transferred from the headquarters.

390
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,400
He's the youngest Senior Partner
of our company.

391
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,480
When he first arrived,
he didn't have anyone around.

392
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,720
Then, he noticed Ruoxin.

393
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
But other than work,

394
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,640
he also took Ruoxin
to many private social occasions.

395
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,640
Some art exhibitions and cocktail parties.

396
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,280
He also took Ruoxin
to look at some houses.

397
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,040
What?

398
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,480
They even looked at houses?

399
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,800
He said that he wants to buy a house,
so he asked Ruoxin for some advice.

400
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
But what he did as a manager

401
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
- isn't appropriate.
- I know, right?

402
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,360
- You also think it's inappropriate?
- It's inappropriate.

403
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,160
But now, this kind of situation
has gotten lesser.

404
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,960
I think Ruoxin
must've told Mr. Xu very clearly.

405
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,520
Then Mr. Xu must be playing
the cat and mouse game.

406
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,600
It doesn't matter what the mouse thinks,

407
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,000
what matters is how the cat thinks.

408
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Ms. Zhou, you don't like Mr. Xu?

409
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,760
No.

410
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
How could I?

411
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,800
What's my right to dislike your boss?

412
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,120
But in the future, if Mr. Xu did something

413
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,760
unusual to Xinxin again,

414
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
you might as well let me know.

415
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,880
Anyway, we have each other's contact
on WeChat now.

416
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Sure, no problem.

417
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,160
Ms. Zhou,

418
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
I'll inform you immediately
if there's something new.

419
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
All right. Thank you.

420
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,840
That's right.

421
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,520
Why don't you

422
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,760
have a simple meal here?

423
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,920
That's good.

424
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,760
But my hand hasn't fully recovered yet,
I can't perform my best.

425
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
Don't worry, just take a rest.

426
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,800
Leave it to me.

427
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,160
Let me take a look.

428
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,720
I'll just cook something, Ms. Zhou.

429
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,920
You're starting to work again?

430
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,440
Why is it still this?

431
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,200
How long are you going to edit this?

432
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Look here.

433
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,320
DRAFTS

434
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,640
What are they? Seems interesting.

435
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,200
The first draft to the tenth draft.

436
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
What are the last ones?

437
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,880
"I'll be a loser if I edit again."

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,320
"I'm not human if I edit it again."

439
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,000
"Dad, you can edit however you want."

440
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,640
Su Yang, you're a genius.

441
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,600
You're growing at a rapid speed.

442
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,960
Do you know what the client said
when I handed in my draft this morning?

443
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,440
What did he say?

444
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,880
He said it looked like
the first draft was the best.

445
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,880
- He wants me to edit it again.
- As expected,

446
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,800
society's brutal beating.

447
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,400
What did you do the whole day?

448
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,760
Why do you look coquettish?

449
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I do? I don't, right?

450
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,280
I accompanied Ruoxin's mom
to the hospital for a checkup.

451
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,640
You're good at this.

452
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,760
You're pleasing the mother-in-law.

453
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,920
How was it?
Did you leave a good impression?

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
Of course I did.

455
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
Did you forget my nickname?

456
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
"Aunt and mom killer."

457
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,680
I'm very good at coaxing mothers.
I've never failed.

458
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,840
It seems like there's a lot of hope.

459
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I think

460
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,840
Ruoxin's mom's impression of me

461
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,880
should be very good.

462
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,520
Extremely good.

463
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Perfect.

464
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,720
Mom.

465
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,360
- I'm back.
- You're back?

466
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,120
Qi Xiao told me that the doctor said
you're recovering well, is it?

467
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,880
You can remove the bandages next week.

468
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,800
It's you who took very good care of me.

469
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
Be honest with me.

470
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,000
What do you think about Qi Xiao?

471
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Quite good.

472
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,040
He is very mature.

473
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,600
He's humble and responsible too.

474
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,360
Not like those guys in their twenties
who are reckless.

475
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,200
He also looks handsome.

476
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,840
Although it's not the era of speaking
with good looks nowadays,

477
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,480
appearance is still very important.

478
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,680
What's more important

479
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,680
is that he's from Shanghai.

480
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,680
I like this guy.

481
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,960
Mom, what do you want to do?

482
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,360
I want to introduce him to a girlfriend.

483
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,680
I want to introduce
Mr. Wang's daughter to him.

484
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
How old is Mr. Wang's daughter?

485
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,080
She's in the third year of university.

486
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,240
She's a grown lady now.

487
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
The third year of university?

488
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,240
When I was a high schooler,
she was still in kindergarten.

489
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,560
Why? Are you afraid?

490
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,640
You have a feeling of crisis?

491
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,960
I told you before not to be stubborn.

492
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,600
Time and tide wait for no man.

493
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,200
The young girls are coming out
one by one now.

494
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,480
But…

495
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,240
- It's just that…
- What is it?

496
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,200
Qi Xiao said that he has someone he likes,
but he hasn't confessed yet.

497
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,800
Who is that girl?

498
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
Why trouble yourself then?

499
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,680
He already has someone he likes,
you're still introducing him.

500
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,920
So what?

501
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,840
They're not living together.

502
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
Besides,

503
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,040
if we introduce him to more people,

504
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,480
then they can have fair play, right?

505
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,480
Aren't you his manager?

506
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,800
You can introduce her to him.

507
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,040
Tell him that
Mr. Wang's daughter is very good.

508
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,400
She studies finance and she can draw.

509
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
The age difference is two years.

510
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,600
They're such a good match.

511
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,160
How are they a good match?

512
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm not going to do it.

513
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,640
I hope Ruoxin's mom

514
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,600
can praise me in front of her.

515
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,200
Yes.

516
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,080
Hopefully, Ruoxin gets excited
and devotes herself to you.

517
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,360
That's also possible.

518
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,600
Su Yang! It worked!

519
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,320
Ruoxin's mom said that
she has a good impression of me.

520
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,760
She praised me like I'm a flower!

521
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,640
- Flower.
- Congratulations, buddy.

522
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,600
Hello, Zou Cheng?

523
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,920
- You've arrived home?
<i>- No.</i>

524
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,400
<i>I'm letting you know,
I'm meeting a client tonight.</i>

525
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,560
<i>I'll be back late.</i>

526
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,600
- All right.
<i>- You're not home?</i>

527
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,160
Me?

528
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,920
I'm at Ruoxin's house with her mom.

529
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,000
Ruoxin is working overtime today.

530
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
<i>All right, I'm hanging up.</i>

531
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,080
How can he be so petty?
Being angry for so long.

532
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,040
Ziyan, it's a weekend night.
There are many customers.

533
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,480
- Let's hurry up and serve faster.
- Coming!

534
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm finally experiencing
the weekend passion of the citizens.

535
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,880
Many loyal customers are coming
for the new menu.

536
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,240
It's full of good reviews!

537
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,440
Hi, may I know for how many people?

538
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,880
- I have a reservation, I'm Mr. Zou.
- Hello, Mr. Zou.

539
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,840
- This way, please.
- Okay. Here, Mr. Wang.

540
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,560
- Here.
- Okay.

541
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,720
Mr. Wang,
this place is quite good, isn't it?

542
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,240
Yes, it's quite good.

543
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,360
How did you find out about this place?

544
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,760
I came here with my wife before.

545
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,200
I saw that you're quite sophisticated,
I figured you'd like it.

546
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,120
Ziyan, your cooking skill is so good.

547
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,800
I don't believe you've never learned it.

548
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
I've never learned it professionally.

549
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,480
But being married for so many years,
this is what I've been doing.

550
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,960
I guess I found out about it
in my own way.

551
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,760
Mr. Qin, I think Leizi is too busy.
I'll help him serve a dish.

552
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,080
Sure.

553
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Here's the drink you ordered.

554
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,000
You're right.

555
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,520
A woman should stay at home
and look after the family.

556
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
That's quite good.

557
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,160
Hello, let me serve your food.

558
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,600
Excuse me. Please enjoy your meal.

559
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,240
Mr. Zou?

560
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,920
What happened? Your ex-girlfriend?

561
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,920
Song Ziyan.

562
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
You have nothing to explain to me?

563
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,480
What's wrong?

564
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,600
"What's wrong?"

565
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,000
Aren't you looking after Ruoxin's mom?

566
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,400
Why are you at the bar?

567
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,040
I couldn't find a chance to tell you.

568
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,960
That's my new job.

569
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,080
The kitchen assistant has resigned.
I coincidentally got that job.

570
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
You found such a nice job.

571
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,400
Work as a helper at a bar, serving dishes.

572
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
What's wrong with serving dishes?

573
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,640
Didn't I serve dishes for you at home too?

574
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
How's that the same?

575
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,240
You serve dishes at home,
a woman taking care of her family.

576
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,520
You serve dishes at the bar,
that's serving others.

577
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,760
I ignored you for two days,
I thought you'd stop finding a job.

578
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,040
I can't believe you're serving dishes.

579
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,640
What's wrong with serving dishes?

580
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,760
Do you find my job embarrassing now?

581
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,040
You think my job is inferior to others?

582
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,880
Zou Cheng,
I've been cooking for you at home.

583
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,400
You've never complimented me!

584
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,880
But now that I'm cooking for others,

585
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,000
as long as I put effort,

586
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,040
I can get compliments from clients
and the boss!

587
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,040
I'm willing to serve dishes at the bar.

588
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,679
I feel happier to serve dishes at the bar
than to serve you at home!

589
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm leaving the house now.

590
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,679
I want you to see

591
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,719
that I, Song Ziyan,

592
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,560
have a social value.

593
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,520
Your social value is to serve dishes?

594
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,199
All right, how much is your social value
paying you each month?

595
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
2,000 yuan? 3,000 yuan or 4,000 yuan?

596
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,080
Song Ziyan, you want to walk out the door,

597
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,120
you want equality and respect,
you don't want to be just my wife.

598
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,280
Good, from today onwards,
we'll pay off our house loan together.

599
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,960
You'll pay half and I'll pay half.

600
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,600
Is that enough equality and respect

601
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,480
to prove that you're an independent woman?

602
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,719
You…

603
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,560
All right.

604
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,639
This house…

605
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,679
I won't stay in this house anymore, okay?

606
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,480
- Hello.
- Hello, Ruoxin.

607
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,960
Come over to my house.

608
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,920
<i>Take a proper cab, don't take a black cab.</i>

609
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,280
<i>Don't wander alone.</i>

610
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,840
- Come here now, I'll wait for you.
- Okay.

611
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,880
My mom is here.

612
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,760
- Zou Cheng is too much!
- I know.

613
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,760
Here.

614
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Eat something. Get up.

615
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
- I don't want to eat.
- Have a bite.

616
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,560
I don't want to eat.

617
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,360
I was quite happy today.

618
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,800
There were many customers at the bar.

619
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,120
Everyone was praising the new menu.

620
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,520
Who knows Zou Cheng took his client there?

621
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,760
When I served the dishes,
he caught me on the spot.

622
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
I'm so unlucky.

623
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,480
It's all right to let him know.

624
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,480
It's better than lying to him, how tiring.

625
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,680
That's right.

626
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,840
You don't know how bad
the words Zou Cheng said earlier.

627
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,360
He even mistook my cooking as a takeout.

628
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,760
Yet he still tells me
to just stay at home.

629
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,960
No way!

630
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,960
All right, let me tell you.

631
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,840
Everyone changes eventually.

632
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,520
Changes don't necessarily mean bad.

633
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,480
For instance, we like shopping.

634
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
When we were younger,

635
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,480
didn't we like fashionable
and hourglass figure clothes?

636
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
Slowly, we started to like

637
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
elegant and classy designs.

638
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,080
It could be that our taste has changed.

639
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,560
Another way of putting this

640
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
is we're getting to know ourselves better.

641
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,720
You're the same too.

642
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Actually, you want to find a job
that can prove your worth

643
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,840
and find joy in it.

644
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,960
But you keep telling yourself
that your husband has changed,

645
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,560
so you need to find a job.

646
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,600
Why?

647
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,680
Ruoxin.

648
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,680
I feel so useless now.

649
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,880
You didn't hear
what Zou Cheng said to me earlier.

650
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,880
He said that

651
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,280
if I want to prove
that I'm more than just his wife,

652
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,560
then I should bear
half of the family expenses.

653
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,800
Yes. He's right to say that.

654
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,440
But you know what?

655
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,520
I don't even have the ability to say yes.

656
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,080
It's all right.

657
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,160
Ruoxin,

658
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
tell me.

659
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,920
If I didn't get married,

660
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,000
didn't think that Zou Cheng is reliable,
and resigned recklessly,

661
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,920
who would I be now?

662
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
Would I be like you,

663
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,600
working as a manager or director?

664
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,600
In that case, I'll throw money to his face

665
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,560
and tell him to get lost!

666
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,160
It's all right.

667
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,560
Isn't it just an argument?

668
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,200
Who'd be nice while arguing?

669
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,600
Of course it sounds bad, right?

670
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,680
- Zou Cheng certainly didn't mean that.
- He didn't mean that.

671
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,440
But he's just telling the truth
while arguing.

672
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,080
I feel so wronged.

673
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,520
It's all right.

674
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,560
Stop crying.

675
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,680
You didn't eat. You should eat something.

676
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,680
I'm not eating. I'm on a diet.

677
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,720
Why are you still on a diet?

678
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,080
It's all right.

679
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,680
- Ms. Zhou, I'm…
- Zou Cheng.

680
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,480
- You still remember me?
- I do.

681
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,720
I've been a class teacher for many years.
I can remember everyone clearly.

682
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,880
When you got married to Ziyan,

683
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,160
Ruoxin and I were sitting at the table
beside the main table.

684
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,720
Do you still remember?

685
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,720
I do.

686
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Come on in.

687
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,280
Please come in.

688
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,080
Zou Cheng.

689
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,640
Ziyan is a close friend
who grew up with Ruoxin.

690
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,000
I've been telling Ruoxin that,

691
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,920
"Ziyan has such a good husband,

692
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,800
her life is one hundred times
better than yours."

693
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,680
I still remember clearly

694
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,960
everything you said at the wedding.

695
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,280
You said that as long Ziyan is happy,
you're happy.

696
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,120
Everything that Ziyan wants
is what you want too.

697
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,840
Am I correct?

698
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,640
Ms. Zhou, you have such a good memory.

699
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,600
It's not my memory that's good.

700
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,520
It's you,

701
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,160
after living as a couple,
who has forgotten what you said.

702
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,400
You're a good man.

703
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,680
But Ziyan…

704
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,120
She was held carefully
in the palm of the hands by her parents.

705
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,400
She was adored by her parents.

706
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,840
That's how she grew up.

707
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,560
She might be a bit stubborn.

708
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,920
You're a man, you should be more generous.

709
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,880
Be more tolerant when there's something.

710
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,880
Whatever it is,

711
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,280
you two should discuss it together.

712
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,760
Do you agree?

713
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
Ms. Zhou, you're right.

714
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,920
I'll remember it.

715
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,520
Then I'll…

716
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,600
Xinxin.

717
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,200
Please ask Ziyan to come out.

718
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,200
Ziyan, Zou Cheng is here to pick you up.

719
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,960
Go home with him.

720
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Your parents aren't feeling well,
don't make them worry.

721
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,600
Zou Cheng.

722
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,560
Honey, my attitude was bad yesterday.

723
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,720
Can you not be angry anymore?
Please forgive me.

724
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,880
Let's go home.

725
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,720
Ms. Zhou, I'm leaving now.

726
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,440
Mom,

727
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,280
did we wake you up yesterday?

728
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,840
You two have been talking for a night.

729
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,320
I've been sitting here the whole night.

730
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,720
Everyone has their difficulties.

731
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,840
All family matters are chicken feathers
when it drops on the floor.

732
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,400
Then why are you rushing me
to the chicken feather pile?

733
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,960
I wish I could make
a feather duster bundle

734
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
and beat you now.

735
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,120
Be careful with your hand, Commander Zhou.

736
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,720
Once your hand has recovered,
we'll pick a day.

737
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,080
Do you want to take a rest?

738
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,440
