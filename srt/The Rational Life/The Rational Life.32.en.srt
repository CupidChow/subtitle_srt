1
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,240
Mr. Gu.

2
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
I've respected you
from the moment I met you

3
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,160
because you're Ruoxin's friend.

4
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,280
I believe you're a man of character.

5
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
I want to tell you

6
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,280
I don't have ulterior motives
for being with Ruoxin.

7
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
I'll rely on myself to succeed.

8
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,400
I feel relieved for Ruoxin
that you think this way.

9
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
But do you really think

10
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,840
that you can succeed quickly

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,400
by just relying on yourself?

12
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,240
How much is a young man's pride worth?

13
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,040
Compared to a successful career,

14
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
it's not even worth mentioning.

15
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,680
Tell me.

16
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
You're with Ruoxin.

17
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
What do you have that she doesn't have?

18
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,120
To be frank, she can help you.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
Compared to your peers,

20
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,240
you'll save years of struggling.

21
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
And you'll gain even more.

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,960
That's why I say you're a smart kid.

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,200
Of course, nowadays,

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,640
there are many young people like you.

25
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
So I really don't mean
to look down on you.

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,160
Yes, successful people like you

27
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
are born with a head start in life.

28
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,160
You would have a hard time

29
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,400
relating to entrepreneurs
who came from nothing.

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,920
So I don't mind
your prejudiced views about me.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,640
But please respect Shen Ruoxin.

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,200
She's no fool.

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,800
If I were like you said,

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,840
someone who approached her with an agenda,

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,800
then do you see her

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,520
as someone who allows others
to exploit and manipulate her?

37
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,760
She earned what she has now
with her hard work.

38
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
It's enough that she understands me.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,760
As for what others think, I don't care.

40
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
I know Ruoxin is strong-minded.

41
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,760
That's why I'm spending
so much time and energy

42
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,880
to say this to you.

43
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,600
You should know.

44
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,520
Ruoxin had never asked favors
of anyone for herself.

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,200
But today,

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,760
I can't believe that

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
she sought to pull strings

48
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,600
for your design competition.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,280
She asked me for connections.

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
Now you stand in front of me

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
talking about self-respect.

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,360
Qi Xiao.

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
You have no right.

54
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,480
Take care.

55
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
Qi Xiao.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Ruoxin, I'll help you.

58
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,360
I'll see you again.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,399
Thank you so much
for the nice arrangements.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,399
Of course.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Get home safely.

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,920
Just follow my car
until you reach the city.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,840
Okay.

64
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,440
- Bye.
- Bye. Drive slowly.

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm going, handsome boy.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
Bye, handsome boy.

67
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
What's wrong? You've been in a daze.

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,160
- I'm fine.
- You don't look fine.

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,960
I'm really okay.

70
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
I'll follow your car.

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480
Stay safe on the road.

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,720
- Drive slowly.
- Okay.

73
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I sent something to your phone.

74
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,320
Did you see it?

75
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,960
CALL ME SU XIAOWANG

76
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,000
You made an official account?

77
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
Sijia made it for me.

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,800
She said a personal brand
is essential for a designer.

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,000
On the webtoon forums,

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,920
everyone goes for the platform.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
All the traffic benefits the platform,

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,360
not me.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,200
By opening an official account,
I can build a fanbase.

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,560
I had no idea.

85
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,960
The third chapter
already has over 2,000 views.

86
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,440
Congratulations.

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,120
For newcomers,
2,000 views are pretty good.

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
All thanks to Sijia.

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,920
She sent incentives to all her groups,

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
asking for clicks and shares.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,920
If it weren't for her,

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,280
I really couldn't do it.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,280
Su Yang, does this make you feel

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
that you owe Sijia too many favors?

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,600
She helped you so much.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Do you feel incompetent?

97
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,760
What do you mean by that?

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,440
I don't mean to offend.
Don't misunderstand.

99
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,720
I just…

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,920
I can't explain.

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
I just feel like

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
I might not be good enough for Ruoxin.

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
I said I wanted to protect her.

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,080
I want to show her that I'm a man.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,960
In reality, I just make her worry.

106
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,560
What's wrong? What happened?

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
I don't know what happened
between you two.

108
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
But I'm very grateful to Sijia
for everything she has done for me.

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,560
My only thought is
to be even nicer to her from now on.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
So, Qi Xiao,

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,360
whatever happened between you and Ruoxin,

112
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,320
I believe you two are good to each other.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Don't overthink it.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,720
And your top priority right now
is this competition.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,880
If you win an award,

116
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,200
you can prove yourself

117
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
and hold your head high
in front of Ruoxin.

118
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,040
By the way, there's one more thing.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,680
Before you submit your design
to the judges,

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,120
you need to register the copyright.
Don't forget.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Okay.

122
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,560
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

123
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,760
I told you.

124
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,120
Don't worry about the investment.

125
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,720
Just focus on the competition.

126
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,040
The investor contract isn't in the studio.

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,160
Why would I leave
such an important contract

128
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,520
in a busy store?

129
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,480
Tell me the truth.

130
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
Are there actually no investors?

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,640
Is that starter money from Ruoxin?

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,320
Who did you hear that from?

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,920
If it were from Ruoxin,

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
I would tell you right away.

135
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,440
Calm down.

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Yes, Ruoxin told me not to tell you.

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm just following orders.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
See?

139
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,400
She knew you would react this way.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,480
There you are, Ms. Zhou.

141
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,640
Someone has been waiting
outside your house.

142
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,720
Yutao?

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Ms. Zhou.

144
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,799
Why are you outside my house?

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,919
I came to visit you.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,919
The last time we ate, you paid the bill.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
I feel bad about that.

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,400
It's not a big deal.

149
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Don't take it to heart.

150
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,240
Last weekend, I went to a nearby resort

151
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,160
with some college friends for two days.

152
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,840
The owner insisted on giving us

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,840
their own free-range eggs when we left.

154
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,960
It's of good quality, so I brought them.

155
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Here, take it.

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
- Thank you so much. You're too kind.
- You're welcome.

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,960
Did Xinxin go
to the last classmate reunion?

158
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,160
Of course she did. Didn't she tell you?

159
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,120
No.

160
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,320
She even brought her boyfriend.

161
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,280
Xinxin has a boyfriend?

162
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,640
That's right.

163
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
Didn't you know?

164
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,720
I didn't know.

165
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,080
You've met him.

166
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
The handsome guy
at the dinner last time, Qi Xiao.

167
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,280
You're mistaken.

168
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,920
Qi Xiao is her assistant,

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
not her boyfriend.

170
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,640
He's 12 years younger than her.

171
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
You're mistaken.

172
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,880
Ms. Zhou,
I'm not at liberty to go into detail.

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,040
Anyway, you can ask Ruoxin.

174
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
- I'll get going.
- No, wait.

175
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,880
Qi Xiao?

176
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,240
Please bring these two items upstairs

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,480
to unit 401.

178
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Where are you going?

179
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Ms. Zhou!

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,360
Ms. Zhou, where are you going? Ms. Zhou!

181
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,040
Mom.

182
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,640
Mom, what are you looking for?

183
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,480
What are you looking for, Mom?

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,920
Mom, what are you looking for?

185
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Mom!

186
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,000
Mom, what's wrong?

187
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
When I went on the trip,

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,080
I prayed for a relationship for you.

189
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,360
But I didn't expect it to come so fast.

190
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,520
This relationship isn't what I wanted.

191
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
I heard it from someone.

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,240
You have a boyfriend. Is that right?

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Did Gu Yutao tell you that?

194
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,560
It doesn't matter who told me.

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,080
Just answer me. Yes or no?

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,560
I don't want to hide it from you.

197
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
Yes, I'm dating.

198
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
Who are you dating?

199
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,200
I think it's still premature.

200
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,160
It's not steady yet, so I didn't tell you.

201
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,080
Premature.

202
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,560
He does look immature

203
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
and he'll never mature.

204
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,720
Why?

205
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
Why did you hide it from me?

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I just didn't want you

207
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
to be like this, so--

208
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,880
Like what?

209
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
Are you worried about me?

210
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,160
You should worry about yourself.

211
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
When you're 40, he'll be 28.

212
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,080
When you retire,

213
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,160
he'll be in his prime.

214
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
When you two hold hands

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
and walk on the street,

216
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
what will people think?

217
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,960
Besides,

218
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,880
Qi Xiao's mom and I are acquaintances.

219
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Have you ever considered my position?

220
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,160
She'll point at me

221
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,800
and say my daughter kidnapped her son.

222
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,520
Mom, you're being offensive.

223
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,600
Qi Xiao's mom

224
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,800
doesn't oppose us.

225
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,520
On the contrary, she's quite supportive.

226
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,040
So she knows.

227
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,000
She knows.

228
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,080
Gu Yutao knows it too.

229
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
The whole world already knows.

230
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,040
Except for me.

231
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,240
I didn't know.

232
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,040
I've always thought of Qi Xiao

233
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,480
as a kid.

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,960
A good kid.

235
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,600
I even took it upon myself
to set him up with someone

236
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,000
and spoke praises of him.

237
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Little did I know,

238
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,280
in the end,

239
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,680
he went after my daughter.

240
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,520
I'm such a fool.

241
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,120
Mom, Qi Xiao and I--

242
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Don't mention him!

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,680
Are you happy now?

244
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
You're family with them now.

245
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,760
I'm an outsider.

246
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,240
I can't do anything about you.

247
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,240
That's why you kept it from me
and humored me.

248
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,800
You lied to me.

249
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Mom.

250
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,760
ZENGZISN

251
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
I'm coming!

252
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,600
Coming.

253
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Who is it?

254
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,000
Come in.

255
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,440
Yilan, why are you here?

256
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,240
We're not on the same wavelength now.

257
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,720
If I take this,

258
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,880
I'll feel guilty.

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,360
Don't go! What do you mean?

260
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
You're confusing me.

261
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Come in first. Come in.

262
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,760
What's going on?

263
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,600
Come in first.

264
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,560
What do you mean?

265
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,240
Why don't you want the shawl I gave you?

266
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
Take a breath.

267
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
- Don't take me for a fool.
- What?

268
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,480
You've been doing undercover work.

269
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,360
You've been patronizing me.

270
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,160
- What?
- I want to ask you.

271
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,840
Are you ready?

272
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
I came here today

273
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,200
to ask you frankly.

274
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,160
Your son and my daughter.

275
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,640
When did you find out?

276
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,560
Yilan, you already know everything?

277
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,360
Actually, I've been looking
for a chance to talk to you.

278
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,120
- But--
- Give me a break.

279
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,480
You've robbed me blind.

280
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,760
I looked around now.

281
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,680
I have nothing left.

282
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,800
I'm all alone.

283
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,680
Those two must have lost it.

284
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
They must have lost their minds.

285
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,600
Yilan.

286
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,200
They're dating.

287
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,200
Isn't that great?

288
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,320
Great?

289
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,320
Why should we deceive ourselves?

290
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,840
How old is your son?

291
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,200
How old is my daughter?

292
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
They're 12 years apart.

293
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,040
A May-December romance.

294
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
How trendy.

295
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,360
But this time,

296
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,320
is your son serious?

297
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Yilan, my son is serious.

298
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,040
He really is serious.

299
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,160
All these years,

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,160
Qi Xiao has never been so serious

301
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,040
about loving a girl.

302
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,200
He told me he's certain.

303
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,440
His mind is set.

304
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,840
He isn't playing around.

305
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
He's not just having fun

306
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
in the heat of the moment.

307
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,800
My daughter is so outstanding.

308
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
Doesn't he feel
any pressure being with her?

309
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,640
Can he control her?

310
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,240
Why are you kicking up a fuss?

311
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,040
Yilan, I'm not kicking up a fuss.

312
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,640
They just started dating

313
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,000
and you're already talking
about splitting them up.

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,480
Yilan.

315
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,400
Qi Xiao really likes Ruoxin.

316
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,119
Let me tell you.

317
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,960
I can't guarantee
anything else about my son,

318
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,599
but there is one thing

319
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,720
I can confidently tell you.

320
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,520
He has a strong sense of responsibility.

321
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,200
Ever since he was a child,

322
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,600
no matter what he did,

323
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,040
he would see it to the end.

324
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,720
He has liked Ruoxin for a long time.

325
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,560
I can see it.

326
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,200
You have to believe me.

327
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,960
That day at dinner,

328
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,480
I don't know if you saw it or not,

329
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,960
but I did.

330
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,800
When my son looked at your daughter,

331
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,320
his eyes were lit up.

332
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,920
When your daughter smiled,

333
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,880
my son was so happy that he could fly.

334
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,640
When your daughter frowned,

335
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
my son was worried out of his mind.

336
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,920
Yilan, as his mom,

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,440
my biggest wish in life

338
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
is for my son to be happy.

339
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,880
I know what you're worried about.

340
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Your daughter is much older than my son.

341
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,480
To be frank,

342
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,080
she's also past
the ideal childbearing age.

343
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,640
But that's all right.

344
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,640
As long as they're happy,

345
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,920
whether they have children

346
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,520
isn't that important to me.

347
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,000
I respect their decision, Yilan.

348
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,360
But the biggest regret in life

349
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,120
is not having a choice

350
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,520
and not getting what you want.

351
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,520
It's nothing personal.

352
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,120
You and my daughter sing his praises.

353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
I also think he's nice.

354
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
But they have chosen

355
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,720
the most difficult path.

356
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,640
They will face
a lot of pressure from society.

357
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,440
Nobody will support them.

358
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
Many years later,

359
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
when your son

360
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,240
has gained experience,

361
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,840
maybe they will want

362
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,440
to go in different directions.

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,600
They'll still end up breaking up.

364
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,640
What will my daughter do then?

365
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,000
She can't afford it.

366
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,400
Yilan, why do you care

367
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,600
about what other people think?

368
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,400
Our children's happiness
is what matters the most.

369
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,040
We're both moms.

370
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
I understand.

371
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,320
Truly, I understand.

372
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
When the kids were little, we told them

373
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,040
we had to rely on each other.

374
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,240
Now that they're grown up,

375
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,960
they're flying off on their own.

376
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,360
It'll kill a part of us.

377
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,200
A piece of our hearts will stay with them.

378
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,720
I understand.

379
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,480
You're right. I raised Ruoxin on my own.

380
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,000
Every family has its own problems.

381
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
Today, I don't want to talk about her dad.

382
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,160
I just want to talk about my daughter.

383
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,720
She had cola splashed in her face.

384
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,120
You know about that, right?

385
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,360
I always taught her

386
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
that one who only knows hatred

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
has no future.

388
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,880
So even now,

389
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
she won't tell me anything.

390
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,360
She carries the burden herself.

391
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,280
But I'm a mom.

392
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
I hope she will soon find

393
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
a mature

394
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
and reliable man

395
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,160
who can protect her.

396
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,920
Yilan, how do you know

397
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
my son can't protect her?

398
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,760
Apart from being younger
than your daughter,

399
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
in what way is he inferior to others?

400
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,000
Yilan.

401
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm not as capable as you.

402
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,120
In terms of being a mom,

403
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,880
I really can't compare to you.

404
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,920
Look at you.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,080
You're in control of your work and life.

406
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,480
You're a respected teacher at school.

407
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,480
Your house is in order.

408
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
But I can't.

409
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,040
I'm not as competent as you.

410
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,760
When Qi Xiao's dad left,

411
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,040
my entire life fell apart.

412
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,640
I couldn't do my job.

413
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,520
I couldn't keep my house in order.

414
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
One meal might end up burnt.

415
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,960
The next meal might turn out raw.

416
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,600
The clothes I bought for my child

417
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,640
were either too big or too small.

418
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,680
I couldn't do anything right.

419
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,840
In terms of being a mom,

420
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,160
you might get a perfect score,

421
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,440
but I might not even get 50 points.

422
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,360
But Yilan,

423
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,760
I believe there is one thing

424
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,120
at which I outshine you.

425
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,240
That is,

426
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,800
I believe in my child.

427
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,000
When Qi Xiao's dad left,

428
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,280
Qi Xiao was only six years old.

429
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,680
Many neighbors told me

430
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,720
not to tell him about it.

431
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,560
Just tell him

432
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,400
that his dad is on a business trip.

433
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,400
Or tell him

434
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,480
that his dad went abroad.

435
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,320
Otherwise, it'll affect him.

436
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,000
That night,

437
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,600
I mulled it over.

438
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,880
I felt that

439
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,320
I should still tell my son the truth.

440
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,000
He has the right to know the truth.

441
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
I pulled my son aside that day.

442
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,200
I told him,

443
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,040
"Qi Xiao, your dad is gone.

444
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,280
You'll never see him again.

445
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
If you want to cry,

446
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
just cry.

447
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
Because I feel like crying too."

448
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,680
That night, we hugged

449
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
and cried all night.

450
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,480
The next morning,

451
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,320
I wiped my tears away

452
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,680
and talked to him.

453
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,600
"Your dad is gone.

454
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,040
But I'm here.

455
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,160
As long as you love me

456
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,480
and I love you,

457
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,760
this family will still be here.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Your dad used to do all the work.

459
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,400
I don't know how to do anything.

460
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,160
But from now on,

461
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll take care of everything
around the house.

462
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,760
I'll do my best.

463
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,320
And you?

464
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,600
You must help me.

465
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,960
Let's work hard together."

466
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,640
He took my hand.

467
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
He told me,

468
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,200
"I will, Mom.

469
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll work hard with you."

470
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,280
A six-year-old child.

471
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,480
All these years,

472
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,520
we have stumbled through life,

473
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,880
held each other up,
and supported each other.

474
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,320
We made it.

475
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,880
Everything has changed.

476
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,680
There is only one thing

477
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,480
that hasn't changed.

478
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,960
I believe in my child.

479
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,680
Yilan, think about it.

480
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,640
The kids are grown now.

481
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,320
Society has changed.

482
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
You still want

483
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
to arrange everything for her.

484
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,960
Let me ask you.

485
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,000
How long can you keep doing that?

486
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,920
Ruoxin is exceptional.

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,400
Why don't you believe
in the choices she makes?

488
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,440
It's not that I don't trust her choice.

489
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
But as her mom,

490
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,040
I'm just scared.

491
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,200
Yilan.

492
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,480
Don't be scared.

493
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,360
When you're scared,

494
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
just keep in mind

495
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,280
that she still has you.

496
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,960
If she has you,
everything will be all right.

497
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,080
PRODUCT SUBMISSION

498
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
SUBMISSION ACCEPTED

499
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,840
<i>Do you know?</i>

500
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,200
<i>Before this,</i>

501
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,880
Ruoxin had never asked favors
of anyone for herself.

502
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,480
But today,

503
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,480
I can't believe that
she sought to pull strings

504
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,920
for your design competition.

505
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,680
She asked me for connections.

506
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,200
Now you stand in front of me

507
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,920
talking about self-respect.

508
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,960
Qi Xiao.

509
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,120
You have no right.

510
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,760
Calm down.

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Yes, Ruoxin told me not to tell you.

512
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm just following orders.

513
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
SHEN RUOXIN

514
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,880
ACCEPT

515
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,640
Hello?

516
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,320
Qi Xiao, I want to tell you something.

517
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,240
My mom knows about us.

518
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,960
Did you tell her?

519
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,360
It wasn't me. Someone else did.

520
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,560
Someone else? Who?

521
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,880
Was it Gu Yutao?

522
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,520
It doesn't matter now.

523
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,840
I knew he was up to no good.

524
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,400
So what now?

525
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,920
I'll talk to her.

526
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,240
Don't look for her.

527
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,680
She's upset right now.

528
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,000
<i>I called to say that</i>

529
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,840
if she calls to criticize you,

530
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,440
then…

531
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,840
I'll just say I like you.

532
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
I want to be with you.

533
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,040
I'll be good to you. I'll put her at ease.

534
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,360
Qi Xiao,

535
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,400
don't tell her that for the time being.

536
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,640
She's angry right now.

537
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,000
She won't listen.

538
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,920
<i>She'll think you're still young
and starting a business,</i>

539
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
so she won't take you seriously.

540
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
- Later--
- Does she not take me seriously?

541
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,320
Or do you not take me seriously?

542
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
Is it her or you
who doesn't believe in me?

543
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,960
Qi Xiao, what's wrong?

544
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,840
It's nothing.

545
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,000
<i>I want to tell you this.</i>

546
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,200
<i>I've submitted my competition entry.</i>

547
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,440
I want to see what I'm truly capable of,

548
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,760
even if I get eliminated.

549
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,800
What's gotten into him?

550
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,600
WHAT'S WRONG?

551
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,080
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Ruoxin.</i>

552
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,880
<i>I was passing by your house.</i>

553
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,600
<i>There's some progress
regarding Qi Xiao's competition.</i>

554
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,680
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>

555
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,520
<i>Do you want to come downstairs?</i>

556
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,920
<i>Or should I come upstairs?</i>

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,280
You don't have to come up.

558
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
I'll come down.

559
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,000
Yutao.

560
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,720
Let's have some tea while we talk.

561
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,360
No, I have some work left to do.

562
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,280
What is it?

563
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,520
It's not much.

564
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
It's the competition you told me about.

565
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,840
It's hosted by my friend.

566
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,200
They happen to be free tonight
and want to have dinner with you.

567
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,000
So I came to ask you if you're free.

568
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,560
I'm not free today.

569
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,040
Let's not arrange this first.

570
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,000
What's wrong?

571
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,200
You're not free today?

572
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
When will you have time then?

573
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,000
Don't worry about setting things up.

574
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,560
I've arranged everything.

575
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,240
You're quite fast.

576
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,800
Listen, it's best to make contact

577
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,040
sooner rather than later.

578
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,160
From what I know,

579
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,320
the organizers have already received
hundreds of submissions.

580
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,720
What are you waiting for?

581
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,920
I thought about it.

582
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,640
Qi Xiao has a lot of self-respect.

583
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,920
He might not be able to accept

584
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,800
using back channels and connections.

585
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,040
Really?

586
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,480
You're kidding.

587
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
Dating a kid must be so tiring.

588
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
He's not capable of much,

589
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,120
but insists on having a noble heart.

590
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,520
Pulling strings and using back channels.

591
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,680
Is it that easy to do?

592
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,280
Does he think
it just takes a humble request?

593
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
It depends on who's willing to help him!

594
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,480
Other people nurture children.

595
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,120
You're nurturing your boyfriend.

596
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
I feel tired on your behalf.

597
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,880
Everyone has something
they won't compromise on.

598
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,760
I quite admire this about him.

599
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,320
All right, as long as you enjoy it.

600
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,640
I'll hold off on the dinner.

601
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,520
The results will be out in two weeks.

602
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
You can give me a call anytime
if there's anything.

603
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,320
Thank you.

604
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
Yutao, I want to ask you something.

605
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Go ahead.

606
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
Did you tell my mom

607
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,880
about me and Qi Xiao?

608
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,840
Yes.

609
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,760
I brought her some souvenirs

610
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,960
and we chatted a bit.

611
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,120
You're so thoughtful.

612
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,240
"For you, a thousand times over."

613
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,360
Remember the book?

614
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,360
You gave it to me in college.

615
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,960
Yes.

616
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,280
Before you went abroad,

617
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,160
I gave you <i>The Kite Runner</i>.

618
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
Since you have a good memory,

619
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,160
you should remember I hate owing favors

620
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,720
and I don't like others
interfering in my business,

621
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,760
even if it's out of concern.

622
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,200
You really are Iron Woman.

623
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,960
You're an impregnable fortress.

624
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm impressed.

625
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm really curious how the kid

626
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,280
burrowed his way into your heart.

627
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,680
I suppose it's fate.

628
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,640
Okay.

629
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,800
I hope you have a chance
to see it to the end.

630
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Call me anytime.

631
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,240
Bye.

632
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,240
Bye.

633
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,320
Why are you here?

634
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,360
Why did Gu Yutao come to see you?

635
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,760
It's nothing.

636
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,280
He was just passing by
and spoke to me about something.

637
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
What's wrong?

638
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
What's wrong, kid?

639
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
Are you jealous?

640
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm not a kid.

641
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm your boyfriend.

642
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,360
Give the 200,000 yuan back to Ruoxin.

643
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,480
- Why?
- Just do as I say.

644
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll take care of the funding.

645
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,520
What do you have in mind?

646
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,040
I have a friend from college

647
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,600
who works at an investment firm.

648
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,000
I can ask him.

649
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,360
Qi Xiao,

650
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,080
the 200,000 yuan

651
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,000
was spent on rent, renovations,

652
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,800
and miscellaneous expenses.

653
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,200
There's only about 80,000 yuan left.

654
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,000
I know.

655
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,360
I know you want
to prove yourself to Ruoxin.

656
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,920
But she did it for our own good.

657
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,120
We can pay her back

658
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
when we accomplish something
in the future.

659
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,840
Isn't that great?

660
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,360
If you win the competition--

661
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,000
What if she also arranged for me
to win an award?

662
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,960
Do you mean…

663
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,040
Would you be able to accept that?

664
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,440
If I accept it,

665
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,080
how am I any different
from those freeloading pretty boys?

666
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
Is this why I'm with her?

667
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,000
Am I that kind of person?

668
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,360
Of course not.

669
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,720
If you were like that,
you could just find a rich woman.

670
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,960
Stop it.

671
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,639
Hey!

672
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Xiaozhang.

673
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,880
Last night, Lisa asked three questions
about the weekly report via WeChat.

674
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,679
Reply as soon as you see it.

675
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,440
<i>Are you up?</i>

676
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,880
<i>Do you want a ride to the studio later?</i>

677
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,880
<i>No, thank you.</i>

678
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,880
<i>I'm already at the studio.</i>

679
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,880
He has been acting weird lately.

680
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,960
Is the competition too stressful?

681
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,760
Hello?

682
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,720
<i>Ms. Shen,
we added one more to the interviews</i>

683
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
<i>for the position
of your assistant this afternoon.</i>

684
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
<i>The resume is in the system now.</i>

685
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,200
<i>- Please take a look.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

686
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,800
RESUME

687
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,360
HOW ABOUT DINNER TOGETHER TONIGHT?

688
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,560
SEND

689
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,840
I'M BUSY
WITH THE STUDIO OPENING TONIGHT.

690
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
Hey, Sijia.

691
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,440
<i>Ruoxin, are you free for lunch?</i>

692
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,160
<i>I need your advice on something.</i>

693
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,600
Sure, no problem.

694
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,160
Are you having lunch with me
because you heard the news?

695
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,560
What kind of news?

696
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,840
Headquarters will be carrying out

697
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,400
an organizational restructuring.

698
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,960
It'll affect every region in the country,

699
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
but the East China region
will bear the brunt.

700
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,440
Really?

701
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,600
No wonder.

702
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
Ruan Ye has been frowning
for the past few days.

703
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,880
I guess you really didn't know.

704
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,720
Our New Energy Department
will be expanding.

705
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,600
We'll have our own auxiliary departments.

706
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,840
Then that means
Mr. Liu will lose his power.

707
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,960
Do you have anything to tell me?

708
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,520
What should I be saying?

709
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,400
I repeat.

710
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
The New Energy Department
will be expanding.

711
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,760
We'll have our own HR Department,
Administration Department,

712
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,240
and Legal Department.

713
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,160
I…

714
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,000
Speak properly.

715
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,400
Ruoxin, do I have a chance?

716
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,520
Can I still work with you?

717
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,400
If you want to,
I'll do my best to help you.

718
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,480
Ruoxin, you're so nice.

719
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll buy you milk tea later.

720
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,480
Forget it.

721
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,960
You didn't ask me out for this.

722
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
So what is it about?

723
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,600
The thing is,

724
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,000
Su Yang created a public account.

725
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
It's getting good responses.

726
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,720
He has a webtoon about a cat.

727
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,200
We made emojis with the cat webtoon.

728
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,080
It turned out surprisingly popular.

729
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,560
A company called Su Yang today,

730
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,440
saying they want to buy the rights

731
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,680
and they'll manage it.

732
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,440
- Guess how much they offered.
- How much?

733
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,120
It's 200,000 yuan.

734
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,320
That's great!

735
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,040
It's a recognition of Su Yang's work.

736
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,600
Su Yang is very happy.

737
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
But we're quite conflicted.

738
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,160
Although 200,000 yuan is a lot of money,

739
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,040
this cat webtoon is

740
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,800
the result of Su Yang's hard work.

741
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
Selling the copyright

742
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,760
is a difficult decision for us.

743
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,720
Ruoxin, what do you think?

744
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,840
Show me Su Yang's public account

745
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,880
- and the emoji pack.
- Okay.

746
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,360
I sent it to you.

747
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,040
I got it.

748
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,400
It's nice.

749
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,240
Su Yang's public account

750
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,440
is managed quite well.

751
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,120
You can give him this advice.

752
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,600
The price doesn't have to be set high,

753
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
but keep a portion of the rights.

754
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,520
I see.

755
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Ruoxin, you're so smart.

756
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,480
Look.

757
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,040
Even webtoon management companies
are doing so well now.

758
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,240
You can use this opportunity
to test the waters.

759
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,040
Work in-depth with an established company

760
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,560
and learn how they operate.

761
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,440
Get some experience.

762
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,800
Ruoxin, you're really amazing.

763
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,360
Your advice really hits the spot.

764
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,800
I've had a revelation. It's true.

765
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,640
Strategic thinking is very important.

766
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,680
If I were Qi Xiao, I wouldn't mind
if you were secretly helping me.

767
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,360
The more you help, the better.

768
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,600
What? What's this about Qi Xiao?

769
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,400
Qi Xiao told Su Yang.

770
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,800
Their studio doesn't have any investors.

771
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,280
You gave the money.

772
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,200
He also said

773
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,120
that you asked Gu Yutao

774
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,240
to pull strings for him
in the design competition.

775
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,320
Where did he hear that?

776
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,280
In any case, Su Yang said

777
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,880
Qi Xiao has been in a bad mood lately

778
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,080
and says you don't trust him enough.

779
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,360
Ruoxin.

780
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,000
Did you two have a fight?

781
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,320
So that's why.

782
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,160
Why didn't he

783
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
tell me himself then?

784
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,440
Qi Xiao actually cares a lot

785
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,960
that you approve of him.

786
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,560
Good afternoon, everyone.

787
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,600
I'm Liu Yiyi,

788
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,960
an East China University
of Science and Technology graduate.

789
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,280
I worked part-time throughout college.

790
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,880
Regarding energy conservation…

791
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,760
I want an interview.

792
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,200
I was very interested to know that
Zenpro's New Energy Department is hiring.

793
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,840
I hope you will give me this chance.

794
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,560
I look forward to working with you.

795
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,320
Tell us what you can bring to our team.

796
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,880
Although I'm a newbie
and don't have much work experience,

797
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,080
I believe that as long as I work hard,
I won't let you down.

798
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,080
<i>Ms. Shen.</i>

799
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,600
<i>You started out as a newbie, right?</i>

800
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,320
Before you had your first job,

801
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,640
you had no work experience.

802
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,560
Please give me a chance.

803
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,240
I promise I'll do a good job.

804
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,960
Ms. Shen?

805
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
Ms. Shen?

806
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,000
Do you have any other questions?

807
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,280
Everyone has to start somewhere

808
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,280
and build up experience from nothing.

809
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,720
But this position

810
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,120
requires a lot of hard work.

811
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,080
<i>It requires plenty of resilience.</i>

812
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,880
<i>It also requires creativity.</i>

813
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,200
It's not easy being my assistant.

814
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
Can you prove to me

815
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,200
that you're more than capable?

816
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,440
Okay, thank you.

817
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,400
I told them.

818
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,320
I'm different from them.

819
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,080
I think it's not a big deal
for the man to be younger.

820
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
The young boys these days are quite fine.

821
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,640
It's still a huge age difference.

822
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,400
What year is this?

823
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,000
We're in the 21st century.

824
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,960
Think outside the box.

825
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,120
Hello.

826
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
- Ms. Zhou.
- Ms. Zhou! Have a seat.

827
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,560
It sounds lively here.

828
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,080
I want to join in.

829
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
You be the judge. Tell me if I'm right.

830
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,440
What is it?

831
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,120
She's talking about her niece.

832
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,320
Go on.

833
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,560
What about your niece?

834
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,600
My brother's daughter
got divorced two years ago.

835
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,920
She finally got herself a new boyfriend.

836
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,960
Isn't that nice?

837
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,480
My brother
and especially my sister-in-law…

838
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,440
My goodness!

839
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,200
They're determined to break them up.

840
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,120
What are they doing?

841
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,720
His daughter isn't a kid anymore.

842
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,760
She has a younger boyfriend.

843
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,040
They're happy together.

844
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,480
Isn't that great?

845
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,320
Why are they worrying so much?

846
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,800
My goodness.

847
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,400
We're parents.

848
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,760
One word. Scared.

849
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,520
An older woman with a younger man?

850
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,040
Sometimes, it's a matter
of traditional views.

851
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,440
We can't convince ourselves to accept it.

852
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,360
I'm different from you.

853
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,920
I think an older woman with a younger man

854
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,480
is the best match.

855
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,920
Tell me why.

856
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,080
