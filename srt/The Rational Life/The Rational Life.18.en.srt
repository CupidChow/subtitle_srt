00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

5
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,240
- Did you check the cars?
- Yes, I did.

6
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,760
- All good?
- Don't worry.

7
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,680
Okay.

8
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,040
Did you double-check everything?

9
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,240
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

10
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,600
Ruoxin is very thorough.

11
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,760
She pays attention to every single detail.

12
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,720
There's nothing she can't handle.

13
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,320
Qi Xiao, the showcase is about to start.

14
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,680
- Copy. I'll confirm with them now.
- Okay.

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
thank you so much for coming.

22
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,520
Welcome to the test-drive event
for Zenpro's new energy car.

23
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,760
So first things first.

24
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,480
Let's give it up

25
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,680
for our manager, Mr. Xu.

26
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,240
He would like to give a speech.

27
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Please, come on stage.

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,400
Thank you.

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you for coming.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
And thank you for trusting Zenpro.

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,240
As you can see,

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,600
the theme of the test-drive event

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,000
is "Dating The Stars" in the city.

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,640
Our slogan clearly shows

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,920
that Zenpro Automotive

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,480
is making our new energy car

39
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
more environmentally friendly.

40
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,320
Check with Sijia later.

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,720
See if everything is ready.

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
We'll begin after the speech.

43
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,920
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,840
It's about family values.

45
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,320
Yes, for this model,

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,720
besides our core technology,

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,640
blade batteries, and E-platform,

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,320
our modular components

49
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,320
also include an intelligence system,

50
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,960
driver assistance,
and intelligent assistance.

51
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,560
With these amazing technologies…

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes,

53
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,680
we want you

54
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
to have more than just

55
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
a cold industrial machine.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,160
Instead,

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
we hope they'll be a good partner
in your family.

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
Give the cars warmth.

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
Give the service warmth.

60
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
We're committed

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,960
to creating a car brand with warmth.

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,920
Thank you.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,280
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,480
Here, take your gift.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,160
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,080
Next.

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,320
Okay.

68
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
Where's the baby car seat in this car?

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
Right.

70
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,440
Children are naughty.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,760
It's not safe without a baby seat.

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,440
Don't you have common sense?

73
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,360
Are there no baby seats in all the cars?

74
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,280
No.

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
Where are the baby seats?

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
I'll go and check.

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Calm down, everyone.

78
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
We have prepared the seats
for your children.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
They got held up.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,440
They'll be here soon.

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,280
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
Where are the baby car seats?

83
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
What baby car seats?

84
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,200
The biggest box.

85
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
It's in the cargo. Think harder.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,200
The bus driver was in a hurry.

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,280
When he was unloading,

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
I was busy counting.

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,040
I didn't check the cargo space

90
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,080
and he just left.

91
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,400
But I didn't see a big box.

92
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
It's over.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,280
Without the baby car seat, it's over.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,720
If there's no baby car seat, they can just

95
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,960
carry the baby and sit in the back seat.

96
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,120
Of course not. It's against traffic rules.

97
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,720
I messed up big time. What should I do?

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,280
Qi Xiao, help me! Qi Xiao!

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,280
Sijia.

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,640
Have you found them yet?

101
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Ruoxin.

102
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,760
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

103
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Why? Where are the seats?

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
When we were unloading,
we forgot about them.

105
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,520
The driver went back to Shanghai.

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
He won't make it back in time.

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
Ruoxin, sorry. It's all my fault.

108
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,440
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,880
Now is not the time.

110
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,120
Bring out the toys
that we've prepared now.

111
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,400
- Go!
- Okay, I'll go.

112
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
- Qi Xiao.
- Yes?

113
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,960
Make some calls and find
a store nearby that sells them now.

114
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,640
- Go.
- Okay.

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
"DATING THE STARS" FAMILY EVENT

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,080
We brought our family here
and there is no test-drive?

117
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,600
What's wrong with your company?

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,560
Don't worry.

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
How about this?

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,160
We'll take care of your children.

121
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
- You can proceed with test-driving.
- No.

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
We're here as a family for the test-drive.

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,440
Without our children,

124
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,840
- how can we be sure?
- Yes!

125
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
- Please calm down.
- Please calm down.

126
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,160
- I'm sorry.
- We have to be careful

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360
about children's safety

128
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
and your experience.

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,760
You're not a parent, are you?

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
Our children are too young.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,040
- If anything goes wrong, what will you do?
- Yes.

132
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,000
- Do you understand?
- That's right.

133
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,720
- So now what?
- Please be patient, everyone.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,560
Our staff is already on it.

135
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,040
There will be baby car seats soon.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm so sorry about this.

137
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
- I want to get in the car!
- I want to get in the car!

138
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,120
Children, look. What are these?

139
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
- Toys!
- Toys!

140
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,320
That's right.

141
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Do you want to hear a story?

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,640
- Yes!
- We have a lot of fun games too.

143
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,000
Come with me. Here!

144
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
Slowly.

145
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,480
Slowly.

146
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Be careful.

147
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Please be patient, everyone.
It'll be here soon.

148
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,120
- Shall we take a break here?
- We have enough for everyone

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,640
- We're sorry.
- We're really sorry.

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,840
- Yes.
- How long do we have to wait?

151
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
How is it?

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
- Did you find any?
- Yes.

153
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,520
But the nearest store
is several kilometers away.

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,800
That's too far for us.

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,360
But I found a warehouse.

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
Maybe it's close by.

157
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,000
Can you reach the owner?

158
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
I can't.

159
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
I'm going to look for him.

160
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
Where?

161
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
Don't worry.

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll solve this problem.

163
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,520
Qi Xiao!

164
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,040
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

165
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,440
I won't let it ruin the test-drive event.

166
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,960
Hurry up.

167
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
We don't have time.

168
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,280
"DATING THE STARS" THEMED
PROMOTIONAL EVENT

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
- Try our snacks.
- Thank you.

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
Do you like it?

171
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Mr. Xu, this mistake

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
caused quite a scene.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
I admit it.

174
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,600
There has been a small accident.

175
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
Before the event,

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,840
we have all the seats prepared.

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
However,

178
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,480
there has been a mistake.

179
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,600
That's why there has been a delay.

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,800
I know everyone here is busy.

181
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
Your time is very valuable.

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,440
Therefore,

183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm sorry for wasting your precious time.

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
My deepest apologies.

185
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,040
Right now,

186
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,240
my staff is trying to solve the problem.

187
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,040
Half an hour.

188
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
Give us half an hour.

189
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,200
Then everything will go as planned.

190
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,800
I hope everyone

191
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,200
can go easy on us.

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,520
Please do it for me.

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,320
If that's what you say,

194
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
then, of course, we have to oblige.

195
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
It was just a mistake.

196
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
It's inevitable for a big event.

197
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.

198
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,880
- Thank you.
- Mr. Xu.

199
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

200
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,000
Please continue.

201
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,400
Okay.

202
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,640
Ruoxin.

203
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
Why isn't Qi Xiao back yet?

204
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
I can't reach him.

205
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,520
What should we do?

206
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,280
Get back to work.

207
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
Okay.

208
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,320
Mr. Xu.

209
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,120
"DATING THE STARS" FAMILY EVENT

210
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,920
ZENPRO NEW ENERGY CAR,
ZENPRO, MOVING TOWARDS THE NEW

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm very sorry about what happened today.

212
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,960
If I may give a suggestion,

213
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,720
can we ask the company

214
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,680
to give them

215
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
a one-time discount?

216
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Maybe

217
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,840
we can give them the discount

218
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,840
that is exclusive to members,

219
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,280
which is a 0.5% discount,

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,720
and return it in cash.

221
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,080
As compensation for this incident.

222
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,440
This will calm down the customers.

223
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
And we can prevent

224
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
any PR crisis at the same time.

225
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Of course.

226
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll pay for our loss

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
with my own bonus.

228
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

229
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
The seats are ready.

230
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,560
While the weather is perfect,

231
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,880
let's get ready to go.

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,920
Thank you for your patience.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,960
Hold on.

234
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
Thank you for waiting.

235
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,240
To apologize

236
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,480
for wasting your precious time,

237
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,200
on behalf of Zenpro Automotive,

238
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,520
I promise

239
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,240
all the families that came
to the test-drive event today

240
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
will receive a special 1% discount

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,800
in addition to the benefits

242
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,680
that you were promised earlier today.

243
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
That 1% will be returned to you

244
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,480
in cash.

245
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
In other words,

246
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,200
when you're buying the car,

247
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,160
the reward will be redeemed.

248
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,600
Also,

249
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,640
we'll give you

250
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,760
three years of basic maintenance.

251
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Not bad. It's a good deal.

252
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Now.

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,280
Please enjoy yourselves

254
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,320
and go on the test-drive.

255
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,560
Thank you.

256
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,040
- Come on.
- Let's go.

257
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,160
Ruoxin.

258
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,920
Mr. Xu's giving out so much
for compensation.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Won't the loss be too big?

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
I had no idea

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,080
that he would give such a huge discount.

262
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
But I believe

263
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,680
he'll never do unprofitable business.

264
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,200
That was a smart move. Well done.

265
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
It was the power of the people.

266
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,440
These folks led me

267
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
through the fields.

268
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,480
We took a shortcut.

269
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,960
Although my ride was damaged,

270
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,840
it's worth it.

271
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,200
You know,

272
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,200
I was about to have a heart attack.

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,760
If you didn't come back,

274
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,480
by tomorrow,
you and I will kiss our jobs goodbye.

275
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I will never make you look bad.

276
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,080
Slow down.

277
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,040
Let's look at the stars, okay?

278
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,440
Look at that.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
- Look over there.
- Look at the stars.

280
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,640
Don't those stars

281
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,760
look like bears?

282
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,280
It's lying on its stomach.

283
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,680
Yes, this is the big bear.

284
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,200
That's the small bear.

285
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,640
- Where are they? The bears?
- Where?

286
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
That one is climbing a tree.

287
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,600
Climbing a tree?

288
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
The koala is climbing a tree.

289
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,240
It's a bear with no tail.

290
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,880
The koala is this short.

291
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,120
A koala has a very short tail.

292
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
No tail because it's too tiny.

293
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,360
They'll be done soon.

294
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
Don't worry.

295
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
Here you go, girls.

296
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,400
This is for you.

297
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,080
From that line to that line.

298
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,120
Do you see two children?

299
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,240
Like us.

300
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,960
Like us. Like you. Right?

301
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,680
- Like us.
- That's the Gemini.

302
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm leaving.

303
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
Bye.

304
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
Mr. Xu.

305
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,000
I will email you the report tomorrow.

306
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
"Dating The Stars."

307
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,520
When the incident happened,

308
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,120
what was your first thought?

309
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,320
I wasn't myself.

310
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,840
I can only think of one thing.

311
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,920
No matter what,

312
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,840
we have to solve the problem.

313
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,640
Were you afraid of losing this job?

314
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
I was terrified.

315
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,600
The order we received today

316
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,760
increased by 60%.

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,560
The results are all that matters.

318
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
Don't you agree?

319
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,320
But today, it was because of

320
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
your presence

321
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,840
and your very decisive decisions.

322
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
When the problem occurred,

323
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,320
you were very level-headed.

324
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,760
Methodical.

325
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,920
It's good.

326
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,960
You have potential.

327
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,000
It wasn't me.

328
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,480
We should thank Qi Xiao for today.

329
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,320
You scared me.

330
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Ruoxin, I saved the event today.

331
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,240
How would you reward me?

332
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
What reward do you want?

333
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,080
I like the stars too.

334
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,200
But I'm very confused
about constellations.

335
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,880
I want you to tell me about them.

336
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,800
Are you a child?

337
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,120
Yes.

338
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
Come on.

339
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,720
Which one do you like?

340
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Well…

341
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,320
The one with the horse legs.

342
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,240
What's that?

343
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
Where? Which one?

344
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,320
- That one.
- That?

345
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
You said you were nervous.

346
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,040
Are you relieved now?

347
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,960
It's all thanks to you.

348
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,240
How were you so sure

349
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,920
that I'll make it in time?

350
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,880
Because I know

351
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
you won't disappoint me.

Here, Mr. Zhang. This way.

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,640
Okay, I'll see you out.

Ruoxin.

361
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,840
I'm putting them in the storage.

362
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Okay.

363
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,960
Ruoxin, the sales report.

364
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,920
Okay.

365
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,080
There's more?

366
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,520
Okay, let me see.

367
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,320
I have good news for all of you.

368
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,400
The test-drive event for our new car

369
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,840
was a great success.

370
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,720
The media and our clients have both

371
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,040
given us great reviews.

372
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,640
And the reviews online are all positive.

373
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
There are barely any negative ones.

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,560
That's not all.

375
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,280
We also set a record
of the highest purchase rate

376
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,600
in the history of our company.

377
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,760
Especially our main focus,

378
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,600
the energy car for families,

379
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,680
has become a best seller
at the top of the list.

380
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,160
For the first time,
I get to enjoy a sense of accomplishment.

381
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,240
Thank goodness

382
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,000
we didn't get scolded.

383
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
That's great.

384
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,240
There's a bigger surprise.

385
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,800
Mr. Xu wants to give everyone
who handled the test-drive event

386
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
a raise.

387
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,880
And the company approved it.

388
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,080
Mr. Xu, the company approved it.

389
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
What about you, personally?

390
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,080
- That's right.
- That's right.

391
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,360
This weekend,

392
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,600
I'll treat you to a meal.

393
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,960
You guys pick a place.

394
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,320
Be my guest.

395
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,240
And as usual,

396
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,560
it'll be on me.

397
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,680
Ruoxin.

398
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Qi Xiao.

399
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
I'll get going then.

400
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,080
Where are you going?

401
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I have something important.

402
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,240
Bye.

403
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
Ruoxin.

404
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,000
Sijia, you left in such a hurry.
I didn't get to tell you.

405
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
I want to buy you dinner after work.

406
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,680
<i>You helped me out. I have to reward you.</i>

407
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,040
I have a date today, Ruoxin.

408
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,840
So I won't be able to make it.

409
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,520
Little girl, who's your date?

410
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
Is it Su Yang again?

411
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,520
Yes.

412
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
<i>You've been making moves.</i>

413
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,720
<i>But he didn't say anything.</i>

414
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,680
<i>Aren't you tired?</i>

415
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,120
Ruoxin.

416
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,320
He asked me out this time.

417
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,280
This afternoon,

418
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
he asked if I wanted to go out
for a movie.

419
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,040
He even said

420
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,040
that he had a gift for me.

421
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,960
I think he…

422
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,480
He's really cute.

423
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,680
Really?

424
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,120
That's great.

425
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,240
Isn't this your first date?

426
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,440
We went out before.

427
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,120
But this is the first time
he has made a move.

428
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,160
If he confesses his love today,

429
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,320
then it will be our first official date.

430
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,480
Okay, I wish you success.

431
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,280
I'll give you some privacy.

432
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,400
I'll treat both of you another day, okay?

433
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,040
Thank you, Ruoxin.

434
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,560
Let's go.

435
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,680
You Sijia.

436
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
It has been edited so many times.

437
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,640
You still can't satisfy Mr. Zhang.

438
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,600
How many times have I told you?

439
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,640
The clients' needs are like God's decrees!

440
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,800
Why are you still here?

441
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,280
Do it now!

442
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,240
Yes.

443
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,560
Mr. Liu.

444
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,720
I told him everything many times.

445
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,160
Why can't he do it?

446
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,200
Why?

447
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,000
Mr. Zhang, please calm down.
Listen to me. He's still young.

448
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,960
Listen to me.

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Su Yang.

450
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,680
Is that your client, Mr. Zhang?

451
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,400
I know, right?

452
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,600
He's so demanding.

453
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,000
Did he tell you

454
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,240
about his crazy ideas
right from the start?

455
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,360
Then he wants you to make them happen.

456
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,520
Actually, his ideas were too unrealistic.

457
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,480
That's right.

458
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,800
But I can't be honest.

459
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
He doesn't like it

460
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,080
no matter how hard I try.

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,440
He said I had let him down.

462
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,080
Did he make one demand today

463
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,560
then change it the next day?

464
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,600
He kept changing ideas.

465
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,280
And he never thought
that it was his own problem?

466
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,800
He'll blame you for not persisting, right?

467
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,360
How do you know everything?

468
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
Were you Mr. Zhang's designer before?

469
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,200
Not really.

470
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,160
I'll show you.

471
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,680
"First draft."

472
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
FINAL TWO, FINAL THREE

473
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,720
FINAL FOUR, ULTIMATE FINAL

474
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,000
FINAL FINAL, LAST FINAL

475
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,360
FINAL FINAL, LAST FINAL

476
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
DO AS THE CLIENT SAID, FINALIZED FINAL

477
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,560
That's just one example.

478
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,440
Remember.

479
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
All our clients are the same.

480
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
Just hang in there.

481
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,920
Here.

482
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,320
Su Yang.

483
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,240
Do it well this time.

484
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,600
Don't let Mr. Zhang down.

485
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,520
Do you understand?

486
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,080
Yes, I'll change it.

487
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
This is interesting.

488
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,880
Su Yang, did you do this?

489
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,280
Yes, I did.

490
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,800
This can be the image of our company.

491
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,680
Mr. Zhang, if you like it,

492
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,320
it'll be the image for your company.

493
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
Right, Su Yang?

494
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,160
I disagree.

495
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,520
You disagree?

496
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,360
This is easy for you.

497
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,080
What? Do you think I won't pay?

498
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,120
Are you out of your mind?

499
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,000
Mr. Zhang is saving you the trouble.

500
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,120
Do you understand?

501
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,840
I would rather work three days straight.

502
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,720
I would rather have
Mr. Zhang disapprove of me.

503
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,720
But if you ask for this cat image,

504
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,920
I will never agree.

505
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,840
What kind of attitude is this?

506
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
What's with that attitude?

507
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,000
Mr. Zhang.

508
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,280
Don't be angry.

509
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
Su Yang is new here.

510
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,080
I'll talk to him.

511
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,200
No. Don't bother.

512
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,080
Don't bother with the design.

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,440
I'll find someone else!

514
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,640
Mr. Zhang!

515
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,320
- Mr. Zhang.
- I'm leaving.

516
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,240
What are you looking at?

517
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,200
Call the HR Department.

518
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,840
Give him a punishment notice.

519
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,760
You're not getting paid this month!

520
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,480
<i>Su Yang, I just got off work.</i>

521
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,760
<i>See you at the cinema.</i>

522
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,040
PUNISHMENT NOTICE

523
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
EMPLOYEE: SU YANG

524
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,480
SIJIA

525
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,920
Su Yang!

526
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,280
Su Yang!

527
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,240
Su Yang, are you there?

528
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,840
Su Yang, open the door.

529
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,960
Su Yang!

530
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,240
Su Yang, you…

531
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,960
Are you okay, Su Yang?

532
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,880
You scared me.

533
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,520
I was worried about you.

534
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,360
Why didn't you answer my calls?

535
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,360
Sijia.

536
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,680
Something suddenly came up.

537
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,440
I got tired.

538
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,480
I don't want to go.

539
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,400
What's going on?

540
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,720
Are you sick?

541
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
Are you not going to explain?

542
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,360
Explain why I had to wait for an hour?

543
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,520
I'm sorry.

544
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,560
It's okay.

545
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,480
You're tired.

546
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,400
Let's watch a movie next time.

547
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,840
You said you had a surprise for me.

548
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
I have a gift for you too.

549
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
I'll get it.

550
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,920
After that, I'll leave.

551
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,640
Open it and see if you like it.

552
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Sijia.

553
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
I'm a useless person.

554
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,880
I don't deserve this.

555
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,680
Open it first, okay?

556
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,160
I found this a long time ago.

557
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,680
I figured you would need it
when you're drawing.

558
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Open it, okay?

559
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,680
Take it back.

560
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,800
This is too much.

561
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
I can't take this.

562
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
No, it's not.

563
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
Compared to your webtoon,

564
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,480
it's not expensive.

565
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,600
You said

566
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,360
that I'm like a kitty.

567
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,360
And you're going to make me

568
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,320
into a new character in your series?

569
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
With this,

570
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
you can do it faster.

571
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Please accept it.

572
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,560
Just accept it.

573
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,960
Fine. If you won't accept my gift,

574
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,600
then give me the gift you prepared.

575
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,720
Then I'll leave.

576
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,240
I'll let you rest.

577
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,160
You said

578
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,720
you had a surprise for me, right?

579
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,200
Sijia.

580
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,680
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

581
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,760
I'm a useless person.

582
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,120
Don't be nice to me.

583
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,600
You'll regret it.

584
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,000
Why?

585
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,760
Why do you always…

586
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,560
How dare you?

587
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,880
Why are you so nice to me,

588
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,160
yet you still push me away?

589
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,240
Why do you keep giving me hope,

590
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
just to let me down again?

591
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,120
You always have excuses.

592
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,760
I always tell myself,

593
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,000
"You Sijia.

594
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
Try harder.

595
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,840
Try a little harder.

596
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,840
You will be able to move him."

597
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,680
But I know now.

598
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,600
I can't get through to you.

599
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
It's because you don't like me that much!

600
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
Am I right?

601
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Right?

602
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Su Yang, am I right?

603
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,600
When you're relaxed and happy,

604
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,400
you want someone with you.

605
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,600
But when you have to take responsibility,

606
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,520
you just run away.

607
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,200
Am I right?

608
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,679
Sijia.

609
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,560
Don't come to see me again.

610
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,199
You should have told me that sooner.

611
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,000
Sijia.

612
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
What's wrong?

613
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,520
Sijia!

614
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,800
What's wrong?

615
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
What happened to Sijia?

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's nothing.

617
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,800
It's just that,

618
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't think she'll ever see me again.

619
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,240
Did you two break up?

620
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Why?

621
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,320
It didn't even start.

622
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,200
How can it end?

623
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,240
If we weren't together,

624
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,080
how could we break up?

625
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,800
Stop with the poem.

626
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,840
Tell me what happened.

627
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,240
Answer me!

628
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,600
If you keep this up,

629
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,800
I'll storm off like she did!

630
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,480
I'm asking you a question. Answer me!

631
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
I might have to leave Shanghai.

632
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,520
What's wrong?

633
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,600
Didn't you just get a job?

634
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,960
PUNISHMENT NOTICE

635
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,960
How?

636
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,920
How did you get fined? You just started.

637
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,400
You don't even get a month's pay.

638
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
According to company policy,

639
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,440
getting three notices like this

640
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
means you're fired.

641
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,600
It's my first month
and I already got a strike.

642
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,360
Even before I get paid.

643
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
I've even offended a client.

644
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,720
Now my boss is upset.

645
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,840
He's really angry at me.

646
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,560
Qi Xiao.

647
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,800
After graduating,

648
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,920
I've been looking for a job for a year.

649
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,480
Now, I've finally found one.

650
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,440
I used to think

651
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,640
that after I found a job,

652
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,000
everything would be okay!

653
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,680
But now,

654
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm not afraid to tell you

655
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,800
that every day at work
felt like torture to me.

656
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,040
Every time I revise a script,

657
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,320
I feel like
I've lost a little passion for drawing!

658
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,120
I really don't know
what I am insisting on!

659
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
My mom was right.

660
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,440
Why do I have to stay in Shanghai?

661
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,880
Come on, don't be like this.

662
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,040
We have our dreams.

663
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,800
I can't even think about my dream now.

664
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,200
It didn't make my life any better.

665
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,880
It makes me stuck in the mud.

666
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,880
Deeper and deeper.

667
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,600
Qi Xiao.

668
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,000
What's your dream?

669
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
Running errands in a big company?

670
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,240
No.

671
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,880
I will never give up on my dream.

672
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
Whatever I said before,

673
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,520
I'll make it happen.

674
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,880
The same goes for you.

675
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
Promise me.

676
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,960
Don't give up now.

677
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,360
Okay?

678
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,160
I didn't give up on my dream.

679
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,400
My dream abandoned me.

680
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,560
I was never in charge.

681
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,040
Don't worry.

682
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,400
I'll go as soon as I arrive.

683
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,840
I'll convince them.

684
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,120
If things go well,
I'll be back in two days.

685
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,040
If you're bored,

686
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,200
find your old friends
and hang out with them.

687
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,320
Or find Shen Ruoxin.

688
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,800
They are all busy.

689
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,960
I'm the only one free.

690
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,960
Honey.

691
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,040
Don't do this.

692
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
I know you're not happy

693
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,160
because I made you quit your job.

694
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,760
But we all have to move forward.

695
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,960
This isn't college where you have to work
to have experience.

696
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,600
That was all for fun.

697
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,080
You've come a long way

698
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,280
to just serving dishes in a bar.

699
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,800
So why bother?

700
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,600
Just like right now.
We're used to living here.

701
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,600
We can't live in a shabby house anymore.

702
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,880
Once you have a car,
you won't like taking the bus.

703
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,680
If you go on a trip,

704
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,120
you can't be a backpacker
like you did when you were 20.

705
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,600
Time goes by.

706
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,680
It won't come back.

707
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Why do you have

708
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,760
to do this to yourself?

709
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,240
I'm leaving.

710
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,600
Okay.

711
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,600
<i>Once you have a car,
you won't like taking the bus.</i>

712
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,600
<i>Time goes by.</i>

713
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,920
<i>It won't come back.</i>

714
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,600
<i>What does that mean?</i>

715
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,520
<i>I always hear my seniors say,</i>

716
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,520
"You should act your age."

717
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,560
I think it's more like,

718
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,480
"Be wise for your age."

719
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,960
<i>At our age, we should understand</i>

720
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,760
<i>that not everyone can see
the view at the top.</i>

721
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,400
<i>What if we're the ship that ran aground?</i>

722
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,200
Then we just rest
until the next wave comes.

723
