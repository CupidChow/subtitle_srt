1
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,520
Song Ziyan!

2
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
Wear your shoes, okay?

3
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,880
<i>Mr. Writer, your fan
is asking for updates.</i>

4
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,880
<i>Is the next chapter of the webtoons done?</i>

5
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,440
<i>I work overtime daily.
I don't have time to update it.</i>

6
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>I'm lacking inspiration lately.
My creativity is running dry.</i>

7
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,320
- Hello?
- Hello, Su Yang?

8
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,520
I can help you think of something.

9
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,200
<i>You can try to expand
the city's background</i>

10
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>to the city.</i>

11
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,920
During the day,
they hide their true nature.

12
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,920
At night,

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,400
the city will become the world of animals.

14
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
<i>In other words, you can expand</i>

15
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
<i>the story's background.</i>

16
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,480
Humans and animals are symbiotic.

17
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,320
You can't tell based on appearances.

18
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
But at night, think about it,

19
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,200
even animals face
harsh survival principles.

20
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,120
<i>Previously, didn't you write</i>

21
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,840
about how kind and protective
humans are towards animals?

22
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,399
I think you can try describing

23
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,440
how animals protect the city
in the future.

24
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,760
Am I

25
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,840
talking too much?

26
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,560
No.

27
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,280
I think you're quite imaginative.

28
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,240
Thank you.

29
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Su Yang.

30
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
You can do it.

31
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
I will…

32
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
I'll always support you.

33
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,320
All the best.

34
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
For this test-drive event,

35
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,400
the time is quite limited to prepare
for such an important task.

36
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Thank you, everyone.

37
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,400
Ms. Shen and I already went to see
the venue and route.

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,440
It's very, very well-planned.

39
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,920
But we haven't decided

40
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
how to implement

41
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,960
our theme yet.

42
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
Last week,

43
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
the family and environmentally friendly
theme that Ms. Shen suggested

44
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,480
was already approved.

45
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
I want to hear your conclusion

46
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,120
about how we're going
to implement the theme this week.

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,000
I need novel ideas,

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,280
not conventional ones.

49
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,360
This time,

50
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,520
can we hire a professional racer

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,360
to showcase the powerful
acceleration performance

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,800
and eliminate their misunderstanding
on acceleration

53
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,000
and other functions
of new energy vehicles?

54
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,960
For environmental protection,
I think we can show

55
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,560
how new energy vehicles contribute
to reducing city noise and pollution.

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,720
For example, during the driving process,
Zenpro Group's latest model

57
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,600
can almost reach
the NVH silence level of a library.

58
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
During the test-drive event,

59
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,160
why don't we just design a small segment

60
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
to collect noise?

61
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
Let's use a noise level meter

62
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,000
to show people the exact number.

63
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,920
Any newer ideas?

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
I've got an unconventional idea.

65
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,440
The theme of our test-drive event

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,400
is family and environmentally friendly.

67
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,040
After the test-drive event,

68
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,600
can we hold a stargazing event?

69
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
Be more specific.

70
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,480
We can find a spot
with a high visibility rate.

71
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,760
Let the parents bring their kids there

72
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,160
to experience the beautiful starry sky
that they don't see in the city.

73
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,480
I think this idea

74
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
really fits our theme.

75
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,400
And I'm sure the kids would love it.

76
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Any more novel ideas?

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,800
I think Ms. Shen's idea is quite good.

78
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,000
If the kids like it,
the parents will definitely like it.

79
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,240
So it would be easy to reach our goal.

80
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,240
But the problem is,

81
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,640
can we find
a stargazing place in the city?

82
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
I do have a place in mind.

83
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,040
Ms. Shen, come with me after work.

84
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
If it's suitable, add it to your proposal.

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,640
I think

86
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,560
it should be a good place.

87
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
Yes, Mr. Xu.

88
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,680
- Ruoxin.
- Qi Xiao.

89
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
You go first.

90
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,440
Can I…

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,520
You go first.

92
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,400
- Any plans for today?
- No. It's fine, I can go.

93
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,159
I haven't told you what it is yet.

94
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,840
As a competent assistant,
I must understand my boss.

95
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,039
You must have some work for me to do.

96
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,159
I can do it. No problem.

97
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
Can you come with me today
to the place Mr. Xu mentioned?

98
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,520
If there's anything we must document,
help me do it.

99
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,480
I'll get it done.

100
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,320
Okay.

101
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Mr. Xu.

102
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,280
I think our preparation time is too short.

103
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
Can I bring my assistant, Qi Xiao, today

104
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
for documentation purposes

105
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
to avoid any problems?

106
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,720
No problem.

107
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
Get in.

108
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,920
I made an exclusive VIP reservation.

109
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,440
This way, no one will disturb us.

110
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,480
It'll be easier for our inspection.

111
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,760
Mr. Xu.

112
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,200
Actually, there's no need

113
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
to have so many service crews.

114
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,840
This mall arranged this.

115
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,400
Perhaps they want to give us
the best impression

116
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
to secure future collaborations.

117
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Besides, in this society,

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,440
as long as you're willing to spend more,
you'll surely get better service.

119
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
That's a truth that will never change.

120
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
They all get paid for overtime.

121
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,960
So why won't they do it?

122
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,560
My goodness.

123
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,880
When I look through this telescope,
it's so beautiful.

124
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
Yes.

125
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,320
It's hard to see stars
in the city these days, right?

126
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,640
Yes.

127
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
We see less and less of them.

128
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
This isn't a place
open to ordinary customers.

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,080
They only cater to VIP customers.

130
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
Because that is an expensive telescope.

131
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,360
You can clearly see

132
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
the different colors on the planets

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
and even details on the moon
a dozen meters away.

134
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,760
You'll be able to see

135
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
lunar craters, impact craters,

136
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,960
rilles, and lunar maria.

137
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,080
So,

138
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,600
this is what VIP members like us

139
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
should enjoy when going on a date.

140
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,640
That's right.

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,080
The night sky
looks really splendid from here.

142
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,120
Mr. Xu.

143
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,320
I can understand you.

144
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
This is

145
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
your pursuit of quality.

146
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,520
However,

147
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,720
for our stargazing event this time,

148
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,400
I hope that our clients

149
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,080
can truly experience

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
the importance of low-carbon trips.

151
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
It's so that more ordinary people
living in this city

152
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,080
won't need to spend a lot of money

153
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,360
to enjoy the natural scenery
and the environment.

154
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,640
I hope we can give people more confidence

155
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,280
that in making our own choices,

156
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,480
we can let the city we live in
have the most dazzling starry sky again.

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,320
It's nice to have
a VIP member venue indeed

158
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,840
and it's very high-end.

159
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,040
But it doesn't really fit

160
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,200
our event's theme this time.

161
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,880
I think we can check out more venues.

162
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,560
If that's the case,

163
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,960
I will reserve my comments first.

164
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
Okay.

165
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,640
- Check out more places then.
- Okay.

166
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,520
Where's your assistant?

167
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,720
He was just here.

168
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
Hello.

169
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
You must be tired from working all day.

170
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,800
This is my job.

171
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,800
You're working hard in the cold.
Here. Have a warm drink.

172
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,120
Well…

173
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,240
How can I take that?

174
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
It's okay.

175
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,600
Thank you, young man.

176
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,640
Young people like you are rare.

177
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,200
They don't even want to talk
to an old man like me.

178
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,760
I've loved listening
to stories of elders since I was young.

179
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,280
Sir, consider me your junior.

180
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,800
- Let's chat.
- Sure.

181
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,480
Sir, do you know any nearby places

182
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,720
that are suitable for stargazing?

183
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,960
Stargazing?

184
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,320
There is one.

185
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,840
I have a secret stargazing spot.

186
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
- I'll tell you.
- Really?

187
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Where were you?

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,480
I saw that you and Mr. Xu were busy,

189
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
so I checked around the area.

190
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
You're done looking around?

191
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
You should have informed us.

192
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,000
Didn't we agree

193
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,560
that you'd help with documentation?

194
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,120
Qi Xiao, Xiaole has a family matter
to attend to.

195
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,560
I told him to go home.

196
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,680
Use my car

197
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
to take Ms. Shen home.

198
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,640
There's no need, sir.

199
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
I'll take a cab.

200
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,240
Mr. Xu, let me drive you home.

201
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,200
I told you.

202
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,440
You're in charge of taking Ms. Shen home.

203
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
It's really okay, Mr. Xu.

204
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,360
You should go home early.

205
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,360
It's really convenient for me
to get a cab.

206
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay.

207
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,200
Take care on your way home then.

208
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,840
You don't have to drive home.

209
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,160
Get Ms. Shen a cab.

210
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
I'll drive myself home.

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,840
- Text me when you get home.
- Okay.

212
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
Bye, Mr. Xu.

213
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Ruoxin.

214
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll take you to a place.

215
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,440
Where?

216
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,680
Qi Xiao.

217
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
Where are you taking me?

218
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,800
It's late. Will it be dangerous?

219
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,960
Don't worry.

220
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,600
Just follow me.

221
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,040
Kids are all talk.

222
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,760
Are you okay?

223
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm okay.

224
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,160
Be careful.

225
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
How much further is it?

226
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,480
We'll get there soon.

227
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
It's so pretty.

228
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,520
How did you find this?

229
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,760
What do you think? Nice, right?

230
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,400
I just chatted with the security guard.
I didn't expect to gain anything.

231
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
So someone gave you a tip.

232
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,320
I was wondering why you disappeared.

233
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,640
You're pretty good.

234
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
Just like the stars.

235
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,320
I think Mr. Xu's VIP member venue
is very expensive

236
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,920
and clients may not even like it.

237
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,680
Look, if we hold
the test-drive event here,

238
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,640
it's so open

239
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,920
and close to nature.

240
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,440
People living in big cities
will surely love this.

241
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
Qi Xiao, you've really reminded me.

242
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,320
How can children in the city

243
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,160
see so many stars nowadays, right?

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,240
On that day, we'll drive all day

245
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
to this lake here.

246
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
Then everyone can see the stars together.

247
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,480
We can hold

248
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,040
a family stargazing event.

249
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,560
It fits the theme
of our test-drive event, doesn't it?

250
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,840
Ruoxin.

251
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
You're amazing.

252
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,600
Qi Xiao.

253
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,960
You did well this time.

254
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,280
I have to reward you.

255
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,200
You owe me way too many rewards now.

256
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,280
By the way, I forgot to tell you.

257
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,080
My mom is inviting you
to dinner at my house.

258
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,240
Really?

259
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
- Dinner at your house?
- Yes.

260
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,840
This place is really nice.

261
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,040
Good morning, everyone.

262
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
Hello, good morning.

263
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,720
- Good morning, Sijia.
- Good morning.

264
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,720
- Sijia.
- Ms. Qiao.

265
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,440
Did you forget to send the proofread
contract to Mr. Ruan last night?

266
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,359
I forgot about it.

267
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,680
Hurry up, or you'll get scolded again.

269
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,640
Watch your performance rating this month.

270
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay, I'll send it now.

271
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Hurry up.

272
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,520
Su Yang really let the animals
into the city.

273
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,800
It's quite nice.

274
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
How did you find this place?

275
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
Qi Xiao found it.

276
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
We heard it's really beautiful at night,

277
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
so we went there last night.

278
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
Last night?

279
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
He could have told me.

280
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
I could have stayed last night

281
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,440
and checked the place out together.

282
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,400
This way,

283
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,560
we don't need to go again.

284
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,680
The security guard told me
when we were about to leave last night.

285
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,840
The thing is
we don't know Suzhou very well.

286
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,840
And we weren't sure
if we could use the place or not.

287
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,720
Most importantly, it's too far away.

288
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
We were afraid you'd waste your effort.

289
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,040
It's quite nice.

290
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,920
I just need to go and check again.

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
What's important is to check

292
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
if we can have an event there.

293
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay.

294
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,080
- Thank you, Mr. Xu.
- You're welcome.

295
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,320
Ask Qi Xiao to check on Dushu Lake again.

296
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm afraid the weather won't be good

297
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,880
and we can't hold the event.

298
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,320
Outdoor events are all about
the weather after all.

299
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,880
Don't worry, Mr. Xu.
I'll arrange everything.

300
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,080
Okay, you've worked hard today.

301
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
No, it's part of my job.

302
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,000
You're working late.

303
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,840
Ms. Zhou, what are you doing here?

304
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
Taking out the trash.

305
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll do it for you.

306
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,960
Qi Xiao.

307
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,040
I want to ask you.

308
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,360
Last night, you guys
really worked overtime that late?

309
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,080
Ruoxin came back
in the middle of the night.

310
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,680
I saw Mr. Xu taking her home earlier.

311
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
She was working late?

312
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,880
Ms. Zhou, don't worry.

313
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Lately, we're holding a stargazing event.

314
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Last night,

315
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,920
we inspected the venue together.

316
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
Then I came back with Ruoxin.

317
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Today, I think

318
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,680
Ruoxin brought Mr. Xu there again,

319
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,080
so he brought her home.

320
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,480
Everything's normal. Don't worry.

321
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,280
You two were together last night?

322
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,320
That's a relief.

323
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,880
Ms. Zhou.

324
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,000
I heard

325
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,600
- that you want to invite me to dinner.
- Yes.

326
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,640
Xinxin already told you about it, right?

327
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
The night after tomorrow,

328
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,760
neither of you is allowed
to work overtime.

329
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,040
I'll treat you to dinner.

330
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,200
I'll be the host.

331
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,400
You helped me out so much last time.

332
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,800
I have to thank you.

333
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,560
Look at you.

334
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
It's what I should do.

335
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,960
Should I come home earlier to help you?

336
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,360
That would be great.

337
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,240
I've noticed that you can cook last time.

338
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,160
Right.

339
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,320
A guy who can cook

340
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,240
is a rare find these days.

341
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,400
Do well the day after tomorrow then.

342
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
Add points

343
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,600
to your image.

344
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
What's your specialty?

345
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,320
How about sweet and sour pork ribs?

346
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,000
That's Xinxin's favorite.

347
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Really?

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,120
It's sweet and sour.

349
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,560
All girls like them.

350
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,240
It's an authentic Shanghai flavor.

351
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,680
But young girls these days

352
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,040
like heavy flavors.

353
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
Okay, it's settled then.

354
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,600
I'll buy the ribs the day after tomorrow.

355
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,720
I'll choose nice ones.

356
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,640
- You even know how to choose them?
- Yes.

357
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
That's not easy.

358
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,480
Many outstanding talents are youngsters.

359
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,800
You're a treasure.

360
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,800
No.

361
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,120
Ms. Zhou.

362
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,240
I was raised by a single mom too.

363
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,560
So I know how hard it was

364
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,160
for you.

365
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,880
You're so thoughtful.

366
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Don't worry.

367
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,160
I'll surely

368
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,560
help you.

369
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,000
Thank you, Ms. Zhou. Let me do it.

370
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,080
Let's go.

371
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Send it to me via email.

372
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
Text me afterward, okay?

373
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
Mom, where did you go?

374
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,080
I took out the trash.

375
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
By the way, Mom, didn't you say

376
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
that you want to invite Qi Xiao
to dinner soon?

377
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,240
Set the date.

378
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
He helped us quite a bit before.

379
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,800
We're on the same page.

380
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,320
I saw him downstairs earlier.

381
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,480
I told him

382
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,680
to come over for dinner
the day after tomorrow.

383
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,720
He said yes.

384
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,320
But the night after tomorrow,
no one can work overtime.

385
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
Don't do it the day after tomorrow then.
How about this weekend?

386
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,720
Mrs. Wang and Xiao'ai are only
available the night after tomorrow.

387
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,640
Mom, I told you.

388
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,560
Don't be a matchmaker.

389
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,240
I saw your video call
with Mrs. Wang and Xiao'ai last time.

390
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,920
To tell you the truth,

391
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,560
Qi Xiao surely won't like
a girl like Xiao'ai.

392
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,960
You're lying.

393
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,400
Xiao'ai is nice.

394
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,160
In what way?

395
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,120
Didn't you hear Mrs. Wang?

396
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
How did Xiao'ai break up
with her ex-boyfriend?

397
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,520
I can tell by listening to you
that this girl must be dramatic,

398
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,760
vain, and superficial.

399
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,400
Can you stop torturing Qi Xiao?

400
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,880
So what if she's dramatic?

401
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
If girls don't act dramatically
when they date, when can they do that?

402
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,080
If you don't act dramatically,

403
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,720
how do you know
that your boyfriend is serious about you?

404
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,360
You're not dramatic.

405
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,360
Please bring home an outstanding man then.

406
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,640
Xiao'ai is dramatic?

407
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,160
You should know
that Mrs. Wang is quite well-off.

408
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,880
They have a house in the city

409
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,640
and a huge villa in Songjiang.

410
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,080
Mom, don't tell Qi Xiao about this.

411
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,880
How can a straightforward guy like him

412
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,840
want to accept financial support
from others?

413
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,960
Besides, you told me
that Qi Xiao already likes someone.

414
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,120
I know Qi Xiao very well.

415
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,240
He's not a disloyal type.

416
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,800
Has Qi Xiao confessed to her yet?

417
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,840
Did he get a yes?

418
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,640
What era are we in?

419
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,320
Can you please keep your wits?

420
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,440
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

421
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,040
Mom.

422
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
Fine.

423
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
Introduce him to her.

424
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,640
You're right.

425
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,760
It's always good to make
some friends, right?

426
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
Introduce him to her.

427
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,120
Good.

428
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,920
That's what I want to hear.

429
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,680
The facts speak for themselves.

430
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,800
You'll see.

431
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Hurry up.

432
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,280
Stop dillydallying.

433
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,800
Qi Xiao, where is Ms. Shen?

434
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
She's in a meeting with Mr. Xu.

435
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,680
Here's the guest list
for our test-drive event.

436
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,360
After her meeting,
let her do a final confirmation.

437
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,120
Once it's confirmed,
we'll officially hand out the invitations.

438
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,840
Is it urgent?

439
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,240
Office hours are almost over.
How about tomorrow?

440
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,280
No later than tomorrow morning.

441
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,520
If not, I won't be able
to answer to my boss.

442
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

443
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,720
Ms. Zhang was here.

444
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,480
She gave you the guest list

445
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,840
for final confirmation.

446
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
When does she want it?

447
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,600
I've asked her. There's no rush.

448
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,040
Tomorrow morning is fine.

449
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,520
- No need to finish it today.
- That's good.

450
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,840
Ruoxin, it's time to leave. Let's go.

451
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,040
It's still early.

452
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,000
I need to finish
what Mr. Xu told me to do.

453
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
Have you forgotten?

454
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,680
What?

455
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,200
My mom is inviting you over
for dinner today.

456
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
That's right.

457
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,640
Look.

458
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,080
Your mom sent me a lot of ingredients
to buy from the supermarket.

459
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,800
You can go ahead then.

460
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,480
I'll be right home after I'm done.

461
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,200
When will you be home then?

462
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,680
Before 7:30 p.m.

463
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
You can eat first. Don't wait for me.

464
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,520
This isn't about me anyway.

465
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,960
That won't do.

466
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,160
We must wait for you for dinner.

467
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,680
Otherwise, it would be awkward.

468
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,840
It would be quite awkward indeed.

469
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,320
My mom already told you?

470
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,960
Yes.

471
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,440
You don't have to be nervous or shy.

472
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
Just act natural.

473
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Do what you normally do.

474
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,920
That's cute, isn't it?

475
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,760
Okay.

476
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,640
I'll do as you say.

477
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
Come home early, okay?

478
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,720
Go. They're waiting for you.

479
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,200
Remember, you agreed to it yourself.

480
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,880
We'll wait for you then.

481
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,920
Go.

482
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,640
Come home early.

483
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,600
I left work already, Ms. Zhou.

484
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,040
Don't worry and wait at home.

485
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,440
I'll buy the groceries.

486
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,320
Thank you, Qi Xiao.

487
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,320
I even asked you to do
so many things today.

488
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm a bit embarrassed.

489
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,960
Don't mention it.

490
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,200
Ruoxin already told me.

491
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,240
It's the chance for me
to do my best today.

492
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,000
Ruoxin told you?

493
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,120
That's a relief.

494
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
Tonight,

495
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,280
you must do well.

496
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,080
I'll try to get you two
to confirm your relationship.

497
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,040
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

498
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,720
"Confirm your relationship"?

499
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
Which one do you like?

500
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,880
Ma'am, is this Iberico pork?

501
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,080
Of course.

502
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
All the licenses are validated.

503
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,880
You can check.

504
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,760
Young man, trust me.

505
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,280
It smells so good when cooked.

506
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,200
It's free if it doesn't smell good.

507
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,480
Okay, I'll take this one.

508
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,080
Okay.

509
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,840
Hello, Ms. Zhou?

510
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,400
I already bought the ingredients.
I'll be right there.

511
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,000
Don't forget to bring me some cilantro.

512
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,040
Ruoxin's favorite food
is braised eggplant with cilantro.

513
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Sure, no problem.

514
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,440
I'll buy it in a while.

515
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,680
I have to go. Bye.

516
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,600
Was that your mother-in-law?

517
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,640
Ma'am,

518
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,080
whether I'll succeed or not

519
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,600
depends on these ribs today.

520
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,080
I'm sure you'll succeed.

521
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,320
I'm a mother-in-law too.

522
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,960
I'll get you a better one.

523
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,920
Sure.

524
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,520
Okay, this one.

525
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,520
Okay.

526
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,000
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Okay.

527
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,120
Mom.

528
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,440
You'll be home soon, right?

529
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,040
Mrs. Wang and her daughter
have been here for a while.

530
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll be home soon.

531
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,680
Is Qi Xiao there?

532
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,560
He's here.

533
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,040
I'm hanging up.

534
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,280
- Isn't it nice, Ms. Zhou?
- It is.

535
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,400
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

536
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,320
I knew it. You're so smart.

537
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,840
You even brought flowers.

538
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,160
Ruoxin likes stars,

539
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,960
so I chose baby's breath to match it.

540
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,000
I think this color suits…

541
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,400
the living room.

542
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
She is…

543
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,440
Xiao'ai.

544
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,800
This flower is from him.

545
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,960
- Thank you.
- Ms. Zhou, this is…

546
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
Didn't Ruoxin tell you?

547
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,320
She's my former colleague, Mrs. Wang Ping.

548
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,400
This is her daughter, Xiao'ai.

549
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,280
I told you about him earlier.

550
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,840
He's my daughter's assistant.

551
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,080
His name is Qi Xiao.

552
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,800
What do you think?

553
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,840
He's good-looking, right?

554
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,520
What's important is that
this kid has a high EQ.

555
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
Damn it.

556
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,520
I met you two thanks to Ms. Zhou.

557
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm so happy today.

558
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,120
Ms. Zhou,

559
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,760
I'll go to the kitchen
to prepare the pork.

560
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Just sit here today

561
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,320
and keep Mrs. Wang and Xiao'ai company.

562
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
I'll take care of the kitchen myself.

563
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,120
I can't let you do the work.

564
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,040
I'll do it.

565
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,440
You can entertain the guests.

566
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
This kid

567
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,560
is so shy.

568
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,560
Do you like him?

569
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,280
Ms. Zhou is asking if you like him.

570
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,680
Ruoxin, what's going on?

571
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,920
Why didn't you tell me

572
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,560
the reason why Ms. Zhou
invited me over for dinner?

573
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,520
I'll be right there.

574
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,880
I'll advise you when I get there.

575
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,840
Why are you hiding in the kitchen?

576
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,560
The lady I introduced to you
is pretty, right?

577
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,040
I already told you.

578
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,480
I'll only introduce you

579
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,640
to the best.

580
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,320
- Ms. Zhou, I--
- Listen to me.

581
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,440
Mrs. Wang's husband is a professor.

582
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,320
So technically,
they are from a family of scholars.

583
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,160
They're quite well-off.

584
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,680
The more well-off people are,

585
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,200
the higher their standards are.

586
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,480
Hide your family's situation well.

587
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,200
- Hide?
- That's right.

588
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,440
I told them

589
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,720
that you're just temporarily
being an assistant.

590
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,120
You're preparing for your bar exam now.

591
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
You're going to be a lawyer in the future.

592
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,320
But in terms of coming

593
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,840
from a single-parent family,

594
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,120
don't mention that today.

595
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,480
If you say too much,
she would have some concerns.

596
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,200
After the two of you get close,

597
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,680
after knowing your personality,

598
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,480
slowly tell her about it.

599
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,000
She'll accept it.

600
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,760
Do you understand?

601
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,320
Ms. Zhou, don't worry. I understand.

602
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,240
Go.

603
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,920
Wait.

604
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,360
Look at you.

605
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,800
You look travel-stained,

606
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,239
like a delivery guy.

607
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,199
Yes.

608
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,679
You're perfect now.

609
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,239
Come on.

610
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,159
Mrs. Wang.

611
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,159
I'll let Qi Xiao chat with you.

612
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,239
I'll go and cook.

613
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,280
Thank you.

614
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,800
Qi Xiao.

615
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,159
I heard you graduated from ECNU.

616
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,960
ECNU is a great university.

617
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,320
Majoring in law is good too.

618
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,840
Mrs. Wang.

619
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,720
Actually, I studied law

620
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,360
because I was confused.

621
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,240
Ms. Zhou already told you, right?

622
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,040
I won't be a legal assistant for long.

623
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,280
My dream is to open an online shop

624
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,560
and have my own business.

625
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,480
An online shop?

626
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,680
Qi Xiao.

627
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,800
Even if you don't become a lawyer,

628
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,720
being a legal assistant in a big company

629
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,920
is still a decent job.

630
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Why…

631
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,040
Why do you want to open an online shop?

632
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
You're not aware.

633
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,200
I opened an online shop
when I was in college.

634
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,720
I skipped classes daily back then

635
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,200
and didn't take my exams

636
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
to make my online shop bigger and better.

637
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,080
But I was unlucky.

638
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,760
Shortly after getting on track,

639
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,480
my partner swindled all the money.

640
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,440
That's why I can only
be a legal assistant temporarily.

641
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,800
But don't worry.

642
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,520
When I save enough money one day,

643
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,920
I'll definitely reopen my online shop.

644
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,920
Mom.

645
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,720
Qi Xiao.

646
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,480
We can discuss

647
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,680
your career plan slowly.

648
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,680
I heard from Ms. Zhou
that you're very capable.

649
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,000
You can do housework, cook,

650
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,520
and even take care of people.

651
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,200
Men like you are rare these days.

652
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,240
Right.

653
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,160
Mrs. Wang.

654
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,480
I've been good at taking care
of people since I was little.

655
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,840
My dad passed away when I was young.

656
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,000
My mom worked hard to raise me.

657
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,480
It wasn't easy.

658
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,640
That's why I have to take care of my mom.

659
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,160
I resolved to buy
a big house after I succeeded

660
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,800
with my online shop

661
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,680
for my future wife and my mom to live in.

662
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,720
There's an old saying in China.

663
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,480
"Filial piety comes first." That's right.

664
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,720
I shouldn't forget my mom
after getting married.

665
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,600
I want my wife to take care of my mom.

666
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,720
Right?

667
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,240
Mom.

668
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,080
I told you I didn't want to come.

669
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
Xiao'ai.

670
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,680
Xiao'ai.

671
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,880
Why are you leaving?

672
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,120
Mrs. Wang.

673
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,160
I've prepared the food already.

674
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,520
Ms. Zhou, he's…

675
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,200
He’s very unreliable.

676
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
He's a poor sexist.

677
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,280
"He's a poor sexist"?

678
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,000
Qi Xiao.

679
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,880
What did you tell them?

680
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,120
Ms. Zhou.

681
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,360
I got so nervous

682
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,400
that I told the truth.

683
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,240
I told them I have no property or savings.

684
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,000
I couldn't even pass the bar exam.

685
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,160
And my mom is depending on me.

686
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,040
You're so stupid.

687
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
You silly kid.

688
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,360
Why did you tell them the truth?

689
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm home.

690
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,440
- Ruoxin, you're back?
- Yes.

691
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,560
Mom.

692
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,160
Where are they?

693
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,040
Where are Mrs. Wang and Xiao'ai?

694
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,920
You're an idiot.

695
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,720
I'm so mad that my blood pressure went up.

696
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,560
I can't believe they didn't like Qi Xiao.

697
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,640
It's fine if they don't like him.

698
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,560
You really don't know

699
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,800
how mean their comments about him were.

700
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,000
They said I introduced
a poor sexist to them.

701
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,040
How can Qi Xiao be a poor sexist?

702
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,920
Why doesn't he deserve her daughter?

703
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,240
I told you.

704
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,520
Don't be a matchmaker.

705
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,960
You know what kind of people
Mrs. Wang's family are,

706
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,160
yet you wouldn't listen.

707
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,440
Ruoxin.

708
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,360
- Wash your hands and have dinner.
- Okay.

709
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,400
Ms. Zhou.

710
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,240
Don't be mad.

711
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,560
Qi Xiao.

712
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,400
Don't take what they said

713
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,400
to heart.

714
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,880
Don't bully youngsters for being poor.

715
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,880
I have faith in you.

716
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,040
I'll surely introduce you
to a nice girl in the future.

717
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,840
She'll be at least 100 times better

718
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,040
than Xiao'ai.

719
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,520
Ms. Zhou, you don't have to.

720
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,640
Didn't I tell you?

721
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
I already

722
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,600
have someone that I like.

723
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Although I don't deserve her yet,

724
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
one day,

725
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,440
I can stand next to her.

726
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,360
I like men with integrity like you.

727
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,880
The one who'll be your girlfriend

728
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,880
is so lucky.

729
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,360
That's enough. Let's put this behind us.

730
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,760
If they won't eat, we will.

731
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,360
- Come on, let's eat.
- Let's eat.

732
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,320
Let's go.

733
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,840
- Come on.
- Come on, Ms. Zhou.

734
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,920
Try it.

735
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Qi Xiao's cooking is delicious.

736
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,800
It smells so good.

737
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,400
And he made all these
in just half an hour.

738
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,400
Eat, Mom. The food will get cold.

739
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,880
Ms. Zhou,
this braised eggplant is really unique.

740
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,720
I've never had it this way before.

741
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
If you haven't tried it,

742
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,040
- then make me proud today.
- Thank you.

743
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,920
- Try it.
- Okay.

744
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,120
It smells so good.

745
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,240
You added the cilantro
while cooking, right?

746
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,360
Are you asking me?

747
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm not sure

748
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,240
if I want to tell you yet

749
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,640
and how to tell you about it.

750
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,960
There's a saying,

751
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,960
"After a student masters his teacher's
skill, his teacher will lose his job."

752
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,920
This is the Shen family's secret recipe.
You won't pass it on to outsiders, right?

753
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,240
Ms. Zhou.

754
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,560
How can a teacher lose his job
after his student masters his skill?

755
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,120
The teacher won't need to do it himself
after the student masters his skill.

756
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,560
Look. If you're craving eggplants
in the future,

757
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,880
just send me a text.

758
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
"Qi Xiao, I want to eat eggplants."

759
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640
I'll cook it for you right away.

760
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
Look at you, young man.

761
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,400
You're so good with your words.

762
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,440
If you're going to pursue a girl,

763
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,120
who can handle you?

764
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,880
I just don't know right now

765
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,480
who would be so lucky for you to pursue.

766
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,880
By the way, Ruoxin,

767
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Ms. Zhou told me
that you like sweet and sour pork.

768
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,640
Try this. I made it.

769
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,320
Nice.

770
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,880
How is it?

771
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,080
How did you know how to make this?

772
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,680
What?

773
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,360
It's exactly the same as my dad's cooking.

774
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Eat.

775
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,560
Qi Xiao.

776
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,960
Where did you learn
how to cook sweet and sour pork?

777
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,040
I learned it by myself online.

778
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,280
It said

779
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,600
that if you add plum sauce
to sweet and sour pork,

780
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,080
it would have a unique taste.

781
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,320
What's wrong? You don't like it?

782
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,360
You like it?

783
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,480
Eat more if you like it.

784
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,600
Eat more.

785
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,520
It's okay, Ms. Zhou.

786
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,840
Try this.

787
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,320
Shredded pork in chili sauce.

788
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,760
I especially learned this
from a Sichuan chef.

789
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,040
Ruoxin likes spicy food,
but I know you don't.

790
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,280
So I especially tweaked it a bit.

791
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,160
I hope it's spicy, but not too spicy.

792
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,360
What do you think?

793
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,480
This is good.

794
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,480
Adding a little spiciness

795
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,280
makes it more fragrant and fresh.

796
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,640
Ruoxin.

797
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,680
- Try this too.
- Okay.

798
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,000
It's really good.

799
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,960
The shredded pork
in chili sauce goes so well with rice.

800
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,360
I need to eat at least
two bowls of rice today.

801
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,840
Have some more then.

802
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,800
Here.

803
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,400
You too. Eat more.

804
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,240
Just eat.

805
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,400
