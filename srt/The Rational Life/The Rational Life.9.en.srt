1
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,200
Thank you.

2
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
Mr. Xu, you're our platinum card member.

3
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,360
This is today's menu.

4
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,400
Okay, thank you.

5
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,280
Okay, thank you.

6
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll take the Chinese cuisine
and a hot Americano.

7
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
- No sugar, no milk.
- Okay.

8
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,120
I'll take this.

9
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,800
- Jasmine tea.
- Thank you.

10
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
This is today's menu.

11
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,440
The New Energy Department
will start training next week.

12
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,240
All regional branches
will send representatives to Shanghai.

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,920
Chengdu is a stronghold of
the mid-west Chinese automotive market.

14
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,000
A lot of new energy automotive
development companies are in Chengdu.

15
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm taking you with me this time

16
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
to get to know the colleagues there

17
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,840
and familiarize yourself
with the work soon.

18
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,760
You'll assist me in planning
the training back in Shanghai.

19
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,480
This will make it easier for you.

20
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
Yes, Mr. Xu.

21
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,040
I'll surely learn from you.

22
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Relax.

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,480
- If you're tired, take a nap.
- Okay.

24
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
Mr. Xu, I'll set up the table for you.

25
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
I'll do it.

26
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Thank you.

27
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,400
Thank you.

28
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Mrs. Xu, your husband is so thoughtful.

29
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
- He's my boss.
- I'm sorry.

30
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,160
Thank you.

31
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,000
<i>These are all five-star restaurants.</i>

32
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,440
<i>Don't miss out.</i>

33
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,680
<i>There are many snacks in Chengdu.</i>

34
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>Try some when you have time.</i>

35
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
<i>You still have time to review them.</i>

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,680
<i>Didn't you say work is hectic?</i>

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,480
<i>You've touched down?</i>

38
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,560
<i>I was just worried about my boss.
Why did I get scolded?</i>

39
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,840
I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT MY BOSS.
WHY DID I GET SCOLDED?

40
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay, let's take a look

41
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,960
at Chengdu's Rayco Technology and Co.'s

42
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,080
integrated vehicle
DC charging station plan.

43
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,480
Please read the first page.

44
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,960
Chengdu's Rayco Technology and Co.

45
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,600
was established in 2003.

46
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,960
It's a new national
high-technology enterprise.

47
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
On November 3rd, 2017,

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
it was successfully listed on GEM.

49
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,440
- It focuses on power electronics research,
- Take a look.

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,280
development, and sales.

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,160
Targeting mid to high-end

52
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,320
DC power supply manufacturers.

53
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,760
Since 2011,

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,200
it has developed
the DC power supply module.

55
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
Mr. Xu.

56
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
I've long heard that
you're young and talented.

57
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,640
Seeing you today,

58
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,920
you do live up to your reputation.

59
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,520
The questions you asked earlier…

60
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,080
We found them really sharp.

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,320
We need time to process it.

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,600
One thing for sure,

63
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,320
we'll definitely find answers
that can satisfy all of us.

64
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,240
I'm sure we'll work well together.

65
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
Mr. Zhang.

66
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
I admire your company

67
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,480
for your sincerity in the cooperation.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,880
And I'm sure
we'll work very well together.

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Dinner is prepared.

70
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,560
- How about--
- It's fine.

71
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,080
I have dinner plans.

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,280
- We'll be in touch.
- Okay.

73
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll make sure

74
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,600
to give you a satisfactory answer soon.

75
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Mr. Xu, you have dinner plans.

76
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
Should I accompany you?

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Of course.

78
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,480
I have a very important guest.

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,240
- You have to be present.
- Okay.

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,800
When you get home,
make sure to practice more.

81
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,320
Get ready to prepare
for the next calligraphy contest

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,840
in the University for Seniors.

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Work hard!

84
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
We can do this!

85
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou.
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

86
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,280
Class dismissed.

87
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,800
This word is powerfully written.

88
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,360
It's okay. Look at mine.
I think it's pretty good.

89
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,360
- Let's eat together.
- Yes.

90
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,640
MOM, HAVE YOUR MEALS REGULARLY
AND MIND YOUR HEALTH.

91
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
ARE YOU STILL ANGRY AT ME?

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,440
Ms. Zhou.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Let's eat together.

94
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,520
No, thank you.

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
Thank you. Please go ahead.

96
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,360
Ms. Zhou has a daughter.

97
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,040
She might be eating
with her daughter's family.

98
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Unlike us, our kids live abroad.

99
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,520
We're all alone.

100
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,760
I'm used to being alone.

101
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,920
At this age,

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,120
we go out ourselves to have fun.

103
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,960
We don't want to trouble them.

104
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,600
Besides, my daughter is busy.

105
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,640
Look at this.

106
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,160
This weekend,

107
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,600
she has a business trip to Chengdu.

108
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,640
Ms. Zhou.

109
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,400
Is this your daughter?

110
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,120
- She looks really good.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,040
She looks so familiar.

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I feel like I've seen her before.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,520
Do you know my daughter?

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm sure I do.

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,160
But I can't remember.

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,040
She looks so familiar.

117
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
PEACH LOUNGE

118
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,880
Mr. Xu, where would you like to sit today?

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,320
You choose.

120
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
Anywhere is fine.

121
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,600
We'll take my favorite table.

122
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay. Please follow me.

123
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,600
Mr. Xu, would you like
your food served now

124
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,000
or shall we serve it later?

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,039
- Now, please. Thank you.
- Okay.

126
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,080
Mr. Xu, don't you have an important guest?

127
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,280
My distinguished guest

128
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,440
is sitting right in front of me.

129
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,200
Thank you.

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
A little bit of champagne is fine, right?

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Yes.

132
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,720
Thank you.

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
Since I came to Shanghai,

134
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,160
I've been working nonstop.

135
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
You've been a great help to me.

136
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
I really wanted to thank you.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,200
Mr. Xu, you're too kind.

138
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,080
I learned a lot from working with you.

139
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
I should be the one thanking you.

140
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,960
I admire your competence at work.

141
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,400
During the meeting,

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
the note you gave me

143
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,960
pointed out all the issues.

144
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
I'm glad.

145
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
I was right about you.

146
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,840
Here's to you.

147
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,400
It's me who should make a toast to you.
I hope to learn more from you.

148
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
Thank you.

149
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,360
Take your time.

150
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
You're smart.

151
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,560
You learn really fast.

152
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,280
I believe that in time,

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
you can surely take charge.

154
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,840
Thank you.

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
Spicy tofu balls.

156
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,520
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Try it first.

157
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,320
This tofu is unique.

158
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,240
It doesn't taste like tofu, right?

159
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
It's molecular gastronomy.

160
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
Hello.

161
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
It has been a while.

162
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
Mr. Xu often says,

163
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
"You can never be tired
of eating fine food."

164
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,600
Louis is French.

165
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,440
He's a three-Michelin-starred chef.

166
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,400
It wasn't easy to bring him here.

167
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,440
I really like Chengdu.

168
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,240
The land flows with milk and honey.

169
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
But whenever I visited,

170
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
I couldn't find anything
that suits my taste.

171
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,160
That's why I tried so hard
to recruit Louis

172
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,640
to manage this restaurant.

173
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,120
Bon appétit.

174
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,560
He hopes you'll enjoy it.

175
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,720
It has a very special flavor. Delicious.

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,480
This is mashed potato with squid inkstone.

177
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,800
Honey fruit dumpling.

178
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,680
Candied fruit.

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Ms. Zhou.

180
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,120
You used to be an English teacher
in high school?

181
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Yes.

182
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,400
No wonder.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,480
Teaching at the University for Seniors,

184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,200
you're putting yourself to good use.

185
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm the type that can't stay idle.

186
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,600
Ms. Zhou.

187
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,560
I remember now.

188
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,800
Hold on.

189
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,880
Take a look.

190
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,120
Is this your daughter?

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,280
Where did you get this video?

192
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
Ms. Zhou, please calm down.

193
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
This is what happened.

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,840
Last month,
my husband was going to buy a car.

195
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,960
We were going to survey the cars
at Zenpro Automotive.

196
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,760
Then my nephew sent me this video,

197
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,640
telling us not to go to Zenpro.

198
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,880
There's a problem there.

199
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,920
Many car owners were protesting

200
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,040
and a woman was splashed with cola.

201
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Actually,

202
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,080
I have a presumptuous request.

203
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,400
Before I came to Shanghai,

204
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

205
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,800
Listen to me first.

206
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,800
The new energy project

207
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,280
will bring forth many parties
and gatherings.

208
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,800
Normally, you have to bring
a date to these events.

209
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
I can't turn them down.

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't want to just find any date.

211
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,240
So I was thinking, if…

212
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,720
If you're willing,

213
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,320
at such events in the future,

214
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,680
will you

215
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,400
be my date

216
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
and attend them with me?

217
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
If it's for work, that's not a problem.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,160
Thank you.

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,680
You've really helped me
by agreeing to this.

220
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,720
How about this?

221
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
From now on,
whenever you attend an event like this,

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
I'll pay for all your outfits
and accessories as such.

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
No--

224
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,000
There's no need to feel pressured.

225
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,760
Don't be embarrassed either.

226
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,720
This is what I should do.

227
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
- Mr. Xu--
- Also,

228
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,480
these things are nothing to me.

229
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,520
It's not a big deal.

230
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Mr. Xu,

231
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,360
I've attended such events with you.

232
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,840
I have a rough idea
of how to dress up for them.

233
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,320
I can handle anything work-related.

234
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,160
As you wish.

235
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,720
I won't make things hard for you.

236
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,040
Tea or coffee?

237
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,000
Tea.

238
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,440
<i>Working late at night.</i>

239
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>It's really sad.</i>

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,920
I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT MY BOSS.
WHY DID I GET SCOLDED?

241
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
<i>Don't work too late.
No need to rush with the inventory.</i>

242
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,400
<i>We'll do it together
when I return tomorrow.</i>

243
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,080
<i>Ruoxin, which one of the shops</i>

244
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
<i>I recommended did you go to?</i>

245
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
<i>Were they good?</i>

246
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>Are you trying to tempt me?</i>

247
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
<i>Hell on earth.</i>

248
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,920
How did the checkup go today?

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,320
Didn't you say you're going to
accompany me once you're done with work?

250
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,800
I didn't expect today's work
to be so complicated.

251
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,560
Work kept coming when I was done.

252
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,480
It never ends.

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,760
Men are so trustworthy.

254
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,520
Don't be mad, honey.

255
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,760
A few years ago, you went off
to Antarctica with just one bag.

256
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Do you really need me
for the pre-conception checkup?

257
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,640
It's pointless for me.
I'm not the one doing the checkup.

258
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,840
So

259
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,119
I'm the only one having a child?

260
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,119
What about raising the child?

261
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Just because I went to Antarctica,

262
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,640
I deserve widowed parenting?

263
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,960
If you say so,

264
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,000
then I don't think we should have kids.

265
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,240
I don't want to sacrifice
myself and my freedom

266
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,960
for you and your mom's happiness.

267
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,240
Song Ziyan.

268
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,359
In the past few years,

269
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,640
did my mom stress you out
about having kids?

270
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,599
Yes.

271
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,160
Children are our responsibility.

272
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
But our roles can be different.

273
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm the breadwinner, you're the homemaker.

274
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Isn't that great?

275
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,840
I've been working my butt off for years

276
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,160
so you get to travel.

277
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,800
I kept silent even though you do nothing,
but goof around.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,560
I'm proud to say that
no other husband can do what I did.

279
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,240
I did nothing?

280
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,280
I goof around?

281
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,680
Who was the one who said
that I can have all the fun?

282
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,240
Who told me to quit
and be a princess for life?

283
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,200
I said it and I did it.

284
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,280
But how old were you then?
How old are you now?

285
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
You don't want kids.

286
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,520
It will sacrifice your freedom.

287
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,520
Then tell me what do you want?

288
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
What do you want to do freely?

289
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,880
Or do you want to continue
to be isolated at home?

290
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,560
What do you mean?

291
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,560
Apart from having kids,

292
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I can't do anything else?

293
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
If I don't have a child, I am worthless?

294
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
You said it yourself.

295
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,080
Zou Cheng!

296
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,000
Listen carefully!

297
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,120
Don't look down on me!

298
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
I'll go and get a job tomorrow.

299
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,320
Don't set yourself against me.

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,240
You worked at a bank for a few years.

301
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,920
But were you promoted to manager?

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,760
Let's say you got promoted to manager,

303
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,440
there are years of employment gap.

304
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
What would you say if they asked?

305
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
You went on a trip?

306
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,680
Who would take you seriously?

307
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,520
Don't talk to me anymore!

308
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,560
Mom.

309
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,000
Are you still in Chengdu?

310
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,680
<i>I'm leaving for Shanghai
tomorrow afternoon.</i>

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Why didn't you tell me
about such a serious matter?

312
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,600
Am I nothing to you?

313
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,800
What are you talking about?

314
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,680
Stop pretending.

315
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
They splashed you with cola!

316
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>The video is all over the Internet.</i>

317
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,920
Where did you see it?

318
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,600
Why?

319
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,440
My daughter was in trouble

320
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,880
and I'm the last person to know?

321
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,880
Don't cry, Mom.

322
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,280
<i>It's not that I don't want to tell you.</i>

323
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,440
I was afraid that if I did,
you'd get worried and anxious.

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
It's okay now.

325
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,760
When was that?

326
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,200
It was a long time ago.

327
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,680
Over a month ago.

328
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,400
Everything's okay now.

329
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,760
Why do you keep telling me you're okay?

330
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
I get it now.

331
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
Whenever you say you're fine,

332
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,640
you're actually not.

333
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,120
You lied to me.
You want me to be at ease, right?

334
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,360
Did you call the police?

335
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,080
<i>Did they arrest that man?</i>

336
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
<i>What's with the attitude of your boss?</i>

337
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,320
Mom.

338
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm really okay now. I'm fine.

339
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,800
Don't worry.

340
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,440
Is it possible for you to get back
together with Xiaocui?

341
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,120
How can you get him
involved in everything?

342
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm doing this for your sake!

343
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,360
If you have Xiaocui by your side now,
he'll protect you.

344
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,320
How could he let that happen?

345
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,560
Mom.

346
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,560
I broke up with Cui Lixin.

347
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,440
He's not even in our company anymore.

348
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,480
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

349
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,400
<i>Don't think too much.</i>

350
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,760
<i>Get some rest.</i>

351
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm really okay. I'm fine now.

352
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,960
I have work to do. I'm hanging up.

353
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,760
You little bastard!

354
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,040
If anyone dares to mistreat my daughter,

355
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I'll fight you!

356
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,040
HIRING: SHANGHAI PUDONG NEW DISTRICT

357
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,320
THREE YEARS AND ABOVE EXPERIENCE
IN RELEVANT FIELD, UNDER 30 YEARS OLD

358
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
UNDER 30 YEARS OLD, EXPERIENCE
IN LARGE COMPANIES PREFERRED

359
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,800
Hello, Ruoxin?

360
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,240
Are you sleeping?

361
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,600
I'm ready for bed.

362
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,600
What's wrong?

363
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,320
I want to get a job.

364
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,960
What do you think suits me better?

365
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,360
What's got you worked up?

366
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,640
When you got married,

367
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,000
you said you'll leave the workforce
and never work again?

368
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,800
I was young.

369
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,080
I found my boss annoying.

370
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,440
I only realize now

371
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
that having my husband as my boss

372
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,200
is the most annoying of all.

373
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
Did you fight with your husband again?

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,840
<i>Are you really looking for a job?
So you're not having a baby?</i>

375
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,360
Anyway, I'm just trying to get a job.

376
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,800
Listen.

377
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,920
It's not easy to find a job these days.

378
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
You'd better brace yourself.

379
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,720
Why are you saying that too?

380
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm telling you the truth.

381
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,040
Back in the day,
your job at the bank is secure.

382
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,400
It'll be hard to find now.

383
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
All right, go to sleep.

384
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,720
- Get in. I'll take you home.
- It's okay, sir.

385
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,920
I already called a taxi.

386
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm sorry.

387
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,600
You didn't even get to rest on weekends.

388
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,520
It's okay.

389
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,040
See you at work tomorrow.

390
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,160
<i>I've been looking it up online.</i>

391
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,560
<i>There's really no job that suits me.</i>

392
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
<i>What do you think I should do?</i>

393
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
Ms. Wang.

394
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,040
I'd like to ask if you still need
a salesperson at your winery?

395
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,320
I'm Ruoxin.

396
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,880
She's about my age.

397
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,600
She used to work at a bank.

398
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,800
But then she got married
and took a break for a few years.

399
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
Okay, Ms. Wang. I got it.

400
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,160
Thank you, Ms. Wang.

401
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,480
Let's grab a meal when you can.

402
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,480
Hello, Mr. Wang.

403
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,880
I'm Shen Ruoxin.

404
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,480
Do you still need salespeople?

405
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,640
An administrator or an office worker
is also okay.

406
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,120
Mom.

407
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,160
Come on in.

408
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
I'll leave them here and go.

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
That's not what I meant.

410
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,720
I know.

411
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,640
You're busy with work
and you don't have an appetite.

412
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,600
So I got you chicken porridge
from Zhending Chicken.

413
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,920
Some spring chicken.

414
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,800
Your favorite moon cake
from Guangming Cun.

415
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
Did you have dinner?

416
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
No, I just ordered some food.

417
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,080
You shouldn't always order takeout.

418
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,360
What if their food isn't healthy?

419
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,000
What if they used gutter oil?

420
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,880
Mom.

421
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
Isn't this also a takeout?

422
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,840
How is this a takeout?

423
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
This is a takeout
from Shanghai's century-old shop.

424
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,360
These are your favorites
since you were a kid.

425
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,480
Don't forget.

426
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,040
Back then, when you had a perfect score,

427
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,760
I only bought you two as a reward.

428
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
They're all my favorites.

429
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,640
Here, eat while it's hot.

430
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Mom, how long did it take you

431
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
to line up for these moon cakes?

432
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,320
Two hours.

433
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,600
How many times have I told you?

434
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,080
You have bad legs.

435
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,720
They swell up if you stand for too long.

436
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,440
It takes two hours
to queue for these moon cakes.

437
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,400
I like them.

438
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,320
So I should drive there
and get them myself.

439
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
Aren't you busy?

440
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
Sit down. Let's eat together.

441
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
I ate some while I was out.

442
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,040
I came here today to ask you,

443
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,440
you told me over the phone

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,840
that Xiaocui left your company.

445
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Is it true?

446
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
Yes.

447
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,400
He left.

448
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,280
But we broke up amicably.

449
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,880
Tell me.

450
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,160
Look at you…

451
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,600
Okay.

452
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,240
I won't say a word today.

453
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,160
If I do, both of us will be unhappy.

454
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,920
Eat up.

455
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,920
I'll get going.

456
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,880
Mom.

457
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,280
From now on,

458
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
no matter what happens,

459
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,880
you have to tell me.

460
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,800
Your mom is all you have now.

461
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,200
Do you understand?

462
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,560
Yes.

463
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,080
Hello, it's delivery for 1302.

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
Thank you.

465
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Don't order takeout too often from now on.

466
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,320
All day long,

467
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,720
she's always having such rubbish food.

468
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,560
<i>One last thing,</i>

469
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,680
Mr. Xu is new here.

470
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
He doesn't know much about the company.

471
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,200
So all departments
must cooperate actively.

472
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,960
Don't just comply in appearance.

473
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Mr. Xu.

474
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,120
Do you have anything else to add?

475
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,320
Thank you, Mr. Liu Pei.

476
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,000
Tomorrow will be a one-week run

477
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,600
for the New Energy Department's
vocational training.

478
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,000
It's a very important vocational training.

479
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,920
It's also part of our in-house training.

480
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,920
Apart from our own staff
in the Sales Department,

481
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
all other branches
will also send their representatives.

482
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,440
So our staff in the New Energy Department
will have to work harder.

483
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,760
Let's compile today's training content.

484
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,960
I'll do the final check.

485
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,080
As for the itinerary and arrangements
of the training…

486
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,120
- Ms. Shen?
- Yes.

487
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,280
You're in charge of that.

488
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
Yes, Mr. Xu.

489
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,080
Come in.

490
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,720
Liu Pei.

491
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Have some coffee to freshen up.

492
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,040
I'll have tea.

493
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,640
Tea is good.

494
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,560
It's healthy.

495
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,040
What brings you here?

496
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
Here's the thing.

497
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,760
I think that Xu Minjie…

498
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,200
He held a press conference
and then an in-house training.

499
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,920
Now he's mass recruiting.

500
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,480
He's playing it big.

501
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
I heard something else too.

502
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
I heard that

503
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,000
he has reported to the headquarters

504
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
about adjusting
the organizational structure.

505
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,760
He's transferring some staff out

506
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,520
of our East China region
to the New Energy Department.

507
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
You're well-informed.

508
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,400
Xu Minjie has the chairman's support.

509
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,080
Now, he's coaxing the chairman

510
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,720
to focus on new energy cars.

511
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
He's definitely up to something.

512
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,840
But don't worry.

513
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
I've ploughed in
the East China region for 20 years.

514
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,080
He can't take advantage of me so easily.

515
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,840
That Xu Minjie

516
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,880
is just all talk when he bluffs.

517
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,560
In the end,

518
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,920
won't he have to prove himself
with sales figures?

519
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,920
Xu Minjie is a newcomer.

520
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,960
Firstly,

521
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,160
he needs to sort out personnel relations.

522
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,400
Secondly, he has to increase
the sales figures.

523
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,440
Who knows how long that will take?

524
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,000
The one who should be anxious

525
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,240
is him.

526
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,080
Not us.

527
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,120
You're right.

528
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,640
Liu Pei,

529
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,680
you've analyzed it so well.

530
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,520
That's very wise.

531
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
But there's one more thing.

532
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,720
I think it might be a problem.

533
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,360
I heard that he wants
to relocate Shen Ruoxin

534
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,520
to his department.

535
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,160
That Shen Ruoxin

536
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,160
has been with us for so many years.

537
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,760
Considering what has happened before,

538
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,560
I'm worried that she might…

539
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
Shen Ruoxin.

540
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,840
<i>Thanks to your recommendation,</i>

541
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,360
<i>I managed to get a small job.</i>

542
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,760
<i>I just signed the contract.</i>

543
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,480
That's great.

544
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,720
<i>We should celebrate.</i>

545
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,440
<i>I'll treat you to a meal when I get paid.</i>

546
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,480
- Ruoxin?
- Yes?

547
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,680
Aren't you going home?

548
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,960
Tomorrow is the training
for the New Energy Department.

549
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,760
I need to prepare some documents.

550
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,800
You should get going.

551
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,760
It's okay. I'll stay and work overtime.

552
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,720
Don't bother.

553
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,160
Mr. Xu will go through
the itinerary with me later.

554
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
There's nothing you can do.
You can head home first.

555
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,640
- Ruoxin.
- Mr. Xu.

556
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,080
From what you just sent me,

557
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,440
the blue color
isn't the official one that we use.

558
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Is that so?

559
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,680
- Switch on the computer. I'll tell you.
- Okay.

560
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Take a look.

561
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,200
Is it the wrong color?

562
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,920
Right?

563
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,600
This.

564
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,880
Ruoxin, Mr. Xu.

565
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,719
- If there's nothing else, I'll get going.
- Okay, go ahead.

566
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,120
The chair.

567
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,719
What about this?

568
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,920
- You have to look at this.
- Okay.

569
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,719
This.

570
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,800
That's right.

571
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,040
VOCATIONAL TRAINING AT 9 A.M.,
VERY IMPORTANT

572
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,360
You can do it!

573
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,280
<i>Hello?</i>

574
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

575
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
There's some traffic.

576
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,600
I'm afraid I might be late today.

577
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,120
<i>I can postpone to 30 minutes tops.
Hurry up.</i>

578
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,240
Okay.

579
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,640
QI XIAO

580
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,280
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

581
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,320
The tunnel at East Yan'an Road
is congested today. Where are you?

582
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,680
I'm now stuck at Puxi Intersection.

583
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,200
Hold on.

584
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,600
Did you see what I sent you?

585
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,440
This is the nearest parking lot.
Try to get there and wait for me.

586
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,760
I promise to get you to work on time.

587
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,960
Be careful.

588
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,080
HAIPU CENTER REAL ESTATE PARKING LOT

589
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,400
How did you know
there's a parking lot nearby?

590
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,400
Hop on first.

591
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Thank you.

592
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,840
Here.

593
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,600
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Come on.

594
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Sit tight.

595
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,440
Zenpro,

596
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,600
as the leader of this industry,

597
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,120
we've had years of experience

598
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,280
in terms of our customer base
and after-sales services.

599
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,640
Now, we can say this with pride.

600
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,480
In terms of new energy car
core technologies,

601
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,120
we have independent
intellectual property rights.

602
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,520
At the same time, we're acknowledged

603
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,400
by the market as well as the customers.

604
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,720
In regards to the new energy cars,

605
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,760
we must mention our subsidy policy.

606
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,000
The biggest distinction
in our subsidy policy

607
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,880
is the car's endurance and battery.

608
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,560
- Ruoxin.
- Different endurance

609
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,480
and different battery densities.

610
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,360
- Are you looking at him or the slide?
- Enjoy different levels

611
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,680
of subsidy policy.

612
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,000
This subsidy policy

613
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,480
not only can it lower

614
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
the consumption threshold
for new energy cars,

615
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,640
but it will also improve our technology
research and development.

616
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,200
- Ms. Shen, can I take a look?
- Okay.

617
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,760
NEW ENERGY VEHICLES INTRODUCTION

618
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,400
ADVANTAGES: THE AVERAGE POWER
IN HYBRID VEHICLES…

619
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
You did all this research?

620
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Yes.

621
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,280
- Let's talk outside.
- Okay.

622
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,720
- Help me get my stuff.
- Okay.

623
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,560
I've been observing you.

624
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,720
In all sorts of conferences,

625
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
you always listen very carefully.

626
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,280
You even did your own research.

627
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,960
How is it?

628
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,080
What's your opinion

629
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,520
regarding the new energy?

630
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,480
Tell me about it.

631
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,920
I think the new energy
is actually quite interesting.

632
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,720
It is energy-saving
and environmentally friendly.

633
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,040
If it can be popularized,

634
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,600
it should be able to improve
the air quality in the city.

635
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,480
Think about it.

636
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,880
One day,

637
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,320
when you look up to the sky

638
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,960
you can see stars everywhere.

639
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,240
It will be just like when I was little.

640
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,280
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

641
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,520
Interesting idea.

642
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,040
It's unique.

643
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,600
All this time,

644
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,000
I've had you follow up on some work
related to the New Energy Department

645
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,800
and take a business trip.

646
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,760
I believe you must have learned a lot
regarding the new energy.

647
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,920
Our department is newly established
and we're short on staff.

648
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,840
I was thinking…

649
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Would you like

650
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,240
to officially join our department?

651
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,640
Me?

652
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,640
You.

653
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
But still, I'm a rookie
when it comes to cars.

654
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I majored in law.

655
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I'm afraid that in your department,

656
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,520
I won't be of much help
and will trouble you instead.

657
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,960
Look at the tall buildings
across the street.

658
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,480
I'm sure that many people there

659
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,000
have jobs that
they didn't major in college.

660
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,640
In the workforce,

661
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,760
every one of us is a rookie.

662
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,880
Like I said,

663
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,400
the New Energy Department
has just been set up.

664
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,120
We're all new colleagues.

665
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,360
There are lots of matters
that we need to report back on.

666
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,360
We have to coordinate
with different departments.

667
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,840
We need a "lubricant."

668
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,880
What's best is that,

669
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,680
this "lubricant"

670
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,400
is smart enough
to learn about the new energy.

671
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,000
I think you're suitable.

672
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,880
No rush.

673
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,640
Let's start with supervision.

674
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,640
Slowly,

675
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,640
blend in with our team.

676
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,960
Mr. Xu.

677
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Thank you for your trust in me.

678
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,600
But can you give me some time
to think it over?

679
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,040
Of course.

680
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,160
It's good to be cautious.

681
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,400
I'll wait for your answer.

682
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,560
<i>I think you're suitable.</i>

683
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,120
<i>Let's start with supervision.</i>

684
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,720
<i>Slowly,</i>

685
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
<i>blend in with our team.</i>

686
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,240
<i>I'll wait for your answer.</i>

687
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,040
You startled me!

688
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,160
What's on your mind?

689
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,200
Just now,

690
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,440
Mr. Xu asked us to join him
in the New Energy Department.

691
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,320
Did you agree to it?

692
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,320
No.

693
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,960
I said that I'll think it over.

694
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,600
Why are you so upset?

695
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,120
Didn't you say if we suck up to Mr. Xu,
we can stage a comeback?

696
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,280
By then,

697
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,080
you'll surely get a permanent position.

698
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,040
No.

699
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,120
Isn't our plan

700
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,760
to make use of Mr. Xu's authority
to return to the Legal Department?

701
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,880
Why are we joining
his New Energy Department?

702
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,680
In that case,

703
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,680
won't we be seeing him every day?

704
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
The Legal Department

705
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,080
is under Ruan Ye's watchful eye.

706
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,000
Recently,

707
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,280
he has been very cautious.

708
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
I can't find any loopholes anytime soon.

709
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,920
Mr. Liu is intimidated by Mr. Xu.

710
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,800
He's even more cautious now.

711
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,240
If we wish to rely on Mr. Xu
to make it back there,

712
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,760
it's unlikely to happen.

713
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,760
Actually, I think
being in the New Energy Department

714
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,280
is a good opportunity.

715
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,840
What can we do there?

716
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,720
We don't know anything about business.

717
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,760
That's not our professional field.
We can only do odd jobs there.

718
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,040
What's the difference from working
in the Administration Department?

719
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,760
Actually, I am interested
in new energy cars.

720
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,160
It's energy-saving,
environmentally friendly, and safe.

721
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,000
The future market will be huge.

722
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
That's my hunch.

723
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,760
In the future, this field will do great.

724
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Is the business promising

725
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
or that guy?

726
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,360
What did you say?

727
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Nothing.

728
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,200
Ruoxin.

729
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,200
I think, you've been
in the Legal Department for so many years

730
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,240
and you have a good foundation.

731
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,720
If you switch departments now,
it will be like starting all over again.

732
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,680
Think carefully.

733
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,480
It won't be good for your career.

734
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,240
What if Mr. Liu assigns you back
to the Legal Department? Right?

735
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,640
Hang in there.

736
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,640
Ms. Shen.

737
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,960
Mr. Liu wants to see you in his office.

738
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,040
Mr. Liu?

739
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,240
Could I be right?

740
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,920
