1
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
How did it go?

2
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,400
It's done.

3
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,240
From now on,
we don't need to organize the storage

4
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
and distribute welfare benefits anymore.

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,560
- What else?
- Also…

6
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
Finding a house for the new boss,
getting a car for him,

7
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,160
and helping out other departments
once in a while

8
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,440
will be our main focus from here on out.

9
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,680
But in terms of
our long-term positions in Administration,

10
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Ms. Li said
that she has to think about it.

11
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,560
The two of us?

12
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,320
For two months?

13
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
Long-term?

14
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,880
That means…

15
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,600
Whether or not you get
a permanent position will be up to me.

16
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,120
My goodness! Ruoxin, you're amazing!

17
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
You're tired, right?
I'll give you a massage.

18
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,120
- I'll buy you coffee later.
- What are you doing?

19
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,680
People are looking. Lower your voice.

20
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,320
Go on working. Pick a driver.

21
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,280
We still have to check the houses
for the new boss in the morning.

22
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,760
Go on.

23
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,320
How annoying.

24
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
Ms. Shen, according to your requirements,

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,240
I found you this housekeeper.

26
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,480
She has been working with us
for a long time.

27
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,800
She has good client reviews
and qualifications.

28
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,960
Don't worry.

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,800
- Hello, ma'am.
- I'm not your employer.

30
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,320
I've checked your information.

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,720
But there are some details

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,720
- that I'd like to talk to you about.
- Okay.

33
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
Your work is from Monday to Friday,

34
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
1 p.m. to 3 p.m.

35
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,440
You'll be in charge of cleaning.

36
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,000
On the last day of every month,

37
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,480
do a general cleaning
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,440
If they're at home,
we'll inform you in advance

39
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
to cancel the cleaning job that day.

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,760
The daily cleaning job
includes laundry and ironing.

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,440
The monthly cleaning
includes wiping the glass

42
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,040
and cleaning the washing machine.

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,640
- Is that okay?
- No problem.

44
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
Okay.

45
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,760
- Should I get the contract for you?
- Okay.

46
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,320
You can arrange everything well.

47
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,079
Whoever marries you in the future
is quite lucky.

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
If a guy just wants me

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,080
to lower his cost of living,

50
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,320
why would I marry him?

51
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,080
If I serve my boss in the office,
at least I'd get a raise

52
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,280
and a promotion.

53
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,200
If I must also serve my husband at home,
isn't that too tiring?

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,400
I can serve myself using that time.

55
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
Are you serious?

56
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,920
How can you say that?

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,880
What do you mean about serving people?

58
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,480
You can't be so old-fashioned

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,200
that you believe in the saying,

60
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,560
"Marriage is the tomb of love," right?

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,000
So you'll date, but not marry?

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Love is hormones plus dopamine.

63
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Marriage, just like love,

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,920
is just a gambling game.

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,040
But the game's style is different.

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,880
I'm not interested in games like that.

67
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,000
Because I'm too tired.

68
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,440
If you won't get married,
that's called celibacy.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
You won't date nor get married.
What do you call that?

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
It's not called anything.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,120
I just want to be single.

72
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
I totally agree with her.

73
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,720
If we could go 30 years back,
I wouldn't get married either.

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
Ma'am.

75
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Well, we still have other work to do.

76
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
Go home and get ready first.

77
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,480
If there are specific working hours,
we'll let you know in advance.

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
- Okay.
- Ma'am.

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
- Please come and sign here.
- Okay.

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,920
Miss, let me tell you.
It's hard being pregnant and having kids.

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,440
Thank you, ma'am.

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
Now, I know why

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,640
you want her to work
when the boss is at the office.

84
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
7 NEW NOTIFICATIONS

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,400
<i>You're a beautiful woman who can cook.</i>

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,640
<i>Can I eat there?</i>

87
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>I'll bring my own chopsticks.
You don't have to prepare them.</i>

88
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,040
<i>No wonder we can't get you
and Zou Cheng to go on trips anymore.</i>

89
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,320
<i>You're having a sweet time at home.</i>

90
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,640
<i>Zou Cheng is so lucky.</i>

91
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,040
<i>He's pampered by your cooking every day.</i>

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,600
<i>Of course.</i>

93
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,520
Hey, honey.

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,280
What time do you get off work?

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,000
I have a surprise tonight.

96
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,040
Honey.

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,360
I forgot to tell you
as I was too busy earlier.

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,400
As I was about to leave the office,

99
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,720
a company suddenly backed out
from signing a contract with us.

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
<i>My boss told me
to make a short trip to talk to them.</i>

101
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm sorry, honey.

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
I won't be back for dinner.

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,880
It's not the first time this has happened.

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,520
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

105
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,120
I've been cooking up a storm
all afternoon.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
All right.

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
I know it's all my fault.

108
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,760
I promise.

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,680
It won't happen again.

110
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm driving. I have to go.

111
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,240
<i>Here are the snapshots.
I'm already drooling.</i>

112
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
<i>Please check.</i>

113
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
<i>Honey.</i>

114
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,480
<i>Keep the leftovers in the fridge.</i>

115
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
<i>I'll eat them tomorrow.</i>

116
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,120
<i>Zou Cheng, how can you leave
Ziyan's love in the fridge overnight?</i>

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,160
Ms. Shen, it's hard to fulfill

118
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,120
all your requirements.

119
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,040
Am I right?

120
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,240
The areas you saw earlier
basically fit your requirements.

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,880
As you know, this is a prime location.
Every space counts.

122
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,120
The developer built the units closely
to make more money. That's normal.

123
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,320
But there's an advantage.
We have a posh club.

124
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,480
It will be convenient for you
to gather with friends.

125
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
How about this?

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
Can you talk to your boss about it?

127
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,160
If it's okay, decide on it.

128
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,840
That would be good for both of us, right?

129
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,840
It really won't do.

130
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
He requested it clearly.

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,040
I can't just let him make do with it.

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,840
Xiaoyu, please help us, okay?

133
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,400
Recommend more units.

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
Ms. Shen, please understand me.

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Our work isn't easy.

136
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,360
Today, I've shown you four units,

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,400
and you don't like them. Aren't you tired?

138
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,760
We're all tired, Xiaoyu.

139
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,400
We both work for others.

140
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920
Let's be considerate to each other, okay?

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,880
Help us out.

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,320
Okay.

143
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,320
- Thank you, Xiaoyu.
- It's fine.

144
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,440
I'll text you
if I find something suitable.

145
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,920
Okay, I'll wait for your call.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,240
Okay, I'll get going then.

147
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
Thank you, Xiaoyu.

148
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,039
- Thank you.
- I'll go ahead.

149
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,520
What if we don't find anything
that fits all the requirements?

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,760
There are three more units, right?

151
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's see after we see those.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
How did you know that I took these?

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,160
As an assistant,

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm very professional

156
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
and hardworking, okay?

157
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,480
And I always bring this with me.

158
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm afraid you'd have low blood sugar
if you're too busy to eat.

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
Hello?

160
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>Hello?</i>

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,960
What's the matter? Are you feeling down?

162
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,960
My goodness.

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,320
I just said "hello,"
and you can tell that I'm feeling down?

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Are you a mind reader?

165
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,360
<i>Of course.</i>

166
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,400
Other than your parents,

167
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,200
I know you even better
than your husband does.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,000
I have a lot of delicious food.
You can eat them. Come here.

169
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
What's the matter?

170
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,280
You're offering me
someone else's gift again?

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,960
Is Zou Cheng on a business trip again?

172
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,360
You're talking so much
even when I feed you good food.

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,800
Half an hour.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,040
Dinner is ready.

175
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't need the chocolate, thank you.

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,280
You can go home now.

177
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,880
You're unhappy to get off work?

178
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,960
No.

179
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,040
I've been running around with you all day.

180
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,200
As my boss,

181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,640
you won't provide my dinner?

182
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,040
I'm having dinner with my best friend.

183
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
Why should you come?

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,920
But you did a good job today.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,680
And you've worked hard.
I'll reimburse you for dinner tonight.

186
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,960
Just walk around

187
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,080
and see what you can eat, okay?

188
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,680
It's not fun to eat alone.

189
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,040
Isn't it more boring if you eat with me?

190
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,200
You didn't eat much hot pot last time.

191
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,880
It's such a good hot pot place.

192
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,920
What a waste.

193
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,440
I'll get going.

194
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,560
By the way,

195
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,760
100 yuan is the maximum amount.

196
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,920
Anything over that is on you.

197
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,800
What a cheapskate.

198
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,920
Enough. I can't eat anymore.

199
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,440
Every time you're in a bad mood,
I get fat.

200
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,800
Who says I'm in a bad mood?

201
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm eating with you. I'm so happy.

202
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,960
Eat up. Finish everything.

203
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Don't leave anything.

204
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
Am I here to clean your house?

205
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,160
Doesn't Zou Cheng go
on business trips all the time?

206
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
Shouldn't you be used to it by now?

207
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,200
Why are you mad today?

208
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,240
He should have told me earlier.

209
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,400
If I hadn't called him,

210
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,880
he would only tell me
when he gets to the hotel.

211
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,600
Isn't it the same
no matter when he tells you?

212
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,120
He must still go on a business trip.

213
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,240
You just don't understand
what we go through at work.

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,960
It's not that I don't want
to understand him.

215
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,440
But when he's on a business trip,
his EQ is gone as well.

216
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,320
Why did he reply in WeChat Moments?

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,320
Now, everyone knows that my husband
doesn't care about me anymore.

218
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm telling you.

219
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,320
It's actually a good thing.

220
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,440
You know why?

221
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Having a low EQ means
that he can't fool you.

222
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,240
You don't have to worry
about him cheating on you, right?

223
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,240
- Get out.
- Okay.

224
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
He was better off
when he didn't get promoted.

225
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,080
After becoming
the vice president of this mall,

226
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,720
he often goes on business trips.

227
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,160
It has been a while since
we spent some quality time together.

228
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,360
If we finally eat out,

229
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,720
go shopping, or watch a movie,

230
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
whatever we do,

231
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,800
he's always on his phone
talking about work.

232
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,200
I think

233
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
his phone is much prettier
and more important than me.

234
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,960
His boss pays him.

235
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
Do you pay him?

236
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,520
You've been married for five years.

237
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,240
What were you doing
in the first four years?

238
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
You were traveling all over the world.

239
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,080
Did he say anything?

240
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,720
He just silently backed you up.

241
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,440
He always supported you.

242
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
He's so focused on work.

243
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,760
He's just letting you wait a bit now.

244
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
Why are you complaining?

245
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
You're being too dramatic.

246
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,040
I'm your best friend.
I'm telling you the truth.

247
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,360
Sir, do you want hot pot?
Authentic Chengdu hot pot.

248
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,200
If you can't eat spicy food,
we have two-sided soup bases,

249
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
mushrooms and tomato soup bases.

250
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,280
Who said I can't eat spicy food?

251
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
A table for one.

252
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
Sir, may I take your order?

253
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes.

254
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,120
I'll have

255
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,080
the ultra-spicy hot pot.

256
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
Sir, our ultra-spicy hot pot

257
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,720
is very spicy.

258
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,520
If you want to practice eating spicy food,

259
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
- I suggest taking it step--
- There's no need.

260
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,440
I don't need to do it step by step.

261
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,120
I want to seize the day

262
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
and do it in one go.

263
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Serve it, thank you.

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,560
Ultra-spicy butter soup base.

265
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,320
Sir, your order is complete.

266
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,920
Your ultra-spicy hot pot

267
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,040
is just okay.

268
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,160
It's not that spicy.

269
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay, please wait a moment.

270
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,080
Hello, sir.

271
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,440
According to our waitress,

272
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,400
you don't think it's spicy enough?

273
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,040
It's indeed average.

274
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,160
I got it, sir.
I'll surely fulfill your request.

275
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Try it, sir.

276
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,160
This is our special
explosively spicy hot pot.

277
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you.

278
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,880
One last thing,

279
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,160
we have a new boss lately.

280
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,400
He's the head of the new
New Energy Department.

281
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,360
His first stop is the East China region.

282
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,600
He'll test the waters
and expand the market.

283
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,000
And he wants to form a new sales team.

284
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,480
Before then, our Sales Department

285
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,160
must be consolidated and compressed

286
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,120
to get ready for the new department.

287
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
Any questions?

288
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
Mr. Liu.

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,240
Are you laying people off?

290
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
What are the criteria
for consolidation then?

291
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,400
I understand how you all feel.

292
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,280
You guys are long-time employees

293
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
who worked hard with me for so many years.

294
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,360
But the group is doing this

295
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,960
for the development of the new business.

296
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,440
To be fair,

297
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,040
the group will launch
a forced ranking system.

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,400
The evaluation for this quarter
will be released soon.

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
I'm sure you know very well

300
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,240
who'll stay and go.

301
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,000
I won't mention your names here.

302
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Sign it.

303
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,840
EMPLOYEE CONFIRMATION NOTICE

304
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,000
Sign it.

305
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,520
SIGNATURE

306
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,040
See you on the rooftop.

307
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm finally a regular employee!

308
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,200
This is great.

309
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,160
We must eat a good meal this weekend

310
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,480
and celebrate.

311
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,720
Ruoxin, you, me, and--

312
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,160
And Su Yang.

313
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
You know me.

314
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,880
I heard Ruoxin took care of this for you.

315
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,480
I think so.

316
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,560
I saw her go
into Ruan Ye's office that day.

317
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,960
After she came out,

318
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,400
Ruan Ye asked me to see him

319
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,920
and asked me
about Kelai Enterprise's contract.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And he told me to brief him

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,360
on what I've been doing
in the last two years.

322
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,720
Then I came out.

323
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,120
It was so sudden.

324
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
I couldn't think straight back then.

325
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
I was so scared.

326
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,160
I was worried that I didn't do well.

327
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
Look.

328
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,240
Did you ask what Ruoxin
and Ruan Ye talked about?

329
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,480
I was embarrassed to ask.

330
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,880
As you know,

331
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
Ruan Ye pushed Ruoxin out.

332
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
When she was transferred
to Administration,

333
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,240
she didn't give in
and asked for consideration.

334
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,040
For my sake, she even went
to ask Ruan Ye for consideration.

335
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,480
I feel too embarrassed.

336
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm finally a regular employee.

337
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,640
I don't know how to repay her.

338
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,600
Don't worry.

339
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,760
Ruoxin told me the other day
that she was on a debate team before.

340
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,160
She never lost an argument.

341
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,120
So I think

342
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,880
Ruoxin must have given Ruan Ye a mouthful.

343
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Really? Then…

344
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
That's great.

345
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,360
But you just said you want
to repay Ruoxin.

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
Do you mean it?

347
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,040
Of course.

348
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,840
You guys can choose where we'll eat.

349
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,920
I'm prepared to shell out
one month's salary.

350
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,640
Two months.

351
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
Eating is so boring.

352
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,760
What's not boring then?

353
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,320
You're with Ruoxin daily.

354
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,320
I'll do as you say.

355
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,040
I have a great idea.

356
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,200
<i>Ruoxin.</i>

357
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,600
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

358
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,560
FROM CUI LIXIN

359
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
<i>Instead of getting laid off,
I'll just quit on my own</i>

360
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>and save my dignity.</i>

361
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,880
<i>Thank you as well</i>

362
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120
<i>for preserving my dignity back then.</i>

363
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,520
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

364
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,480
<i>Until we meet again.</i>

365
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,040
The interior design looks very elegant.

366
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,200
It was exquisitely designed.
You can move in directly.

367
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
The layout is very nice too.

368
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,200
Ms. Shen.

369
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,600
I've shown you all the houses in Shanghai

370
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
that suit your needs.

371
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
If this one still won't do,

372
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,280
I won't be able to find
a more suitable one.

373
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
It's a nice place.

374
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,440
Really?

375
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
I knew you would like it.

376
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,640
I'm not the one moving in.

377
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,880
It doesn't matter
whether I like it or not.

378
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,200
The point is that
it fits all the requirements.

379
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Prepare the contract.

380
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,400
Okay, I'll go get it. It's in the car.

381
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,160
I'll go get it.

382
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,440
We managed to solve a big problem.

383
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
Can we go home now?

384
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,440
Do you have plans?

385
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,840
Ruoxin, it's the weekend.

386
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,920
Okay, go ahead.

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,400
I don't have plans.

388
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,120
But I'm working overtime

389
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,480
without overtime pay.

390
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,040
Can you compensate me in another way?

391
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,680
- You want compensation?
- Yes.

392
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,280
The biggest compensation would be

393
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,280
to buy you a meal.

394
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
At most, you'll get to choose where to go.

395
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,080
Who wants to eat?

396
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,720
I want you to go somewhere with me.

397
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,320
Where?

398
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
You'll see when we get there.

399
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,040
JINJIANG ACTION PARK

400
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,200
You're all grown up.
You still come to such a childish place?

401
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,560
Yes.

402
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,400
Someone wouldn't go home
and insisted on coming here before.

403
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,400
They were closed,
so she was mad and wouldn't leave.

404
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,440
I'm curious as well

405
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,760
how much fun it is inside.

406
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,360
You're not talking about me, right?

407
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
Since you're here, just enjoy it.

408
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,960
Relax a bit.

409
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,080
Ruoxin.

410
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,200
Hi.

411
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,120
Ruoxin.

412
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,160
I already bought the tickets.

413
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm finally a regular employee.

414
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,400
I don't know

415
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,400
what you told Mr. Ruan that day.

416
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,960
However,

417
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
- thank you.
- Stop scaring me, will you?

418
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,680
Work hard in the Legal Department.

419
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,880
Don't worry, Ruoxin.

420
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
I won't embarrass you.

421
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,800
All right. If you go on, Sijia will cry.

422
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,560
Let's go and enjoy ourselves.

423
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,200
Come on. Let's enjoy ourselves.

424
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,880
JINJIANG ACTION PARK

425
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,400
- Two.
- Okay.

426
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,520
What about this?

427
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,560
This is very pretty. Do you like it?

428
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,840
- Take it if you like it.
- I'll pay.

429
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
I like him.

430
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,160
It's very obvious. I can tell.

431
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,240
What do you like about him?

432
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,680
He's handsome.

433
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,120
I used to be a cheerleader in school.

434
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Qi Xiao was on the basketball team.

435
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,760
After a game,

436
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,720
we all went to sing karaoke together.

437
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,560
Su Yang sang

438
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
"The Waves" by Huang Pinyuan.

439
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,120
He sang it so emotionally.

440
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,560
It was really nice.

441
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
That moment

442
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,520
touched my heart.

443
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,040
That's it?

444
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,280
You saw him sing a song in a karaoke bar?

445
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,600
And when he sang,

446
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,080
his eyes were a bit sad,

447
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,440
but they were shining.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,600
It feels like there's a story behind it.

449
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,840
At that moment,
I thought that he must be very kind.

450
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
I want to get to know him.

451
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,200
It's so good to be young.

452
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Ruoxin, help me analyze it.

453
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,760
Do you think

454
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
Su Yang likes me?

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,560
I don't have much contact with him,
but I think he…

456
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,720
He seems introverted.

457
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,840
So his feelings must be bottled up inside.

458
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
Yes, that's the kind of guy he is.

459
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,400
But I think

460
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,040
he likes me too.

461
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,760
I went back to school
with Qi Xiao a few weeks ago.

462
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,560
When I saw Su Yang again,

463
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,880
I sat on the lawn
and watched the moon with him.

464
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,760
Then he added a cat

465
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,120
looking at the moon in his webtoons.

466
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,880
I think that cat is me.

467
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,400
Ruoxin, do you know
that Su Yang draws webtoons?

468
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,960
He has ongoing serial webtoons
that are especially good.

469
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,400
I'll find the website link

470
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,400
and send it to you.

471
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,440
I've sent it. Remember to check it out.

472
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
You're so blinded by love.

473
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll go ahead.

474
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Thank you.

475
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's ride the Ferris wheel.

476
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,120
Eating ice cream

477
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,280
while looking at the view is so romantic.

478
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,840
Okay.

479
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,720
Here.

480
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,640
Thank you.

481
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
Dating a boy

482
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
and dating a man is so different.

483
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,760
How so?

484
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,760
You don't have to be particular
about dressing up,

485
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,240
and you don't have to eat expensive food.

486
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,480
Ice cream will do.

487
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,920
When did they start dating?

488
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
Why didn't I know about this?

489
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,920
I don't think they're dating yet.

490
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,960
However,

491
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,640
I think they will be
after riding the Ferris wheel.

492
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
What do you mean?

493
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,520
Why?

494
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,360
What's so magical about the Ferris wheel?

495
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,200
Who knows?

496
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,760
What are you doing?

497
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,600
Don't join them.

498
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Let them be.

499
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,640
You are playing Cupid.

500
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,640
<i>From here,</i>

501
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,160
the view is really amazing.

502
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,880
Yes, it's very nice.

503
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,840
Isn't it?

504
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,840
Su Yang.

505
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,520
Have you ever rode a Ferris wheel
with a girlfriend before?

506
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,880
I've always been single.

507
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,440
Don't you have a girl you like?

508
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,480
I still don't know
if I can settle down in Shanghai.

509
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm even relying on Qi Xiao
to share the rent.

510
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,120
So I think

511
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,840
I can't afford to date yet.

512
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
I think you're overthinking it.

513
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,040
If you like someone,
it has nothing to do with

514
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,680
whether you are employed,
what your job is, and how much you make.

515
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
If you like someone,

516
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,040
just looking at him

517
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,360
would make you feel so happy.

518
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,080
No matter how unhappy you are,

519
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,640
it will eventually go away.

520
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,120
Su Yang.

521
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,520
When I look at you,

522
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
I feel very happy.

523
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
What about you?

524
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,000
Does it make you happy
when you look at me?

525
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,440
I have to think about it.

526
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,720
You don't even know
if you're happy or not?

527
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,240
You must still think about it?

528
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,360
Here.

529
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,960
Thank you.

530
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,800
Do you think Su Yang likes Sijia a lot?

531
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,080
Sijia is so cute.

532
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,320
He probably doesn't think
that he's good enough

533
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,360
to deserve Sijia.

534
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,680
Do kids nowadays think that much?

535
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,160
Why do you always speak
like you're a middle-aged woman?

536
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,440
You keep saying "kids."

537
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,920
Su Yang is not a kid.

538
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm not a kid either.

539
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,280
Fine. You're all adults who can date.

540
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,520
Now, those born in 1995
are already working.

541
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,080
In the future, tell me in advance

542
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,640
if you have a date with our girlfriend.

543
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
I'll consider giving you a leave.

544
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
What girlfriend?

545
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,560
Did you forget?

546
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,920
When we first met
with the hospital fruit basket?

547
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,960
What happened? Did you get her back?

548
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,240
She's not my girlfriend.

549
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,440
Her name's Luoluo.

550
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,320
She's my partner for our online shop.

551
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Then she took our deposit and left.

552
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,400
I finally found her that day.

553
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,760
Why did you stop me that day?

554
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
I misunderstood.

555
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,720
Sijia.

556
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,240
If I can't get a job
in Shanghai within a year,

557
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,240
I must go back
and take the civil service exam.

558
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,360
So when that time comes,
perhaps the happier I am now,

559
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,360
the more I'll be sad then.

560
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,400
So being happy isn't enough
when you like someone.

561
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
What if you find a job within a year

562
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,800
and you can stay in Shanghai?

563
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,040
Will you be happy when you look at me?

564
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,120
It hasn't happened yet.

565
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,560
It's no use thinking about it.

566
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,720
Let's make a pinky promise.

567
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,000
If you find a job within a year

568
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,280
and you can stay in Shanghai,

569
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,480
let's come here again.

570
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,520
Then you'll have to look me
in the eye and tell me

571
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
if you're happy or not,
or if you feel particularly happy.

572
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,400
Come on.

573
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,480
Hurry.

574
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,160
Su Yang, I'm sure you will find a job.

575
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
You're very capable.

576
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,280
And I'm sure

577
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,640
more people will see your talent.

578
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,280
Just don't give up.

579
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,400
Look at me.
I'm a regular employee now, right?

580
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,240
Thank you, Sijia.

581
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,080
I won't give up.

582
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,720
It's so nice. Let's take a photo.

583
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,920
Do a finger heart.

584
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,120
Let's make a face.

585
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,840
Come on.

586
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
It's not ugly enough.

587
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,960
Come on.

588
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
What happened to your shop?

589
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,360
We can only close down for a while.

590
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,640
At least I don't need to rush things.

591
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,560
I can make some nice designs.

592
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,240
When I have the energy and money,

593
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,560
I'll open it again.

594
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
Designs?

595
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,880
What kind of shop is it?

596
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
I make original bracelets.

597
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,640
I remember now.

598
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,680
You created the design

599
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,640
for Jin Yuanhao's case?

600
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,160
What's the matter?

601
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,960
A man can't design jewelry?

602
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,720
So many famous jewelry designers are men.

603
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,160
I didn't say that men can't be designers.

604
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
But you like designing so much.

605
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,920
Why didn't you major in design back then

606
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,080
and study law?

607
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,920
After my dad passed away,
I'm the one taking care of my mom.

608
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,720
It would be hard to find a job
if I study design.

609
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
So I studied law back then.

610
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,920
Back then, my mom especially liked
watching <i>The File of Justice</i>.

611
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,560
She was imagining me
wearing a wig in court daily.

612
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,680
Your mom is quite funny.

613
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,200
However,

614
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,200
I didn't expect

615
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,640
that you're quite responsible.

616
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,360
You're a man.

617
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,960
What about you? Why did you study law?

618
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
It's not just to get a job easily, is it?

619
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,320
Actually, for my NCEE application,

620
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,600
I wanted to study astronomy.

621
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,200
However,

622
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,160
my mom insisted that I study law.

623
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,160
My mom said,
"Why do you want to study astronomy?

624
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,760
After you graduate,

625
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,160
do you want to starve?"

626
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,960
Your mom is so harsh.

627
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,920
Now, I know where you got
your talent in debating.

628
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,720
The last person I want to be is my mom.

629
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Let's not talk about that.

630
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Tell me.

631
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
You're so competent.

632
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,160
Why didn't you become a lawyer?

633
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,360
If you go to court,

634
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,600
you would surely be very cool.

635
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,720
When I first graduated,
I wanted to work in a law firm too.

636
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,680
But my mom said,

637
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,480
"It's too exhausting
to work at a law firm.

638
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,600
And after getting used
to the dark side of the world,

639
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,840
you would have a twisted mind.

640
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,160
It will be hard for you to date."

641
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,080
That's why she forced me
to work in a company's Legal Department.

642
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,640
I get it now.
Your mom interferes in everything.

643
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,400
My mom doesn't interfere at all.

644
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,000
That's why I must
make decisions for myself.

645
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,200
That's great.

646
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
You can do whatever you want.

647
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,760
Unlike me.

648
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,800
My mom is still keeping an eye on me now.

649
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
I can tell.

650
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,960
You're struggling to fight

651
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,440
for your independence.

652
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,440
<i>- One without an eye
- One without an eye</i>

653
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,520
<i>- One without an ear
- One without an ear</i>

654
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,040
<i>- How strange
- How strange</i>

655
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,960
Good.

656
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,520
- Good job, Xiaoxin.
- A round of applause.

657
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,320
Uncle, give me the phone.

658
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,160
- I'll show you something fun.
- Okay.

659
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll give you the phone. Here.

660
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,480
Zou Cheng.

661
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,280
When are you going
to have your own child with Ziyan?

662
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Mom, I'm so busy.

663
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,800
How can we find time for that?

664
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,560
You're not free, but Ziyan is, right?

665
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,560
She just stays at home now.

666
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,760
It's the perfect timing.

667
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,080
With a child,
the vibe at home would be different.

668
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Mom.

669
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,960
How many times have I told you?

670
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
I don't want kids.

671
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,600
The two of us are doing well now.

672
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,400
If you really want more people at home,

673
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,560
ask Zou Ying
to bring Xiaoxin here more often.

674
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,880
Xiaoxin is good,

675
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,720
but his surname isn't Zou.

676
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,360
All right.

677
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Let me ask you a more personal question.

678
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,080
Neither of you wants kids.

679
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,719
Do you really not want one,
or are you unable to have one?

680
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,679
Is the problem on your side or hers?

681
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,120
Mom.

682
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,080
We're both fine.

683
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,080
I really don't want to have one.

684
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,560
Here. Have some fruits.

685
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,520
I told you not to play with the phone.

686
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,199
Why are you playing with it again?
Give it back.

687
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,880
It's fine. Let him play on the weekend.

688
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,400
He's bored when we chat.

689
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,600
You're the best, Uncle.
You're the worst, Mom.

690
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,639
Xiaoxin, I have a call.

691
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,600
I'll take this first.
You can play with it later.

692
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
Have some fruits. Come on.

693
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,120
Come, Xiaoxin.

694
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,560
I brought you some fruits.

695
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,719
Which one do you want?

696
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,440
Okay.

697
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Great. Xiaoxin can speak English so well.

698
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,080
Xiaoxin, let me tell you.

699
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,240
If you eat your fruits properly,

700
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,200
I'll consider letting you borrow my phone.

701
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
Okay.

702
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,560
You're amazing. Take it.

703
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,800
Ziyan.

704
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,840
This is nothing new.

705
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,600
I want to ask you.

706
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,840
When will you have a child of your own?

707
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,840
- Mother, Zou Cheng said--
- "Zou Cheng said."

708
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,360
You always say "Zou Cheng said."

709
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,840
Let me ask you.

710
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,200
If Zou Cheng really told you something,

711
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
would you listen?

712
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,160
You two are saying the same thing.

713
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,160
A few years back,

714
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,760
you said, "We don't want kids."

715
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,880
Okay, keep on delaying it.

716
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,880
When you get to 40 or 50 years old,

717
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
if Zou Cheng tells you,

718
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
"I want a child of our own,"

719
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,880
can you give him one?

720
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,320
Will you be able to?

721
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
There are some things

722
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
that men can delay,

723
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,680
but women cannot.

724
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,440
A few years ago,

725
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,800
when you first got married,

726
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,400
you kept traveling.

727
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,840
"We don't want kids."

728
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,800
Fine.

729
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,920
No kids.

730
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,240
You don't want one.

731
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,240
I kept my mouth shut.

732
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,000
Because back then, I wanted to see

733
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,200
if you'd be able to sustain your marriage.

734
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,720
Yes, you've changed in the past two years.

735
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
You're staying at home now.

736
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,120
You act like a wife now.

737
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,320
You know how to clean and cook
and wait for Zou Cheng to go home.

738
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,960
Isn't this a good time?

739
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,360
You should have a baby soon.

740
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
Mom.

741
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,240
Let's eat out today. Don't cook at home.

742
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,440
Why should we eat out
when we're done cooking?

743
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,360
Go ahead if you want to. I'll stay home.

744
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,920
What did your mom mean
when she said those things earlier?

745
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,760
She's old. She wants a grandchild.

746
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,240
She wants us to have a kid.

747
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,120
Don't your parents do the same?

748
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,640
I protected you, didn't I?

749
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm not talking about that.

750
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,240
She said I didn't act like a wife
a few years back.

751
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,280
She even thought

752
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,240
that we might get separated,
so it was fine to not have a kid.

753
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,480
Let me ask you.

754
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,000
When I was traveling a few years ago,
was she hoping that we'd get a divorce?

755
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,640
It's all in the past now.
Why are you bringing that up?

756
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,040
You're just giving yourself a hard time.

757
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
Didn't my mom tell you?

758
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,680
You've done well in the past year.

759
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,560
I did well?

760
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,640
Was I doing it for her?

761
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,560
Does your mom always sow discord
between us?

762
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,240
What are you saying?

763
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,440
You're married to me,

764
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,080
not my mom.

765
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,680
What's important is what I think, right?

766
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,800
Okay, let me ask you then.

767
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,960
What are your thoughts?

768
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,720
I think that in the past year,

769
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,120
for me and our family,

770
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,560
you stayed home.

771
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,200
I'm so happy.

772
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,560
I'm very grateful.

773
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm thinking that my years
of waiting have paid off.

774
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,720
Our family

775
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,040
is becoming more
and more like a normal one.

776
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,160
What do you mean?

777
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,360
It wasn't normal before?

778
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,680
Zou Cheng.

779
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,440
Didn't you tell me this?

780
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,720
You'll bear the shackles, I'll be free.

781
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,160
I'll be free on your behalf.

782
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,200
I did tell you that.

783
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
However,

784
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,560
people and things change, right?

785
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,240
Ziyan.

786
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,560
We'll both

787
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,040
be 35 soon.

788
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,280
I don't think we should act
like kids anymore.

789
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,640
We must learn to be adults.

790
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,960
Based on what you're saying,

791
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,800
you actually agree with your mom, right?

792
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,760
Are you also having second thoughts
about not having kids?

793
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,360
Indeed, these days,

794
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,960
I want to have a child.

795
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,560
But I'll protect you from my mom.

796
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,960
We both agreed not to have kids before.

797
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
I'll repeat myself.

798
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,840
People and things

799
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,200
always change.

800
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,720
I'll keep waiting for you.

801
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,640
You can wait.

802
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,720
That sounds nice.

803
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,920
In the end,
you still want me to have kids, right?

804
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,440
If you don't want to have one,

805
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,600
let's hold off for now.

806
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,600
Mr. Liu.

807
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,280
I need to consult you

808
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,280
regarding the new energy car
launch tomorrow.

809
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,720
The exhibition platform is almost done.

810
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,600
But we don't have enough people
in the PR Department.

811
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,880
Ms. Li.

812
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,240
Can the Administration Department
please help us out?

813
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,520
Sure.

814
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,800
I'll give you two people. Is that enough?

815
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,760
Yes. Thank you, Ms. Li.

816
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,360
Thank you.

817
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,720
Mr. Liu.

818
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,960
I have another question.

819
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,160
The press release Mr. Xu sent

820
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,880
states that this launch

821
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,920
is a "Strategic Transition
of Zenpro Automotive's New Business."

822
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,840
- That line--
- Remove that.

823
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,480
Transition?

824
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,680
A new energy car is just a trend.

825
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,800
After the trend changes in two years,
won't we still do what we must do?

826
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,800
When I started selling
gasoline cars in Zenpro,

827
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,040
Xu Minjie was just a toddler.

828
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,560
Electric cars?

829
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,480
Ruan Ye, will you buy an electric car?

830
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,480
What am I buying?

831
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
An electric toy?

832
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,920
Men…

833
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,880
must have a mechanical watch

834
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,680
to show their status.

835
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,280
If you buy an electric car,

836
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,440
aside from showing that you're poor

837
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,400
and can't bid for a license plate
in Shanghai, what else can it show?

838
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,640
Electric car.

839
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,840
That's interesting.

840
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,560
You're so honest.

841
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
You're sharp-tongued.

842
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,000
So Mr. Liao,
the Sales Department needs to know this.

843
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,160
Though tomorrow
is the new energy car launch,

844
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,440
this season, we're still mainly promoting
the gasoline cars we mentioned earlier.

845
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,840
I don't care what you do.

846
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,840
Gasoline car sales must hit
a new high this quarter.

847
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,320
Don't worry.

848
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,080
The East China region

849
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,120
is working hard with Mr. Liu.

850
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,600
We must teach Mr. Xu a lesson.

851
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,600
He can't be too cocky

852
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,200
since he's from the headquarters.

853
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,760
Don't underestimate him either.

854
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,080
He's the youngest partner
in the headquarters.

855
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,480
He invested in the company.
He must be competent.

856
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,080
Otherwise, the chairman
wouldn't value him so much

857
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,680
and let him handle the new energy piece.

858
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,320
The East China region is his first stop.

859
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,760
If he can't succeed

860
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,760
in this region,

861
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,600
the new energy project
will be considered a failure.

862
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
So he'll surely come in strong.

863
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,320
- Is Xu Minjie already in Shanghai?
- Not yet.

864
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,720
His secretary said he'll arrive
in Shanghai tomorrow morning,

865
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,640
then go straight to the product launch.

866
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
Xu Minjie is quite difficult to deal with.

867
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,160
His housing requirements

868
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,200
didn't even fit an A4-sized paper.

869
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
My goodness.

870
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,880
Even so,

871
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,760
we must face him.

872
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,720
Let me remind you.

873
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,480
Based on the company's ranking,

874
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
he's half a level higher than me.

875
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,360
A new broom sweeps clean.

876
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,600
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

877
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,960
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

878
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,560
We're all experienced.

879
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,920
If he wants trouble,

880
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,960
we will fan the flames.

881
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,280
Thank you, Ms. Li.

882
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,920
The lease contract your company drew up

883
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
has a lot of problematic clauses.

884
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,480
Ms. Shen, this is the situation.

885
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,280
Our contract was made
by professional and experienced lawyers

886
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,600
in the country.

887
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,360
It's a standard contract.

888
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,720
<i>We're a legitimate company too.</i>

889
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,680
If you want to revise the terms,

890
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,360
I don't think it will be easy.

891
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,000
If you say that,

892
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,240
I'll have to find
a new real estate agency.

893
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,400
No, don't.

894
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,080
We'll revise it.

895
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,280
Let's discuss
what you want to change, okay?

896
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,680
I'll revise them
and send them to you as soon as I can.

897
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,040
<i>I had a fight with Zou Cheng yesterday.</i>

898
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,240
<i>I'm so annoyed.
I'll go to your place after work.</i>

899
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,400
<i>I'll let you know when I'm on my way.</i>

900
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,280
There's a press conference
for the new energy car tomorrow.

901
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,880
It's an important event for the group.

902
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,600
You can say that
it's of utmost importance.

903
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,840
There must be no mistakes.

904
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,560
The whole PR team is there now.

905
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,120
Let's help them out too.

906
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,160
Ruoxin and Qi Xiao.

907
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,040
- Go and help them.
- Ms. Li.

908
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm dealing with Mr. Xu's lease now.

909
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,720
I have a few problems to take care of.

910
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,160
Ruoxin.

911
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,160
You're a long-time employee.

912
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,160
You know what utmost
importance means, don't you?

913
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,080
There are priorities in things, right?

914
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,800
It's the first big event
of the New Energy Department.

915
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,160
The group already told us

916
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,080
that "every resource must support it."

917
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,200
Do you understand?

918
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Ms. Li, I'm not trying to evade my work.

919
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,720
However,

920
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,880
the lease is also an urgent matter.

921
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,840
Can we send someone else first?

922
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,320
Ms. Zhang is already there.
You two should go too.

923
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,760
Right now.

924
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,160
I'll go ahead. Revise the contract first.

925
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,680
- I'll go there once I'm done.
- Okay.

926
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,440
