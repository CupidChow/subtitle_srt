1
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,720
Sir!

2
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Why are you still here?

3
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Is there a blackout?

4
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,600
It must have been the typhoon.
You should go.

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,320
I can't afford for anything to happen.

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
Sir, let me in for a while.

7
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,880
- There is still an employee inside.
- Then call them.

8
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Her phone is off. She just had surgery.

9
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,200
I'm worried about her.

10
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Let me check inside.

11
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,680
I'll check the windows
and doors too. Okay?

12
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
It's too dangerous
in this weather. So, no.

13
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Sir, help me out.

14
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
What if something happens to someone here?

15
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Do me a favor, will you? Please, sir.

16
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,480
You're putting me
in a very difficult position.

17
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,240
Help me out.

18
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
Thank you, sir.

19
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
I'm telling you.

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,680
The elevators are down.

21
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,240
You'll have to take the stairs.

22
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,560
- Be quick. Don't cause any trouble.
- Okay.

23
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
Thank you, sir.

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Shen Ruoxin!

25
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,480
Shen Ruoxin!

26
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,600
Shen Ruoxin!

27
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,760
Shen Ruoxin!

28
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Shen Ruoxin!

29
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
Shen Ruoxin!

30
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
Shen Ruoxin!

31
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Qi Xiao.

32
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
Shen Ruoxin!

33
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
I'm here!

34
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
AUTOMATIC DOOR

35
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,960
Qi Xiao.

36
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,920
What was that earlier?

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
What are you doing here?

38
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,080
You said you had to move stuff.
Then I couldn't reach you!

39
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,480
It's so windy.
You have no idea how worried I was!

40
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
My phone's battery died.

41
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,200
I had to move upstairs in a hurry.

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,880
I couldn't find the charger.

43
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,560
When I could finally recharge it,

44
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,040
the power went out.

45
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,400
I said I'll do it!

46
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Why didn't you listen?
Why do you have to do it yourself?

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
I was just anxious!

48
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,480
I thought the movers
should move everything

49
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,400
before the typhoon comes!

50
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,560
Otherwise, it's dangerous
to leave it outside.

51
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,560
Is it not dangerous for you?
Do you value money over your life?

52
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm tired enough, Qi Xiao.

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
Can you stop yelling at me?

54
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm fine now.

55
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm fine. Don't worry.

56
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
You have no idea how scared I was.

57
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,640
It's raining outside.

58
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,320
The wind is so strong.

59
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,360
I knew you would try to move those things.

60
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,920
I was worried that you might fall.

61
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
You might get a cold from the rain.

62
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,400
Your wound might open up.

63
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
All I could think about was you
passing out on the floor in pain that day.

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
I'm fine now.

65
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
Look, I'm fine.

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,640
Don't scare yourself
with your imagination.

67
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm worried about you because…

68
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,600
It's because I like you.

69
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,000
Qi Xiao, what are you talking about?

70
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Don't be ridiculous.

71
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,120
I'm not kidding.

72
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,520
I've told you before.

73
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,880
But you didn't take me seriously.

74
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,080
Believe it or not,

75
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,360
that's how I feel.

76
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,200
Ruoxin.

77
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
No.

78
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
Shen Ruoxin.

79
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,720
I like you.

80
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
I've liked you for a long time.

81
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Qi Xiao.

82
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
There are many types of affection.

83
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,559
The two of us

84
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,240
have a huge age difference.

85
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,080
Is it because

86
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,240
you work with me every day?

87
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,280
You might be confused about your feelings.

88
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,920
I know what you want to say.

89
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
But I'm an adult.

90
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,160
I know how I feel about you.

91
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
This has nothing to do with our age.

92
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,960
When you're not with me,

93
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,560
I miss you.

94
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,760
I worry about you.

95
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880
I get angry at you
for not taking care of yourself.

96
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,560
If it makes you happy,
I'll do my best to do everything I can.

97
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
When I'm with you,

98
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,960
even if we don't talk,

99
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
as long as I can sit beside you,

100
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,240
I feel at ease.

101
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm happy.

102
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
I think this is love.

103
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,760
I'm drawn to you.

104
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
Shen Ruoxin.

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What about you?

106
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Qi Xiao.

107
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
We…

108
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,960
We have too big of an age gap.

109
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
So…

110
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,760
So I…

111
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
I can't possibly…

112
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,960
Tell me yourself.

113
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,800
That you don't like me.

114
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,080
That you've never felt anything for me.

115
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,120
When you were sick and leaning on me…

116
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,280
didn't you feel anything for me?

117
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,360
When we were together every day,

118
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,280
didn't you feel anything for me either?

119
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,280
When we went stargazing together,

120
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
didn't you feel anything for me either?

121
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,400
Tell me.

122
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
I'll give up if you tell me.

123
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,520
You can't do it, can you?

124
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
I know you like me too.

125
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,680
Right?

126
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,200
Can we…

127
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,160
give it a try?

128
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
Did you just nod?

129
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,960
Is that a yes?

130
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,160
Yes.

131
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Did you agree?

132
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,400
What's wrong? Did I hurt you?

133
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
I fell when I was closing the window.

134
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,720
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,840
Don't act tough in the future.

136
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Did you eat some skewers?

137
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
The typhoon sent the files

138
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,200
all over the floor.

139
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,480
I'll go and check.

140
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,520
Stop right there, Shen Ruoxin! Stop!

141
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,600
I need to pick up the files.

142
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,200
Tell me the truth. How many did you eat?

143
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,240
I didn't eat them.

144
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,400
You didn't?

145
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,920
I could smell it. How can you deny it?

146
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
You're lying, aren't you?

147
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,560
- Don't chase me!
- Did you eat it?

148
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,920
When did you eat it?

149
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
How can a man have such long lashes?

150
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,000
Shen Ruoxin.

151
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,040
I won't ever let you go.

152
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,320
You have no idea how happy I am.

153
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,960
Last night, when I asked you
to say you don't like me,

154
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,680
I thought I was going to die.

155
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,720
I'm glad you didn't say it.

156
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,360
I'm glad you agreed.

157
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,240
You're my girlfriend now.

158
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Don't change your mind.

159
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,599
Did someone come to work this early?

160
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,320
Come, take a look.
This is our new energy vehicle.

161
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,160
Please recommend it to your children.

162
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,520
Sir, take a look
at our new energy vehicle.

163
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,840
Take a look at our new energy vehicle.

164
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
- Take a look.
- Okay.

165
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
- Look at our new energy vehicle.
- Okay.

166
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,000
Ma'am, look at our new energy vehicle.

167
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,120
This is the induction stove. Take a look.

168
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Have a look at our new energy vehicle.

169
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
- Miss.
- Yes?

170
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,040
Is this car safe?

171
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,480
Ma'am, you can try and have a seat inside.

172
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Can I?

173
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,720
- Yes.
- Sure.

174
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,040
Please go ahead.

175
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,280
This seat is comfortable.

176
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
The thing is,

177
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
my daughter is graduating from college.

178
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,520
I want to buy her a car.

179
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,880
I've been browsing for over three months.

180
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,560
I couldn't find anything suitable.

181
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,560
Ma'am,

182
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
everyone is concerned about safety.

183
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes.

184
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,200
I also drive
our company's new energy vehicle.

185
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,800
Our company's cars are highly secure,

186
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,600
drive well,

187
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,000
and have high performance.

188
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,800
If your daughter is a novice driver,

189
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
we have many other different models here.

190
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,240
You can take your time choosing.

191
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,680
My daughter is not a novice driver.

192
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,200
She used to drive her dad's car every day.

193
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,560
She's an experienced driver.

194
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,840
Miss.

195
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,360
You're quite honest.

196
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
- Unlike salesmen.
- Take a look.

197
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,320
As soon as the client comes,
they'll say anything just to make a sale.

198
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,520
- Xiaohong, hold this.
- I'll check it out.

199
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,120
Don't squat down. Get up.

200
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,920
Ma'am,

201
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,200
if you have any questions,
I can answer them for you.

202
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,960
She just recovered from an illness
and is still a bit weak.

203
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
How nice, young man.

204
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,600
Are you two dating?

205
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,680
You're quite considerate.

206
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,080
Ma'am, isn't my girlfriend pretty?

207
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,680
She's not pretty.

208
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,400
She's beautiful!

209
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,200
You have a good eye.

210
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,520
Ma'am, do you have any more questions?

211
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,640
I can help you.

212
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,480
Is it for your son or daughter?

213
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,120
- My daughter.
- I see.

214
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,200
What's wrong?

215
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,120
Are you upset?

216
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
We're in public.

217
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,000
You still need to be careful.

218
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,520
Do you want everyone to know
that I'm your girlfriend?

219
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,440
That's right.

220
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,400
I would carry around a loudspeaker

221
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
and let everyone know

222
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,280
that I have such a beautiful girlfriend.

223
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,600
Be careful.

224
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,240
Everyone comes to work around this time.

225
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,480
And I'm your boss.

226
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,520
Don't scare me.

227
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
I already know
the three couples in the company.

228
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,440
But don't worry. I won't say anything.

229
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,360
I'm thinking about something else.

230
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
What is it?

231
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,600
If our colleagues can't know about us,

232
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,120
can I introduce you to my friends first?

233
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
Your friends?

234
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,680
Su Yang and Zhu Lin?

235
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,520
If they know, You Sijia will find out too.

236
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,960
It's not the right time yet.
Let's not do it.

237
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,440
Okay.

238
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,840
I can keep quiet.

239
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,360
But my lips aren't easy to seal.

240
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
What reward do I get in return?

241
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,120
What reward?

242
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,920
A peck from my girlfriend.

243
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

244
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,040
Don't be shy.

245
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,000
We slept together last night.

246
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,760
Ruoxin, don't change your mind.

247
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,120
Who slept with you?

248
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
We slept separately!

249
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,960
Do you want to get hit?

250
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,160
Let go.

251
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
No, come on.

252
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,320
We just arrived from the venue.

253
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,800
Are you here early to help, Su Yang?

254
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,760
I don't have work today.

255
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,200
I can help out.

256
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,040
I'll let you two talk.

257
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,480
I'm heading upstairs.

258
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,240
- That's fishy.
- How suspicious.

259
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
Give me some intel.

260
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,360
Ruoxin didn't come home last night.

261
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,520
Qi Xiao didn't come home
last night either.

262
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,440
Seriously?

263
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,920
<i>You're so cute.</i>

264
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,640
<i>What are you saying?</i>

265
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,200
You startled me!

266
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,720
Sit down!

267
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,720
I called you out at the door, Ruoxin.

268
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,720
Didn't you hear me?

269
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,600
- Did you order?
- Yes.

270
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
Ruoxin.

271
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,520
Qi Xiao just said

272
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,080
that the two of you

273
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
got together last night.

274
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,720
He told you?

275
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,040
It's true?

276
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,320
I was just bluffing.

277
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
You're in for it, You Sijia!

278
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,560
You're asking for it.

279
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,080
I'm so excited!

280
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,280
You finally accepted Qi Xiao.

281
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,680
I'm about to cry.

282
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,160
Hold on.

283
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
What do you mean "finally"?

284
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,240
You knew?

285
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,360
Qi Xiao told me a long time ago.

286
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,360
He said he really likes you.

287
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,320
I was afraid you would keep rejecting him.

288
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
I've been worried about him.

289
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,400
How great! You two are finally together!

290
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I'm so excited.

291
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,840
Lower your voice.

292
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,800
Do you want the whole company to know?

293
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
Why are you crying? Wipe it.

294
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,280
Thank you.

295
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,600
Ruoxin.

296
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,840
You were so good to me.

297
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Qi Xiao is also a good friend of mine.

298
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,800
Aside from Su Yang,

299
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,200
you two are the ones
I care about the most in this city.

300
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,040
And now you've said yes.

301
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,840
You two can be together.

302
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,560
I'm so happy, Ruoxin.

303
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
What do you want to eat? My treat.

304
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
Really?

305
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,840
I want macarons.

306
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,840
Okay.

307
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,200
Hello?

308
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,600
Hey, Qi Xiao.

309
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,320
You're such a bad friend.

310
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,200
How am I not a good friend?

311
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,560
I was worried about you all night.

312
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,360
But you were having the time of your life.

313
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,040
How did you know?

314
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
Did Ruoxin tell you? She admitted it?

315
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,800
Sijia asked Ruoxin.

316
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,840
Ruoxin admitted it.

317
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,760
I knew she was serious about it.

318
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,440
Tell me. What do you want to eat?

319
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,920
Delicacies or sumptuous feasts.

320
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,280
Take your pick. It's on me.

321
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,560
You just wait.

322
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
I'll skip lunch.

323
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll bleed you dry tonight.

324
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,800
No problem. See you tonight.

325
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
Here.

326
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,520
Only hot water for you today.

327
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000
Keep that in mind, okay?

328
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,160
You snuck out to eat skewers last time.

329
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,640
I still remember that.

330
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,160
No more of that for one month.

331
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
Stay still.

332
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,960
All right.

333
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,240
When some people date,

334
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,280
they spoil their partner like a child.

335
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,480
Qi Xiao,

336
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,280
you're making me look bad.

337
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,560
- Give me a break, will you?
- Tough luck.

338
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,480
Why don't you spoil me like a child?

339
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,400
Sure, I'll do it now.

340
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,440
What do you want me to do?

341
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,720
I want to eat that.

342
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,240
Chicken?

343
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,280
I want this one too.

344
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,720
Cucumber.

345
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,440
It's good.

346
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,440
You have a nice smile.

347
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
You should eat it.

348
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,440
Eat up.

349
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,640
You seem to be smiling
for the first time in a long time.

350
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,600
I need to tell you something.

351
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,120
I may have done something irrational.

352
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,240
But I've decided to do this.

353
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,200
I might have seriously decided

354
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,240
to date Qi Xiao.

355
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,880
I don't know why either.

356
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,360
But I'm really happy when I'm with him.

357
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,040
You know now.

358
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,120
<i>Shen Ruoxin!</i>

359
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,880
Pigs must be flying!

360
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,840
Congratulations!

361
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,920
You're making me deaf.

362
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,440
You scared me to death.

363
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,360
<i>I know I'm being irrational.</i>

364
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,480
He's only 20 years old.

365
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,600
Why do I feel like a cougar?

366
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,280
You're not just a cougar.

367
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,400
You're practically a succubus.

368
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,720
<i>All right.</i>

369
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,240
Don't overthink it.

370
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
Listen, Shen Ruoxin.

371
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,440
At our age,

372
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,840
the most important thing

373
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,120
is to enjoy life.

374
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,920
<i>Constantly explore
the possibilities in life.</i>

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,440
Qi Xiao is a good kid.

376
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,960
Don't judge yourself yet.

377
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,280
Enjoy your youth.

378
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,880
Song Ziyan,

379
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,720
you're the succubus!

380
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,240
<i>You didn't sleep well last night.</i>

381
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,480
<i>Get some rest today.</i>

382
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,360
<i>Don't sneak out again.</i>

383
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,120
<i>It's time for my beauty routine.</i>

384
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,800
RESIGNATION LETTER

385
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,520
RESIGNATION LETTER

386
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,040
- You're quitting?
- Yes.

387
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm dating Ruoxin.

388
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,120
It'll complicate things at work.

389
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,080
I don't want to make her uncomfortable.

390
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,080
You sure are dedicated to love.

391
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,040
But it's not easy
to find a job these days.

392
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,240
Su Yang.

393
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,200
There are two things in life

394
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,320
that I've always felt are a blessing.

395
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,320
The first one

396
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,760
is to be with someone you love.

397
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,200
The other one

398
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,840
is to have a job that you like.

399
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
God has blessed me.

400
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,920
I already have

401
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,680
the first thing.

402
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,280
So

403
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,320
it's time to work on the second thing.

404
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,200
Do you plan on sticking to design

405
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,520
and run your online shop?

406
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,160
But my previous concept was premature

407
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
and lacked planning.

408
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,680
That's why I plan on starting fresh.

409
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,440
Besides, Zhu Lin has been looking
for a studio partner.

410
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,320
My ideas are in line with his.

411
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,240
Ruoxin also supports my decision
to return to design.

412
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,680
Now I finally believe it.

413
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,760
True love makes people brave.

414
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,600
I used to be afraid of love

415
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,200
because I was scared
I had nothing to offer.

416
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,680
Sometimes, I felt like
I can't fix any of her problems,

417
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,600
so I didn't even bother asking her.

418
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,520
I later realized that

419
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,720
maybe all she needs to know

420
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
is that you care.

421
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm with Sijia now.

422
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,600
I don't feel so empty inside anymore.

423
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Instead, I feel more motivated now.

424
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
Now you're getting it.

425
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,080
You're such a sweet talker.

426
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,160
Where did you learn
all those moves you made at dinner?

427
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,000
True love doesn't need any tricks.

428
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,480
It all comes from the heart.

429
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,640
Just be careful from now on.

430
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,560
Don't set such a high bar

431
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,720
for other men.

432
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,760
Sure. Let's do our best.

433
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,800
We weren't even thinking
of buying a new energy vehicle.

434
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,360
Your salespeople kept badgering us

435
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,480
and went on about how great this car is

436
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,400
and how complete the service is.

437
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,239
When I bought the car,

438
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,880
you made so many promises!

439
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,240
Why are you brushing me off now?

440
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,600
Ma'am, we're not brushing you off.

441
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,640
Calm down.

442
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,680
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

443
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
What misunderstanding?

444
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,920
I've called many times!

445
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Did you solve my problem?

446
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,960
You're right.
I'm sure we could have done better.

447
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,880
- Xiaowang.
- Ms. Shen.

448
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,880
What's going on?

449
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Ms. Chang bought our new energy vehicle.

450
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,400
But they live in an old building

451
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,240
without an independent electric meter.

452
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,280
The installation of a charger
would be a safety hazard.

453
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,680
It'll have to draw commercial power

454
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,960
from the adjacent office building.

455
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,680
The car owner is upset about that.

456
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,040
She insists that we fooled her.

457
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,160
Of course.

458
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,280
Commercial power is 0.3 yuan per kWh
more than residential power.

459
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,640
It adds up.

460
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,960
She has also complained several times.

461
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,360
- Could you…
- I'll handle it.

462
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,320
Go and buy some coffee.

463
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Ms. Chang?

464
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,640
Hello, I'm in charge of
the New Energy Department.

465
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,480
If you have any issues,
you can tell me directly.

466
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,400
Are you in charge here?

467
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
I'm Shen Ruoxin, senior manager
of the New Energy Department.

468
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,800
Please call me Ms. Shen.

469
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
Let me explain.

470
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,400
The installation of the charger

471
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
isn't done by our company.

472
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,920
We outsource it to a third-party company.

473
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,880
Of course, I'm not saying this
to shirk responsibility.

474
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,120
I want you to understand.

475
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,040
Our company would never
deceive our clients.

476
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,720
Of course, I believe

477
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
the installation company
must have done this

478
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,480
purely for safety reasons.

479
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,960
It's okay to be displeased.

480
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,720
I'll represent our company

481
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,520
and resolve this with you.

482
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,640
Don't be angry.

483
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,880
This is your problem to solve.

484
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,280
- Yes.
- A third party?

485
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,120
How is it my concern?

486
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,600
All I know is that when you sold the car,

487
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,640
you promised to solve this problem for me.

488
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,560
A charger can't be installed at my home.

489
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,560
Why wasn't I told before I bought the car?

490
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,440
- Right.
- Look at how it ended up.

491
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,000
What a waste of time and energy.

492
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,160
You don't care after the purchase is done!

493
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,560
You're so irresponsible.

494
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,000
I want to file a complaint.

495
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,400
And the installer said
I should have known about it.

496
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,240
It's not my job! How would I know?

497
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,040
Yes, don't be mad.

498
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,960
I thought a charger
could be installed anywhere!

499
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,320
- That's problematic.
- Yes.

500
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,640
Can it be installed or not?

501
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,800
- This is a unique situation.
- This car isn't really that convenient.

502
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,400
I just made the down payment.
Is there post-sales support?

503
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,240
- Don't worry.
- We don't want to buy it.

504
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
- Don't be mad.
- That's enough!

505
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,240
Stop pretending!

506
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,680
You're in charge, right?

507
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,200
A third party? Post-sales?
I don't trust you anymore!

508
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,320
I want a refund!

509
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
That's not necessary, is it?

510
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,880
- Give us an explanation.
- Excuse me.

511
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,320
Pass out the drinks.

512
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,640
- Is this car a good idea?
- Don't be mad. Look.

513
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,680
Have some coffee.

514
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,520
Your water has turned cold.

515
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,520
How about this?

516
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,640
I'll call the installation company
and get you a satisfactory solution.

517
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,880
What do you think?

518
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,840
Calm down.

519
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,520
Mr. Liu,

520
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,080
the two of us

521
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,840
have always worked well together.

522
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,560
We're an installation company.

523
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,400
We've always followed the rules.

524
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,120
No one wanted this to happen.

525
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,720
Our contract with your company
is very clear.

526
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,640
When your company installs the charger,

527
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,640
you must be fully responsible
to our customers.

528
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,080
But in Ms. Chang's case,

529
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,640
during the charger installation,

530
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,520
you failed to discuss it with Ms. Chang

531
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,640
before deciding
to use commercial electricity.

532
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,800
That's the truth.

533
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,480
Ms. Shen, you don't understand.

534
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,640
Given her situation,

535
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
this is the best installation plan.

536
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,960
There's no other option.

537
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
If we gave her what she wanted,

538
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,760
it would have been a safety hazard.

539
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,800
No one wants that.

540
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,120
If you keep going on about the contract…

541
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Then there's no deal.

542
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,840
There's a problem with your sales.

543
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
When you're selling the car,

544
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,080
you failed to inform the customer
of the installation requirements.

545
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,880
Mr. Wu, I admit it.

546
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,120
There are indeed installation limitations.

547
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,400
But it's clear the customer
is unhappy with your service.

548
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,920
If you had discussed it with her first,

549
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,520
we wouldn't be here now.

550
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,560
Enough.

551
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,600
Stop arguing.

552
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,080
We're here today to fix the problem.

553
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,680
All this talk hasn't yielded
a specific plan.

554
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,720
Mr. Wu.

555
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,080
You can leave first.

556
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,440
We'll keep discussing.

557
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,240
I'll let you know when we have a plan.

558
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,640
- Wait, Mr. Liu--
- We'll get going then.

559
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,040
- Mr. Wu, let me see you out.
- No need.

560
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,440
Take care then.

561
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Anything else you want to say?

562
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
Mr. Liu, from what I gathered,

563
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,320
our customer is dissatisfied
with their service

564
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,120
and blaming it on us.

565
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,920
Mr. Wu's attitude
is grounds for legal action!

566
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
Ms. Shen.

567
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
A lawsuit is too risky.

568
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,720
Whether we win or not is one thing.

569
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,960
If we file a lawsuit, customers will think
we're passing the buck.

570
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,960
If this goes viral online,
I can't imagine the consequences.

571
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,160
Ms. Shen.

572
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,120
This isn't the first time
this has happened to you.

573
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,960
You should think about it carefully.

574
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,160
You know that.

575
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,240
Ms. Shen, I've told you before.

576
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,040
Think carefully before you do something.

577
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,240
You're the one in charge
of the New Energy Department, right?

578
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,600
I know Mr. Xu gave you a lot of authority.

579
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,800
Being busy is no excuse.

580
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,080
When there's an issue,

581
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,560
you should talk to the company
before it's too late.

582
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,920
Remember your department's
previous sales training?

583
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,480
It was perfunctory at best.

584
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,360
There isn't even a basic post-sales plan.

585
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Now you pass the blame
when there's a problem.

586
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,520
That's not the attitude we should have.

587
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,240
Mr. Liu is right.

588
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,520
Right now, we should think about

589
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,040
how to minimize damage to the company

590
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,840
instead of causing
more damage to the brand.

591
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,400
The best solution for this case now?

592
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,200
I have two suggestions.

593
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
First of all,

594
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
make sure the PR Department follows up.

595
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,520
Second, do damage control immediately.

596
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,480
Didn't the owner ask for a refund?

597
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,520
Then let's show the client

598
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,160
our attitude and determination
regarding this case.

599
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,440
Agree with her demand.

600
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,920
You mean we should refund her?

601
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,200
Not just a refund.

602
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,200
Someone in your department
must take responsibility for this,

603
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
resign, and apologize publicly.

604
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,800
That's the only way customers will have
confidence in our post-sales service.

605
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Let's all learn from this mistake.

606
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,120
That includes me.

607
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,160
From now on, chargers must be installed

608
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,960
according to
the customer's specific requirements.

609
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Communicate more comprehensively
with the installation company.

610
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,040
- Mr. Liu--
- All right, stop talking.

611
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,720
This is the consequence
of your salespeople

612
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,680
neglecting proper communication
in their bid to make a sale!

613
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,440
The company's loss

614
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,360
shall be fully borne by your department.

615
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,360
I don't agree with this solution.

616
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,840
I believe we can talk
to the owner of the car,

617
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
give her a discount on the car,

618
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,680
and explain the installation situation.

619
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Or we can ask Mr. Wu to come up

620
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,640
with a new charger installation plan.

621
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,000
This isn't about whether you agree or not.

622
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,760
Will a discount make up
for the electricity cost over the years?

623
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,040
Will she agree?

624
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,160
Won't she feel
we're doing the bare minimum?

625
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,400
If we don't handle this properly,

626
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,280
the entire company will be affected,

627
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,840
not just your New Energy Department!

628
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,720
Can you bear that responsibility? Can you?

629
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,400
You must have already forgotten

630
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,680
what happened with Jin Yuanhao's case.

631
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,680
So in handling this case,

632
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,440
do not take anything for granted!

633
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,120
If another scandalous article about you

634
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,480
goes up online,

635
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,640
everyone will see it.

636
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,280
"Isn't that the legal counsel, Ms. Shen?"

637
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,360
By then,

638
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,080
the negative effect on our brand

639
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,240
will be exponentially amplified.

640
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,920
Not even Mr. Xu can protect you!

641
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,120
You need to know

642
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,760
when to cut your losses.

643
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,800
Don't push your luck.

644
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,640
