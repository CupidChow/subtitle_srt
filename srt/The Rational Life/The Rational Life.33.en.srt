1
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,840
My brother and his wife

2
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,600
want to separate them.

3
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,800
My goodness.

4
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,000
I told them,

5
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
"What are you doing?

6
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
Your daughter isn't a kid anymore."

7
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
Right?

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
They're together.

9
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
They're happily in love. That's not bad.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,720
Why are they worrying so much?

11
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
My goodness.

12
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
We're parents.

13
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
One word. Scared.

14
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,320
An older woman with a younger man?

15
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Sometimes, it's a matter
of traditional views.

16
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,080
We can't convince ourselves to accept it.

17
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,920
I'm different from you.

18
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,520
I think an older woman with a younger man

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,120
is the best match.

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Tell me why.

21
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,800
Think about the past.

22
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,240
For most couples in the past,

23
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,360
the men were usually older. Why?

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,720
Because men make houses, women make homes.

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Isn't that right?
So men have to reach a certain age

26
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,320
before they have social status

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,360
or before they can provide for the family.

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,960
That's why "men make houses."

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
As for the girls?

30
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,320
They have to be young.

31
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,360
They must be healthy.

32
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,080
Because they have to give birth. Right?

33
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,600
So "women make homes."

34
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,000
But look at how it is now.
It's totally different.

35
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,360
Times have changed.

36
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
Do you know how amazing my niece is?

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,200
She said her annual income is

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
more than a million yuan.

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,320
- Amazing, right?
- Yes.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
She also said,

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,520
"I don't need a man to pay for me.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
I have my own money.

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll buy it for myself.

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,080
I don't need his money.

45
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,480
I just want to find someone who I like

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
and he likes me back.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,920
We can be together and happily in love."

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,240
This niece of yours is so confident.

49
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
Very confident.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,520
I don't think it's about the money.

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
I think parents are concerned about

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,480
the biological problem.

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,880
If the woman is older,

54
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,160
when she becomes

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,480
an old hag,

56
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
the man would still be young.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But nowadays,

58
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,800
finding a soul mate

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,120
is unrealistic.

60
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

61
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,600
Looking for a soul mate
is basically impossible.

62
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,920
But biologically speaking,

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,000
I think the woman should still be older.

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
Hear me out.

65
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,880
People are saying,

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,360
"Most women live longer than men."

67
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,400
So how can they be together forever?

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,160
The woman has to be older than the man.

69
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,560
So they can grow old together, right?

70
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,400
What if according to tradition,

71
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
the man should be older than the woman?

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,520
Then my niece is 37 years old.

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,840
If she has to find someone older than her,

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,560
he'll be like 40 or 50.

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
A man in his 40s won't be as healthy.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,800
If he gets ill or has an accident,

77
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
my niece has to take care of him.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
Won't that be a bother?

79
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,240
So dating a younger man now

80
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,360
and being happy in love all the time

81
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,320
is a lot better.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,360
Isn't that great?

83
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,720
Yes.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,120
Also, Ms. Zhou.

85
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm telling you.

86
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,760
Girls nowadays aren't like our generation.

87
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,160
When women become old,
they would look like a hag.

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
Young girls today…

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
My goodness.

90
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,240
They have cosmetics. They go to the gym.

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
And have microplastic surgery.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
You know it, right?

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,520
They all look so young.

94
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Have you seen it? What's it called?

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,800
Something sisters?

96
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,080
<i>Sisters Who Make Waves.</i>

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,120
It's a good TV show.

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,240
- Isn't it great?
- Yes.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
Can't you tell how old she is?

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,040
But she can sing and dance.

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
Look at men these days.

102
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,960
Those older guys don't even dress up.

103
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,120
Some grow fat. Some go bald.

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
They don't age well

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,040
- with their big bellies.
- Right?

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,480
That little niece of yours,

107
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,600
how much older is she than her boyfriend?

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,560
I think she's five years older.

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
That's all right.

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,400
Only five years.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,240
I thought it was 15 years.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
A five-year age difference
is nothing nowadays.

113
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
In my eyes,

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
it's not a big deal at all.

115
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,880
Ms. Zhou, you're too open-minded.

116
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,480
Fifteen years?

117
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
My niece is 37!

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,360
If it's 15 years,

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
that boy would only be

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,040
in his early 20s.

121
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,320
Just a young adult.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,840
That's so embarrassing. Come on.

123
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,200
Small child.

124
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
A young boy.

125
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,840
I think this design is good.

126
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
We can give it a try.

127
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
Not good enough.

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,960
Go and look at the major brands.

129
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,080
Compared to them, this is nothing.

130
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,080
Those major brands' designs

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,880
are the works of the best designers.

132
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,120
They have perfected their skills
over time.

133
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,680
Besides, our goal
isn't the same market as theirs.

134
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,160
Being able to do this as a start-up brand

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
is already an accomplishment.

136
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,760
Take your time.

137
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,200
I don't have the time.

138
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
I have to hurry.

139
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,440
I have to prove myself right now.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
I just told you no…

141
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,080
Why are you here?

142
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,800
You've been ignoring me.

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,920
Of course I have to come and find you.

144
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,080
I'm not ignoring you.

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,920
I'm just busy.

146
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Qi Xiao.

147
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,840
Has it been bothering you?

148
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,880
The age difference

149
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
between the two of us.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
That's impossible.

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
I thought about it for a few days.

152
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,960
I think the older I get,

153
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,280
the more I become like my mom.

154
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,120
I used to think

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,400
that my mom
always arranged everything for me.

156
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,640
She decides everything

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,280
and she always acts like
she did it for my own good.

158
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,400
But now, I also realize

159
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,200
that I'm becoming more and more like her.

160
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Ms. Zhou is adorable.

161
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,240
Though she's a little bit controlling.

162
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,760
That's right.

163
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,040
After you quit,

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
I came to Zhu Lin in secret.

165
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
I invested 200,000 yuan

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,040
and I told him not to tell you.

167
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
But I did that

168
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,360
only because I wanted to help you guys.

169
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
I wanted the best for you.

170
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,680
So…

171
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,040
Are you upset?

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,880
A little bit.

173
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,560
I can look

174
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
for investors myself.

175
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,640
You offering us money

176
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
makes me feel like you don't believe

177
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
that I'll make it.

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,680
When my mom

179
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
took out her savings

180
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,720
for the down payment for my house,

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
I said the same thing.

182
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
I said,

183
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,200
"Mom, don't you believe me?

184
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,760
Do you think that I won't be able

185
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
to make enough money?"

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Guess what my mom said?

187
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,800
She must have said that

188
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,440
she didn't want you to struggle.

189
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,920
She said

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,480
it's an investment.

191
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,320
She even told me

192
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,120
not to take away her chance
to make an investment

193
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,120
just because I was too proud.

194
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,880
That's a great excuse.

195
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
She was right.

196
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,640
Look. Over the years,

197
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
housing prices have gone up.

198
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,760
Qi Xiao.

199
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm not that rich.

200
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,560
So the 200,000 yuan that I gave you guys,

201
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,000
I worked hard for it.

202
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,520
I saved the money, bit by bit,

203
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,880
from my salary and bonuses.

204
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
I won't let my money go to waste

205
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,680
just out of pity.

206
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm investing.

207
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,280
Someone once told me

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,000
that he used to run an online shop.

209
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,400
Each month, he made 7 to 8 thousand.

210
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,520
He also said he wanted his own shop

211
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,440
to make 50 to 60 thousand a month

212
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,800
in the future.

213
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
I think you have the potential,

214
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,840
but you need investors.

215
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,240
We really hit it off.

216
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't take away my chance
to make an investment

217
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
just because you're too proud.

218
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,600
What about the design competition?

219
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
Giving me a privilege.

220
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,760
Was that out of confidence?

221
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,360
Gu Yutao told you that?

222
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,920
I didn't go to him first.

223
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
He brought it up himself.

224
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,560
He said he knew someone
and that he would talk to them.

225
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,800
But I already told him

226
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,240
that Qi Xiao, my boyfriend,
doesn't like playing dirty.

227
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,360
That's what I admire about him.

228
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,520
Really?

229
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
I thought I had already turned him down

230
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,040
so I didn't tell you.

231
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
I didn't want to upset you.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
But I never thought

233
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
that he would use this

234
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,520
to drive a wedge between us.

235
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
I knew it. He has bad intentions.

236
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,400
Then today,

237
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
we discussed all our problems.

238
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,280
It's all out there.

239
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,520
What else do you need me

240
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
to explain to you?

241
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,240
From now on,

242
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,960
no matter what we come across,

243
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,200
we have to open up to each other. Okay?

244
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

245
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,600
If you really want me
to be honest with you,

246
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,520
can you also be honest with me?

247
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm very curious

248
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,120
to know what you think of me.

249
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,360
Or what you think of our relationship.

250
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,240
For some reason,

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
it feels like you don't want people
to know we're dating.

252
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
As if you're ashamed of me.

253
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,040
Why do you think so?

254
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Sijia knows.

255
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Ziyan knows too.

256
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,320
At the reunion,
I also formally introduced you

257
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
to everyone.

258
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,920
What about your mom then?

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,040
Mom.

260
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,560
Qi Xiao and I would like

261
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,360
to have a meal with you.

262
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,680
Good?

263
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,560
Are you ready?

264
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,920
I just want to make sure

265
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,760
that you're serious

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,800
about this relationship like I am.

267
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
Do you have your answer now?

268
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,120
That's great!

269
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,520
That's great.

270
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Su Yang.

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,720
That's wonderful.

272
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,520
I'm glad you're here.

273
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,360
I didn't think they would agree.

274
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,360
That means they really like
your work and your skills.

275
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
That's why they agreed to work with us.

276
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,920
Mr. Su, now we just have
to check the contract.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,640
The 50,000 yuan deposit money
will be ours soon.

278
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Sijia.

279
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,920
I was just thinking.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,280
We don't have a company.

281
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,240
We can start one.

282
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
I did some research yesterday.

283
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,520
It's easy to start one.

284
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,080
The government is encouraging
student entrepreneurs.

285
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,480
Even after graduation,
they'll still support it.

286
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,200
In many districts of Shanghai,
there are more plans and subsidies.

287
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,480
We can take a look.

288
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,160
We might be able to apply.

289
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
You're amazing.

290
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,400
Su Yang.

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
The only problem is,

292
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
will you…

293
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,640
Will you quit your current stable job

294
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
to start a business?

295
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,200
If you don't want to, it's also fine.

296
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,880
You can just sell the rights to it.

297
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,080
That's good too.

298
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,520
- 200,000 yuan--
- I will.

299
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Sijia.

300
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,840
I'm willing to try.

301
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,119
After being with you,
I'm no longer afraid.

302
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,000
I fear nothing.

303
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,440
CHECKING YOUR COMPANY NAME

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,320
RESIGNATION LETTER

305
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,040
CHECKING YOUR COMPANY NAME

306
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,240
Hello, Mom.

307
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,000
Qi Xiao, is it true
that you're having dinner

308
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
with Ms. Zhou tonight?

309
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
How did you know?

310
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,920
Did she tell you?

311
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,920
<i>I went to her school to give her eggs</i>

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
<i>and she told me.</i>

313
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,440
Qi Xiao, you must behave yourself tonight.

314
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,040
Then it would work.

315
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,360
"It would work"?

316
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
How would it work?

317
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,560
Tell me.

318
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,640
<i>I asked her.</i>

319
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,520
"Hey, why didn't they invite me?"

320
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,960
Guess what she said?

321
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,440
What?

322
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
She said,

323
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,600
"According to Shanghai's rules,

324
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,440
the man goes to the woman's house first."

325
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,040
<i>Hey, "the man" goes
to "the woman's" house.</i>

326
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
I understand. Got it.

327
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,800
I love you, Mom.

328
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
You're the best mom in the world.

329
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,320
Come on, my dear.

330
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,240
Bye.

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
Bye.

332
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,640
Ms. Zhou, the food is ready.

333
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,800
Let me get you some soup.

334
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
Not now.

335
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,800
Have a seat first.

336
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,040
You too.

337
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,200
Sit here.

338
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,280
Let's just be quiet and sit for a while.

339
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,040
When you are quiet,

340
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,320
the whole world will be quiet.

341
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
I have a few words

342
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,120
to say to you.

343
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,960
After that,
I won't mind your business anymore.

344
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Of course, Ms. Zhou.

345
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm not that old-fashioned.

346
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,840
But I have my own view.

347
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
Because to my generation of people,

348
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,840
dating without wanting to get married

349
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,400
is called being tramps.

350
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,320
But it's different now.

351
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,000
When you're in a relationship,

352
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,640
you must learn to grow.

353
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,480
But I still hope

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,480
that you can have

355
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,760
a wedding with no regrets.

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,760
Don't get married just for your parents.

357
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,920
Don't get married
because society demands it.

358
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Do it because you've found true happiness.

359
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,840
Are you ready?

360
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,920
Ms. Zhou, we're ready.

361
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,000
We're serious about this.

362
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,840
You're just a kid.

363
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,040
You always butt in.

364
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,720
I didn't ask you.

365
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,800
Since you said it first…

366
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,640
Okay then.

367
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm asking you first.

368
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,760
Are you serious about Shen Ruoxin?

369
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,440
Do you think, in the future,

370
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,360
you'll marry her and have children?

371
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Ms. Zhou.

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,560
That's up to her.

373
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,920
I have always been serious.

374
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,120
I was never fooling around.

375
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,880
But the age difference is big.

376
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,120
She's 12 years older than you.

377
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,960
You're 12 years younger than her.

378
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,600
I know.

379
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,520
You're worried that I'm too young,

380
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,960
that I might be too naive,
so you're worried.

381
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,000
But I promise you,

382
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,560
I can take care of her.

383
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
I'm really sincere.

384
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,800
How sincere are you?

385
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Tell me.

386
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,800
On the surface,

387
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,800
she's rational, logical, and careful.

388
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,880
But she's also very romantic.

389
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
She likes watching the stars.

390
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,760
<i>Nothing touches her</i>

391
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,160
<i>more than ideal things.</i>

392
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
<i>While she may look cold on the outside</i>

393
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
<i>and only cares about her own interests,</i>

394
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,120
she's actually a softhearted person.

395
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,600
She's willing to sacrifice

396
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,160
for the people she cares about.

397
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,880
<i>Qi Xiao,</i>

398
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,640
let me repeat this

399
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,000
one last time.

400
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,320
The day you decided
to leave the Legal Department,

401
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,800
from then on,

402
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
<i>you are my people.</i>

403
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,400
<i>Don't ever say such things like,</i>

404
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,800
"Don't worry."

405
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,600
She doesn't like being interfered with

406
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,960
and being controlled.

407
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,440
She always says
she wants to control her own life,

408
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
but she often can't take care of herself.

409
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,800
Shen Ruoxin!

410
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,920
Shen Ruoxin!

411
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,440
<i>She has a weak stomach,</i>

412
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,680
but she loves spicy food

413
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,600
and coffee.

414
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,840
Her blood sugar drops easily,

415
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,960
but she often skips breakfast.

416
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,120
<i>She likes horror films,</i>

417
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,400
but she'll have problems falling asleep.

418
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,880
So she has
to watch documentaries to relax.

419
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
She thinks she's a good drinker,

420
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,200
<i>but when she's upset,
she gets drunk easily.</i>

421
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,800
She can do

422
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,320
whatever she puts her mind to.

423
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,680
If she doesn't want something,

424
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,760
even if she's tempted with treasures,

425
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
she still won't take it.

426
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
<i>Mom.</i>

427
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I've made up my mind.

428
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
I'm not leaving.

429
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,680
Ms. Zhou.

430
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,080
You've never asked me

431
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,600
why I like her.

432
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,480
I like her

433
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,080
because of how special she is.

434
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
Her ability and strength,

435
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,880
everyone can see that side of her.

436
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,640
But her cuteness and softness,

437
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,400
only I can see that.

438
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,440
I'll cherish her.

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,200
After hearing that,

440
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,440
I really feel like
you know my daughter better than I do.

441
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
Thank you.

442
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,280
Your turn.

443
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,760
Why do you like him?

444
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Mom.

445
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,960
When I am with Qi Xiao,

446
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
I feel the most comfortable

447
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,680
and relaxed.

448
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
I never have to hide anything.

449
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,200
I can always be my true self.

450
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,800
I never have to worry that he'll hurt me

451
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,520
or he'll set me up.

452
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,720
He always stands up for me.

453
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,320
He protects me

454
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,560
and takes care of me.

455
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,600
<i>When the whole world is going against me.</i>

456
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,880
<i>He stands by my side</i>

457
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,800
<i>no matter what.</i>

458
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,080
What are you doing?

459
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,880
Do you enjoy ganging up on a woman?

460
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,560
<i>Aren't you ashamed?</i>

461
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,640
<i>He's there for me when I'm tired.</i>

462
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,040
<i>When I'm drunk and act crazily,</i>
<i>he'll make a scene with me.</i>

463
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
When I have a setback at work,

464
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,440
when I'm having trouble,

465
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,720
he'll always be there.

466
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,080
He'll help me solve all my problems.

467
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,560
<i>Actually, I don't know</i>

468
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,520
<i>why I…</i>

469
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,440
<i>I feel safe when I'm with a man
who's so much younger</i>

470
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,560
than me.

471
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,720
When he smiles at me, I feel…

472
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,520
I feel like this cold world,

473
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,360
this world
that is full of rules and restrictions,

474
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,840
has become so warm.

475
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,280
<i>I don't know if it's love or not.</i>

476
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,120
<i>Because I don't know
what the definition of love is.</i>

477
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,240
But I know one thing for sure.

478
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,920
In all these years,

479
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
he's the only one…

480
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,040
who came into my heart.

481
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,280
So Qi Xiao and I…

482
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,920
We're serious.

483
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,120
They say you're only hungry

484
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,800
when your mom thinks you're hungry.

485
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Instead of me teaching you,

486
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,080
it's better to say that the two of you

487
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,880
keep on teaching me.

488
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
Xinxin,

489
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,640
you're an excellent girl.

490
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,880
I hope

491
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,040
that you can have a unique life.

492
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,760
But Xinxin,

493
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,480
you're older than him.

494
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,280
You should be more rational.

495
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,280
I still want to ask.

496
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,720
How long do you think

497
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,000
this affection will last?

498
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,880
Ten years?

499
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,120
Twenty years?

500
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,440
Mom.

501
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,920
When two people are together,

502
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,120
no one knows what will happen

503
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
in 10 or 20 years.

504
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,680
Maybe at first,

505
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,240
two people look great being a couple.

506
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,040
But you'll never know how they may change.

507
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
Because no one knows
what's going to happen.

508
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,880
Ms. Zhou.

509
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
I know.

510
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,040
By being together,

511
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,400
we'll face many problems in the future.

512
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,640
Lots of setbacks.

513
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,760
But no relationship can go on

514
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,720
without any problems or setbacks.

515
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,640
One thing is for sure.

516
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,160
I'm very serious.

517
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,120
I'm willing to be with her

518
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,720
to face the problems

519
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,600
and solve them.

520
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
I'll try to grow up

521
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,160
and always be by her side.

522
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,280
Be the shoulder that she can lean on.

523
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,200
Don't worry.

524
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,560
Mom.

525
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,040
Isn't love just an irrational belief?

526
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
It's just

527
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,440
what the heart wants.

528
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,400
It's something that ties us together.

529
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,960
After so many years,

530
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,280
I finally made up my mind
and have the courage

531
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,920
to be brave for once.

532
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,040
Aren't you happy for me?

533
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,480
I am.

534
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,800
I have no reason not to be happy for you.

535
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,760
Go.

536
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,560
Be brave.

537
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,720
Even if you fail,

538
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,240
you can come home.

539
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,720
You still have me.

540
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,200
I won't let anyone treat you badly.

541
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Qi Xiao.

542
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,680
Do you understand what I just said?

543
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm not a vegetarian.

544
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,480
Got it.

545
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,360
You're not a vegetarian.

546
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,000
You can have the ribs I made.

547
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,040
Here, Mom.

548
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,120
Ziyan.

549
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,680
Why are you back early?

550
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,360
I thought your flight was tomorrow.

551
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
I've been away for a week.

552
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,960
I miss you.

553
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,440
There's a class tomorrow

554
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,480
so I won't see you.

555
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,480
I won't see you at night either.

556
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,840
So I flew back right away after work.

557
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,640
Not bad.

558
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,040
I'm on probation, right?

559
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,400
I have to do well.

560
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,400
Why aren't you playing?

561
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,080
My band is interviewing our new drummer.

562
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm an amateur after all.

563
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,159
I can play from time to time.

564
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,639
But I can't play for them every day.

565
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,600
Or even go on tours or competitions.

566
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,760
So I asked Ting to find a new drummer.

567
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
So from now on,

568
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,480
you won't come to the bar at night?

569
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,239
I'll come if you're away.

570
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,040
But if you're home,

571
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,360
I'll stay home.

572
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,639
Honey.

573
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,840
Are you doing this for me?

574
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,639
I promise.

575
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,320
Other than business trips,

576
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,679
I'll try to turn down
every business dinner.

577
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,360
I'll stay home with you.

578
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,360
You said it.

579
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,480
- Keep your word.
- I promise.

580
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,920
What about your class?

581
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,480
I'll still go.

582
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,800
The principal asked me.

583
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,520
He said that the students really like me.

584
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,880
He wanted to pay me more

585
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,240
to teach more students.

586
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,560
Good for you.

587
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,800
So did you agree?

588
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,080
No. I said I was thinking about it.

589
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
I was trying to hold him off.

590
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,280
So he'll pay me even more.

591
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
Seems like
you're becoming the best teacher.

592
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Do you know?

593
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,680
Why do the children like me so much?

594
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,840
They say I'm the only one

595
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,600
who doesn't see them as children.

596
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,880
I can understand them.

597
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,840
Ms. Song is so great.

598
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,960
What do you think?

599
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,320
I think it's great.

600
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,760
He's the one.

601
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,280
Just by his appearance

602
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
and the atmosphere,

603
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,600
he matches us.

604
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,240
No. I mean, he matches you.

605
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,080
I think he's really great.

606
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,120
But…

607
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,760
I think you're the best, Ziyan.

608
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,960
Unfortunately, though the king wishes,
the goddess refuses.

609
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,080
Don't use an idiom if you don't know it.

610
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,560
Do you know what it means?

611
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
She's my wife.

612
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,000
Don't lay a finger on her.

613
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,360
I was wrong.

614
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,040
To be honest, if we're going to hire Leo,

615
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,000
Ziyan, maybe you can do

616
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,400
one last performance.

617
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,680
Get everyone excited.

618
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,600
Invite all your friends.

619
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,320
Zou Cheng,

620
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,640
when will you be free?

621
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
The day after tomorrow?

622
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,080
I'll invite the guys
from my company as well.

623
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,320
After seeing you play,

624
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,040
they've become your fans.

625
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,920
Okay.

626
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,360
Then I'll also invite Ruoxin
and the others.

627
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, the day after tomorrow
is Ziyan's show.

628
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,000
I'll remind you beforehand.

629
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,800
Buy some cheering props.

630
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Okay.

631
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,680
This place is so popular.

632
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,120
Look at the time.

633
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
There's still a line.

634
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,840
It's popular online.

635
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,320
It's not just popular and pretty,
there's one more thing.

636
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,320
- What's that?
- It's expensive.

637
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,240
With a discount, it's 788 yuan.

638
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
More expensive than Waldorf.

639
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,880
My dear Ziyan.

640
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,400
It's so nice of you

641
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,280
to pay for this expensive afternoon tea.

642
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
You don't even care about the price.

643
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Because Zou Cheng gave me his card.

644
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,760
Not arguing anymore?

645
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,360
Have you guys reconciled again?

646
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
Right now,

647
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,760
it's like we're glued to each other.

648
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,800
Like a house on fire.

649
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,200
So deeply attached.

650
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,200
We don't pale in comparison
with you and your younger boyfriend.

651
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,760
What are you saying?

652
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,480
Shen Ruoxin.

653
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,080
You're blushing.

654
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
I've known you for years,

655
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,480
but I've never seen you blush.

656
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,120
Who's blushing?

657
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,160
This kid, Qi Xiao, is amazing.

658
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,320
He's the cure for your age.

659
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,160
Tell me.

660
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,720
How far have you two gone?

661
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Have you

662
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
kissed yet?

663
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,640
Take out your mirror and look at yourself.

664
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
Nothing's wrong. My makeup's nice.

665
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,360
Your tongue was sticking out.

666
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,960
It's freaking me out.

667
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,920
"Freaking"?

668
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,240
Being with your younger boyfriend

669
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
really made you younger.

670
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,920
Can't I hold on to my youth's end?

671
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,160
Sure.

672
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,720
It really is popular online.

673
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,080
So many people are coming in.

674
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,840
But I don't understand.

675
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,960
Isn't the afternoon tea supposed to be
for two people?

676
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,040
They only ordered
one set of afternoon tea.

677
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,720
And the rest ordered the cheapest drink.

678
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,120
Honey water.

679
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,480
Is that enough?

680
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,800
You're so simple-minded.

681
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,400
Are they here to eat?

682
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
They're here to take photos

683
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,600
and post them online.

684
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,520
"Another afternoon with my BFF."

685
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,600
No, but what is the point of this?

686
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,080
I don't get it. What does it mean?

687
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,840
To set an image of being pretty and rich.

688
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,560
Someone will take the bait.

689
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,760
I don't understand young girls.

690
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

691
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
The moment you say that

692
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,320
makes you look like an old lady.

693
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,360
Have you heard of <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>?

694
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,120
Never heard of. Never seen it.

695
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,640
Yes, I am an old lady. Okay?

696
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,520
Is there an old lady who's this pretty?

697
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,800
You're the prettiest in this store.

698
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,560
All right. You're a young girl.

699
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,400
Girl, let's go to the bar together.

700
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,840
I'll ask Zou Cheng to take us.

701
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,480
I already promised Qi Xiao.
I'll go with him.

702
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,880
Gross.

703
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,400
Are you two inseparable?

704
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,200
Qi Xiao is preparing to cheer for you.

705
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,800
We are doing it for you,

706
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,480
milady, Song Ziyan.

707
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Eat up, you.

708
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,480
Eat. It's my gas money.

709
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,000
It's so good.

710
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,160
Tastes expensive.

711
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There's more.

712
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,360
Qi Xiao.

713
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,680
Is everything ready?

714
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,600
Where is he?

715
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,600
Qi Xiao?

716
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,760
Where are you?

717
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,840
You startled me.

718
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,000
So childish.

719
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't open your eyes.

720
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,920
I have a surprise for you.

721
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,760
Okay.

722
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,040
Don't open your eyes.

723
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,280
I know.

724
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,480
Are you peeking?

725
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,400
No.

726
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,920
Come. Follow me.

727
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
Are you going to scare me?

728
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,680
You'll find out soon.

729
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,040
Slowly.

730
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,960
Be careful.

731
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
Where are you taking me?

732
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,480
- Are you looking?
- I'm not.

733
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,560
Here.

734
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,360
Okay.

735
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,560
Be careful.

736
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,600
Have a seat.

737
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,720
Can I open my eyes now?

738
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,960
Not yet. Wait a minute.

739
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,280
Now you can.

740
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,960
My goodness.

741
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,040
Did you make this?

742
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,880
How did you do that?

743
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
Zhu Lin told me today

744
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,880
that I can use this hologram

745
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,400
to look at my designs.

746
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,080
It just came to mind

747
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,840
that I can let you look at the stars.

748
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,600
We don't have to go to the science center.

749
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,600
Whatever you want,
whenever you want to see it,

750
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
I can do it for you.

751
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,360
Do you like it?

752
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,360
Yes.

753
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,160
A lot.

754
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,560
I LOVE YOU

755
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
FAIRY

756
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,320
Tonight

757
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,360
is my final performance here.

758
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,600
All this time,

759
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,200
I have so many people to thank.

760
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,880
I would like to thank Ting

761
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,520
and everyone in the band.

762
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,680
It was you

763
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,280
who helped me find my purpose and motive

764
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,640
when I was helpless and confused.

765
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,600
You showed me that I was still shining.

766
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,560
I have to thank my best friend,

767
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,520
who has been with me since we were kids.

768
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,720
If it weren't for her,

769
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,640
I wouldn't be playing the drums again.

770
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,200
Ruoxin.

771
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Thank you.

772
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,120
Lastly,

773
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,560
I have to thank my husband.

774
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,240
FAIRY

775
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,440
Zou Cheng.

776
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,520
I LOVE YOU

777
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,880
At our wedding

778
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,360
five years ago,

779
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,640
you said something

780
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,840
that still moves me even to this day.

781
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,920
After holding your hand for five years,

782
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,160
I just want to say,

783
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,440
"Let's hold hands

784
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,840
until we're old.

785
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,360
Even death

786
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,080
won't separate us."

787
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,480
