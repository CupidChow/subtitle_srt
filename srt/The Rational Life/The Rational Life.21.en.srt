1
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,040
- Come on.
- Mr. Liu.

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Wait, Mr. Liu.

3
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,720
ANHUA

4
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,520
Let's take my car. I called a driver.

5
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,120
There's no need. I also called a driver.

6
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,640
How can you call a driver for a motorbike?

7
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Let's leave together.
The driver will be here soon.

8
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,840
You suddenly stepped out during dinner.

9
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,760
Why are you so down after returning?

10
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,400
Miss.

11
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,520
It's fine that you monitor me
during meetings.

12
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,920
Why are you monitoring me at dinner too?

13
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
This is workplace abuse.

14
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,800
But Ruoxin,

15
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,200
I still can't believe

16
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
that you really gave up the opportunity
to go to the headquarters.

17
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,440
I think

18
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,320
what someone said makes sense.

19
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,760
My mom is getting old.

20
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,240
I don't feel at ease
that she's alone in Shanghai.

21
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,560
If something happens again

22
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,000
and there's no one nice to help her,

23
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
I'd be too far away to do anything.

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
I'll regret it then.

25
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Are you reluctant to leave me…

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Us?

27
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Of course I'm reluctant to leave you.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,440
Where can I find such a good assistant?

29
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
Ruoxin.

30
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
After Mr. Xu leaves this time,

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
he doesn't need to come back again, right?

32
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,520
You don't want Mr. Xu back that badly?

33
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,040
We're able to come this far

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
all thanks to Mr. Xu.

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
So we should thank him.

36
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
Now that Mr. Xu is gone,

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
we must face the difficulties alone.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
It's fine, Ruoxin.

39
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,080
After he leaves, you still have me.
I can help you deal with difficulties.

40
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,480
- Should I thank you in advance then?
- You're welcome.

41
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,399
But Mr. Xu treats you differently.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,440
You didn't go with him this time.

43
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,880
Won't you regret it?

44
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,320
What are you trying to say?

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
I mean,

46
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,720
I feel like the way
Mr. Xu looks at you is weird.

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
He's especially nice to you
and tries to hit on you.

48
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
He takes you to gatherings
and looks at houses.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Aren't you interested in him?

50
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
So you think I'm a gold digger, right?

51
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,240
Of course not.

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,040
I know you're not that kind of person.

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,800
But aside from being rich,

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,080
Mr. Xu's qualifications are quite good.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,720
I just want to know

56
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
why you rejected him.

57
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,400
Since you rejected him,

58
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,720
why did you give him…

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Have you watched the movie <i>Love
After Love</i> based on Eileen Chang's book?

60
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,640
If you understand the movie,

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
you'll know the reason.

62
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
LOVE AFTER LOVE BY EILEEN CHANG

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
SYNOPSIS, ABOUT THE AUTHOR

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,320
Su Yang, have you watched <i>Love After Love</i>?

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
"Weilong.

66
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,480
I can't marry you.

67
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,240
And I can't promise to love you.

68
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,640
I can only promise to make you happy."

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,040
I only remember that scumbag's line.

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
You mean

71
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,480
Ruoxin is saying
that Xu Minjie is a scumbag?

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,560
What are you talking about?

73
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,920
Today, I asked Ruoxin

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,280
why she didn't fall for Xu Minjie.

75
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Then she said,

76
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,480
"You'll know
after watching <i>Love After Love</i>."

77
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
What's the meaning of this?

78
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,960
Based on Xu Minjie's character,

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,120
he must be the rich businessman
named Situ…

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,120
What was it again?

81
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,760
- Xie.
- Yes, Situ Xie.

82
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
Don't worry.

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
Ge Weilong doesn't like him at all.

84
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,840
She likes Qiao Qiqiao.

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,480
So to Ruoxin,

86
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,120
Xu Minjie isn't Qiao Qiqiao, right?

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,240
Didn't Ruoxin decide not to go with him?

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,720
What are you worried about?

89
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,840
But the way they looked
at each other today is different.

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Ruoxin even gave him…

91
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you jealous?

92
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,600
Do you have anyone to be jealous of?

93
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,920
Pick up your laundry.

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,600
SIJIA

95
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,960
No way.

96
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,800
- Qi Xiao.
- What brings you here?

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,560
Information fee.

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
Put it on my tab first. Tell me.

99
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm here to see Ruoxin.

100
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,400
What's the matter?

101
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,240
Is Ruan Ye up to no good again?

102
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,160
Not this time.

103
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
The bid winner
for the new energy project's ad agency

104
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
is signing the contract with us now.

105
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Mr. Liu said that our previous contract

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,840
with the ad agency has already expired,

107
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,120
so we should let this ad agency handle

108
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,440
the ads for conventional
fuel vehicles as well.

109
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,240
This is the first time that I see him
make things easier for the company.

110
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Did Ruoxin agree?

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,600
Ruoxin must report this to Mr. Xu.

112
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Mr. Xu said yes.

113
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
This is so unnatural
that I'm afraid it's a trick.

114
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,800
I have to go.
I need to revise the contract.

115
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,280
Sijia.

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,760
I saw your post on social media.

117
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,720
Did you go to a gathering this weekend?

118
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,400
I enrolled in an online
finance class before.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,840
Everyone enjoyed chatting with each other,
so we met up once.

120
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,760
What's the matter?

121
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,520
What's going on between you and Su Yang?

122
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,040
He seems to be in a bad mood every day.

123
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,400
He's a mess.

124
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,440
He actually quite like you.

125
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Just give him one more chance.

126
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
Qi Xiao.

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,560
If you're the one telling me

128
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,480
that he likes me,

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,400
how else do you think
I can give him a chance?

130
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,720
I'll get going or Mr. Ruan Ye's secretary
will pick on me again.

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
What now?

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,840
One last question.

133
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,960
Have you watched <i>Love After Love</i>?

134
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,920
Yes.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,720
Analyze it for me
from a female perspective.

136
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
What does it mean?

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,080
It's basically saying

138
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,280
that women are corrupted

139
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,000
by pretty clothes,

140
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,960
jewelry, parties,

141
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
and love.

142
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,800
Your daughter is quite pretty.

143
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
She has a master's degree?

144
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,640
It's not easy to meet someone
with her level of education.

145
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,400
Sir, well…

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
My daughter is highly educated,

147
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
but she was always studying in school.

148
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
She's very innocent.

149
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
Look.

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,520
- On my phone, I have lots--
- That's enough.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,920
She's so well-educated.

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
It's too much.

153
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Mr. Song.

154
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,880
What you said

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,880
is right

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
and wrong too.

157
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
My daughter has a master's degree too.

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
Even now, she's still single.

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,720
In saying that it's too much,

160
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
who is too much for whom?

161
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,000
As a parent, I don't understand

162
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,040
where have all the good
and high-quality men gone?

163
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,720
Look.

164
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,240
If the girl has a master's degree,

165
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,480
the guy should at least have
a doctorate degree, right?

166
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,160
"Girls marry high, guys marry low."

167
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
The old saying is true.

168
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
It seems like

169
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,600
we should find one
with an undergraduate degree.

170
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,160
I'm a teacher.

171
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,520
To me,

172
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,080
whether she has a doctorate,
master's, or undergraduate degree,

173
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,600
these girls are all outstanding enough.

174
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,800
- Did you get that?
- But I don't understand.

175
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,400
In this era,

176
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,680
why don't they have an advantage

177
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,280
in terms of marriage?

178
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,280
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

179
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Ma'am.

180
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Let me tell you something.

181
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,160
Actually, my daughter
has a doctorate degree.

182
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,400
But I don't dare to tell them here.

183
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,880
When people hear her level of education,

184
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,720
they're all scared off.

185
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
They won't even talk to you.

186
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,200
I understand.

187
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,160
Ma'am.

188
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,720
- Let's talk more.
- This must be your first time here.

189
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,920
- I'm Xiaomei, your customer service agent.
- Okay. Your event doesn't suit me.

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
Think about it,
I raised my daughter so well.

191
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,760
I never thought of letting
my daughter marry high.

192
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,240
But I can't bear

193
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
to place my daughter on your platform

194
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,600
and let people pick her
like a piece of vegetable.

195
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,440
There are so many
outstanding girls these days.

196
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,960
Outstanding boys

197
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,760
- are too few.
- Ma'am.

198
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,440
Listen. You may not know
since it's your first time here.

199
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,920
Our event mainly aims to set up a platform
and opportunity for people.

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
This kind of community event
is more for public welfare.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,400
It's indeed a bit low-end.

202
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,520
But we also have
a high-end blind date event.

203
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,800
It's only for our members,
and our members are all verified.

204
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,880
They work in the top 500 companies
and studied in universities

205
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,840
included in Projects 985 and 211.
So it's easier to get a match.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,760
- That doesn't sound bad.
- Yes.

207
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,760
And you know what, ma'am? You're right.

208
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,720
Outstanding young men and women

209
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,000
just work all the time.

210
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,360
They have no time to socialize
and make new friends, so…

211
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,320
Our platform's mission
is to help them choose

212
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,040
high-quality members
and meticulously find a match for them.

213
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,400
The chance of success is extremely high.

214
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,160
What's your annual fee

215
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,760
for members?

216
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,000
- Our annual membership fee is 5,000 yuan.
- 5,000 yuan?

217
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,920
- It's too expensive.
- Listen to me, ma'am.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,600
This is about one's life happiness.

219
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,000
To be honest, it's not expensive at all.

220
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,200
I'll show you.

221
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Look.

222
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
Those who found partners within a year

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,280
are 80%.

224
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,280
The remaining 20% can buy the second-year
membership at half the price.

225
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,800
If you haven't found someone
you like in two years,

226
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,240
we promise to fully refund
your membership fees.

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
Or you can choose to be

228
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,160
a lifetime member for free.

229
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Look.

230
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,160
Here is the basic information
about the high-quality male members.

231
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
- Look, they're from Qinghua, Peking…
- And Fudan University.

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,960
We have a blind date event coming up.
Your daughter can come.

233
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,720
Take a look at this.

234
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,000
He's from overseas.

235
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,920
Mom.

236
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,680
You're home? Why are you so late today?

237
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,480
You didn't even reply to my texts.

238
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,240
Kitty.

239
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,160
Are you hungry?

240
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Look.

241
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,800
What did you buy?

242
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,600
What is it?

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,920
These are your favorite mooncakes
from Guangmingcun.

244
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,840
I checked out a company today.

245
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,720
What company?

246
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Health supplements or bed frames?

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Am I that stupid?

248
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,960
I signed you up for this.

249
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,880
AISI MARRIAGE COMPANY

250
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,320
What is that, Mom?

251
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
A marriage company?

252
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,480
You want me to find a match there?

253
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,120
These platforms are scams.

254
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,320
People basically use dating agencies.

255
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,880
That's why

256
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
I especially

257
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,240
went and checked that company.

258
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
This company is pretty solid.

259
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,360
They showed me all the male members'
information on their computer.

260
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,880
That's why I registered you as a member.

261
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
Tomorrow,

262
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,960
they happen to have a blind date party.

263
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,440
You can go there after work.

264
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
Don't forget.

265
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,000
You have to dress up nicely

266
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,400
and beautifully.

267
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
My goodness.

268
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,000
The membership fee is so expensive,
several thousand yuan.

269
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
No.

270
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,760
I got the regular one.

271
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,920
The regular one is several thousand too.

272
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
Look at you.

273
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,240
Last time, you finally went on
a three-day trip with food and lodging.

274
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,600
But you refused to pay
for a 300-dollar tour group.

275
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,520
Why are you so generous about this now?

276
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,200
I'm using my own money.

277
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,760
It's none of your business.

278
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,240
Mom, that's not what I meant.

279
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,560
Baby.

280
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,840
Can you let me finish first?

281
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,480
You're not going to Shenzhen, right?

282
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Get serious

283
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,800
and hurry to get

284
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,200
yourself married

285
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
before you turn 35.

286
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Xinxin.

287
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,560
I can't be with you forever.

288
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
But while I'm alive,

289
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
I hope to see

290
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,880
that person

291
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,280
love you,

292
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
console you,

293
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,800
and give you a nice dream.

294
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,720
In this world of ours,

295
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,760
please believe in yourself.

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,680
I, Shen Ruoxin, am the best.

297
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,200
I will.

298
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
Besides,

299
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,680
the girl from this company told me this.

300
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,920
In a year,

301
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,319
80% of their members managed
to find a partner.

302
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,359
If you still can't find one
after two years,

303
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,640
the membership fee can be fully refunded.

304
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,599
Give yourself two years.

305
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,920
After two years,
if you still can't find anyone,

306
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,360
I won't talk about it anymore.

307
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,640
This matter

308
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,000
is over.

309
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,280
Mom.

310
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,200
Such a company may not exist
after two years.

311
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,760
I'll go.

312
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,160
I'll definitely attend.

313
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,360
I'll dress up nicely and go.

314
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,080
That's more like it.

315
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I've already added you
to their group chat.

316
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,440
They'll inform you

317
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,800
of the location and information
about tomorrow's event.

318
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,120
I'm really impressed by their way
of doing sales.

319
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,600
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,880
Come on.

321
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,320
- I'll pick out an outfit for you.
- It's okay, Mom. I can do it by myself.

322
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,040
No.

323
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,880
Stop!

324
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,880
What's the matter?
Are you too excited to have breakfast?

325
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,520
Mom, I'm not eating breakfast.

326
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,760
I'll just buy some buns downstairs.

327
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
You're making me upset.

328
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,960
What about the dress I picked out
for you last night?

329
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,400
Mom, I wore that bridesmaid dress
at my cousin's wedding over ten years ago.

330
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
I can't wear that anymore.

331
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you mean
you can't wear that anymore?

332
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,840
Wasn't it fine last night?

333
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Why can't you wear it today?

334
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,080
The customer service agent said,

335
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,640
"During blind dates,

336
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,600
they're most afraid of office attire.

337
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,720
It's intimidating."

338
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,480
Good girl.

339
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
To go on a blind date,

340
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,600
you have to be girly

341
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,560
and look young.

342
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,560
Mom, I'm 34 years old.

343
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
I can't pretend to be young anymore.

344
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,840
You can.

345
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,640
- You can. Listen to me. Come on.
- Mom.

346
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
Change into the clothes
you wore yesterday.

347
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,600
- Mom.
- Change your clothes.

348
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,600
Also,

349
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,720
did you memorize the questionnaire?

350
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,840
Interests in baking
and flower arrangement.

351
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,000
Recent hobby is taking your mom on trips.

352
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,040
Pretty princess, look ahead.

353
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,040
Baby.

354
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Look back and smile at me.

355
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,240
You're so beautiful.
You look like you're just 18 years old.

356
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,040
This is the kind of video
I want to upload in the group chat

357
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,640
and show Xiaomei.

358
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,680
- So pretty.
- Mom, I'm going to be late for work. Stop.

359
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,200
Take a picture as soon as you get there.

360
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,480
Ask Xiaomei if you have any questions.

361
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,000
She'll answer them one by one.

362
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, smile. Smile for me…

363
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,840
Here.

364
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,680
If you meet someone you like, don't elope.

365
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,200
So beautiful.

366
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,080
BLIND DATE EVENT INVITATION

367
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,640
Good morning.

368
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,280
Good morning.

369
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,560
<i>Don't be nervous about the first event,
Ms. Shen Ruoxin.</i>

370
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,560
<i>Don't forget.</i>

371
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,360
<i>Raise your mate value
and lower your partner's uncertainty.</i>

372
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,040
I have plans. I'll go first.

373
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Okay.

374
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,760
Ruoxin.

375
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,320
Why are you following me?

376
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,120
My motorcycle broke down.
Can I catch a ride with you home?

377
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,760
I have something to do later.

378
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Get in.

379
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,120
Qi Xiao.

380
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
Do you have plans for later?

381
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,840
No.

382
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,520
Then go on a blind date with me.

383
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,240
This is the first time I heard about
bringing an assistant to a blind date.

384
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,080
If I go there alone,
it would be very awkward.

385
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,560
Just think of it
as spending time with your sister.

386
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,680
You're not willing to go?

387
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
I am.

388
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,880
But can I go without signing up?

389
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,880
Yes.

390
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
The customer service agent
told me yesterday.

391
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,160
The membership fee for women
is 5,000 yuan,

392
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,640
but only 280 yuan for men.

393
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
They're very short on guys.

394
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,840
They'll be so grateful if I bring a guy.

395
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,080
That's so sexist.

396
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,560
Now I'm curious.

397
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,600
I can go and experience it then.

398
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,240
You're not hoping
to find a girl there, do you?

399
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm telling you. Today is all about me.

400
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,160
What are you saying?

401
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,720
I'm going there to protect you.

402
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,480
Hello. This is my business card.

403
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,520
My surname is Shen.

404
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,200
Hello, Ms. Shen.

405
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,040
Ms. Shen.

406
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,000
How many relationships have you had?

407
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,680
<i>On blind dates, it's important
to lower his uncertainty</i>

408
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
<i>and pique his attention.</i>

409
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,720
"PU" means partner's uncertainty.

410
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,400
The higher the uncertainty,
the higher the insecurity.

411
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,040
The lesser the uncertainty,
the stronger the confidence

412
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,480
and he will make more moves.

413
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,600
It's unrealistic for those
in their thirties to have zero experience.

414
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,560
The best answer is
one to three relationships.

415
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,080
Don't say more than three.

416
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,200
I've only had one real relationship.

417
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,240
But in the end,

418
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,080
we didn't get married.

419
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,400
Ms. Shen, I wonder

420
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,520
if you have any hobbies and interests?

421
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,680
<i>Increasing MV is as important</i>

422
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
<i>as lowering PU.</i>

423
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
What is MV?

424
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,440
It's mate value.

425
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,720
A woman's mate value
is not in terms of success at work.

426
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,760
It's whether you can be a good wife

427
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,480
and mom in the future.

428
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,680
So for your hobby, you must mention

429
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
baking, painting, and flower arrangements.

430
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,280
These three are the safest.

431
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,480
<i>If you say that you're preparing
to study child psychology,</i>

432
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,120
trust me.

433
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm sure he'll be attracted to you.

434
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm usually quite busy with work.

435
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
When I come home from work,
I like to stay in bed and order food.

436
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,000
I learned Taekwondo before
and self-defense.

437
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,120
But I was too busy with work later on,

438
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,520
so I didn't continue.

439
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,480
I feel like I'm not that healthy lately,

440
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,520
so I want to learn boxing too.

441
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
I see.

442
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,000
You've had very few relationships.

443
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,280
I wonder

444
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,160
why it didn't work out.

445
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,520
<i>Reason for break up.</i>

446
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,160
<i>It's best to say that it was
due to geographical reasons.</i>

447
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,120
<i>Don't forget.</i>

448
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
<i>Don't show your aggressive side.</i>

449
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,040
That's the most dangerous question
that increases PU.

450
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,040
Why did we break up?

451
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,400
Perhaps

452
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,960
I don't like him enough.

453
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,960
Even though he was perfect in every way,

454
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,520
he didn't make my heart flutter.

455
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,080
I have a speech
in the Bund Center this Friday.

456
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,080
I wonder if you're interested in going.

457
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,640
I don't think I can make it.

458
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,600
I promised my best friend

459
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,360
that I'll go to a bar with her.

460
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,440
A bar?

461
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,760
<i>Don't ever say you like going to bars.</i>

462
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,400
<i>It's suicide.</i>

463
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,880
<i>Not only does it increase PU,</i>

464
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,560
<i>but it also clears out MV.</i>

465
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,560
I'm not old.

466
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,560
I just graduated from college this year.
We're the same age.

467
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
Hello.

468
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
- Hello.
- Hey, add me on WeChat.

469
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
Yes.

470
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,760
- Add me on WeChat.
- Sorry, my phone's battery died.

471
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm sorry.

472
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,880
<i>How is it going?</i>

473
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,840
<i>How is it going?</i>

474
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,960
<i>Answer me. How is it going?</i>

475
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840
<i>How is it going?</i>

476
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,320
<i>Ms. Shen.</i>

477
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,840
<i>Based on our established plan,</i>

478
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,080
<i>you must like at least two members, right?</i>

479
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,480
<i>Why don't you tell me about them?
I'll give you some advice.</i>

480
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,920
- You're Ms. Shen, right?
- Yes.

481
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,200
We had too little time earlier.

482
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,320
I didn't get to introduce myself well.

483
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
I'm Fang Da.

484
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,120
This is my business card.

485
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,520
FANG DA

486
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,560
- You're also in alternative energy?
- Yes.

487
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,240
You're also in alternative energy?

488
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,840
What kind of business do you do?

489
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
Zenpro Automotive.

490
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,120
New energy vehicle.

491
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,800
What's the matter?

492
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,560
You don't think a lady should work
on new energy vehicles?

493
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,520
No.

494
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,960
It's just quite unique.

495
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,800
Most of your co-workers
must be men, right?

496
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,960
Under those circumstances,
why would you need to go on a blind date?

497
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,640
Ms. Shen, you must be
a very ambitious woman.

498
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,360
You're a Capricorn, I presume?

499
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,920
Excuse me.

500
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,560
Excuse me, miss.

501
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
Let's chat.

502
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,720
Excuse me.

503
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,920
We're not done yet. Please wait a moment.

504
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,320
Sorry, I can't wait.

505
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,720
She doesn't seem interested
in chatting with you.

506
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,160
Young man.

507
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,320
I think

508
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,280
either you've misunderstood yourself,

509
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,200
or you've misunderstood this lady.

510
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,040
This lady has way more
experience than you.

511
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
If she eats with you,

512
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,800
she'll be bored.

513
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,000
Those young girls there suit you more.

514
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,680
So this is your type.

515
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,720
Older women like to wear pink
to look young.

516
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,480
She thinks she's an old princess.

517
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,400
What's wrong with older women?
I like older women.

518
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,640
What do you care?

519
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,440
- Are you crazy?
- Can you cure that?

520
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
Qi Xiao.

521
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,800
I dragged you to the event.
Do you know what you looked like just now?

522
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,920
Among them, you were like
a sheep that fell into a pack of wolves.

523
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
They wanted to eat you.

524
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,440
How dare you laugh at me?

525
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,480
Yes.

526
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,640
I originally thought

527
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,680
that this blind date event
might be reliable.

528
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,560
What if I find the right man for me?

529
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,720
But after the customer service agent
coached me yesterday, I was shocked.

530
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,280
I've lost all interest.

531
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,480
What? "Increase MV and lower PU?"

532
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,040
Would that person still be me?

533
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,640
Why am I putting on such a show?
Isn't that tiring? Can I pretend forever?

534
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,880
Why should I do that?

535
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,680
To get those men
who like watching such shows?

536
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,000
You don't have to pretend.

537
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
You're amazing just the way you are.

538
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,440
I don't believe
what the customer service agent said.

539
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,000
Because

540
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,360
I was serious earlier.

541
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,280
What do you mean?

542
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,120
We should've eaten more earlier.

543
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,720
My mom spent 5,000 yuan.

544
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
What a waste.

545
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,680
Mom, you're home?

546
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,400
Why are you home so early?

547
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,000
You met some people you like, right?

548
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,480
No.

549
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,200
How come?

550
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,720
Xiaomei said that if you do as she said,

551
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,280
you'll meet at least three or four guys.

552
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,200
You can find out more about them.

553
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,640
I did what she said.

554
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,240
No one suitable caught my eye at all.

555
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,720
What do you mean then?

556
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,720
That means they can introduce you to them,

557
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
but you're the one who doesn't like them.

558
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,360
No, Mom.

559
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,480
I won't be able
to find anyone suitable there.

560
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,920
I'll tell the customer service agent
to get you a refund now.

561
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
Why?

562
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,920
I brought Qi Xiao there today
and you know what?

563
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Before I left,

564
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
what did they say?

565
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,840
Let me show you.

566
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,120
They asked Qi Xiao to sign up

567
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,280
and sent him
the female members' information.

568
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,800
She's cute.

569
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,480
She's a colleague of ours, You Sijia.

570
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,760
I just called her.

571
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
She never joined.

572
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,160
Do you know that none
of her information is true?

573
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,040
You have been scammed.

574
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
But don't worry.

575
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,920
I'll surely find a way
to get your money back.

576
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,440
Or I'll ask my friend to send them
a lawyer's letter.

577
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,639
No.

578
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,679
That means

579
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,280
all the male members' information
they showed me

580
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,719
might all be fake?

581
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,400
They're mostly fake members.

582
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,600
So this place is unreliable.

583
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,360
Don't expect anything from it, okay?

584
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,320
You spend money recklessly.

585
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,440
She really didn't understand what I said,

586
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,679
or did she tactfully reject me?

587
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?

588
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,080
Qi Xiao.

589
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,600
I want to ask you something.

590
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,440
Go ahead.

591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,160
Do you think Sijia really signed up

592
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,280
to be a member of that blind date company?

593
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,040
Didn't Ruoxin say

594
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,280
that she didn't?

595
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,560
What if she's just
too embarrassed to admit it?

596
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,840
Su Yang.

597
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,680
I think you're quite interesting.

598
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,200
When she pursued you,

599
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,360
you turned her down.

600
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,880
Now you're worried
if she's having blind dates?

601
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,480
Besides,

602
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,680
she's single.

603
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,040
Even if she goes on a blind date,
is that your business?

604
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
Can you do anything about it?

605
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,720
I told you before.

606
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,520
If you really like her, get her back.

607
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
Blind date companies

608
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,080
are even using You Sijia's photo
in their promotional album.

609
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,280
What does that mean?

610
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,400
It means that
in their professional opinion,

611
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,680
girls like You Sijia are very popular.

612
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,360
If you don't act now,
someone will pursue her.

613
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,280
You can't do anything even if you cry.
Do you understand?

614
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,640
If you do, go to sleep.

615
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,600
Get out.

616
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,920
You startled me
in the middle of the night.

617
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,760
Go to bed.

618
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,120
Go away.

619
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,440
What's wrong with older women?
I like older women.

620
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,480
What do you care?

621
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,280
<i>Because</i>

622
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,080
I was serious earlier.

623
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,560
Does he like me?

624
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,080
What's wrong with kids nowadays?

625
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,360
How can you easily say that you like me?

626
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,280
You're over ten years younger than me.
What do you mean you like me?

627
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,000
So what if
I'm over ten years younger than you?

628
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,120
I like you.

629
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,880
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

630
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,520
Have you had breakfast?

631
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,240
Yes.

632
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,040
What about you?

633
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,480
I did.

634
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,200
I'll buy you coffee later.

635
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,680
Why did you go to the 26th floor?

636
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,160
I went to see Mr. Liu
to get this month's sales summary report.

637
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,200
It's way worse than we expected.

638
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,920
I'll go to the store right away.

639
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,240
Contact the ad agency.

640
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,600
Ask them to submit
the ad placement layouts

641
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,600
- and ad performance.
- Okay.

642
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Hello?

643
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,080
Everything's fine at the shop.

644
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,520
Many customers are interested

645
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,200
in finding out more
about our new energy cars.

646
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,120
There's a problem on the ad agency's side.

647
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,480
There's been a 60% cut
on the ad space we originally planned.

648
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,520
They were allocated
to the conventional car models.

649
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
A 60% cut?

650
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,320
Get me an appointment
with the ad agency's manager.

651
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,720
I need to talk to them.

652
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,160
I already did.

653
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,040
But they referred us to the contract.

654
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,720
Indeed, it doesn't specify

655
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,080
the ad expense percentage
for conventional models

656
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,720
and new energy cars.

657
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,040
<i>Also, Mr. Liu was the one who told them</i>

658
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,840
<i>to increase the percentage
for conventional car models.</i>

659
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
Mr. Liu?

660
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,840
<i>Yes.</i>

661
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,800
I got it.

662
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,120
Come in.

663
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,600
Excuse me, Mr. Liu. I need to talk to you.

664
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,080
Ms. Shen.

665
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,480
I wanted to talk to you too.

666
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,680
See for yourself.

667
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,360
This month,

668
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,840
new energy cars
aren't selling well enough.

669
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,120
The group invested heavily
in the new energy business.

670
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,920
The test-drive event went well.

671
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,040
But having a great start and a bad result
can't be justified, right?

672
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,440
Mr. Liu.

673
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,240
I'll report to Mr. Xu
about the new energy cars' sales.

674
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I came to discuss something
with you today.

675
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,600
The ad agency we're using now

676
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,920
is the one who won
the new energy cars' bid.

677
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,400
It's fine if we use the same agency.

678
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,800
But did you make a mistake
with the ad placement percentage?

679
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,840
The company always follows
the previous year's advertising budget.

680
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,840
Is there a problem?

681
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,000
If that's the case,
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

682
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,760
Perhaps the ad agency
didn't sort things out properly.

683
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,800
In that case,
I must add a supplemental agreement

684
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,600
to the ad agency's contract.

685
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,920
We'll indicate the ad placement percentage

686
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,480
for new energy cars and
conventional models' annual ad expenses.

687
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,120
It's fine if we use the same agency.

688
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,520
However, we must ensure

689
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,440
our expected ad placement percentage.

690
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,200
Adding a supplementary agreement is fine.

691
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,520
But you should report this
to Mr. Xu as well.

692
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,680
Why did you come to me?

693
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,960
Let me tell you.

694
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,080
This quarter's ads
have already been released.

695
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,080
If we replace them now,
we'll suffer a loss.

696
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,000
The ad agency will demand additional fees.

697
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,120
If Mr. Xu is willing to bear the loss,

698
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,120
then I don't have any objection.

699
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:28,840
