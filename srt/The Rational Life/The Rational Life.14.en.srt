1
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,680
THESE FOUR FACTORS ARE
KILLING YOUR HEALTH!

2
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,480
Don't believe them, Mom.

3
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
They're making all this up.

4
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,960
How are you these days?

5
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,920
Are you taking medicine regularly
for your high blood pressure?

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
I'll be back this weekend.

7
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Be good.

8
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,120
<i>Mr. Xu.</i>

9
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,960
<i>Last night, my reaction</i>

10
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,920
<i>have caused you to misunderstand.</i>

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
<i>I'm actually very happy</i>

12
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,680
<i>to learn from you
in the New Energy Department.</i>

13
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>Don't worry.</i>

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
- You scared me.
- What?

15
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,120
You scared me.

16
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,040
What are you doing, Ruoxin?

17
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Are you

18
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
waiting for me?

19
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,680
As if.

20
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,360
Ruoxin.

21
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,000
Why aren't you wearing
the birthday gift I gave you?

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
How many likes did you get on
your WeChat post yesterday?

23
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,680
Show me.

24
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh no.

25
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,600
I forgot to create groups.

26
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,520
What?

27
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I had so much fun yesterday
and posted it on WeChat.

28
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,680
I forgot to block out
our colleagues and my boss.

29
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
What's the big deal? It was your birthday.

30
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,840
I never block out anyone on my posts.

31
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,000
What do you know?

32
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
Which group do I belong to?

33
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll go get some coffee.

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,840
What?

35
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,800
This way.

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
Hey, guys. He's our new colleague.

37
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,120
- Your desk is over here.
- Thank you.

38
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Hello, my name is Su Yang.

39
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,240
I'm the company's new designer.

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,280
I look forward to working with you.

41
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
Your first job?

42
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,480
Kind of.

43
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,360
I used to freelance at home.

44
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,400
Work hard.

45
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,960
You'll get a drumstick for lunch.

46
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,280
- Then I'll make you some coffee.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
Ruoxin.

48
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,280
We've adjusted the new energy car's

49
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,920
test-drive event proposal
and press list with Mr. Xu last night.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,320
Please take a look.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Some parts require other departments
to coordinate with us.

52
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
If it's okay with you, we'll get started.

53
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,080
All of you had a meeting last night?

54
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,120
Yes, Mr. Xu worked four hours
of overtime with us last night.

55
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm so tired.

56
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,920
This is Mr. Xu's new assistant.

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Shen.

58
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm Li Xiaole.

59
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,720
Just call me Xiaole.

60
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Mr. Xu said that he's troubled you

61
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
with miscellaneous work.

62
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,360
He'd like you to do a handover soon
so I can learn more from you.

63
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,400
I heard Mr. Xu was
looking for an assistant.

64
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,040
Who knew he'd be so quick?

65
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Actually, I was at last night's meeting.

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
It's officially my first day here.

67
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,160
I look forward to learning from you.

68
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
We should learn from each other.

69
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,480
- This way.
- Okay.

70
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Try my new black tea.

71
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
What are you thinking about?

72
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,120
Are you worried that

73
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,160
you stood Mr. Xu up yesterday?

74
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
- Is he angry?
- Why would he?

75
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,640
Why would Mr. Xu be so petty?

76
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,760
He's the boss.

77
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,920
We just have to do our jobs well.

78
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,400
By the way,

79
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I just came up with
two new ideas for the test-drive event.

80
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,400
Let's go through them later.

81
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Qi Xiao.

82
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,400
What is it?

83
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,840
You looked so happy.

84
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,120
Did Ruoxin accept your love confession?

85
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,160
There's no love confession.

86
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
But I'm sure about one thing.

87
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Ruoxin definitely doesn't fancy Mr. Xu.

88
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,640
She's only with Mr. Xu simply for work.

89
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,920
And Mr. Xu has a new assistant now.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Ruoxin won't have to help so often.

91
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,280
In that case,

92
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,320
you should confess your feelings
to Ruoxin.

93
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,440
That won't do.

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,800
She's working hard
to sort things out with Mr. Xu.

95
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,080
And the new energy car
is about to be tested.

96
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
I can't cause any trouble for her now.

97
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,120
Besides,

98
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,480
I haven't figured out yet
how to woo a girl like Ruoxin.

99
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,760
Are you still the super confident

100
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600
Qi Xiao that I knew?

101
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I knew it. We all have our nemesis.

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,520
Tell me.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,640
What's the matter?

104
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,120
What's your nemesis?

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,040
You can tell?

106
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
The subway station is there.

107
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
You came all the way here.
Are you walking me home?

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,120
I'll be honest with you then.

109
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,880
Well…

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,880
I heard

111
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,799
that Su Yang got a new job.

112
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,280
I want to celebrate with him.

113
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,240
That's it?

114
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,080
Go ahead without me.

115
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,400
I've taken the initiative many times.

116
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,600
Don't I have any pride?

117
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,000
If you ask Su Yang out for me,

118
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,320
I'll buy you breakfast for a week.

119
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,040
Two weeks.

120
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
Tell me. Where to?

121
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040
It's definitely the first stop
for youngsters to relieve stress.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,880
Let's go.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Ms. Shen.

124
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
- Are you looking for Mr. Xu?
- Yes.

125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,000
Mr. Xu has a phone meeting
with the headquarters.

126
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,000
Are there any documents for him?

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,440
It's okay.

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,240
I need to report to him.

129
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,280
I'll come back later.

130
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,520
- Okay.
- Thank you.

131
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,920
Hello, may I help you?

132
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,480
Hello, can I get a bottle
of that orange-flavored soda?

133
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,640
Thank you. How much?

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
- Five yuan.
- Okay.

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,360
Su Yang, since when
do you like this flavor?

136
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,280
Yesterday, I saw Sijia liked it.

137
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,400
Well, as your best friend,
do you know what I like to drink?

138
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,760
Your mom said
that beverages are unhealthy.

139
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
You always listen to your mom.

140
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,920
That's why you don't like them.

141
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,800
Water.

142
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,520
Thank you.

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,200
You look so cool in this.

144
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Don't just thank him.

145
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
He bought it especially for you.

146
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
Why do you care?

147
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
Su Yang, put on the vest.

148
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
Here.

149
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,120
Be careful.

150
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,160
I didn't know you liked this.

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
Not really.

152
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,680
Last year, when our department
did team building,

153
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
I came to check it out.

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,120
But Ruoxin didn't choose it.

155
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,400
I've always wanted to try this.

156
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,800
If I come alone,

157
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,960
I can't play this.

158
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Seven o'clock, assemble.

159
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,640
We're dividing you into teams.

160
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,600
Okay.

161
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,800
We can't hide here forever.

162
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,360
In the last round,
I died in three minutes.

163
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,160
I want to live longer this time.

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,720
All right.

165
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,680
Let's go fire a round for fun.

166
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
I'll be the vanguard later.

167
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,720
You two, watch my back.

168
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,680
How is it?

169
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
Are you all gone?

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Wait for me.

171
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
No one's here.

172
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
You're so loud. They'll come rushing over.

173
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,160
Su Yang, there's someone here.

174
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Cover me!

175
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Su Yang, I told you to cover me.

176
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,640
Don't just save the damsel in distress.

177
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,320
I told you to cover for me.

178
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,880
500 yuan for 3 minutes and we're all dead.

179
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
Hey, You Sijia.

180
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Su Yang risked his life to save you.

181
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,920
It doesn't make sense
if you don't marry him.

182
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,560
Qi Xiao, don't be mean.

183
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
What are you talking about?

184
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,120
Sijia is a girl.

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
It's normal to protect girls.

186
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,400
Last time, when we went rafting,

187
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,600
didn't I also protect Luoluo and Xinyi?

188
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,800
Where are you going, Sijia?

189
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm not Luoluo or Xinyi.

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,320
I don't need your protection.

191
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
What's wrong with her?

192
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,920
What did I do?

193
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,920
That's about it.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,320
- Okay?
- Yes.

195
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,760
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Hold on.

196
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,400
Here, Qi Xiao.

197
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,800
All right.

198
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

199
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,360
Sijia.

200
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,720
It's on Mr. Su today.

201
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,920
Let's order more.

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Yes, order some more.

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,840
No.

204
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,480
I'm just like the other girls.

205
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't want to get fat. I'm on a diet.

206
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,400
You're not fat.

207
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,520
Besides, you'll still look great
even if you're fat.

208
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,640
I'm serious.

209
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Enjoy your meal.

210
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
Let's eat.

211
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,080
Su Yang,

212
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
have some meat.

213
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,080
Have some of this.

214
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,680
Thank you.

215
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,520
Some people are showing PDA.

216
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,880
I can only sit and watch.

217
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,920
What are you talking about?

218
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,040
Then, go confess your love to Ruoxin too.

219
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,040
Don't tell me you haven't decided
how to confess to Ruoxin?

220
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,760
It's not a question of how to say it.

221
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,400
It's not like she's in her twenties.

222
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,160
Sweet talk isn't enough
to make her heart flutter.

223
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
She's independent, mature,
and she has her own ideas.

224
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,920
I don't even know
what kind of boyfriend she wants.

225
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,560
If I tell her how I feel,
she'll think I'm childish.

226
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,680
Still, you should do something.

227
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,880
You can't mull over some matters.

228
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,360
Once it's been dragged out,

229
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
you lose the momentum.

230
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,640
A mature woman like Ruoxin,

231
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
she's busy with work and career-oriented.

232
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,680
Why don't you give her flowers every day

233
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,240
and buy her breakfast?

234
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,440
You both work for the same company anyway.

235
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,480
That won't work.

236
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,280
That's what Mr. Cui did.

237
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,280
He cooked and brought lunch
for her to the office every day.

238
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,320
Ruoxin avoided him like a plague.

239
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,280
The outcome, as you both know,

240
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,480
the considerate Mr. Cui

241
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
is now her ex-boyfriend.

242
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,560
It doesn't work because
Mr. Cui is the submissive one.

243
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,000
Like Mr. Xu,

244
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,600
it doesn't work either,
he spends generously on her.

245
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,280
The needs of a mature woman,

246
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,640
it's really hard to figure out.

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,440
The person I like,

248
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
she must be the most special one.

249
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,120
It's insincere to play any tactics.

250
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,600
What? Eat up.

251
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,440
Sort out the records of
the phone meeting soon.

252
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Once I've checked,

253
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,200
send a copy of each to the participants.

254
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,640
- Send a copy to the chairman.
- Okay.

255
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,000
It's too late tonight.

256
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,520
You should go home.

257
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,920
Head home for dinner.

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
What about you, Mr. Xu?

259
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
I have other work to do.

260
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't mind me.

261
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll drive.

262
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,040
Take care.

263
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,520
Thank you.

264
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,240
Ms. Shen.

265
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,920
Mr. Xu.

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
You're still here?

267
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
I have some work to report to you.

268
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,560
This is where the cars for
our test-drive event will be parked.

269
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,360
This entire area.

270
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,640
This is the event venue.

271
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,440
The theme board for the event

272
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
will be built here.

273
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,920
There's also a small interactive stage.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The preliminary address
of the test-drive event

275
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
is now somewhere near Shanghai.

276
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
As for the exact location,
Qi Xiao is still checking.

277
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,960
The venue looks nice.

278
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,280
By the way, Mr. Xu,

279
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,480
the report on eco-friendly feasibility,

280
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,720
I've had it done.

281
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Take a look.

282
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,200
It turned out very well.

283
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,359
All the families we interviewed
are very interested in it.

284
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
I think

285
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,880
this project is doable.

286
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll write up the details soon

287
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,040
and list a few specific directions
and suggestions.

288
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,599
I'll try to get it ready to discuss
with everyone at Thursday's meeting.

289
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,960
Good.

290
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,160
Very good.

291
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

292
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Mr. Xu.

293
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,040
In fact, today,

294
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,800
I've been meaning to talk to you.

295
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,480
About what?

296
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,560
About last night.

297
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,880
You are my right-hand woman.

298
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,040
As for that,

299
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,840
that means more to me than you being just

300
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,520
an attractive and charming woman.

301
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,720
Don't worry.

302
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,040
I, Xu Minjie, am not a despicable boss.

303
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Thank you, sir.

304
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,560
Thank you for giving me
so many opportunities at work.

305
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,800
You earned all of this.

306
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,720
I won't hire someone incompetent.

307
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,920
By the way, Li Xiaole is my new assistant.

308
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,960
Once he gets used to the job,

309
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,960
you can hand over some
of my personal matters to him.

310
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
I was hoping you'd make time

311
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,600
to continue working on coordinating
the East China region

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,080
as well as spend more time

313
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,680
on the market

314
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,520
and the operations of new energy
in the East China region.

315
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,920
If you're interested, of course.

316
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,920
Thank you, sir.

317
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm very interested.

318
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
Head home early.

319
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,520
Good night.

320
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,920
Good night.

321
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
What does Ruoxin need?

322
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,000
Try it and see if it's comfortable.

323
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,240
Is this for me?

324
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,200
Don't tell me you made this.

325
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,840
No way.

326
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,320
I bought it online.

327
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,200
You bought it online?

328
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,840
You have to give it a bad review.

329
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,320
It's a bit rustic.

330
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,920
You also tidied these up?

331
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,720
Your desk is a mess.

332
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,000
So I helped you with it.

333
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,040
Let me try this cushion
and see if it's comfortable.

334
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,000
It's quite nice.

335
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,560
It's so soft.

336
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,120
How do I clean this?

337
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,960
There's a zip.

338
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,080
There's a zip.

339
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
You can unzip it to wash it.

340
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,240
Got it.

341
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
It can also be on the desk
to use as a pillow.

342
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,360
Let me try.

343
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,000
So comfy.

344
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,600
When I nap during lunch break,
I get to sleep like this.

345
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I'm getting sleepy lying down like this.

346
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,760
Thank you.

347
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm sorry.

348
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,880
This is bad!

349
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,120
It's pretty serious!

350
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,360
Let's take a look.

351
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,280
Young man.

352
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,000
Help!

353
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Help!

354
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
Don't be scared. I'll call the ambulance.

355
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,400
I'll call an ambulance for you.

356
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,440
My cell phone?

357
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,600
- What's going on, ma'am?
- My cell phone!

358
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,480
- Call the ambulance.
- Okay, I'll do it.

359
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,280
- I'll do it.
- Call an ambulance.

360
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,200
Young man!

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
I really don't know what happened.

362
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,480
I crossed when it was the green light.

363
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
In a second,

364
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,240
I was dizzy and I fell to the ground.

365
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,760
He also fell to the ground.

366
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,360
He was covered in blood.

367
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,640
Ma'am, don't worry.

368
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,400
There are cameras everywhere.

369
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,640
Whatever happened, who was responsible,

370
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,920
the police will find out.

371
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
This isn't the time

372
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,720
to discuss who is responsible.

373
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,160
Look at him.

374
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,800
He's covered in blood now.

375
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,000
If something happens to him,

376
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,400
I'll feel uneasy.

377
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,560
It's okay.

378
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,440
Ma'am, you're hurt too.

379
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
Ma'am, let me help you.

380
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,000
Be careful.

381
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,440
Be careful.

382
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,680
- Come on.
- No.

383
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,560
How can it be this hospital?

384
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,720
Let's go to another hospital.

385
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,840
Ma'am, this is the only hospital
in this area.

386
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,560
- Your hand should get checked.
- No.

387
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,960
Ma'am, you should come too.

388
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,360
No, let's go to another hospital.

389
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,760
You called an ambulance.
Why did you pick the hospital?

390
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
- That's right, ma'am. Let's go.
- Come on.

391
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,240
- Wait, my hand.
- Slowly.

392
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,480
Ma'am.

393
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,680
- Here. Drink some water.
- Okay, thank you.

394
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Ma'am, I've already paid the fees
and checked on the delivery guy.

395
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,400
He's quite alert.

396
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,760
It shouldn't be a problem.

397
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Don't worry.

398
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,200
Here's your phone and the bill.

399
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,640
By the way, ma'am, do you have a family?

400
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,080
Should I contact them?

401
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
There's no need.

402
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
My daughter is busy with work.

403
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,480
I mustn't disturb her.

404
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,120
How can that be?

405
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,600
There's a lot to handle.

406
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,120
Your arm needs to get checked too.

407
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,480
It's okay. I'm fine on my own. I…

408
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm really okay.

409
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
Young man.

410
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
You've been running around
taking care of matters for me.

411
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,560
If you have work to do,

412
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,120
just go ahead.

413
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Thank you.

414
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,840
Are you really okay on your own?

415
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm really okay.

416
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,320
Nurse.

417
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,840
Where's the delivery guy
who had an accident?

418
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,880
Are they both here?

419
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,080
The lady is here.

420
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,840
The police are here.

421
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,480
What do you think?

422
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,760
I think we should increase
the number of reporters.

423
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,960
Excuse me, sir.

424
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,680
It's Qi Xiao.

425
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,800
I told him to call the driver.
Something might have happened.

426
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
I'll answer the call.

427
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,040
Hello, Qi Xiao?

428
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,720
Mom?

429
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,440
Mom.

430
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,200
How was it?

431
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,200
Where are you hurt?

432
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,920
I'm fine.

433
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
The delivery guy went to get a brain CT.

434
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
I wonder if he's okay.

435
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,880
Ruoxin.

436
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,440
What a coincidence.

437
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,760
Did you drop off my mom?

438
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,200
I broke my phone.

439
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,640
I had to borrow his phone.

440
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
When I dialed,

441
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
you answered.

442
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,040
So you're his manager?

443
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,320
I owe it to this young man today.

444
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,560
You should've called me right away.

445
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,880
Do you want me to panic?

446
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
If the police didn't come,
I wouldn't have called you.

447
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Let me see your hand.

448
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,960
Ruoxin.

449
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Mr. Xu.

450
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,360
I just called the traffic police.
They've checked the CCTV footage.

451
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,800
Your mom crossed the street

452
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
on a green light
via the pedestrian crossing.

453
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,600
It's the delivery guy's fault.

454
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,920
Thank you--

455
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,720
You little girl,
why can't you get it right?

456
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,040
Why did you bring a stranger here?

457
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,560
To make your mom look bad?

458
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Who is he?

459
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,040
This is my boss.

460
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,280
We're going to check out the venue
and you suddenly called.

461
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
I panicked, okay? Mr. Xu drove me here.

462
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,600
- Mr. Xu--
- Don't, ma'am. Stay put!

463
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,800
- Hello, ma'am. I'm Xu Minjie.
- Nice to meet you.

464
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Your cell phone is smashed.

465
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,480
Are you okay?

466
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
- I'm okay.
- That's good.

467
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,200
Ruoxin.

468
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,200
My friend is a reputable doctor.

469
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
I'll give him a call later.

470
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,160
Once the delivery guy's CT scan is out,

471
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,200
I'll send him the film.

472
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,960
It's easier for you to decide.

473
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,400
Thank you so much, Mr. Xu.

474
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,280
Don't be so polite with me.

475
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,840
Don't worry, ma'am.

476
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,760
Have a seat.

477
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
This is the guy you told me about,

478
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,240
the new boss who appreciates you?

479
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
That's right.

480
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Is he married?

481
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
Mom, what are you saying?

482
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,480
Our relationship is professional.

483
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,720
I don't think so.

484
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
A reputable doctor?

485
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,680
They're done with it.

486
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,640
Slowly.

487
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,920
Slowly.

488
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,800
Young man, how do you feel now?

489
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
You really scared me just now.

490
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,240
There's blood all over your head.

491
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,520
I'm just a little dizzy.

492
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,040
Is your family here?

493
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,840
The company will send someone.

494
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,760
The police said it's all my fault.

495
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Ma'am, I really…

496
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,280
My hospital bill…

497
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,240
Listen to me.

498
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,760
You can't get too worked up.

499
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,360
You're fine. That's what matters.

500
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,280
The doctor will be here soon.

501
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,880
You got hurt at work.

502
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,880
The platform will cover your insurance,

503
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
so don't worry.

504
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
Xiaoxin.

505
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,480
Dad.

506
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Enemy.

507
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
Look at me.

508
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,920
Move your head.

509
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm dizzy.

510
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,960
Which side?

511
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,800
This way or this way?

512
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,960
This way.

513
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,160
This way as well.

514
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,080
After the impact on the brain,

515
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,880
you'll feel dizzy
and nauseous for a while.

516
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,160
It's normal.

517
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,760
But if it's just a minor concussion,

518
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,320
it won't show on the CT scan.

519
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,840
You'll need an MRI scan.

520
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,080
Mom, have a seat.

521
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,960
Slowly.

522
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Let me see.

523
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,680
- Ruoxin.
- Yes?

524
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
Your dad is such a kind doctor.

525
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,080
That's right.

526
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,160
We only met good guys today.

527
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Does it hurt?

528
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,640
Sir.

529
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,480
- Okay.
- Dad.

530
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,240
Xiaoxin, judging from his current state,

531
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,400
it's nothing serious.

532
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Once their employees get here,
they can take him home.

533
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,080
Okay.

534
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,040
I'll prescribe some headache medicine.

535
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,640
If it gets better,

536
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,640
after some time,

537
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
he should get another CT scan.

538
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,880
It doesn't seem serious.

539
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Don't worry.

540
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,840
Yilan,

541
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,600
I heard you got hit? Are you okay?

542
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,840
Thanks to you, it was just a scare.

543
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
I'm fine.

544
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,600
No, Ms. Zhou.

545
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,000
Didn't you hurt your arm?

546
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,640
Hey, kid.

547
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,560
Why are you such a blabbermouth?

548
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,480
Here.

549
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,240
Let me see. Left or right?
Lift it up. Show me.

550
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,000
I said it's fine.

551
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,400
Mom, why are you so stubborn?

552
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,880
Your health is more important.

553
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,160
Right?

554
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Whose side are you on?

555
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,720
All these years,

556
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,080
you still have the same temper.

557
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,680
We all care about you.

558
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,400
Thank you for your kindness.

559
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,680
Come on. Lift it up.

560
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,680
Mom!

561
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,720
Xiaoxin, take your mom for a CT scan.

562
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,320
- I got it.
- Okay.

563
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,240
Ma'am.

564
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
I've made a call.

565
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,760
You came at the right time.

566
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,080
Please come over here.

567
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,800
This is

568
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,960
Xinxin's friend.

569
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,560
The president of a car company.

570
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,920
He knew I was hurt so he came over.

571
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,400
Xinxin has a good job.

572
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,920
She's now a senior manager.

573
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,120
She'll be promoted to director soon.

574
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,600
Okay.

575
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,960
I'm glad you're all doing well.

576
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Of course.

577
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,640
You don't have to worry about us at all.

578
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Otherwise, why would you leave?

579
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
How can I let you down?

580
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Shen--

581
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,640
Let me introduce you.

582
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,120
This is Xinxin's dad.

583
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,160
I am

584
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,800
the ex-husband of Ruoxin's mom.

585
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,520
- Hello, Mr. Shen.
- Hello.

586
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,960
- I'm Xu Minjie.
- Hello.

587
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,120
Come on.

588
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,760
Why do you talk so much today?

589
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,600
No one takes you for a mute
if you don't talk.

590
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,280
Ex-husband, my ass.

591
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,040
Are you promoting yourself
as an ex-husband?

592
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
You should play TikTok.

593
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Get on the headlines.

594
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,080
Be an ex-husband influencer.

595
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,800
Mom, stop it.

596
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,520
Let's go get you scanned.

597
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,880
Your mom's arm was hurt?

598
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
It's just a small injury.

599
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
Don't listen to him.

600
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,160
Let's get you scanned. Behave!

601
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,760
- Come on.
- Here, Ms. Zhou.

602
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,920
Why won't you behave?

603
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,680
Be careful, Mom.

604
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,480
Ms. Zhou.

605
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,760
Hairline fracture is pretty serious.

606
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,000
Ruoxin, I have a friend
who runs a top-notch private hospital.

607
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,960
It's nearby.

608
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,440
It shouldn't be a problem for me
to get a VIP ward.

609
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,320
Ms. Zhou, why don't you
recuperate there for some time?

610
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,160
It takes 100 days for a bone to mend.
Don't take it lightly.

611
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,280
It's okay, Mr. Xu.

612
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,640
I can take care of my mom.

613
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,240
Mom, move in with me tonight.

614
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
A hairline fracture needs recuperation.

615
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,560
I thought you'd be too busy

616
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
to look after her.

617
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,080
Besides,

618
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,040
it takes energy to look after your mom.

619
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,400
You're a girl.

620
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,760
Isn't that too hard on you?

621
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,280
It's okay, Mr. Xu. She has me.

622
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,200
I live downstairs.

623
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,480
I'm always ready to help.

624
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,840
Thank you, Xiaoxu.

625
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,240
I appreciate the thought.

626
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,000
But look at this hairline fracture.

627
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,440
It's now in a cast.

628
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,640
I can still move my fingers.

629
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
Thank you so much, but I won't bother you.

630
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,680
Okay, I'll take you home.

631
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,040
Okay, thank you.

632
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,560
Ms. Zhou, look.

633
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,400
You're being too polite again.

634
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,480
Xiaole, drive the car to the entrance.

635
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,639
Thank you, sir.

636
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,120
Mom, be careful.

637
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,520
Watch your arm.

638
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,600
Xiaoxin.

639
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,880
Come here for a second.

640
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,800
- Dad.
- Xiaoxin.

641
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,360
Your mom's injury, it's nothing serious,

642
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,920
but the pain will last for a week.

643
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,760
She's very impatient.
It'll be hard for her to endure the pain.

644
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,880
Be more patient with her.

645
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
Don't worry, Dad. I'll take care of her.

646
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,600
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

647
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Thank you, sir.

648
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,960
Thank you.

649
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,200
They're gone.

650
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,240
What about me?

651
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,200
I did a good deed,

652
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,920
but I didn't even get a compliment.

653
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,240
SHEN RUOXIN

654
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
You still remember to call me.

655
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,640
At least you have a conscience.

656
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,920
Ruoxin.

657
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,960
Qi Xiao.

658
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,440
I'm going home to take care of my mom,
so I won't be at the office today.

659
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,440
When you get there,

660
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,160
please take care of other matters.

661
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,000
I emailed you the to-do list.
You need to check it.

662
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,000
What?

663
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,840
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

664
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,200
No, it's fine.

665
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,160
But I can only get back
to the office in two hours.

666
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,600
I need to get my motorcycle.

667
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
I'm hanging up.

668
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,320
<i>By the way, thanks for today.</i>

669
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,640
You were a big help.

670
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
I owe you big time.

671
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,160
It's okay. It's my duty.

672
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,360
Take good care of your mom.
I'm hanging up.

673
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,800
Ms. Zhou.

674
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
I saw that your phone was broken.

675
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,120
A friend gave me a new phone as a gift.

676
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,720
I left it in the car. I haven't used it.

677
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
If you don't mind,

678
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
you can use it first.

679
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,200
How can I?

680
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,960
I cannot accept what's not mine.

681
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,360
Mr. Xu.

682
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
You did us a great favor just now.

683
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,760
I should thank you.

684
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,360
How can I accept your gift?

685
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,240
Take it. Thank you.

686
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
You don't have to be so polite.

687
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Also,

688
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,520
I like how you called me

689
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,320
"Xiaoxu" just now.

690
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,200
All the more reason to apologize.

691
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,080
I was in a panic just now.
I don't mean to call you that.

692
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,520
You're Xinxin's boss.

693
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,200
How can I call you "Xiaoxu"?

694
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,000
I should call you "Mr. Xu."

695
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,480
Mr. Xu.

696
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Ms. Zhou, you're the elderly.

697
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,920
You can surely call me "Xiaoxu."

698
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,040
You're too kind.

699
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,440
Then I'll try…

700
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,280
I'll try calling you "Xiaoxu."

701
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,200
- Xiaoxu.
- Yes.

702
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,960
Look at you.

703
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,800
At such a young age,

704
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,720
you are already in a very high position.

705
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,960
You must be really competent, right?

706
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,120
I'm too flattered.

707
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,160
I'm just lucky.

708
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,680
But I don't get it either.

709
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,280
Young people these days,
don't you always wear your wedding ring?

710
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You don't have a wedding ring.

711
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,200
Are you still single?

712
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,400
- You shouldn't be.
- Mom, why are you talking about this?

713
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
You're right.

714
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,680
I'm still single.

715
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,160
Well,

716
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,640
I haven't found someone
who can make me settle down.

717
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,360
So you really are still single.

718
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,280
It's good that you're single.

719
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,120
Men get married late.

720
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,480
Don't be so lucky.

721
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,480
If I were you, I also wouldn't settle down

722
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,320
with someone so soon.

723
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,960
But look at you.

724
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,080
You're rich and powerful.

725
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,360
You're so handsome too.

726
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm sure you'll get into
quite a bit of trouble?

727
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,760
The young ladies will swarm all over you.

728
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,160
But that's okay.

729
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,080
This is life.

730
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,960
Living nonchalantly for once

731
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,280
won't leave you any regrets.

732
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,560
I never thought

733
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,440
that you're actually
so ahead of time, Ms. Zhou.

734
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,600
Did you hear that?

735
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,240
Have some water, Mr. Pan.

736
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,240
Thank you.

737
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,520
Thank you for choosing our company.

738
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,120
I'll work with you

739
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
to design your cover.

740
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,280
Let me know if you have any requests.

741
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,440
You should know

742
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,800
that our book

743
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,840
is about movies.

744
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,120
Cinema is art.

745
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,160
So, the cover design…

746
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,320
It surely has to be meticulous, right?

747
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
What's your preferred style?

748
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,800
The style…

749
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,840
It has to be elegant.

750
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,040
Let me tell you,

751
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,440
I don't want the mystifying type.

752
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,560
Let's not go artistic.

753
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
The overall vibe

754
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,040
should be more down-to-earth, right?

755
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,360
Take a look at this.

756
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,000
Do you have any preference for the colors?

757
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,880
Then we can base it on the colors
to decide on an overall tone.

758
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,680
Color scheme.

759
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,120
As for the color scheme,

760
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,360
plain and elegant.

761
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,000
It has to be plain and elegant.

762
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,920
Don't do any colorful stuff.

763
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
It's too tacky.

764
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,160
However,

765
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,120
it still has to stand out.

766
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,280
When it's placed there,

767
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,640
it has to be eye-catching.

768
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,600
Do you get it?

769
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
You guys are professionals.

770
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,560
These are just small requests.

771
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,680
For you,

772
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,040
it's just a piece of cake.

773
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,160
If you have any previous projects,

774
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,520
you can recommend them to me, okay?

775
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,920
Let me take a look.

776
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,240
Thank you.

777
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,200
Slowly, Mom.

778
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,080
Be careful, Ms. Zhou.

779
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,880
- Xiaoxu.
- Yes?

780
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm really tired today.

781
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,800
Otherwise,

782
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,040
we would invite you upstairs.

783
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,160
You're a big boss.

784
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,480
You must be very busy.

785
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,600
I've held you up until now.

786
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,560
I'm sorry.

787
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,000
Mr. Xu.

788
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,160
I can go with my mom.

789
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,960
Thank you so much for today.

790
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm sorry for delaying
the test-drive event.

791
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,040
Don't worry.

792
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
I texted Ms. Zhang on WeChat

793
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,080
to follow up on the exhibition.

794
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,800
Take a day off today.

795
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,560
Stay at home with your mom.

796
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,240
Ms. Zhou, I'll get going then.

797
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,640
Tell Ruoxin to send me WeChat
if anything comes up.

798
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
Get well soon.

799
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you.

800
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,160
- Bye.
- Bye.

801
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,600
- Goodbye, Mr. Xu.
- Okay.

802
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,280
- Take care, Ms. Zhou.
- Bye.

803
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,000
Take care.

804
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,000
Mom.

805
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,280
Just now in the car,

806
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,080
why did you speak
a lot of nonsense to Mr. Xu?

807
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,600
What nonsense?

808
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,680
That Mr. Xu, I can tell right away.

809
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,600
- He's so kind to us today.
- Slowly.

810
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,880
He fancies you.

811
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
Slowly.

812
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,040
He's my boss.

813
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,680
Yes.

814
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,560
Just know that he's your boss.

815
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,080
When picking a man,

816
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,040
don't get the good-looking one.

817
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,200
He has a car, a house, and money. So what?

818
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,840
He doesn't care about you.

819
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,200
Why did I like Xiaocui?

820
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,320
Because he really loves you.

821
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,520
If you choose Mr. Xu,

822
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,160
the first half of your life
will be a passion,

823
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,160
the second half will be family,

824
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,760
and in between are all
extramarital affairs.

825
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,440
Listen to yourself.

826
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,640
That's so mean.

827
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,160
Do I sound mean?

828
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,600
Mr. Xu is all talk and no cider.

829
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,320
He's a man
who would leave no traces behind.

830
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,040
Do you believe me?

831
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,800
If he's in Beijing,

832
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,680
he must want to eat grilled duck.

833
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,880
If he's in Guangzhou,

834
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,680
he'll crave a piece of roasted pork.

835
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,560
Now that he's in Shanghai,

836
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,680
a dumpling like you,

837
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,960
he's never tasted it before.

838
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
A big bite.

839
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,160
He's just tasting it for fun.

840
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,800
How old are you, my dear?

841
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,200
Can you afford to waste time?

842
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,640
A big bite?

843
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,440
If you don't like Mr. Xu,

844
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,640
at the hospital earlier,

845
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,640
why do you act like you know him so well?

846
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
What were you doing?

847
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,960
You're using him to show off to Dad?

848
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,920
You win.

849
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm going to take a shower.

850
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,160
