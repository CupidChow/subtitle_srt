1
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
Why are you staring at me like that?

2
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm not.

3
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
Eat up.

4
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
You can't even stay quiet
while having porridge.

5
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Stay still.

6
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,720
Ruoxin.

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
- Sijia.
- Ruoxin.

8
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,280
Take a seat.

9
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,840
- Ruoxin, how are you feeling?
- I'm feeling better.

10
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
That's great.

11
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,560
I brought you some clothes.

12
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,720
- Take a look, are they correct?
- Yes, they are correct.

13
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Thank you, Sijia. It's correct.

14
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Why are you being so polite?

15
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,240
Qi Xiao, why don't you go home first?

16
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,400
Sijia can accompany me.

17
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm fine. I'm not leaving.

18
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm staying here tonight.

19
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,680
What are you saying? Go home and rest.

20
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,000
I need you to fight for me.

21
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,360
Don't worry, everything is fine.

22
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Plus, if something happened tonight,

23
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,880
Sijia is a girl, how can she help?

24
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,840
Right?

25
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,840
That's right.

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,560
Ruoxin, I can't accompany you tonight.

27
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,320
I have a movie date later.

28
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,520
You're going on a date?

29
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,480
With who?

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,360
Sijia, you can't be dating, right?

31
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
What about Su Yang?

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
- No, I'm calling Su Yang.
- No need.

33
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,560
He…

34
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,680
He already knows about it.

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,240
What did he say?

36
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,520
He said…

37
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,560
He can join in.

38
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Join in?

39
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,880
What's going on?

40
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,960
- The three of you--
- Qi Xiao, are you dumb?

41
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,560
Sijia is with Su Yang.

42
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
Is that true?

43
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
When did this happen?

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,040
Why didn't I know anything?

45
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,040
He's doing this to me now.

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,240
We talked about it just now.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,640
Don't bother about him, just go.

48
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay.

49
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,440
Ruoxin, rest well
and take good care of yourself.

50
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,120
Bye.

51
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Bye.

52
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,720
Qi Xiao.

53
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you dumb?

54
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
I just didn't realize it.

55
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
Hello, everyone.

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,200
We'll be going back to Shanghai tomorrow.

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,360
We've visited all the attractions
in the ancient town.

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,080
You'll have free time today.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,440
You can buy some souvenirs
for your relatives and friends.

60
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,240
But if you want to eat at the hotel,
be back before 6 p.m.

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
We won't wait beyond that time.

62
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,320
That isn't right, guide.

63
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,960
In the itinerary, wasn't there a temple
that's efficacious for marriage?

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
- Yes, that temple.
- Did we go?

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,880
That…

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
It's over there.

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,600
But there's a distance.

68
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Let's go.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,440
- It's for the children.
- That's right.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
What time should we be back?

71
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,080
- At 6 p.m.
- Come back to eat at 6 p.m.

72
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,760
We've been walking so far.

73
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,200
Where's this temple for marriage?

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,400
Let's go further.

75
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,760
Do you want to take a rest?

76
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,400
I'll go ask someone.

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,040
Ma'am, excuse me.

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Do you know if there's a temple here?

79
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,840
Temple?

80
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
No.

81
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
There is no temple.

82
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,520
That isn't right.

83
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
The guide said there's a temple
that's efficacious for marriage.

84
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,560
We want to seek blessings
for our children.

85
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
It's not a temple.

86
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,200
It's this tree here.

87
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,320
What?

88
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,240
Isn't this just a normal tree?

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Don't simply say anything.

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,880
This isn't a normal tree.

91
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,200
This tree here

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,640
was planted by Confucius 3,000 years ago.

93
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,880
It's very efficacious.

94
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,240
Especially for marriage.
It's very effective.

95
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Boys and girls from all over
come here to ask for blessings.

96
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Look, the tree is full of ribbons.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
How can we do this?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
Tie a ribbon to a copper coin
and throw it up.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,000
The higher you throw,

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,800
the faster fate will come.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
All right?

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,920
Where can we buy the ribbon and coin?

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Here.

104
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,000
I have it.

105
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Have a look.

106
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
How much are these?

107
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,920
A ribbon is 50 yuan
and a coin is 100 yuan.

108
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,480
Do you believe what she said?

109
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,680
Is Confucius known for marriage?

110
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,280
She's sitting under this tree.

111
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,840
She thinks she's a God of Marriage.

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,240
She's just putting on coins to the ribbons

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,120
and says that the tree
was planted by Confucius.

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,440
The tree that Confucius planted
is at the Kong Family Mansion in Shandong.

115
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,720
This tree has been here for 3,000 years?

116
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
Let me take a look.

117
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
It's just 100 years maximum.

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,640
Let's go, it's a scam.

119
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
Don't go.

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,520
We can discuss it.

121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Why not…

122
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,840
I'll give you two ribbons and two coins.

123
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,840
150 yuan in total, all right?

124
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
150 yuan.

125
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,280
It's cheap.

126
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,080
Here's the coin.

127
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,240
Ma'am, are you taking advantage of us?

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,880
Is this a copper coin?

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,520
Yes.

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,480
It's plastic.

131
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,440
Don't think that
it's written as "copper coin" on top,

132
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,440
so we'll take it as a copper coin.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
I think you are very greedy.

134
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,400
Let's talk things out, okay?

135
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Give me a reasonable price.

136
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
It's a business, let's make it simple.

137
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
Fifty yuan!

138
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,920
You're crazy.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
- Fifty yuan--
- You must be crazy.

140
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,440
Didn't you hear what she said?

141
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,720
She's here to do business.

142
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,120
How can we get blessings from here?

143
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,360
She's with the tour group here to scam us.

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,440
Fifty yuan is fine.

145
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,320
You'll scan mine or I'll scan yours?
WeChat or Alipay is fine.

146
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,120
- Just a scan.
- Let's go!

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,160
Thirty yuan then?

148
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,280
Twenty yuan, okay?

149
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
Twenty yuan is the lowest,
take it or leave it.

150
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
Five yuan, last price.

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
Ten yuan, it's the lowest.

152
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,400
Ten yuan for both of us.

153
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,600
Fine, all right.

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,080
I still feel that she's even lying now.

155
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,600
Since we are here and we've come this far,

156
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,880
let's take it
as a local customs experience.

157
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll need to tell my daughter
that I've sought blessings for her.

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
That's right.

159
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,480
- I'm done.
- You are done?

160
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,240
Just tie a knot.

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,760
A slip knot or a dead knot?

162
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,200
Isn't there a rule for the knot?

163
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,360
Anything is fine.

164
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,800
Just tie it tightly.

165
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,960
- Tightly.
- Shall I pray first?

166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,720
Then tell my child's name
and what I'm praying for?

167
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,760
As you like, just say it in your heart
and tell it faster.

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,120
I'll need to go home soon.

169
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
All right, I'm done.

170
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,760
Okay, just throw it up strongly.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,840
- Throw it higher.
- One, two, and three.

172
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,200
It's up there!

173
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,600
Excuse me, ma'am. Can you hurry up?

174
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
Have you tied it?

175
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,400
You just need to throw it up.

176
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
- How should I throw this?
- Just throw it up.

177
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
- Here, one, two, and three.
- Three.

178
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
It's up there now, isn't it?

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,960
Look, mine is a bit higher than yours.

180
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Didn't she say that the higher the better?

181
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
That's right.

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,640
Congratulations to you.

183
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,040
I hope you'll get a good son-in-law soon.

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
Thank you for your wishes.

185
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,760
I hope you'll get
a good daughter-in-law soon.

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,360
That's good.

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,040
Let's go.

188
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

189
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

190
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,200
May our wishes come true.

191
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
We're even sillier than her.

192
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
We got cheated.

193
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
Never mind, it's just five yuan each.

194
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,760
It's not much.

195
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,840
This isn't about money.

196
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,480
Cheating is wrong.

197
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,920
They said that people in ancient towns
are honest and simple.

198
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,000
I think she's quite crafty.

199
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
Forget about it, Yilan.

200
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,520
That's how traveling is, isn't it?

201
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,800
I want to buy a souvenir for my son.

202
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,640
Let's have a look at the souvenirs.

203
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,080
Buy one for your daughter too.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,680
Let's just take a look.
It's just in front, let's go.

205
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,600
Hurry up.

206
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,160
This is so cute.

207
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
Look, is this nice?

208
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,080
What's the purpose of this?

209
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,640
My son likes this kind of thing.

210
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,760
I'll pick one for him.

211
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,000
He likes designing and crafting.

212
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,920
You really know your son well.

213
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,960
My daughter is different.

214
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
Whatever that I buy,
she'll say that it's old-fashioned.

215
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,200
She won't use it.

216
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,600
It's very difficult to please her.

217
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
That's why

218
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,520
I don't buy her things anymore.

219
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Yilan, it's actually easy to realize
what your child likes or not.

220
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,440
Just look at what she likes to buy.

221
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,080
As moms, aren't we buying gifts
for our children out of goodwill?

222
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
It doesn't matter if she doesn't use it.

223
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,440
She can feel your care for her
just by looking at it, isn't it?

224
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,640
My daughter doesn't think that way.

225
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
The things she likes…

226
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,040
I think she likes bottles.

227
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,840
For tea, coffee, and juices,
all the bottles are different.

228
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,960
What a fussy exquisite.

229
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,120
Yilan, everyone has their hobby.

230
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Just like my son who likes…

231
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,640
What did you say? She likes bottles?

232
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,960
Come with me.

233
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,960
Here, come, hurry up.
I'll take you to a place.

234
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,720
Here, come.

235
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I saw this.

236
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,960
Look at this.

237
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,800
I saw this heating bottle earlier.

238
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,200
Let's ask the boss.

239
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,400
How does the heating work?

240
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,400
This bottle? It's very convenient.

241
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,200
Just add the water in it,
press this button

242
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,080
and it'll become hot water.

243
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,560
For tea or to heat the milk,
it's very easy.

244
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,360
It doesn't take up space in the bag.

245
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,360
Look, I think your daughter will like it.

246
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,240
She's so busy with her work,
she must care about efficiency, right?

247
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,920
To drink hot water in the winter,
you'll need to boil it.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,480
With this, she can have hot water anytime.

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,240
There's really everything now.

250
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Sir, are there any other colors?

251
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,560
Other colors? Let me look for it.

252
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,040
Boss, please give us a discount.

253
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,000
No problem.

254
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,240
This is quite cute.

255
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
It's all bottles here.

256
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,400
Here.

257
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,080
Thank you.

258
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,040
Is it still painful?

259
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,240
Just some normal pain.

260
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,160
Right.

261
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,560
I saw this book with a bookmark
on the sofa,

262
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,920
so I took it here for you.

263
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm feeling quite bored now.

264
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,560
Ruoxin, 30 years of solitude isn't enough?

265
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,560
You want "one hundred years of solitude"?

266
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,680
What do you know?

267
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
This is a literary classic.

268
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,840
I know it.

269
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,480
Anyway, I don't want you to be alone.

270
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm not lonely.

271
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm so busy in the hospital every day,
I can't wait to be discharged now.

272
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,880
Life is life, work is work.

273
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,240
But I'm here now,

274
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,800
I won't let you be alone.

275
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,840
I can't hold the book with my hand now,
can you read it for me?

276
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,760
Sure.

277
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,640
"All over the world, there won't be

278
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,360
a prettier and friendlier house

279
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,880
than this asylum.

280
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,520
She hired someone to clean the house,

281
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,360
changed the furniture,
restored the garden,

282
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,240
sowed new flower seeds,

283
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,720
and opened up the windows

284
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,800
so that the summer rays
would shine upon the bedroom."

285
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,200
"She announced the end
of her mourning period.

286
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,120
She took off her dull and old clothes

287
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,600
and put on new, youthful clothes.

288
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,520
The music of the pianola

289
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,319
made the house merry again.

290
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,079
When she heard it,

291
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,599
Amaranta remembered Pietro

292
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
and the gardenia that he was wearing

293
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,240
<i>during the sunset."</i>

294
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
Let's take a temperature.

295
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,360
It's normal.

296
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,640
I'm so jealous of you.

297
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,560
Rest well.

298
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,640
What's so great about it?

299
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
There's nothing great about it.

300
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
If you play well, you can do that too.

301
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,280
Who wants to learn?

302
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
There are so many rules.

303
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120
I'll play it the way I want.

304
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
I think

305
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,800
it's just like making friends at school.

306
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,600
Your friends will treat you
the way you treat them.

307
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,800
So now…

308
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,800
The drum is your friend.

309
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,560
You want to say something to it

310
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
and it wants to say something to you too.

311
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
You can't just think about yourself,

312
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,960
you need to cooperate with your friends.

313
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't understand what you are saying.

314
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,320
I see.

315
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
Look, although you are the one
holding the drumsticks,

316
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,120
cooperation is important too, right?

317
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,240
At this stage, you should cooperate
with your teacher.

318
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,280
Then you can learn something.

319
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,080
I saw how you played earlier.

320
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,880
You're not good at counting beats yet,

321
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,640
that's why you can't follow it
when you play.

322
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,560
You can't be stubborn.

323
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,320
You can't be perfect in the beginning.

324
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
Just like making friends,

325
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
you'll get to know each other slowly,
all right?

326
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,880
But…

327
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,880
I think my drum doesn't like me.

328
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
I've said it just now.

329
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,520
It's because you are not good
at counting beats yet,

330
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,520
so you can't follow it when you play.

331
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,480
It's not the drum that doesn't like you,

332
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,280
it's you who's being impatient.

333
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Ma'am, did you even realize this?

334
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,000
You're awesome.

335
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,680
I think if you have more patience,
you'll get better at counting beats.

336
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,440
But the condition is that

337
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,800
you need to practice more.

338
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,600
Ma'am, can you teach me?

339
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,680
I want to be friends with my drum.

340
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
I--

341
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,000
Ms. Song, you didn't tell me
that you are here.

342
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,040
I heard the drumbeats from afar.

343
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,880
I wondered who was playing so well,
so I came to have a look.

344
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,240
I just reached here a while ago.

345
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,160
I saw him playing the drum
so I took a look.

346
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,800
- I forgot to greet you.
- It's all right.

347
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,160
- Shall we talk outside?
- Sure.

348
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,320
Ma'am.

349
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,640
Can you teach me?

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
I'll let you know later, okay?

351
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,880
Ms. Song, I believe in you.

352
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,640
You have the potential
to be a good teacher.

353
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,600
I've never taught before.

354
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
And…

355
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm not a professional.

356
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
The kid's name is Midou.

357
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,720
He signed up for one-on-one teaching.

358
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,520
But he's assertive
and he has a strong personality.

359
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I've changed a few teachers for him,
yet he's not satisfied.

360
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,520
I'll soon need to refund his fees.

361
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,440
You won his heart once you came.

362
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,560
Actually, I'm not confident either…

363
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,040
Especially with kids.

364
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,920
You can give it a try.

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,520
Midou has good potential.

366
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,960
I won't force you.

367
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,640
If you think he's not up for it,
we can discuss this again.

368
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,080
What do you think?

369
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,840
Okay.

370
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,720
I'll try for one class then.

371
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,680
That's great.

372
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
QI XIAO

373
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,200
Qi Xiao, you did well.

374
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,480
Ruoxin, I finished early this afternoon.

375
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,200
I've done the inventory list
and Xiaoliu took it back to the office.

376
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,960
- I'll come to take you home earlier.
- No, don't worry.

377
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,880
I'm hanging up. My mom is calling me.

378
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Okay.

379
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,720
- Mom.
<i>- Xinxin, I'm back.</i>

380
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,000
<i>- Are you home?</i>
- Mom, I'm on a work trip.

381
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,640
But I told Ziyan to pick you up.

382
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,120
<i>Why are you on a work trip again?</i>

383
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
<i>Please tell Ziyan then.</i>

384
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
<i>I have to go now, the guide is chasing us.</i>

385
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,200
I'm hanging up. Goodbye, Mom.

386
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,080
<i>Hello, dear. It's urgent.
Please do me a favor.</i>

387
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,800
What happened? Tell me.

388
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
My mom is back.

389
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,280
That's a good thing.

390
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,000
How is that urgent?

391
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
My mom doesn't know
that I'm in the hospital.

392
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,640
You don't know how my mom is?

393
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,640
I had a sneeze last time,
she cooked me something bad.

394
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
If she finds out I had surgery this time,

395
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,160
she'll make me vomit.

396
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,080
All right, I'll go pick up your mom.

397
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,880
I told my mom that I'm on a work trip.

398
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,600
We must be consistent with our story,

399
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm getting discharged this afternoon.

400
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,240
You're nagging. Goodbye.

401
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,960
The purple one.

402
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,840
HANGZHOU TO SHANGHAI

403
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,760
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

404
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

405
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,520
Yilan!

406
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,080
- You took everything?
- Yes.

407
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,360
Don't leave anything behind.

408
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,560
I bought you a gift.

409
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,960
No, you are too kind.

410
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,160
- No.
- I cant--

411
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,680
You must accept it.

412
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,360
Take it.

413
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,240
Thank you, then.

414
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,400
- Can I open it?
- Of course.

415
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,080
Have a look and see if you like it.

416
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,880
- Such a beautiful shawl.
- That's right.

417
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,920
I'll surely keep it
until my daughter gets married

418
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and I'll wear it.

419
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,800
I'll surely invite you to the wedding.

420
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,600
That's great.

421
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,280
Yilan, since we share a bond,
you must have a meal at my house.

422
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,320
My son is very good at cooking.

423
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Then I'm inviting you to my house too.

424
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll teach you
how to make Red Bean Barley Soup.

425
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,840
You can't keep waiting for your son
to come home and cook for you.

426
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,240
You must learn.

427
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,560
That's right.

428
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
- Thank you.
- I finally have something to do.

429
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,920
Ziyan!

430
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,680
She's your daughter? So pretty.

431
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,320
No, she's my daughter's friend.

432
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,040
My daughter is busy, she's on a work trip.

433
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,320
She came to pick me up.

434
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,480
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

435
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,520
She's a friend I met during the trip.

436
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Your son isn't picking you up?

437
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,520
He has a meeting today.

438
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,320
He's stressed out.
I don't want to disturb him.

439
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,440
Then let's send her home too.

440
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,760
Sure.

441
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,280
No, don't trouble yourself.

442
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,600
I'll just grab a cab.

443
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,080
Ma'am, it's all right.
You're taking so many things.

444
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Here, I'll send you back first.

445
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,440
Then I'll send Ms. Zhou back.

446
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,560
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

447
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
- Thank you, miss.
- Let's go.

448
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,120
- Thank you.
- No worries.

449
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,960
- I'm sorry, it's quite heavy.
- It's all right.

450
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,520
The sales for the campus campaign

451
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,600
aren't as good as expected.

452
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,560
It's less than we estimated.

453
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,080
You should give it some time.

454
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,680
Buyers who find the car good
will surely recommend it.

455
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,400
It'll spread by word of mouth.

456
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
No need, I'll do it myself.

457
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,080
It's all right.

458
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,560
Right, Qi Xiao.

459
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,920
When you send me home later,
find a hotel nearby to stay at.

460
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
- I'm not going home.
- What happened?

461
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,920
My mom is back.

462
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,800
She'll find out if she sees me like this.

463
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,560
Then don't go to the hotel.
Come to my house.

464
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,280
I mean you can stay in my room,

465
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,040
I'll share a room with Su Yang.

466
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,600
Do you have a room?

467
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,160
Hello, Su Yang?

468
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,160
Go for a date with You Sijia tonight.

469
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,960
Give me some space.

470
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,440
Why? Who are you bringing home?

471
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
Ruoxin just got discharged.

472
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,720
She doesn't want her mom to find out
so she'll rest at our place for a night.

473
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,680
My goodness.

474
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,800
There's too much room for imagination.

475
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,200
Go away!

476
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
What are you thinking about?

477
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
We are very pure.

478
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,800
She just had surgery.

479
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,480
All right, I know it.

480
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,360
Okay, tidy up before you go. Goodbye.

481
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,600
Speaking of Xinxin…

482
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,720
She has always been busy.

483
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,960
It's a weekend and she's on a work trip.

484
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
Where does she have the time

485
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,920
to find a boyfriend

486
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
and have a serious relationship?

487
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,400
Ruoxin is always like this.

488
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,720
She's very hardworking.

489
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,200
She won't change anymore
since she has always been like this.

490
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,400
Ms. Zhou, don't worry.

491
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,920
She knows what she's doing.

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
Does she?

493
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,160
What does she know?

494
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,760
Ziyan, you grew up with Ruoxin.

495
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
I've seen you growing up.

496
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
Let me tell you something from my heart.

497
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm really jealous of your parents.

498
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,240
Look at you.

499
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,720
When you were at school,
you weren't the top student.

500
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,160
But you were a good kid.

501
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
When it's time for university,
you went to one.

502
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,200
When it's time to work, you worked.

503
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,840
When it's time to get married,

504
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
you got married.

505
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,600
You saved a lot of worries
for your parents.

506
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,960
Ms. Zhou,
every family has its difficulties.

507
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,240
When I argued with Zou Cheng,
you saw it too.

508
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,480
I'm getting old.

509
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,640
I can't understand everything anymore.

510
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,840
You said that you don't want to have kids.

511
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,400
Ruoxin doesn't want to get married.

512
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,000
What's wrong with you guys?

513
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,560
Ms. Zhou,
did you have fun during this trip?

514
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,480
Let me tell you,

515
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,360
it's the best season now
to visit the ancient town.

516
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,360
It's not too hot.

517
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
That's true.

518
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,280
I've been mingling around on the trip,

519
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,680
I didn't like any of their kids.

520
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,160
What a waste.

521
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,280
So you went to arrange blind dates
for Ruoxin?

522
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,240
Of course.

523
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,400
I even sought blessings for her marriage.

524
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,840
Ziyan, if you have any friends

525
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,600
or if any of your husband's colleagues
are still single,

526
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,560
introduce them to us if it's suitable.

527
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,680
No problem, Ms. Zhou.

528
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,520
If there's a suitable one,
I'll introduce him to her.

529
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,920
Thank you.

530
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,480
Come in.

531
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,880
I haven't washed my hair for many days,
it feels so oily.

532
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,080
Can I borrow the bathroom?

533
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,760
Sure, let me help you wash.

534
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,240
What?

535
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,520
I mean…

536
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
You need to bend down to wash your hair.

537
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,240
It's better if I help you.

538
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,760
Then if you help me wash it,

539
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
I don't have to bend down?

540
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,040
I can't believe you know how to wash hair.

541
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,480
That's right.

542
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,440
If I can't find a job one day,

543
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,440
I can still work at the hair salon.

544
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,520
You have such a strong desire to survive?

545
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,640
Hello?

546
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,760
<i>- You were kicked out from the house?</i>
- Yes.

547
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Qi Xiao is an ungrateful buddy.

548
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
They finally have a chance to be alone.

549
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,920
As his buddy, can't you tolerate him?

550
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,360
Am I not tolerating it out here now?

551
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,240
Don't you have some work to rush?

552
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,320
Where are you planning to go?

553
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
This bad news came suddenly.

554
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,320
I still don't know.

555
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,640
I haven't thought about it.

556
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,360
I have a perfect place.

557
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,840
It won't hold up your work
and it can inspire you.

558
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,880
<i>Are you interested?</i>

559
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,520
Yes, I'll be right there.

560
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
Su Yang.

561
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,960
I chose this one for you,
it could be helpful to you.

562
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,720
Sijia.

563
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,120
I don't think
I can continue with this job.

564
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,480
I feel like

565
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,280
I'm wasting my time every day.

566
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,800
I feel demotivated.

567
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,840
I can support you.

568
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,520
Just focus on drawing the webtoon.

569
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm your loyal fan.

570
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,640
I wish to work full time
in drawing webtoons too.

571
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,880
But living in the city
with the high expenses isn't easy.

572
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,080
It'll be easy if you are this talented.

573
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,480
Su Yang, I sent your artwork,
this image of a little cat

574
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,960
to a few of my WeChat groups.

575
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,720
Everyone likes it so much.

576
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,880
They even asked me,

577
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,280
if there's an emoji pack of this cat.

578
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,960
They are willing to pay for it.

579
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,920
Su Yang, you are very talented.

580
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,680
I have faith in you.

581
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,560
Thank you, Sijia.

582
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,480
I'm braver now after being with you.

583
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
Don't worry.

584
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,600
After saving up some money,
I'll try to work full time on it.

585
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,120
Actually, we can start
with this little cat emoji pack now.

586
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,680
I also heard that Weibo and forums
are difficult to earn money.

587
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,400
Why don't you try to open
a WeChat public account?

588
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,600
I can't.

589
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,880
Those public accounts,
with so many fans, are run by a team.

590
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,720
I don't have a team yet.

591
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,680
Didn't you say that you are braver now?

592
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,240
Why are you discouraged again?

593
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,800
You have a team too.

594
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,400
I'm your team member.

595
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,280
Keep it up.

596
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,680
Ruoxin, do you have to be so hardworking?

597
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,800
You were discharged yesterday
and you're back at work today.

598
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,400
New Energy has just started,
we can't relax now.

599
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,000
What's more,
Liu Pei and Ruan Ye are watching us.

600
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,160
I'm worried.

601
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,240
All right.

602
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,560
HOST IT IN THE RESIDENTIAL AREAS
WHERE THERE'S MORE DEMAND.

603
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,520
STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY CARS.

604
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,000
Ruoxin, look at this.

605
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,280
Why didn't we think about this?

606
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,800
Some time ago when I was
in the lift going back home,

607
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,240
I heard a couple talking about
changing their car.

608
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,240
They must be mainstream consumers.

609
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,560
This idea is quite good.

610
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,280
But if we want to enter
the residential community,

611
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,720
we need to get approval
from the management and committee.

612
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,600
Also, the best day to hold an event
is on Saturday and Sunday.

613
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,000
During weekdays, everyone is working.

614
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,160
I'll handle the committee and management.

615
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
Okay.

616
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,520
Listen to me, our time is precious.

617
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,400
Excuse me, we are really busy.

618
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,840
- No, you--
- Help yourself.

619
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,240
Don't reject me first.

620
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,160
Listen to me.

621
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,200
We just want to hold a promotional event

622
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,200
for our new energy car in the community.

623
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,240
Didn't I tell you just now?

624
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,240
No.

625
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,160
This new energy car is
strongly promoted by our country.

626
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,160
So why not?

627
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,800
Look at you, selling cars until here.

628
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,240
There are elders and children
in this community.

629
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,480
Yet you are going to do a live test-drive?

630
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,280
Tell me, is there a guarantee of safety?

631
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,480
We won't test-drive here.

632
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,920
It's guaranteed to be safe.

633
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,120
No, the exhaust smoke is strong.

634
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,360
There won't be any smoke.

635
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,000
This new energy car is made
to protect the environment.

636
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,840
Qi Xiao.

637
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,560
- Ms. Zhou.
- What are you doing here?

638
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,560
I discussed with Ruoxin
to hold a promotional event

639
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,120
for new energy cars in the community

640
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,240
so that everyone knows about our car.

641
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,960
I've been trying to persuade,
yet the community committee disagrees.

642
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,880
You are the head of our community?

643
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,600
These are young people's affairs.
You should try to be supportive.

644
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,920
Look at our community,

645
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,400
there are so many people and cars.

646
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,600
Everyone is driving a car.

647
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,240
How bad is the pollution?

648
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,040
The new energy car
that he's talking about,

649
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,240
I've heard of it.

650
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,720
Because my daughter is selling this car.

651
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
This type of new energy car
is environmentally friendly.

652
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,280
They are using batteries, not gasoline.

653
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,680
If everyone changes to this type of car,

654
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
then the air purifier at home
would be useless.

655
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,640
Ma'am, let me be honest.

656
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm worried that they will disturb others

657
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,600
and I'll get some complaints.

658
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,400
Complaints?

659
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,640
Why would they complain?

660
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,560
They are here to introduce a new car,

661
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,200
not yelling on a high-pitched speaker.

662
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,560
How is that disturbing others?

663
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
That's right.

664
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
We promise not to yell
and we'll not disturb anyone.

665
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,520
Also, they are not here for free.

666
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,720
Qi Xiao.

667
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,360
Are there any free goodies
for the event this time?

668
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,520
Yes, all signed customers
will get organic eggs.

669
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,240
Tell him that directly.

670
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,040
Sir, all of our signed customers
will get organic eggs.

671
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,080
Isn't this a great thing
that benefits everyone?

672
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,000
You should support it.

673
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
Ma'am, we'll do as you said then.

674
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,400
Thank you very much.

675
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,760
Don't shake my hand first.

676
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,040
There's one more thing.

677
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,440
Is there a program for this event?

678
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,360
Let my manager check on the program.

679
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,840
If there aren't any issues,
then we'll let you in.

680
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,880
Sure, there'll be no problem.

681
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,560
- That's it.
- Thank you, sir.

682
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,480
Thank you, sir.

683
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,680
Thank you, sir!

684
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,520
