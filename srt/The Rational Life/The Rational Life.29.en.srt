1
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,440
Hot Americano.

2
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
No milk, no sugar.

3
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,280
Why are you giving me a coffee?

4
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
What is it?

5
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,360
It's Qi Xiao.

6
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,960
He knows that
I have to buy coffee for them every day,

7
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,480
so he asked me to bring you a cup.

8
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,520
He cares about you.

9
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,840
Thank you.

10
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,680
Is Ruan Ye giving you a hard time?

11
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,520
Not really.

12
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
Anyway…

13
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,320
Anyway, it has always been like that.

14
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,440
I'll teach you something.

15
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
When Ruan Ye's assistant
picks on you again,

16
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,600
make sure everyone is present.

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Refute her outright
with a justified cause.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,120
She'll surely complain to Mr. Ruan.

19
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,480
Let her do it.

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
We want her to complain.

21
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,240
Ruan Ye is paranoid.

22
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
The tougher you are,

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,880
the more clueless he is about your plans.

24
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,240
He also can't figure out
what Mr. Xu and I will do.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,040
He'll take it down a notch.
You'll be better off. Get it?

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,240
- Thank you, Ruoxin.
- Go.

27
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,840
<i>I got the coffee.</i>

28
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,400
<i>From now on, only drink the coffee I buy.</i>

29
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>What if you forget?</i>

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>Can't I buy it myself?</i>

31
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
<i>I won't forget</i>

32
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
<i>and I'll regulate your intake.</i>

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,520
<i>Two cups a day. No overdosing.</i>

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,640
<i>How bossy.</i>

35
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,560
<i>Okay, as you wish.</i>

36
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,320
Ms. Shen.

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,800
You're smiling so sweetly this morning.

38
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Is it your boyfriend?

39
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,120
No. What is it?

40
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,160
Qi Xiao is gone.
You need another assistant.

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
We want to know
your specific requirements.

42
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,760
Preferably someone with experience
in the administration.

43
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,280
- Okay.
- If not, recruit new energy graduates

44
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
from technology universities.

45
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Okay.

46
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Preferably women.

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,120
There may be more men
from technology university graduates.

48
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,120
There are fewer women.

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,240
Wasn't your previous assistant a guy too?

50
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
Do you make this request
because you're worried

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,480
that your boyfriend will get jealous?

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
No.

53
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,720
I think a woman
will be more attentive at work.

54
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
But it's not a must.

55
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,640
What matters is that
they are reliable and diligent.

56
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
Okay, I'll screen them now.

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll send you the details
of suitable candidates.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,080
You can select some
and set the interview dates.

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
- Okay, thank you.
- I'll get back to work.

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,960
Hello? Mr. Yang.

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
It has been a while.

62
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,120
What? Do you want to buy a car from me?

63
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,880
<i>Do I have to get a new car
to look for you?</i>

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
<i>You're as enthusiastic as a micro vendor.</i>

65
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm always fighting.

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,720
<i>Listen.</i>

67
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
<i>Gu Yutao has returned.</i>

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
- Gu Yutao?
- <i>Yes.</i>

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Hasn't he been working in Singapore?

70
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,840
<i>I heard his law firm transferred him back.</i>

71
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,240
<i>An enterprise group is getting listed.</i>

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,160
<i>This time, he's back</i>

73
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
<i>and he won't leave anytime soon.</i>

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,640
<i>Let's meet up this evening.</i>

75
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
<i>We haven't seen each other for years.</i>

76
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Sure, you're our league branch secretary.

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,160
I'm glad we have you.

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
If not, we're all so busy.
It's hard to get together.

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>Gu Yutao called for this gathering.</i>

80
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,640
<i>I'm just contacting everyone.</i>

81
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,080
<i>He has booked the restaurant.</i>

82
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560
<i>It depends on whether you're free or not.</i>

83
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,600
<i>I'm just acting as his secretary.</i>

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,880
<i>Let me confirm the schedule with you.</i>

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,960
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,760
Text me the address.

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
I'll come by after work.

88
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,200
<i>Okay, see you later.</i>

89
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
See you later.

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
<i>Isn't it funny?</i>

91
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,200
Yutao.

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
Did your wife come back
with you this time?

93
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,280
You said you got married.

94
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,720
We didn't get to attend it.

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
When will we get to meet

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,280
the legendary Mrs. Gu?

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,440
- That's right.
- Yes.

98
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,560
To be honest,

99
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
I've been divorced for two years.

100
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,720
Actually, at our age,

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,200
it isn't necessarily bad to get divorced.

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
Since we don't get along,

104
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
why bother staying together?

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
That's right.
Just find someone more suitable.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,280
Right?

107
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
Mr. Gu here is good-looking.
An eligible bachelor.

108
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,680
Shouldn't young ladies
be throwing themselves at you?

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,400
Forget about young ladies.
They are too much to handle.

110
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,080
- Look at him.
- I'll be honest.

111
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,480
When my wife married me,
she was only 24 years old.

112
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,600
She was a young lady.

113
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,880
She had great looks.

114
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,920
Her family is very well-off.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,480
But being married
to a successful man like me

116
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,960
is a bit overwhelming for her.

117
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,400
You know,

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,400
in Singapore, I have to meet

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,240
the chairmen of listed companies,
executives, and entrepreneurs every day.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,920
It was stressful for her
to go out with me.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
So when we got divorced, she said to me

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,080
that she's finally free.

123
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Isn't that ironic?

124
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,560
Anyway,

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,720
I now think that

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
looks matter when looking for a spouse.

127
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
It's for the sake of the next generation.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,680
Most importantly,
you have to share the same values,

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,840
same interests, and know each other well.

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Yes, that makes sense.

131
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,800
Hey.

132
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,080
- Why isn't Shen Ruoxin here?
- That's right.

133
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,640
- Here she is.
- She's here.

134
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,760
She's here.

135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
- Ruoxin.
- Ruoxin.

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Ruoxin.

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
You haven't changed after all these years.

138
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,320
Oh no. Look at me, I misspoke again.

139
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,160
You're getting prettier.

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,640
It has been a while.

141
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,280
- It has been a while.
- It really is.

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,080
You look just as you were in college.

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,440
- Right?
- Ruoxin.

144
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,200
Why didn't time leave any mark on you?

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,240
Shen Ruoxin.

146
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,640
Tell me now.

147
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,040
What did you eat to turn back time?

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
Why is she still so fit?

149
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
Will you shut your mouth?

150
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,480
Which of the ladies has changed?

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,040
Don't we still look as we were?

152
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,720
But the guys in our class
are a bit hard to praise.

153
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,120
- Right. Take a look.
- Indeed.

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Yes. Time is a file that wears
and makes no noise.

155
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,520
Right, Huang Ziwei?

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,840
Look at your belly.

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
What's with the one block of abs?

158
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
Look at Yutao.

159
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,480
How can I compare myself to him?

160
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,840
Mr. Gu is working

161
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,000
on projects that invest
in new holding firms.

162
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,799
He has been working out every day.

163
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,760
To get a case, my team has to drink
with all sorts of people every day.

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
That's why I'm getting a belly.

165
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,920
How can I still work out?

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,160
Tianle, don't talk about me.
Look at yourself.

167
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,480
Look at this.

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Yutao.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
Since you're back,

170
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
introduce more clients to me.

171
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,480
Our little firm
can be of assistance to you.

172
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,120
Those cases that you miss out on

173
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,760
are enough to feed us, right?

174
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,640
You're too kind.

175
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,840
- Ruoxin.
- Everyone.

176
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,560
The food is served. Please enjoy.

177
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,320
- Let's get seated.
- Yes.

178
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
- Here.
- Here.

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,800
Here.

180
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,760
Hey, guys.

181
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
This hasn't been easy.

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,480
For our youth,

183
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,960
let's drink a toast!

184
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
- Here.
- Here.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

186
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,880
- Here.
- Cheers.

187
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,800
Cheers.

188
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
Yutao, Ruoxin.

189
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,800
When I look at you two,

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,160
it reminds me of the stress we had

191
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,760
before exams.

192
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,240
- Back then,
- Thank you.

193
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,000
you two straight-A students
were always vying to come first.

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
It made us, the flunkers,

195
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,640
filled with awe.

196
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,680
- That's right.
- Stop it.

197
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,160
I didn't expect
to meet such a hard worker.

198
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
You girls were busy dating guys.

199
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,920
Our Ruoxin was only dating

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
books and exam papers.

201
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,560
It really stressed me out.

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,320
I'll be honest with you.
I had a lot of girls hitting on me.

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,960
I dare not reciprocate. Why?

204
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,120
It might hold me up.

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,120
Did I hold you up?

206
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,040
No.

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
You changed my life.

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,840
Yutao.

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,480
How long are you planning to stay here?

210
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,200
There are so many companies
that are ready to go public.

211
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,120
I was transferred here for that.

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
By the way,

213
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,240
as soon as I got back,

214
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,160
Shanghai was still
the most comfortable city.

215
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,480
- Right.
- So you're staying?

216
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,080
We'll see.

217
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,280
Although I'm from Shanghai,
I've been away for too long.

218
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,760
It will take time

219
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
to adjust to the culture.

220
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,400
This is called "reverse culture shock."

221
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
It's reverse culture shock.

222
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,400
In my opinion,

223
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
whether you're staying
for a long or short term,

224
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,080
- we should get together when we can.
- Yes.

225
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,680
Help each other out. Keep in touch, right?

226
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,320
- Absolutely. Come on.
- Here.

227
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,240
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,560
Ruoxin.

229
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,000
I heard you're working
in Zenpro's Legal Department?

230
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
I was in the Legal Department.

231
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,080
I'm now assigned to
the New Energy Vehicle Sales Department.

232
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,600
New energy vehicle?

233
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,160
That has nothing to do with your major.

234
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,440
Yes.

235
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
But being in a new field
is breaking new ground.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,160
I think it's interesting.

237
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,840
From what I remember,

238
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,960
you're very goal-oriented.

239
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
A very rational person who perseveres.

240
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,360
To be honest,

241
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I thought you would be
a company's legal director

242
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,560
or a senior partner at a law firm.

243
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,760
Life can be so unpredictable.

244
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,040
Sometimes, you stray away

245
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,960
from the planned route as you go along.

246
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,960
But I think it's not so bad
when you derail.

247
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,160
Sometimes,

248
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,920
don't you think
it's a blessing in disguise?

249
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you married?

250
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,680
No.

251
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,560
Do you remember?

252
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,480
Before I went to Singapore,
we also had a gathering.

253
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
I was joking with Ruoxin back then.

254
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,120
By the time we're 35 years old,

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,840
if we're both still single,

256
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,120
let's just make do with each other.

257
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,440
- I remember that.
- My goodness.

258
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,280
How many years ago was that?
Do you still remember it?

259
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,240
Aren't you married?

260
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Don't bring it up.
I got divorced two years ago.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,360
When two people are together,

262
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
if one person remains at a standstill,

263
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,160
we'll just grow further apart.

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,840
It also gets duller and duller.

265
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,640
I guess you're not the one
at a standstill, right?

266
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,960
The past's dream girl and boy

267
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,520
are both single now.

268
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
What a perfect fit, right?

269
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,800
- Yes.
- That's right.

270
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,720
With two straight-A students,

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
there's always plenty to say.

272
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,480
Don't joke around.

273
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
I have a boyfriend.

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,880
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

275
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,840
- Which guy stole our dream girl?
- Exactly!

276
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
What is he working as?

277
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,120
- There's someone better than Yutao?
- You had better come clean.

278
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
- Tell me.
- Okay.

279
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,200
It's not time yet.

280
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,560
I'll bring him to meet you
when we go steady, okay?

281
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,600
Which tall, rich, and handsome guy?

282
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
You don't know him.

283
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,560
- Ruoxin, we're leaving.
- Be careful.

284
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,360
- Let's meet up again.
- Bye.

285
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,000
- Bye, see you.
- Bye.

286
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
- I'm leaving. Bye.
- See you soon.

287
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,080
I'm leaving. Bye.

288
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,680
- Slowly.
- Bye.

289
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,040
- Did you drive here?
- I parked my car over there.

290
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
- I'll walk you there.
- No, it's close.

291
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,400
Call a taxi.

292
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,400
By the way,

293
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,200
is Ms. Zhou doing well?

294
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,440
She's doing quite well.

295
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,840
Sometimes, she goes through
your photos and said that

296
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
you were her favorite student.

297
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,880
Well, when I'm done with work,

298
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,080
I'll pay her a visit.

299
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,480
- She didn't move away?
- No.

300
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,800
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

301
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Bye, then.

302
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Bye.

303
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,880
GOOD NIGHT KISS

304
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,280
GOOD NIGHT KISS

305
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Good night.

306
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,640
GOOD NIGHT KISS

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
Ms. Shen.

308
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,760
You need to attend an urgent meeting.

309
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
Right now? What meeting?

310
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,680
I don't know.
Mr. Liu asked me to call you.

311
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,880
All right, I got it.

312
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>The purpose of this meeting</i>

313
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,200
<i>is to sum up
the recent charging station incident.</i>

314
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>All in all,</i>

315
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,360
<i>Mr. Liu handled it on time.</i>

316
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
<i>Ms. Shen also did well</i>

317
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,320
<i>in the follow-up.</i>

318
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,240
<i>Your cooperation has prevented</i>

319
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,200
<i>this incident from causing damage
to the company's reputation.</i>

320
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
<i>Instead, it has made</i>

321
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,600
<i>our new energy vehicle
to develop a more favorable image.</i>

322
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,440
But this incident has served

323
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,440
as a reminder to me.

324
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,200
In terms of our new energy vehicle's
sales training,

325
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,600
we need to step up our game.

326
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,040
<i>Professional knowledge differs
from that of fuel vehicles,</i>

327
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,400
<i>so the key points in sales
will also be different.</i>

328
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,760
<i>It's hard to manage them
under the same department.</i>

329
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
<i>That's why the management has decided that</i>

330
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,480
<i>from now on, the Sales Department</i>

331
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
will be separated into two.

332
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,040
Traditional fuel vehicles

333
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,080
will still be managed by Mr. Liu Pei.

334
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,840
<i>As for the sales
of the new energy vehicle,</i>

335
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,520
<i>the headquarters will assign
a new deputy director.</i>

336
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,960
<i>I think</i>

337
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,920
<i>Mr. Liu has something to say.</i>

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
No.

339
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,080
Since it has been decided
by the headquarters,

340
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll cooperate.

341
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
That's good.

342
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
I know.

343
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,120
Mr. Liu, it has been hard on you.

344
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,800
You have to manage the sales
of traditional fuel vehicles

345
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,200
as well as the new energy vehicles.

346
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,760
<i>It's better from now on.</i>

347
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,280
<i>You only have to manage one.</i>

348
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,760
<i>So far,</i>

349
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,240
<i>traditional fuel cars
are still very important.</i>

350
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,280
- <i>Ms. Shen.</i>
- Yes.

351
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,800
<i>I hope you learn something
from this incident.</i>

352
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
<i>As of now,</i>

353
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,200
<i>you're in charge of the training
for the sales of the new energy vehicles.</i>

354
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes.

355
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,200
I'll revise the curriculum again
and submit my feedback to you soon.

356
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,360
<i>Okay.</i>

357
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,160
<i>Does either of you
have any other questions?</i>

358
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,680
<i>Okay. That's it for today's meeting.</i>

359
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,800
Mr. Liu,

360
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,280
if there's nothing else,

361
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll get going.

362
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,000
Shen Ruoxin.

363
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Separating both departments…

364
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,800
This sure is a drastic measure.

365
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,960
Mr. Liu,

366
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,800
you think too highly of me.

367
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm just a manager.

368
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,240
Would I have such an influence

369
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,480
over the superiors' decisions and ideas?

370
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,880
I can still manage
to learn from my mistakes

371
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
and draw a conclusion.

372
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,480
Hello? What is it?

373
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,040
Listen.

374
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,080
The headquarters is assigning
a new deputy director.

375
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,280
The New Energy Department
will have its own Sales Department.

376
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,400
Liu Pei has been decentralized.

377
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Damn, how exciting is that?

378
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,120
Did you do this?

379
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
I finally got back at him.

380
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,080
I now feel

381
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,280
how fresh the air is.

382
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,600
I want to see

383
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,800
the look on Liu Pei's face now.

384
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,080
In that case,

385
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,440
shall I take you to watch a comedy tonight

386
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,720
to celebrate your victory?

387
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,160
Sure.

388
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,640
<i>See you tonight.</i>

389
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
Shen Ruoxin turned your tactics
well against you.

390
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,160
We didn't get her in a mess,

391
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
but she got us into a bigger mess.

392
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't be angry, Mr. Liu.

393
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,120
Even if there's an outside manager,
we can still tackle him.

394
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,760
As for Shen Ruoxin,

395
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,560
isn't she getting ahead
by charming Xu Minjie?

396
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,560
Don't worry.

397
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,400
We can get something on her one day.

398
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,360
Wait.

399
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,280
This new deputy director
is my equal in terms of position.

400
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,680
Let's see what he is like.

401
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,760
I'm telling you.

402
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,360
Don't mess with Shen Ruoxin.

403
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,720
Don't make any mistakes.

404
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,880
Let's wait and see.

405
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
All right.

406
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
You should be careful too.

407
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,160
Even if Shen Ruoxin tackles me,

408
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,680
I'm in the Legal Department.

409
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,880
As long as I make no mistakes
in the contracts,

410
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,120
what can she do to me?

411
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
Don't let your guard down.

412
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,360
Yes.

413
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,160
Mr. Liu is so wise.

414
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,200
You're so good to me.

415
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,080
Don't be angry. Calm down.

416
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,720
Ruoxin.

417
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,720
- Did something happen today?
- What's wrong?

418
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,360
I just brought up some coffee.

419
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,960
But it felt so tense there.

420
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,520
Mr. Ruan went to see Mr. Liu in a hurry.

421
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
He looked

422
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
as if he's facing an enemy.

423
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,800
What is he anxious about?

424
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,240
He's next.

425
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,880
Ruoxin, aren't you awesome?

426
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,040
Right.

427
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,440
Mr. Ruan saw me bring up some coffee.

428
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,600
He even stopped and told Xiaoqiao that

429
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,280
I shouldn't bother
with small matters like buying coffee.

430
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,800
I should work with ease.

431
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,960
Ruoxin, what exactly did you do?

432
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
I haven't yelled at Xiaoqiao yet.

433
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,120
Just work hard.

434
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,480
You won't be bullied if you're competent.

435
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Once there's a Legal Department
in the New Energy Department,

436
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,920
I'll transfer you there.

437
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
That's great.

438
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,800
- Go.
- Bye.

439
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,160
It smells so good here.

440
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,680
Ms. Shen,

441
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,200
you smell so good.

442
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,320
You dress so prettily.

443
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,120
Are you going on a date?

444
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm so envious.

445
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,320
Ms. Shen is a chic celibatarian.

446
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,160
Dating is a fun part of life.

447
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,680
It's not about getting married.

448
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,880
Can you handle it?

449
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Isn't that Qi Xiao who resigned?

450
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,200
May-December romance. Gosh!

451
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
You're right.

452
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,280
Shen Ruoxin is in top form.

453
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,720
The age difference doesn't really show.

454
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,640
I've heard that young men nowadays
are particularly caring.

455
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,440
Really? No matter how caring they are,

456
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,720
they won't care for you.

457
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,680
That's how good she is.

458
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,960
She sucks up to the boss

459
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,840
while she hooks up with young men.

460
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
We call this a good tactic.

461
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,720
Let's go.

462
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,040
Do you feel elated today?

463
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,640
I guess Liu Pei and Ruan Ye
won't dare to mess with you again.

464
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Who knows?

465
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,600
They are weasels.

466
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,360
I feel great today anyway.

467
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,360
I like how you are now.

468
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,080
I'm relieved to see you like this.

469
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,280
Previously, you put up
with whoever that bullied you.

470
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,040
- I get mad thinking about it.
- Not anymore.

471
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,920
I won't give them any chance
to bully me again.

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,240
I've thought about it.

473
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,160
The best defense is to attack.

474
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
It's my mom.

475
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,480
Hello? What is it, Mom?

476
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,440
I just sent you
the location of a restaurant.

477
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,720
When you're done with work,
go and eat there.

478
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,160
Mom, why are you
suddenly taking me out to eat?

479
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
I…

480
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,680
I have something important tonight.

481
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't care what you're doing today.

482
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,080
Put them aside for now.

483
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,040
Gu Yutao is back.

484
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,320
<i>He wants to treat me to a meal</i>

485
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,960
and he has asked for you as well.

486
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,520
It has been a while since you met, right?

487
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,920
Gu Yutao?

488
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,920
We already met
at the reunion two days ago.

489
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
<i>That was a gathering for college friends.</i>

490
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>There were so many people.</i>

491
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
<i>Did you get a chance to talk?</i>

492
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,520
He made a reservation
at a nice restaurant today.

493
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,760
He also said

494
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,400
he's single.

495
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
He's single, you know?

496
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,320
Mom, are you going to play matchmaker

497
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,920
and hook me up with him?

498
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,160
<i>Hook what up?</i>

499
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,560
<i>Hurry up. Let's talk in person.</i>

500
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
- <i>We'll be waiting.</i>
- Mom!

501
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,240
I've already bought the tickets.

502
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,880
It's not as if you don't know
my mom's temper.

503
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,520
If I don't go tonight,

504
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
will the two of us be able
to watch a movie?

505
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,200
She'll keep calling
until my phone runs out of battery.

506
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,560
Okay, I'll go with you.

507
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,280
You too?

508
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,120
How? What will you tell my mom?

509
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
I'm your boyfriend.

510
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,760
Your mom is setting you up
with another man.

511
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Do you think it's okay for me
to not be there?

512
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,320
Are you jealous?

513
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,560
Yes.

514
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,960
Listen. I'm very jealous now.

515
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,360
I am so jealous
that it's hurting my stomach.

516
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,600
That Gu…

517
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,960
Gu Yutao.

518
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
Who is he?

519
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,360
He was my mom's student in middle school.

520
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,680
He often won a lot of competitions.

521
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,080
My mom always said
that he was her favorite student.

522
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
She always compared me to him.

523
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,440
I was stressed out since I was a kid.

524
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,360
By chance,

525
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,080
we both got into law school at East China
University of Science and Technology.

526
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,880
Since then,

527
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
my mom compared me to him even more.

528
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,720
I was so annoyed.

529
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,080
Childhood sweetheart.

530
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
You said your mom changed

531
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
your college application.

532
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Could your mom

533
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,360
- have wanted to set you up?
- What are you saying?

534
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
My mom was worried
I would fall in love too soon.

535
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,840
You think too much.

536
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,360
I'm definitely going

537
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,200
to this restaurant because I'm jealous.

538
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,440
Don't worry, your mom will welcome me.

539
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,200
Because of you and me,

540
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,160
my mom is getting in good with your mom.

541
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,600
They are almost best friends.

542
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,040
I'll be there as a family friend

543
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,280
to make her look good.

544
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,080
Qi Xiao.

545
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,920
Does your mom know about us?

546
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,840
Before we started dating,

547
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,400
she could tell that I like you.

548
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,440
What did your mom say?

549
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,320
Did she get angry?

550
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,880
Did she think I misled her son?

551
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,160
No.

552
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,840
Did you also watch too many dramas?

553
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,160
My mom was very supportive

554
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,840
and she said I have good taste.

555
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
She complimented you.

556
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,080
Really?

557
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,240
Of course.

558
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
If not, why would my mom approach yours?

559
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,920
Don't worry.

560
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,440
Our relationship is still blessed.

561
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,920
The address.

562
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,120
You got the address?

563
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,240
Let me meet my rival.

564
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,680
Slow down!

565
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,920
Roasted duck, please.

566
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,320
The pancakes must be hot.

567
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,160
One more thing,
stir-fried crab with garlic and chili.

568
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,000
You don't have to order that much.
It's just the three of us.

569
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,680
Ms. Zhou, it has been over ten years.

570
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,600
Your student is treating you to a meal.

571
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,040
Shouldn't I order more dishes?

572
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,760
By the way,
does Ruoxin still like to eat chili?

573
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
Yes.

574
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,120
She's stressed out at work,
so she likes strong flavors.

575
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,760
She has a weak stomach.

576
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
I told her to stop eating like that,
but she wouldn't listen.

577
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,800
A spicy chicken.

578
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
Mildly spicy. Not too spicy.

579
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,560
That's all.

580
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,000
Serve the cold dishes first.

581
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,720
Serve the hot dishes when everyone's here.
Thank you.

582
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,640
Yutao.

583
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,600
I've heard that
right after you graduated from college,

584
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,360
you went abroad to work, right?

585
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,520
Yes, I went to France first.

586
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,920
Then I went to the United States for LLM.

587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,040
It stands for Master of Laws.

588
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,960
After that,
I worked in New York and London.

589
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,280
But I was in Singapore in recent years.

590
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
Ms. Zhou.

591
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,320
To be honest,

592
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,920
I've traveled all over the world.

593
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,800
The city I miss the most
is still Shanghai.

594
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,680
I ate all sorts of delicacies,
but none can compare

595
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,600
to the shrimp noodles that you bought me

596
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,240
after I won first place
at the Hope Cup English Contest.

597
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,440
You remember.

598
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,560
I've been telling Ruoxin

599
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,600
that you're the best
of all the students I've taught.

600
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,720
- A world-class elite.
- I'm flattered.

601
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,560
By the way, I especially brought

602
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,520
a photo album with a photo of you
when you were awarded.

603
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,680
- Really?
- That's right.

604
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,600
At the Hope Cup English Contest.

605
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
- You still have it?
- Look.

606
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,720
Is this me?

607
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,840
Of course!

608
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,320
I can't recognize myself. Let's see. This…

609
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,040
I need to take a photo and save it.

610
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,720
It's a rare item.

611
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,840
It really is.

612
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,560
- Is this Ruoxin?
- Yes.

613
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
She hasn't changed at all.

614
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,560
She's still such a kid.

615
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,040
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

616
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,160
Yutao.

617
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,800
Have a seat.

618
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,920
You're so busy now.

619
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,880
You're here and there all over the world,

620
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
yet you're still single.

621
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
Why?

622
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,720
Your parents aren't urging you
to get married?

623
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,640
Ms. Zhou,

624
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll be honest with you.

625
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,200
Actually, I was married.

626
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,640
But I'm divorced.

627
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,160
<i>Are you off from work?</i>

628
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,000
<i>I'm not having dinner today.
Class isn't over yet.</i>

629
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,920
<i>Let's set a date for another time.</i>

630
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
<i>What class are you in?</i>

631
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,360
<i>I'll pick you up after class.</i>

632
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,000
<i>Where is it?</i>

633
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,240
SHANGHAI XUHUI REAL ESTATE
TRADING MANAGEMENT

634
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,320
My ex-wife is from a small city.

635
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,280
She's insensitive
and not attentive enough.

636
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,480
Of course,

637
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,400
her personality is fine.

638
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,040
However, as time went by,

639
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
we felt we weren't a good fit,

640
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,680
you know?

641
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,680
You were

642
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,440
married once?

643
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
Yes.

644
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,920
In Shanghai, remarriage still
isn't seen positively by others.

645
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,000
If you're looking
for a girlfriend in Shanghai,

646
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,960
there will be some obstacles.

647
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,440
You must be prepared.

648
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,560
Have you two ever had a baby?

649
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,520
No, we were too busy with work

650
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,760
to consider that.

651
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,320
Are you still in touch with your ex-wife?

652
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,280
Some people…

653
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
Even though they are divorced,

654
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,920
they still haven't broken things off.

655
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,160
Don't worry, Ms. Zhou.

656
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,840
My ex-wife has already remarried.

657
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,400
We hardly talked
when we were in Singapore.

658
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Now that I'm back in Shanghai,
I'm sure I won't contact her again.

659
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,120
Don't worry.

660
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,160
Ms. Zhou,

661
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,840
I was your student.

662
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
You should know me best.

663
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,280
With my current condition,

664
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,960
be it my career, my age,

665
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
or physical qualities…

666
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,360
I also have a foreign passport.

667
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,920
Finding a good woman in Shanghai

668
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,120
shouldn't be too hard.

669
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
Of course.

670
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,880
I've learned a lesson
from my failed marriage.

671
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,680
Now, I think that

672
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,360
an outstanding woman

673
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,280
should first be well-educated.

674
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,680
We must share
the same educational background.

675
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,400
If we don't have anything in common,
it's not easy.

676
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,000
Take Ruoxin and me, for example.

677
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,920
Whenever we meet,

678
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,840
there's always something to talk about.

679
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,080
I think we get along very well.

680
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,840
Ruoxin.

681
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,520
She's too focused on her work.

682
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,280
Her marriage…

683
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,200
I'm worried about it for nothing.

684
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,440
Actually, my terms are simple. Just one.

685
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,400
You have to be good to her.

686
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,320
That's true.

687
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,440
A clean relationship.

688
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,880
Don't get involved in any mess.

689
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
As for the car and house,

690
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,320
Ruoxin has all of them.

691
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,520
She's working at a big company now

692
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,680
as a senior manager.

693
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,920
What else can she want?

694
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,920
She's working so hard.

695
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,040
She can win her own bread.

696
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,960
Yes.

697
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
As for the foreign passport

698
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,520
or living abroad,

699
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,040
come on.

700
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,600
It's not like it was 20 years ago.

701
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,000
Young ladies in Shanghai
don't care about that.

702
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,440
Who else do you think will go and suffer,

703
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,840
living abroad with foreigners?

704
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Ms. Zhou, have you heard of the saying,

705
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,760
"A once-divorced man is a gem.

706
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,440
A twice-divorced man is a weed"?

707
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,160
Is that even a saying?

708
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,360
Yes, many elders say that.

709
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,480
No.

710
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,520
I've never heard of it.

711
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,160
However, it depends on the lady's family.

712
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,560
See if her parents think so too.

713
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Of course,

714
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,520
I'm just kidding.

715
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,680
Ruoxin should be here soon.

716
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,400
- Thank you.
- You look great.

717
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,760
- Ruoxin, you're here.
- Yutao.

718
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,800
Mom.

719
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

720
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,680
Why are you here too?

721
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,840
Ms. Zhou, I was working overtime
with Ruoxin, right?

722
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,160
I just wanted to drop her off.

723
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Now that she's here,

724
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
if it's a bother,

725
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,120
I'll…

726
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Yutao, this is my best friend's son.

727
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,000
He's one of Ruoxin's colleagues.

728
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,040
Why don't we let him stay for dinner?

729
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,760
- He doesn't eat much anyway.
- Yes, it's okay.

730
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,440
Ms. Zhou is here today
to catch up with her student.

731
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,280
But since you said he's one of us,

732
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,920
I don't mind. Join us.

733
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,960
Server, another chair, please.

734
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,680
No, put it here.

735
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,800
Another set of tableware.

736
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,760
- Have a seat.
- Come. Have a seat.

737
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,040
- Gu Yutao.
- Qi Xiao.

738
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,960
Have a seat.

739
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,920
- Your colleague?
- That's right.

740
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Young and promising.

741
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,280
Ruoxin,

742
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,200
you're working so hard now.

743
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,720
You can make it on your own.

744
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,120
It's not easy for women to have a career.

745
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,440
All jobs are hard,

746
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,760
be it for men or women.

747
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
Excellent.

748
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,840
OFFICIAL ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT
INSTRUCTOR: LIU PEI

749
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,719
Mom.

750
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,320
If you didn't stop me
from going to the law firm,

751
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
I might be just like Yutao by now.

752
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,200
I could've been a partner.

753
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,560
Wasn't I worried about you?

754
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,920
I wanted you to have an easier life.

755
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,560
But I've never thought

756
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,920
that her current job in this department
is no easier than being a lawyer.

757
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,240
It's good money.

758
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
You're so busy.

759
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,200
Even if you get married,
you'll get a divorce.

760
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,160
What's the point of being rich?

761
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
Besides, you're a woman.

762
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
I disagree with you.

763
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,080
Is it okay for men to get divorced?

764
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,720
I've been there.

765
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,720
Divorce is hurtful for both men and women.

766
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,160
So from the very beginning,

767
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,080
you need to keep your eyes open,

768
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
you know?

769
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,160
Enjoy your meal.

770
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
I'm going to the restroom.

771
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,600
Xinxin, he must have gone
to get the check.

772
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,600
Go.

773
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,360
Get the check.

774
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,640
This meal isn't good.

775
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
I've already paid.

776
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
We haven't seen each other for years.

777
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,480
Besides, I brought Qi Xiao with me today.

778
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,680
Should the three of us
have him buy us dinner?

779
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,400
Well done.

780
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
You're very sharp today.

781
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
So clearheaded.

782
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,520
On the phone earlier,

783
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,760
who was trying to set me up with Gu Yutao?

784
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,920
Why is it that now,

785
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,400
you've changed your mind
when you're done eating?

786
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
You don't seem to be very nice to him.

787
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,480
At first,

788
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,080
I did think he was pretty nice.

789
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,400
No matter what,

790
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,600
he is a single man.

791
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
But as soon as we talked,

792
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
apparently, he's a divorced single man.

793
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,840
Before you arrived,

794
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,800
when he was talking about his ex-wife,

795
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,800
you didn't see that contempt in his eyes.

796
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,000
He can talk about his ex-wife
in front of me today.

797
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,600
One day,
he might also tell others about you.

798
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,640
He also brainwashed me.

799
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,320
He said, "A once-divorced man is a gem."

800
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
What gem is that?

801
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,600
Divorced.

802
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,880
He didn't find the reason for it
in himself.

803
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,400
Will this gem treat you well
in the future?

804
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
It's over. Let's drop it.

805
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,680
I was never okay with him.

806
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,400
It was your one-man show.

807
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,840
You're so smart, Ms. Zhou.

808
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,960
You could tell he was a hypocrite.

809
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
Hey, kid.

810
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,880
It's time for me to tell you off.

811
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,680
You came for a free meal.

812
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,160
That's too ill-mannered.

813
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,120
We're having
a private family conversation.

814
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,280
Why are you butting in?

815
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
You should

816
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,240
keep your mouths shut.

817
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,240
I figured out what you wanted.

818
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,800
Isn't it so that I can help you
keep an eye on Ruoxin?

819
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,400
That's true.

820
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,240
If Gu Yutao seeks Ruoxin
outside her office…

821
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,800
Do you have my WeChat?

822
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,280
Report it to me on WeChat, okay?

823
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,560
Copy. I got it.

824
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,240
Ms. Zhou, it's my treat.

825
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,680
How can Ruoxin pay for it?

826
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm so sorry.

827
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,400
She should.

828
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,360
Didn't I tell you?

829
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,880
I should welcome you back to Shanghai.

830
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,240
I even ordered so much food.

831
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
I'll treat you next time.

832
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,760
Ms. Zhou,

833
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,760
take the food home.

834
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,800
No, there's too much food.

835
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,760
- I can't finish it.
- Just take your time.

836
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,760
It's okay. Let's go.

837
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,120
I'll walk you to your car.

838
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,040
Why did you take it all?

839
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,560
Ruoxin,

840
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,920
you're growing on me.

841
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,040
You haven't changed
one bit all these years.

842
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,000
You're not tainted by worldly pursuits.

843
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,280
A truly independent woman.

844
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,960
I'm impressed.

845
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,280
I don't mean to impress you.

846
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,760
But you succeeded in getting my attention.

847
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,360
I had a great time today.

848
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,520
We'll meet again when we can.

849
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,160
I hope it won't be long.

850
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

851
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,800
Hey, you.

852
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,960
Are you waiting for your boyfriend?

853
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,400
That's right.

854
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm waiting for him to pick me up.

855
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,880
Then…

856
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,320
let your boyfriend

857
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,120
take you out for something tasty.

858
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,000
Come on.

859
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,520
I said that casually.

860
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
I never thought

861
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,440
you would really sign up.

862
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
You always say,

863
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,960
"I say it casually."

864
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,480
But I know

865
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,920
you're actually afraid.

866
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,920
I'm telling you.

867
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,840
Don't be afraid.

868
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,200
Keep moving forward.

869
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,200
I'll help you.

870
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,040
Last time, didn't you say
running a public account

871
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,680
is difficult and troublesome,

872
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,040
so you need a team?

873
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,520
So I did some research.

874
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,120
The more I study about it,
the more interesting it gets.

875
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,440
That's why I signed up for this class.

876
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,400
I want to learn more systematically.

877
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,440
Learning more skills doesn't harm anyone.

878
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,600
Thank you.

879
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,120
There you go again.

880
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,760
You're always thanking me.

881
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,520
Don't mention it, okay?

882
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,960
When you've succeeded,

883
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,640
I'll count myself

884
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,440
as a shareholder who invested with skills.

885
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,800
Then you're the founder.

886
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,640
I'm a partner.

887
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
I'm the CEO of your public account.

888
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,400
ORIGINAL ACCESSORIES DESIGN CONTEST

889
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,000
CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR DEADLINES

890
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,560
The first-place winner will receive
a start-up fund.

891
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,840
Does that mean

892
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,040
you'll have your accessory brand?

893
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,320
Isn't this what Qi Xiao dreams of?

894
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,120
SECOND ANNUAL "MOC"
ORIGINAL ACCESSORIES DESIGN CONTEST

895
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,040
Let's go.

896
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,000
Take these two bags home, Ms. Zhou.

897
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,520
Thank you.

898
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,960
Drive safely.

899
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,400
Go on.

900
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Get some rest.

901
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,680
What's wrong? What's so funny?

902
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,680
Do you know what
Gu Yutao told me just now?

903
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
He said that

904
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,680
I succeeded in getting his attention.

905
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,480
Is he serious?

906
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
He was really serious.

907
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,120
Why is your childhood friend so weird?

908
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,360
You didn't see him
when they were packing the food.

909
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,640
He ate the lobster

910
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,360
and left the spicy chicken for you.

911
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,920
He knows that I like spicy food.

912
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,560
That's being thoughtful, you know?

913
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,680
That's right.

914
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,040
SECOND ANNUAL "MOC"
ORIGINAL ACCESSORIES DESIGN CONTEST

915
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,640
That's great.

916
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,960
What's great?

917
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,880
This. Su Yang sent it to me.

918
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,720
If I win this competition,

919
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,320
I can get a start-up fund.

920
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,120
I'll have a chance to start my brand.

921
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,080
Really?

922
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,120
But there's not much time.

923
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,720
Can you make it?

924
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,160
I'll try. I'll sign up once I'm back.

925
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
It's quite a famous contest.

926
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,360
Even if I don't come in first,

927
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,800
as long as I win an award,

928
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,920
I'll be well known in the design industry.

929
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,960
By then, Zhu Lin's shop and mine

930
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,560
will be a lot more well known.

931
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,920
Many subcontractors will be asking for us.

932
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,800
I guess this is a big chance for you,

933
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,320
so make sure you seize it.

934
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,040
If you need anything,

935
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,160
just tell me.

936
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,000
Don't hold back, okay?

937
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,760
Don't worry.

938
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,720
Zhu Lin has the place ready for me.

939
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,760
I'll start tomorrow.

940
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,880
If I win the contest,

941
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,040
what reward will you give me?

942
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,160
Aren't you being too greedy?

943
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,400
You win an award
and you want a reward too?

944
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,680
You want a double reward?

945
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,440
Their reward is different from yours.

946
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,480
What reward do you want?

947
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,680
If I win,

948
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,760
you'll take annual leave.

949
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,320
- I'll take you traveling.
- No way. I'm too busy.

950
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,320
How is there time for that?

951
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,760
I don't have the time.

952
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,160
I'm kidding.

953
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,560
I can do that.

954
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,120
