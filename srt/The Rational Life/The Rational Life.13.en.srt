1
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,960
Get up.

2
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,200
I got it!

3
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,480
Let go!

4
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,520
You're making me want to throw up.

5
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,000
What?

6
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,960
The company I went to
for an interview two days ago

7
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
hired me.

8
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,280
I got a job!

9
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Congratulations.

10
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
You finally have a job.

11
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,400
You can date You Sijia now.

12
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,080
You are officially at your peak.

13
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Isn't this too low to be my peak?

14
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
The test-drive event is in two weeks.

15
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
For our department,

16
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,880
it's a very important event.

17
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,520
We'll invite all the major media
outlets to report on it.

18
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,080
So we have to make sure
that everything is in check.

19
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Ms. Shen.

20
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Contact the PR Department.

21
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,680
Check all the press releases
they have made.

22
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,120
Check the flow of the test-drive event.

23
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,640
Okay.

24
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
- Mr. Zhang.
- Yes.

25
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,240
Find a more experienced test driver.

26
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
Take note of his appearance.

27
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,600
He'll be in the PR draft.

28
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
Once it's confirmed,

29
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
get the portrait rights agreement ready.

30
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,280
Reservation and inspection
of the event venue are also on you.

31
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,680
No problem.

32
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Mr. Li.

33
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,360
You have some technical knowledge.

34
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,560
You will deal with the garage.

35
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,560
There should not be any errors
during this event.

36
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,840
Okay, no problem.

37
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,080
Here it is again.

38
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,560
One of the typical topics of such events.

39
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,279
The theme of the event.

40
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,440
Who can give me new ideas?

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,400
Mr. Xu.

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
I have something.

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
Go ahead.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
This weekend,

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,680
I bought our company's new energy car.

46
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,880
At the flagship store,

47
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,200
I noticed that many of our clients

48
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,360
are using our cars as family cars.

49
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
And with that,

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,520
I interviewed a few families as well.

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,800
I realized something.

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,040
The reason why they chose our cars

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,800
was that they are eco-friendly.

54
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,520
New energy is eco-friendly.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Everybody knows that.

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,960
- Yes.
- Let Ms. Shen finish.

57
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,320
Also, they all mentioned

58
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,920
the reason they chose this car

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,720
is because after they had children,

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
they became more concerned
about the earth's future.

61
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,720
It's more about sustainability.

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,440
They are willing to contribute
to the environment.

63
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,600
But I realized

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,360
something very important.

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,880
Compared to other brands,

66
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,120
our advantage is
the price-performance ratio.

67
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
For these families,

68
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,280
the price-performance ratio
matters the most.

69
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
I was thinking that

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
if we are targeting to grab hold
of this group of people,

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,560
maybe we can start with

72
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,440
eco-friendliness and family happiness

73
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
as the center of our promotion.

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,280
What a unique way of thinking.

75
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
It looks like
Ms. Shen wasted no money in buying a car.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,840
But I need numbers after the fact.

78
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Find a media company.

79
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
Have them do a survey

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,080
and a focus group

81
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,560
to see if your idea is valid or not.

82
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Okay.

83
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,640
Anyone else?

84
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Any new ideas for me?

85
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
The meeting is adjourned.

86
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
Qi Xiao.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,360
I'll run through the process.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
Go to the PR Department right now.

89
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Ask Ms. Zhang to take out
the schedule and press releases.

90
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,240
I have to find a media company

91
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,000
and finish that feasibility report
on eco-friendliness.

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
Sure, no problem.

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
- Make it quick.
- Okay.

94
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
Ruoxin.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
Did I miss anything?

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,920
No.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,320
Don't make any plans after work today.

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Why?

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,760
What do you mean?

100
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,000
It's your birthday.

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,120
I never celebrate my birthday.

102
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,000
I thought only my mom

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
and the telecommunication company
would remember my birthday.

104
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,040
How is that possible?

105
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,520
We won't forget.

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,480
Sijia and I

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,920
put in a lot of effort
to throw you a party.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,960
And Su Yang too.

109
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,840
See it as an excuse

110
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,760
to get together.

111
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,440
Or to celebrate the fact
that we are in a new department.

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,080
It's a new start, okay?

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
Well, that's nice of you.

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,800
Thank you.

115
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,000
Tonight,

116
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,880
can I bring my best friend along?

117
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
Of course, the more the merrier.

118
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Okay.

119
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,200
Hurry up and go to the PR Department.

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,880
Hey, Ruoxin.

121
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,520
<i>Baby, come to my place tonight.
It's my birthday.</i>

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,040
I was just about to call you.

123
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
You deserve to be happy.

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,520
Be happy all year long!

125
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,280
I wish you good fortune and longevity.

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,040
Let's not go to your house.

127
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,280
Your house is so empty.

128
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,240
How about this?

129
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,120
Come to the bar after work tonight.

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,320
I'll make you something.

131
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
Ting's band is performing tonight.

132
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,880
<i>The kids at the office</i>

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,440
<i>are throwing me a party.</i>

134
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,720
<i>It's okay. Come after work.
There's no rush.</i>

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, I'll bring you some new dishes then

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
and let them have a taste.

137
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
<i>See you tonight.</i>

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
See you tonight.

139
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,200
Hello, I'm here.

140
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

141
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,240
Boss.

142
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,600
I would like to take an early leave today.

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,240
It's my best friend's birthday.

144
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
It's okay. Go.

145
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,559
Discuss it with Mr. Qin.

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
You two just work it out, okay?

147
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,360
There's a show tonight.

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
There won't be many people eating.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,720
Boss.

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm thinking of making
some new dishes to go.

151
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,760
I can pay.

152
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
It's okay, go ahead.

153
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,720
No need to pay.

154
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
Let's just think of this

155
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,200
as my gratitude for your hard work
on the new dishes.

156
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,760
Thank you, sir.

157
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,760
You are welcome.

158
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
Chicken wings, thighs,

159
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,040
steaks,

160
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,360
and chilies.

161
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,240
<i>What would you like to drink?</i>

162
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,400
<i>What does Ruoxin like?</i>

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,320
<i>Beer.</i>

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,880
<i>Beer.</i>

165
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,200
XINXIN SUPPORTERS TEAM

166
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,680
A bunch of drunks.

167
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,040
<i>Barbecue with no beer</i>

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,680
<i>is such a waste of barbecue.</i>

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,720
MOM: HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
MAY YOU HAVE GOOD HEALTH.

170
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,880
<i>And thank you</i>

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
<i>for giving birth to me.</i>

173
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>Time is ruthless.</i>

174
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,680
<i>Especially for women.</i>

175
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
<i>Pay more attention to your own matters.</i>

176
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

177
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,880
<i>Okay.</i>

178
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
<i>Carrying them is so tiring.</i>

179
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
Are you done with work?

180
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Don't think that flattering me
will make me go easy on you.

181
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,640
Don't worry.

182
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
It was done early.

183
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,560
I can assure you
that there aren't any mistakes.

184
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,240
You are working more efficiently.

185
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,520
Ruoxin.

186
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Let's get off work on time.

187
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,040
Did you tell Mr. Xu?

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,000
Who's driving him?

189
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,920
Don't worry.

190
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,480
I told him this afternoon.

191
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,360
I told him I have a family issue.

192
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Ruoxin.

193
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
It's time. Let's go.

194
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,840
Hold on. Let me save this.

195
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
Why are you so happy?

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
It's not your own birthday.

197
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,920
It's a promise then.
You'll celebrate my birthday with me.

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Hello, Mr. Xu.

199
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Yes, I'm still here.

200
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,080
Right now?

201
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,800
Okay, I'll be right there.

202
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,560
You are not standing me up, are you?

203
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,320
Mr. Xu says the headquarters sent
the marketing team for a meeting.

204
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
You should go home first.

205
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll be back soon.

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,400
Why didn't he look for you sooner?

207
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,120
Why now?

208
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm sure it's about the test-drive event.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,280
It means they take our work seriously.

210
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
It will be quick.

211
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,600
Go home first.

212
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
Besides, my best friend will come later.

213
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
Okay?

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,920
How about this?

215
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,560
You can be late
for your birthday party too.

216
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,800
So it's a deal?

217
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,320
Come home soon.

218
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,560
We'll be waiting for you.

219
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,720
Okay.

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,680
I'm going.

221
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,320
Nine o'clock.

222
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,520
Should I still go then?

223
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,920
Of course, you should.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
I'll be done soon.

225
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,520
I'll text you when I'm done.
Then we'll go.

226
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,840
We'll arrive at the same time.

227
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
Okay.

228
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
You have to work overtime today.

229
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
Can it be that your boss knows

230
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,240
and wants to surprise you?

231
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,120
Bossy chairmen always do that

232
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
<i>in dramas.</i>

233
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,640
I'll hit you in the head.

234
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,240
<i>I should call Zou Cheng right now</i>

235
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,040
and tell him that his wife won't back down

236
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,440
because her brain is damaged.

237
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
Also, she's out of her mind.

238
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,360
Darn you.

239
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
That's enough.

240
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,280
Go back to your bossy chairman.

241
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
I'm hanging up.

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,960
You have been watching too many dramas.

243
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,560
Ms. Shen, this way, please.

244
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,000
Mr. Xu.

245
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,040
Thank you.

246
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,920
Happy birthday.

247
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,360
Mr. Xu.

248
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,440
This is…

249
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm really flattered.

250
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,120
Don't be.

251
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,400
Don't say that.

252
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,040
I was afraid you wouldn't want to come.

253
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,000
That's why I lied on the phone.

254
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,040
Trust me just this once.

255
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,520
I won't ever do it again.

256
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,160
Mr. Xu.

257
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,520
Actually, I know.

258
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,200
You have been nice to me.

259
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Without you,

260
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
I would have given up in Administration,

261
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,840
quit my job,

262
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,800
and left without getting a bonus.

263
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,960
So I'm grateful to you.

264
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,440
Stop.

265
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,960
I didn't ask you here

266
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,520
just to thank me.

267
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,760
And I don't need

268
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
your gratitude.

269
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
If anyone should be thankful,

270
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,120
it should be me.

271
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,240
Thank you for showing me
that there are still girls like you

272
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,360
in the workplace.

273
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,040
Ruoxin, to be honest,

274
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,920
I've dated different types of women.

275
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,680
And some of my relationships

276
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,200
were not exactly great.

277
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
From my experience,

278
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,360
I've seen quite a lot of
career-oriented and ambitious girls.

279
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,760
They were independent,

280
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
strong-minded, and capable.

281
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
But at the same time,

282
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
they also have their motives.

283
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,520
And they would get what they want
no matter the cost.

284
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,640
What about women who weren't ambitious?

285
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,040
They were vain.

286
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,880
Their vanity was like a bottomless pit.

287
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,800
It's endless.

288
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,120
So I had to date them in my own way.

289
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
But then, I met you.

290
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,520
You are really different from them.

291
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,320
You are competent, strong-minded,
and independent.

292
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,359
However…

293
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,359
You…

294
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,400
You don't have any ulterior motives.

295
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
You can always do

296
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,160
the tasks I gave you better than expected.

297
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,040
Wherever I took you,

298
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,119
you always behaved appropriately.

299
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,280
But at the same time,

300
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,160
you kept a very safe distance.

301
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,839
In fact, that makes me admire you.

302
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,880
Sometimes, when I'm with you,

303
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
I feel relaxed.

304
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
So I hope

305
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,640
that with you by my side,

306
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,680
you can help me

307
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,560
relieve some stress.

308
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
Allowing me to feel relaxed

309
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
both at work

310
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,760
and in life.

311
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
The truth is…

312
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,000
The truth is I do need a security blanket.

313
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Mr. Xu.

314
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm really grateful

315
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,440
that you think so highly of me.

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm currently under your command

317
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,560
and at your service.

318
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,600
You gave me so many opportunities.

319
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,280
I'll do my best

320
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,880
and work hard

321
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,280
to pay you back.

322
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,440
Let's not talk about this now.

323
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
Let's enjoy the beautiful view.

324
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
I'm here!

325
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,200
It's so pretty.

326
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,680
Su Yang.

327
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,600
Qi Xiao.

328
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,040
You have prepared so much food.

329
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,320
I'll help you.

330
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,480
Thank you.

331
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,840
Why isn't Ruoxin here yet?

332
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,800
Qi Xiao, send a message and ask her.

333
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,120
Is she done?

334
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,360
Is she still coming?

335
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,240
I did.

336
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,080
There's no reply.

337
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,720
What's wrong with him?

338
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,880
That Mr. Xu from your company.

339
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
Is he into Ruoxin?

340
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,120
Why did he make
her work overtime on her birthday?

341
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,520
Did he do that on purpose?

342
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,800
Mr. Xu and Ruoxin?

343
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
My goodness.

344
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,320
That's so romantic.

345
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
Ruoxin is so attractive.

346
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I'm telling you.

347
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,360
Mr. Xu is so much better than Mr. Cui.

348
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,720
What are you talking about?

349
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,320
No, he's not! Not at all!

350
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,840
Qi Xiao.

351
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
Are you

352
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,800
in love with Ruoxin?

353
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,560
Are you jealous?

354
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,360
No.

355
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,480
Are you serious?

356
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,000
She's more than ten years older than you.

357
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,960
I've told him so many times.

358
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,320
However,

359
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,360
he's in too deep to get out.

360
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
He can't help it.

361
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,400
I've tried every restaurant

362
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,640
around the Bund.

363
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,960
This one has the most unique view.

364
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,840
In my life,

365
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,120
I won't miss out on any good things.

366
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,760
But after choosing,

367
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,320
I only go for the best.

368
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,760
I'll say this again, Ruoxin.

369
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,240
I know.

370
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,280
You are independent.

371
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,240
You stand on your own.

372
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,600
That's what I like about you.

373
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,360
But tell me.

374
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
In a single day,

375
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
there's only one chance to see this view,

376
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,640
be at the right restaurant,

377
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,040
in the right mood,

378
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,680
and most importantly,

379
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,440
with the right person

380
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
and good weather too.

381
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
That's why it's very rare.

382
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,600
Like this cheese in front of us.

383
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,000
This kind of handmade cheese is

384
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,520
all over the shops in France.

385
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,720
But if you put them together,

386
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,040
ship them across the ocean

387
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,040
to us,

388
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,600
of course, they are expensive.

389
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,440
But if you let the person you love

390
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,560
taste how good they are,

391
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
the price doesn't matter.

392
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,120
What's important is

393
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,400
the feelings of the person…

394
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,560
who prepared the dish.

395
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,280
I…

396
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,920
May I put it on for you?

397
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,400
It's beautiful.

398
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,400
Mr. Xu.

399
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,560
It's too expensive.

400
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,840
Something this expensive

401
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,280
should be put on the most precious lady.

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,040
Mr. Xu.

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,720
I appreciate your kindness,

404
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,120
but I can't accept this necklace.

405
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,920
Ruoxin, you…

406
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,680
You are a smart woman.

407
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,120
Why don't you give yourself a chance

408
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
to see higher and farther?

409
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,760
I trust my taste.

410
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,320
The jewelry is expensive,

411
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,520
but you deserve it.

412
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,080
The view is beautiful.

413
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,360
And there will be many more.

414
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,560
You have to believe me.

415
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,280
I won't disappoint you.

416
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,960
Thank you so much, Mr. Xu.

417
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,600
I really can't accept it.

418
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,640
Can you tell me why?

419
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,720
If I tell you,

420
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,080
you'll laugh at me for being stupid.

421
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,880
But really,

422
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,960
there's no occasion for me

423
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,360
to wear a necklace like this.

424
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,320
When I just graduated

425
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
and got my first paycheck,

426
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,240
my best friend said to me,

427
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
"You should buy an expensive bag.

428
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
You earned it."

429
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,640
But I didn't.

430
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
Of course, I could.

431
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
I could buy myself a designer bag.

432
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,960
But with such an expensive bag,

433
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,280
I won't be able to wear

434
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,560
the casual clothes

435
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,320
that I used to wear.

436
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,160
And I can't be sloppy.

437
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,360
I would have to buy designer clothes,

438
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,560
designer shoes,

439
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,840
or even designer watches.

440
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,280
If I bought all those things,

441
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,960
how could I take the bus

442
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,040
or the subway every day?

443
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,240
Then don't I have to give myself

444
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,080
a car as well?

445
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,320
With a car,

446
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
can I still room with someone else

447
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,240
like I used to do?

448
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,600
Should I

449
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
pick a better neighborhood

450
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,120
and rent a better house?

451
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,280
A designer bag.

452
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,720
I can afford it if I work hard.

453
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,840
But living the life after a designer bag,

454
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,760
I can't fake that.

455
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,720
It's because I'm not at that level yet.

456
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,160
I think you are overthinking it,
I really do.

457
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,560
A bag is just a bag

458
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,960
and a necklace is just a necklace.

459
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
Don't think about the rest.

460
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,480
Yes. Now that I think about it,
it was so ridiculous.

461
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,160
It's just a bag.

462
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,400
But when I figured it all out,

463
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,800
I've worked for many years.

464
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,280
I had my own savings, promotions,

465
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,760
and bought a house and a car.

466
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,760
But back then,

467
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
if I were to buy such an expensive bag,

468
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
I really might have

469
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,200
to cut back on food
and have instant noodles for a month

470
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,480
to save that money.

471
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,200
Mr. Xu.

472
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,280
Isn't it tiring to live like that?

473
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
I know.

474
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,960
You stand taller than me.

475
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,520
You look farther than I do.

476
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,480
But I really hope

477
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,720
that I can do it on my own,

478
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,560
stand on my own ground,

479
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,760
and look at my own view.

480
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,920
I don't want

481
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,960
to be pulled up to the top by others,

482
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,920
to tiptoe

483
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
and see

484
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,600
the view someone else shows me.

485
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
That's too exhausting.

486
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,000
You…

487
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,360
You still don't trust me.

488
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,600
I trust you.

489
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,480
I trust that you are the best boss.

490
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,640
You have given me so much chance and help.

491
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm really grateful.

492
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,160
But I really hope

493
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,280
that one day,

494
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,200
with my own efforts,

495
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,040
I can buy it for myself

496
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,400
when I have the occasion for the necklace.

497
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,800
Mr. Xu.

498
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,760
Thank you for tonight,

499
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,920
for preparing all these,

500
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
and for showing me

501
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,960
this beautiful view of Shanghai.

502
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm very grateful.

503
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
But I thought

504
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,400
you asked me here for work.

505
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
In fact, my friends and I

506
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,560
are celebrating my birthday tonight.

507
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,120
They are still waiting for me.

508
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,520
Therefore,

509
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm really sorry.

510
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,840
I have to go.

511
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,080
Thank you.

512
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,840
Mr. Xu, should I still serve the food?

513
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,040
Yes.

514
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,840
For one person.

515
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,280
Thank you.

516
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,560
I have to change
the speech for the test-drive event,

517
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll see you at the office.

518
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,560
HI, MAGIC CITY

519
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
I'm not against older women
dating younger men.

520
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,200
These days,

521
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,160
it's normal for girls to be older

522
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,520
and Ruoxin is so attractive, right?

523
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,000
However,

524
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,040
Ruoxin is different.

525
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,280
She's so rational.

526
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,680
She always does things

527
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,160
for the outcome.

528
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,000
So I think it's hard for her

529
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,400
to have a passionate romance

530
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,480
with a younger man that wouldn't work out.

531
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,000
Why wouldn't it work out?

532
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,920
Yes, there's an age difference.

533
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,280
But I'm just young, not naive.

534
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,320
I know what she's thinking.

535
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,880
I understand

536
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,160
all of her emotions.

537
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,600
Why can't I be serious

538
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
and be in a real relationship?

539
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
That's what you think.

540
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,200
How do you know what she thinks?

541
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,440
Fine. Even if she treats you
like a suitor,

542
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,560
let's be real.

543
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,320
It's Mr. Xu you are up against.

544
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,760
Beer and barbecue or expensive delicacies.

545
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,520
Which will she choose?

546
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,800
How do you know
that she won't choose the barbecue?

547
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,080
Ruoxin is rational,

548
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,440
but she's not a gold digger

549
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,640
and she's not snobby.

550
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,240
I know she prefers spicy hot pot

551
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,000
over molecular gastronomy.

552
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,120
Besides,

553
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,040
isn't happiness the most important thing
in a relationship?

554
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,040
Or is it a personal background?

555
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Qi Xiao.

556
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,000
I think you are right.

557
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,920
Relationships

558
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,480
don't have to be materialistic.

559
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,560
If you like each other,

560
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,280
then having beer and barbecue

561
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
will make you happy too.

562
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,440
Also, expensive delicacies
are not for everyone.

563
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,000
Qi Xiao, I support you.

564
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,760
But since you like Ruoxin,

565
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,640
you should be brave and let her know.

566
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,920
It's meaningless for you
to be mad and jealous by yourself.

567
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,920
I don't want to scare her.

568
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,280
I don't know.

569
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,160
I need some time to think.

570
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,840
What a coincidence.

571
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,360
I told you.

572
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,199
We'll arrive around the same time.

573
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,600
Birthday girl.

574
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,679
Are you done with your boss?

575
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,960
I'm not sure

576
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,040
if I handled it correctly.

577
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,480
What's wrong?

578
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,400
What happened?

579
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,920
I think

580
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,560
I may have offended our boss.

581
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,360
Just as I finally get
a small break in my career,

582
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,520
my future is bleak again.

583
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,600
I don't believe you.

584
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,600
I've seen you like this many times.

585
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,360
Back in the days, after exams,
you would look like this,

586
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,760
sighing heavily, saying,

587
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,760
"I messed up this time."

588
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,040
In the end,
you were still at the top of our class.

589
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,080
I told you.

590
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,400
You were made
to turn all the worst into the best.

591
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,760
This isn't like an exam.

592
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,920
There are standard answers for exams.

593
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
But now,

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
I'm very unsure.

595
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Be confident.

596
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,760
You're the unstoppable Shen Ruoxin

597
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,600
that can overcome whatever coming, okay?

598
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
After all these years,

599
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
what haven't you overcome?

600
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,840
You need to have a little faith
in yourself.

601
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,800
And it's your birthday.

602
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,360
Whatever problem you have,

603
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,040
save it for tomorrow.

604
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,280
Also, Shen Ruoxin,

605
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,520
because of you,

606
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,120
I traveled across Shanghai.

607
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,480
You have to give me a smile.

608
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,440
We'll party tonight

609
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,560
and have a happy birthday.

610
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,480
Here we are.

611
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,000
We're here.

612
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,640
Ruoxin.

613
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,520
Ruoxin.

614
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,160
Ruoxin, you're here.

615
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,360
You are right on time.

616
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,040
These kids are so friendly.

617
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,240
Ruoxin, you're finally here.

618
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,960
Otherwise, this is too much food
for us to finish.

619
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,440
I told you.

620
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
We'll make it in time.

621
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,040
Start grilling. I'm starving.

622
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,400
I'm on it.

623
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,560
Two potato chips, please.

624
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,520
And four chicken wings. Make them spicy.

625
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,920
All right.

626
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Do you need help?

627
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,840
No, you should sit. Go have fun.

628
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,040
Don't drink too much.

629
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,960
I bought some drinks.

630
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,120
Take a look. Which one do you like?

631
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,200
- This one.
- Okay.

632
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
Let me do it.

633
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,600
Thank you.

634
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,280
Ruoxin.

635
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,560
Have some barbecue.

636
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Thank you.

637
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,920
You left early.

638
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,000
Was Mr. Xu upset?

639
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,720
I hope not.

640
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,160
But that's okay.

641
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,160
It's my birthday today.

642
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,680
I'm the boss. I'll do whatever I want.

643
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,920
Leave business for tomorrow.

644
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,840
Exactly.

645
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,440
Who would work with their boss
on their birthday?

646
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,480
Do you want
to work overtime on your birthday?

647
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,440
If it's working overtime with you,

648
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,680
I would love to.

649
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,520
Really?

650
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,960
Really.

651
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,960
Birthday girl.

652
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,920
Come here and blow out the candles.

653
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,880
Song Ziyan, your cooking skills
are improving day by day.

654
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,120
Look at what you have made.

655
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,080
Of course.

656
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,680
I designed it myself.

657
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
And I made it myself.

658
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
Ruoxin, make a wish.

659
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,640
Here.

660
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,160
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

661
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,440
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

662
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,600
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

663
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,000
<i>- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you</i>

664
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,000
Thank you.

665
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Blow the candles.

666
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,360
Let's do it together.

667
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,520
One, two, three.

668
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,800
Ruoxin.

669
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,320
What did you just wish for?

670
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,720
Will my wish come true if I tell you?

671
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,480
No. How can you say it out loud?

672
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,760
Ruoxin, this is my gift for you.
Take a look.

673
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,760
Goodness, Sijia.

674
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
It's so pretty. I love it. Thank you.

675
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm glad you like it.

676
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
It's pretty.

677
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,840
It's pretty.

678
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,000
Happy birthday.

679
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
It's so pretty.

680
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:27,960
Qi Xiao.

681
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,560
Did you make this?

682
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,520
I can vouch for him.

683
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
He worked on it for days.

684
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,800
A while ago,

685
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,720
I saw a picture of the Rosette Nebula.

686
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,200
It looked so beautiful,
I was inspired by that.

687
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,520
A picture of the Rosette Nebula?

688
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,760
Which one did you see?

689
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,440
This one.

690
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,560
I edited this.

691
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
You edited it?

692
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,240
Previously, I paid someone

693
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,440
to take a picture of nebulae
for me on the NASA website.

694
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,800
Then I edited it myself.

695
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,120
Young man.

696
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,160
You didn't see that on Ruoxin's profile,

697
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,280
did you?

698
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,960
I didn't.

699
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,840
Ruoxin, you have a WeChat public account?

700
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,240
What's your name?

701
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,160
"Eyes of the Sky."

702
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,120
Look it up.

703
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,600
Is this it?

704
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,040
Yes, this is it.

705
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,440
It's not huge though.

706
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,960
I have only less than
a thousand followers.

707
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,840
Young man.

708
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,640
Flatter her a little bit.

709
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Follow it.

710
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,400
Where did you find this photo?

711
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,840
For a while, I've been wanting

712
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,800
to make a piece
of astronomy-related jewelry.

713
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,320
So I was searching.

714
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,080
And I found this picture
to be the most interesting.

715
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,680
I was worried you wouldn't like it.

716
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,360
But since you are the inspiration,

717
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,320
then I must've had the right gift.

718
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,000
Ruoxin, let me put it on for you.

719
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,040
Okay.

720
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,880
Here.

721
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,400
- How is it?
- It's pretty.

722
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,080
It looks good on you.

723
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,360
Isn't it pretty?

724
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,400
It is.

725
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,200
All right.

726
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Thank you. I love it.

727
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,880
It really looks good on you.

728
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,880
Is that so?

729
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,320
Why don't you give this young man a raise?

730
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,800
Come on.

731
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,080
He still needs observation
after getting a permanent position.

732
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,040
All bosses are the same.

733
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,640
Just cut the cake.

734
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,600
Let's do it.

735
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,280
Here I go.

736
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm cutting the cake.

737
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,280
I'll get you a big one.

738
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,240
Here.

739
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,920
You can have a big one.

740
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,120
Qi Xiao.

741
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,160
Ruoxin.

742
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,600
After I've revised the schedule
for the test-drive event,

743
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,640
that's all of it.

744
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,680
Thank you.

745
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,200
I called for a meeting so late.

746
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Go home and get some rest.

747
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,920
I'm leaving then, Mr. Xu.

748
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,840
See you tomorrow.

749
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,760
