1
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,400
Mr. Jin, take your time.

2
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Take a good look.

3
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,920
I've sent you a copy this morning.

4
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,160
They're the same.

5
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Sijia will keep in touch with you.

6
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,000
After your wife is discharged,

7
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
please tell us the cost
of the hospital bills.

8
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,560
Once we've checked the amount,

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,720
we will transfer the money
to your account.

10
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,880
You may think about it.

11
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
It's okay.

12
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,760
There's no need.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,080
Where do I sign?

14
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Right here.

15
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,640
Right.

16
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
Can you delete that recording?

17
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
Of course, there's no point in keeping it.

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
There's one more.

19
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
Can I go?

20
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,640
I'll walk you out, Mr. Jin.

21
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,160
Get back to work.

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,200
I'll see Mr. Jin off.

23
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,000
It's easier to get in here than out.

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
This way, please.

25
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Here, Mr. Jin.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,920
Take care, Mr. Jin.

27
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,160
You're always welcome here.

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,680
Don't worry. I won't be back.

29
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,600
Yes.

30
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
She has to give us an explanation.

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,360
They're here. It's her.

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
- Mr. Jin.
- Mr. Jin.

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,840
Did you sign a settlement with them?

34
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,360
- Did they force you?
- It's her.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,240
The woman in the video.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,200
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
Ever since Jin posted online,

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
we've been paying attention.

39
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
We support Mr. Jin. Protect his rights!

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,080
That's right, Jin. Don't be afraid.

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
Just sue them.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Calm down, everyone. Calm down.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,960
We have settled everything
regarding the incident.

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,520
We've worked it out peacefully.

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Peacefully, my ass.

47
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,600
You big companies are bullies.

48
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
- Yes.
- No.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
That's right.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,240
Is this you in the video?

51
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
How dare you threaten his wife and child?

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
That's not true.

53
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,080
That's not what happened.

54
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,560
Where is this video from?

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,120
- Where?
- This morning.

56
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
A righteous individual posted
it on our website.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
- Right.
- No, Mr. Jin.

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,080
Explain it to them.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
That wasn't the case.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,200
- Right?
- Yes, that's right.

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,680
- Yes.
- Let me help her explain.

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,280
Let me make this clear.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
First, I didn't record that video

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
and I didn't post it online.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
I have nothing to do with it.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
Ms. Shen.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Even though I made a deal with you,

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,079
I don't have to speak for you.

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
To be honest,

70
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,279
I hate you a lot.

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,120
I hate your company very much.

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,800
From now on, we're done.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,840
As for whether you've threatened me,

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,000
you know the truth.

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
My friends.

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,880
It's not easy to save up and buy a car.

77
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,440
- Listen to Mr. Jin. It's her.
- That's her.

78
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
- That's her.
- That's her.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
- Let me explain.
- It's her.

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
Can't you people be reasonable?

81
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,040
Serves you right. You're evil.

82
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
- You deserve this.
- Listen.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
You have to explain it to us

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,440
or we won't let you go.

85
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,920
- We need an explanation.
- Explain.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
- Explain.
- We need an explanation.

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,640
We need an explanation.

88
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
You threatened other people's children.

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
You're too arrogant.

90
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,240
- That's right.
- You're shameless.

91
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
- Explain.
- We need an explanation.

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
- Give us our money back.
- Explain.

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
Go away.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,080
What are you doing?

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,240
Do you enjoy ganging up on a woman?

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,680
Aren't you ashamed?

97
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,600
I'll call the police if you don't stop.

98
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,200
- Do you believe me?
- Go ahead.

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,240
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

100
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,360
- Who's that?
- What does he do?

101
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,320
POOR QUALITY CARS

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,640
PROFITEERS

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,160
SHAMELESS COMPANY

104
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,240
TIMER

105
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,880
TIMER ENDS

106
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Qi Xiao.

107
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,159
Is Ruoxin inside?

108
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,559
I heard that someone threw water at her.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,400
I brought her clothes and shoes.

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,800
It has been ten minutes.

111
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,800
Go inside. I'm worried.

112
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,960
But what should I say?

113
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,320
You're both girls.

114
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Go inside and comfort her. Hurry up.

115
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,720
But she's my boss.

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Hurry up.

117
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,800
Ruoxin.

118
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,240
Are you okay?

119
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm fine.

120
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
It's just cola, not acid.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
Thank you for this.

122
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
Create a post online right now.

123
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,800
We need to set the record straight.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,760
And find out who posted the video.

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,240
Who started the rumor?

126
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
What do those people want?

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
It must be Jin Yuanhao.

128
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,160
No, he didn't know we were coming,

129
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,360
so he couldn't have set that up.

130
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
That's right.

131
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Jin Yuanhao called us because
he didn't want things to get out of hand.

132
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,360
He has no motive.

133
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
Ms. Shen.

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,120
I watched the video many times.

135
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,840
You're always at the center.

136
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
I think they're targeting you.

137
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,680
You can take a look.

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,160
It was posted anonymously.

139
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
I looked into that user.

140
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,760
His account was created a few days ago.

141
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,360
And this is his only post.

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
I think he is up to no good.

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,120
I know an expert in computer science.

144
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,920
If you need it,
I can ask him to look into this.

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,920
We might find clues.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,960
All right, Qi Xiao.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,520
You're in charge of this post.

148
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,320
Keep an eye on what this person does next.

149
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Meanwhile, ask your friend.

150
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,520
Find out who started the rumor.

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,240
- Okay.
- Sijia.

152
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,840
Contact the PR Department now.

153
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,600
Draft a response letter immediately.

154
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
- Be quick.
- Okay.

155
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
Go.

156
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,400
I was terrified.

157
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
She acts as if nothing has happened.

158
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
She's so tough.

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
She's not just tough.

160
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,240
That's not normal.

161
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Why is that not normal?

162
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,440
That's too rational for a woman

163
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
that it's not human.

164
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,120
You're the one that's not human.

165
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Should women hide in the corner and cry?

166
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,680
Who did this then?

167
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,440
If it's against our company,
what's the purpose?

168
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,960
What's his next move?

169
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,080
Liu Pei.

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,800
I've told you.

171
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,600
That woman…

172
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
She has long hair, but short sight.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,440
She has the brains, but is that enough?

174
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,120
Jin Yuanhao wanted two million.

175
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, he asked for too much.

176
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,000
But they're making such a fuss
for just two million.

177
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,280
We're in the spotlight now.

178
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
That's not good.

179
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,960
Liu Pei.

180
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,440
If word gets out

181
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,440
to the headquarters

182
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,360
to Mr. Zhang,

183
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
that'll be bad.

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,440
This long-haired, but short-sighted woman.

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,840
How is she so--

186
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
This is bad.

187
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,640
This is bad.

188
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,600
The video of Shen Ruoxin is trending.

189
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,040
"Legal Officer
Who Threatened Car Owner Got Splashed.

190
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
It Was Delightful."

191
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,600
You can see for yourself.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,280
Qi Xiao.

193
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,320
This is our response to the PR Department.

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,520
Deliver it later.

195
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
- Okay.
- Here, pay attention.

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Qi Xiao.

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,960
There's a rule for new employees.

198
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,000
There will be a welcome party tonight.
Don't leave after work.

199
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay.

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Yes, we have such a rule.

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
I'll ask Ruoxin about the restaurant.

202
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,600
It's okay.

203
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,960
Mr. Ruan's secretary has booked

204
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,240
a Japanese restaurant called Black Pearl.

205
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,640
Ms. Shen is busy right now.

206
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Don't bother her with these things.

207
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,960
Remember to come tonight.

208
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,960
THREATENED WITH WIFE AND CHILD

209
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,200
<i>I saw the group chat.</i>

210
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,320
<i>Are you okay?</i>

211
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,640
SPAM CALL

212
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,480
<i>I'm fine now. Thank you.</i>

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
<i>About yesterday,</i>

214
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
<i>I was too emotional.</i>

215
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Come in.

216
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,360
Ms. Shen, Mr. Liu wants you
in his office now.

217
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,080
Okay.

218
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,160
Come in.

219
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,560
Mr. Liu.

220
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,920
- Is everything okay?
- I've notified the PR Department.

221
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
There will be an announcement.

222
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,080
After your approval, it will be posted.

223
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
Let's not talk about this first.

224
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
Ruan Ye is in charge of that.

225
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,760
I want to know now.

226
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,360
What do you think about it?

227
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,600
Do you mean the video clip?

228
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,040
I swear.

229
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
It's true that I met Jin Yuanhao.

230
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
But I'll never
threaten anyone with their child.

231
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Ruoxin.

232
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
I believe you.

233
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
But will the netizens believe you?

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
So you mean…

235
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,840
This video has a particularly
bad influence.

236
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,400
The person who posted the video

237
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,960
is going against our company.

238
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,440
I really want to know.

239
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Is it a coincidence that he knew

240
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
that we're on Jin Yuanhao's case?

241
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,800
And when you visited Jin Yuanhao,

242
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,280
he happened to take the video.

243
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
And he bent the truth
to tarnish our company's reputation.

244
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Do you think

245
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,680
that I'm colluding with this guy?

246
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,040
Ms. Shen, calm down.

247
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
Mr. Liu was just trying

248
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,560
to objectively analyze
all the possibilities.

249
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,600
After all, you have been in charge
of Jin Yuanhao's case.

250
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
And it was your decision
to go to the hospital that day.

251
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,200
It's normal for others

252
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,000
to question you, right?

253
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,400
What do you think?

254
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,040
I'm the one who got splashed

255
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,920
and am in the center of all the gossip.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,800
Am I stupid enough to frame myself?

257
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,600
All right, Ruoxin.

258
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,760
Stop it.

259
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,640
I don't care if it was personal

260
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,280
or was it against our company,

261
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,080
but things have gotten out of hand.

262
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,840
It has such a negative effect
on our brand.

263
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,480
I think you should stop appearing

264
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,800
in front of the public.

265
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,680
It's to protect you
for your own good as well. Okay?

266
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you mean?

267
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,040
You're making me the sacrificial lamb?

268
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,840
Good.

269
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,480
The PR announcement is done.

270
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,880
Mr. Liu, please take a look.

271
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
Ms. Shen, take a look.

272
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,800
All right.

273
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,200
Why don't I read it out loud?

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,160
"After an investigation,

275
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
the Legal Department's Ms. Shen

276
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,200
did meet Mr. Jin Yuanhao at the hospital

277
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,040
yesterday afternoon.

278
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,320
But unlike what the video says,

279
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,680
she didn't threaten Jin Yuanhao

280
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,320
with the safety of his family.

281
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,840
This matter

282
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,120
is very important to Zenpro Automotive.

283
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,160
For causing so much trouble,

284
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,760
we would like to sincerely apologize
to Jin Yuanhao's family

285
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,000
and to everyone who has been paying
attention to the matter.

286
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,800
The company has decided that

287
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,040
starting tomorrow,

288
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,360
Ms. Shen will no longer be working
for the company's Legal Department.

289
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,520
Hereby certified by

290
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Public Relations, Zenpro Automotive."

291
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,600
Also, Mr. Liu.

292
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,880
I made an appointment with Jin Yuanhao.

293
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,040
I asked him to work with us

294
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,760
and publish his own statement

295
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,840
to put an end to this.

296
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,760
And he agreed to it.

297
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,760
Ruan Ye.

298
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,640
Good job.

299
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,080
The way you do your work is…

300
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Mr. Liu, it's for the company.
It's my duty.

301
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,800
Mr. Liu.

302
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,400
I've been working here
since after graduate school.

303
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,120
It has been seven years.

304
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,680
I'm attached to this company.

305
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,280
Ms. Shen.

306
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,079
Mr. Liu cares about
people's feelings as well.

307
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,119
He knows you've been working
for the company for years,

308
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
so he didn't take extreme measures.

309
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,359
But word has gone to the headquarters.

310
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,839
They were very upset.

311
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,080
Mr. Liu withstood the pressure
to protect you.

312
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,600
You would've been fired earlier.

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,120
So quit while you're ahead.

314
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,040
All right.

315
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Ruan Ye.

316
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,200
Okay.

317
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
I'll be outside.

318
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
Ruoxin.

319
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,440
Have a seat.

320
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,080
The company has decided
that starting tomorrow,

321
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,080
you'll be transferred
from Legal to Administration.

322
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,400
Whether the attack

323
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,560
was personal or against the company,

324
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,560
transferring you

325
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,760
is the best solution.

326
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
Mr. Liu.

327
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,840
I studied law.

328
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,080
What can I do in Administration?

329
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,560
It's the same.

330
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,720
You'll still be a manager.

331
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,040
What will be the problem?

332
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,680
Besides, as Ruan Ye said,

333
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,560
I protected you,

334
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,280
so quit while you're ahead.

335
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,080
- Since you've made your decision--
- Yes.

336
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I've notified the HR Department.

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
Get some rest this afternoon.

338
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Report to Administration tomorrow.

339
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,720
Okay, I understand.

340
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,440
My shift ends in two hours.

341
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
I'll cover my last shift
in the Legal Department.

342
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,000
<i>Shen Ruoxin is out.</i>

343
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,400
<i>Is this for real?</i>

344
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>She's so good. How can it be?</i>

345
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,520
<i>How could this happen?</i>

346
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,080
<i>It seems to be true.</i>

347
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,840
<i>- She has been transferred.
- I think it's true.</i>

348
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,440
Ms. Shen, this box is for you.

349
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,960
We're tidying up your new desk now.

350
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,880
Leave it there. Thank you.

351
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,040
ZENPRO LEGAL GROUP:
MR. RUAN IS TREATING EVERYONE

352
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,520
TO JAPANESE CUISINE
TO WELCOME QI XIAO INTO THE TEAM

353
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
YOU'VE BEEN REMOVED BY MS. QIAO

354
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Ms. Shen.

355
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Ms. Shen.

356
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
My computer science friend just told me

357
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,760
that he's still trying to track
the IP address for us.

358
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Right.

359
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
I also checked the username on the forum.

360
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
On other websites,

361
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,240
I found similar usernames.

362
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,920
After reading the posts,

363
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,120
I found a special one.

364
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,120
Two months ago,

365
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,440
he asked,

366
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,000
"How do I install a tracking app

367
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,040
on my wife's phone?"

368
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,520
- I think this is--
- You should know

369
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
that I don't work here now.

370
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,280
You don't have to report this
to me anymore.

371
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,760
I don't think it's fair.

372
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,280
You're the victim.

373
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,240
What else can I do?

374
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,760
My personal situation,

375
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
compared to the company's interests,

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,200
is like an ant to an elephant.

377
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,760
Do I have a choice?

378
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,880
Get out. I want to be alone.

379
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Close the door for me, thank you.

380
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,680
<i>Everyone.</i>

381
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,000
We have a new colleague.

382
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,000
Come. Introduce yourself.

383
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,600
Hello, my name is Shen Ruoxin.

384
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,480
I look forward to working with you.

385
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,840
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

386
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Welcome.

387
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

388
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
Ruoxin.

389
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,280
You're amazing.

390
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,600
You won the biggest case

391
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,040
of intellectual property in our industry.

392
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,000
Yes.

393
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,400
People praise the lawyers

394
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,800
as if the Legal Department is useless.

395
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,200
Ms. Shen, you made us proud this time.

396
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Congratulations.

397
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,360
Don't say that.

398
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,360
It's thanks to the lawyers.

399
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,920
And you guys too, right?

400
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,120
I should toast you guys.

401
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,400
Good job, everyone. Here.

402
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,680
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

403
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,160
<i>- Thank you.
- Thank you.</i>

404
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,440
Why are you still here?

405
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,920
Didn't Ruan Ye

406
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,680
hold a welcome party for you?

407
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,480
I made up an excuse.

408
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm not going.

409
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
It's not a welcome party
if you aren't there.

410
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,600
They can do whatever they want.

411
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,000
You recruited me.

412
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,960
I just wanted to stay and see

413
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
if you needed any more help.

414
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
What were you thinking?

415
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,520
You just got in.

416
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,960
Are you trying to piss off
all the leaders and your colleagues?

417
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,840
Don't you know how stupid you're being?

418
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,320
So be it.

419
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Young people are stupid.

420
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,040
Right.

421
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,600
What should we eat later?

422
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,800
What do you mean?

423
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
I told you that I was hired by you.

424
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,400
Of course you should treat me
to a welcome party.

425
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,840
I'm sorry.

426
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
You work for the Legal Department.

427
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,600
I don't anymore.

428
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Law students should be strict.

429
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,040
You'll be working in Administration
starting tomorrow.

430
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,800
So right here, right now,

431
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
you're still in the Legal Department.

432
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,880
If you really want me to treat you,

433
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,800
then you'll have what I'm having.

434
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,200
No problem.

435
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
It's good.

436
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,680
Why aren't you eating?

437
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
Can't you eat spicy food?

438
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,200
I didn't expect that you, a Shanghainese,

439
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,840
to mean such levels of spiciness
when you said "spicy."

440
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,680
You ordered too much food for us two.

441
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,320
Of course. I haven't had lunch yet.

442
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,680
We have to finish it.

443
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,240
Beef tallow hot pot is delicious.

444
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,400
Try it.

445
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Can you even eat spicy food?

446
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,800
Are you regretting it?

447
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,160
You should've gone with them

448
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,720
rather than having this with me.

449
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,760
I'm a man.

450
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,680
I never have regrets. I'll eat.

451
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,960
Come on. Eat up.

452
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,240
Ruoxin.

453
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,960
It smells so good.

454
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,960
You're having hot pot?

455
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,200
What are you doing here?

456
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,480
Is the party over?

457
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,040
No.

458
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,680
I told them I had an emergency and left.

459
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,320
Qi Xiao told me where you are.

460
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,640
Yes.

461
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,800
Here.

462
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,000
Chopsticks.

463
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,920
Ruoxin.

464
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,320
The truth is…

465
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,520
Actually, I heard that the headquarters
didn't question you.

466
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
It was Mr. Liu and Mr. Ruan

467
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,480
who were trying to get rid of you.

468
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,920
I already guessed that.

469
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,040
To be honest,
I never wanted to be in office politics.

470
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,160
I always felt that
if I rely on my own efforts,

471
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,440
I believe I can make it.

472
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,280
But as it turns out,

473
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,800
I guess I was wrong.

474
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,680
So you two need to learn from my mistakes.

475
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,880
From now on,

476
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
butter Ruan Ye up if you have to.

477
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,200
You can even stomp on me if you need to.

478
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,680
I don't mind.

479
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,000
Come on. Let's drink.

480
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,880
Hurry up.

481
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,320
Ruoxin.

482
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
For the past two years,

483
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,840
thank you for always taking care of me.

484
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,360
When you're in Administration,

485
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,800
if there's anything I can do to help,

486
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
please let me know.

487
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,280
Just ask.

488
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
Okay.

489
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,240
Ruoxin.

490
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll get that person who framed you.

491
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,280
That's enough.

492
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,000
We'll part ways and still be happy.

493
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,200
From now on, both of you
should take care of yourselves.

494
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,680
Bottoms up.

495
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,600
Bottoms up.

496
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
This is great.

497
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
Hurry up and eat.

498
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,960
It's so good.

499
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,520
I'm telling you, it's too spicy.

500
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,520
It's barely edible.

501
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
You'll get used to it.

502
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,360
All right.

503
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,040
Go home.

504
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,080
I'm leaving.

505
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,360
Ruoxin, are you really okay?

506
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,880
Although your news isn't trending anymore,

507
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,320
I still see many comments saying

508
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,880
they want to dig up information on you.

509
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,760
Yes, you should lay low for a while.

510
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,520
We haven't found the culprit yet.

511
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,960
- What if he's up to something again?
- That's right.

512
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,640
Why don't you stay with your mom
for a couple of days?

513
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,760
Forget it.

514
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,160
I can't go to my mom's house.

515
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,320
She'll be suspicious.

516
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,000
Besides, if they dig up my mom's address,

517
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,320
isn't that even worse?

518
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,240
They're just gossiping online.

519
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
I think

520
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
they won't do anything to me in real life.

521
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
Besides, I've taken self-defense classes.

522
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,960
I should be fine.

523
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm leaving.

524
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

525
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Ruoxin is such a brave woman.

526
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,840
If I'm half as good as her,

527
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,120
I'll be satisfied.

528
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,120
No matter how strong she is,

529
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,320
she must still have a soft side.

530
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm leaving too.

531
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,880
Su Yang found a house.
I'm moving tomorrow.

532
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,160
Wait.

533
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,880
Su Yang?

534
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,320
You're still living together?

535
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,680
He is looking for a job.

536
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,360
We haven't moved since graduation.

537
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,480
I'm still rooming with him.

538
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,520
The school has issued a final warning.

539
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,360
We have to move out now.

540
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,640
But I think we can still be roommates.

541
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,480
We can split the rent as well.

542
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,600
He happens to have a classmate
who owns a house.

543
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
We're renting it for 5,000 yuan.

544
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
It's quite nice.

545
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,040
It's 5,000 yuan a month?

546
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
That's expensive.

547
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,320
This classmate is getting paid that much.

548
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,520
We settle financial matters clearly.

549
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,720
You've been very loyal and helpful
to Su Yang

550
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,520
by rooming with him.

551
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
That's the least I can do.

552
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
The rental in Shanghai…

553
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,880
It's not easy for him to stay.

554
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,640
Fine, I get that you two are good friends.

555
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
By the way,

556
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,680
is Su Yang still working on his webtoon?

557
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,200
I've been following his works.

558
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
Yes.

559
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,080
I'll tell that punk.

560
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,720
He does have fans.

561
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,320
Actually,

562
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,120
I haven't gone back to school
in a long time.

563
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
I would like to take a look.

564
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,720
And I'm experienced

565
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,040
in moving and packing.

566
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,200
I see.

567
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,840
I'll call Su Yang right now.

568
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll have him pick us up.

569
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,239
Can I crash at your place tonight?

570
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,239
Over there.

571
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,320
How is that? Is that okay?

572
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,760
Su Yang, look who's here.

573
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,440
- Hi, Su Yang.
- Hi.

574
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
Do you remember me?

575
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Of course I remember.

576
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,240
Hello, You Sijia.

577
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
It has been a while.

578
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Yes.

579
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,640
It has been a while.

580
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,440
I never thought I would see you again.

581
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,280
I told you.

582
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I was able to stay at Zenpro
because of her.

583
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,800
But I'm afraid
I'm not the one she's interested in.

584
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,400
When we were having dinner,

585
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,840
she had been asking about someone else.

586
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,720
When she heard
that someone was about to move,

587
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,120
she volunteered to help.

588
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,480
Qi Xiao, what are you talking about?

589
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,600
I haven't been back
to school for a long time.

590
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,160
I want to be on the school field

591
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
and watch the moon.

592
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,680
The moon?

593
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,120
Yes, I got it.

594
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,160
Help Su Yang pack

595
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,640
and he'll watch the moon with you.

596
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
What do you mean by that?

597
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
Are you not moving?

598
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,320
You really aren't the romantic style.

599
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,040
Fine, I'll be the third wheel.

600
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,480
We'll all pack and watch the moon, okay?

601
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
By the way, after packing today,

602
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,760
I'll come back early tomorrow
to move our things.

603
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
- Wait for me.
- No.

604
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,200
I checked. There aren't too many things.

605
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,440
I'll call a cab tomorrow
and get it over with.

606
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,560
Stay at the office.

607
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Go straight to the new place after work.

608
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,280
Don't you have a lot of stuff?

609
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,960
When I moved out of the dorm,

610
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,680
I couldn't fit everything in one car.

611
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
You're a girl.

612
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,160
You have more belongings.

613
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,720
All right, don't stand there.

614
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,080
Let's go and pack.

615
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,880
The moon will be gone soon.

616
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,680
There'll be nothing to watch then.

617
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,360
- Let's go.
- Come on.

618
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,960
My goodness.

619
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,920
What are you doing, Song Ziyan?

620
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,000
Are you confessing your love to me?

621
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,480
I didn't wait in vain
for ten years, did I?

622
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,160
Finally.

623
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,360
Look at what you've done.

624
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,120
I shouldn't have bought crayfish.

625
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
I should've bought M9 wagyu.

626
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,440
I already have the wagyu beef.

627
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,480
Actually,

628
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
I was trying to be romantic
with Zou Cheng.

629
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,560
But that rascal went on a business trip.

630
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,840
So it's yours now.

631
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
Your house is full
of the erotic scent of truffles now.

632
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,960
I'll pass.

633
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,880
I already ate hot pot. I'm so full.

634
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,120
Your husband can have it.

635
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Leave it for him.

636
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll get changed then.

637
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,120
Go and get changed.

638
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,800
Tell me. What's wrong?

639
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,560
What's the problem?

640
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,960
Why do you have to stay here?

641
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,880
It's work.

642
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,120
Though I've been working
at this company for seven years,

643
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,600
now I'm back to square one.

644
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,720
Did your boss frame you?

645
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Were they the ones you mentioned earlier?

646
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,000
Mr. Liu and Mr. Ruan?

647
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,720
It's a long story.

648
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,440
I feel like a sunflower right now.

649
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,400
I'm facing the sun,

650
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,760
but my body wants to rest in the mud.

651
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Is my house the mud?

652
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,920
Have you ever seen such fragrant mud?

653
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,520
Go back to Cui Lixin's mud.

654
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
We broke up.

655
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
What?

656
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,520
No way.

657
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,520
I witnessed him proposing a few days ago.

658
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,960
You agreed too.

659
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,520
We broke up that day.

660
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,280
I don't know what he's thinking.

661
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,400
We've only been together for three months.

662
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,680
Why would he think
that we're ready to get married?

663
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:05,920
Tell me. Why do so many women like
the way he proposed?

664
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
Did he respect me?

665
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,600
It's our relationship,

666
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,320
but there was a crowd of strangers.

667
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,000
Why should I play along?

668
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,240
Did he give me the right to refuse?

669
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,120
Zou Cheng proposed to me
in the Meili Snow Mountains.

670
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
Back then,

671
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,240
everyone in the hotel was involved.

672
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,720
I was very happy.

673
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,880
Fine.

674
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,320
Maybe I'm the problem.

675
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,840
I must be an unusual woman.

676
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,200
Shen Ruoxin.

677
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,360
I really think
that Cui Lixin is a good person.

678
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,400
He's at least a B-class man.

679
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,600
Fine.

680
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,360
A "C+" at least.

681
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,280
"C+" is okay, right?

682
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,480
Yes, he's not a local.

683
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,400
For an outlander to come to Shanghai

684
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,000
and to make a living here,
that's not easy.

685
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,760
But the most important thing is that

686
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,920
in the three months you're together,

687
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,240
Cui Lixin cares a lot about you.

688
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,760
He has been nice to you

689
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,520
and he treated you like a queen.

690
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,720
Even your mom had no problem with him.

691
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,400
Why don't you accept him?

692
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,640
It's not that.

693
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,760
I'm not really looking for an A-class guy.

694
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,280
But being together with him,

695
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,680
it didn't feel like I was in love.

696
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,800
All that he has done for me

697
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,000
was like a burden.

698
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,560
Let me give you an example.

699
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,240
When he buys breakfast,

700
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,160
he may call ten times just for that.

701
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm tired enough every day.

702
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,200
After a long day in high heels,

703
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,320
I can finally lie down on my bed.

704
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,560
I want to clear my head and use my phone.

705
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,920
But he would call me,

706
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,440
saying that we should go to a movie.

707
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,000
I really…

708
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,480
I just wanted to lie down quietly
on my own.

709
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,200
I didn't want
to go on more dates that week.

710
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
He wants an ocean,

711
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,240
but I can only give him a cup of water.

712
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
There's a gap
between expectation and reality.

713
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,160
You're so mean.

714
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,160
You're dating.

715
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,760
Lovers want to be together 24 hours a day.

716
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,160
But look at you.

717
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,720
Does he need to give a heads up

718
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,400
and get approval to date?

719
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,440
But he can't just show up at my door

720
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,840
and give me a shock, can he?

721
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Shen Ruoxin.

722
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,960
I grew up with you.

723
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
You've always been that perfect girl

724
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,200
that my mom would compare me with.

725
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,360
But I think

726
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
in terms of love and marriage,

727
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,240
I have the right to advise you.

728
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,640
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

729
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,880
Here we go.

730
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,320
You're 33 years old.

731
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,840
You are pretty and smart.

732
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,120
But why do you have so few suitors?

733
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,080
That's right. Why?

734
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,000
That's because

735
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,680
you never show any sign of
wanting a relationship.

736
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,960
Or should I say

737
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,560
you never show any sign of wanting love?

738
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,280
You're always so calm, rational,

739
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,240
and self-reliant.

740
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,160
Men don't want to come near you.

741
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,440
Do you understand?

742
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,160
Do you really want to be in love?

743
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,560
Do you know what love is like?

744
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,920
Thank you.

745
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,280
Do you like this book too?

746
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,840
I just want to check it.

747
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,680
Do you like it too?

748
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,880
I've read it before.

749
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,840
<i>Love means</i>

750
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,600
that he's all you can think of.

751
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,480
You'll be so brave

752
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,040
that you might do something

753
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,480
that you wouldn't normally do.

754
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,440
<i>But sometimes, you may get cold feet,</i>

755
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,360
<i>start to think too much,
and be afraid to lose everything.</i>

756
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Love is just

757
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,360
like moonlight,

758
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,400
a floral scent,

759
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,720
<i>a dreamy rhythm,</i>

760
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,040
<i>or a reckless journey.</i>

761
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,560
DISCOVER NATURAL CODE

762
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,680
Is that from the advertisement

763
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
for your Adventure Club?

764
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,760
- How did you know?
- Cliché.

765
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,320
It's so clichéd.

766
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,560
That last sentence

767
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,880
is some kind of slogan, isn't it?

768
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,640
I work for a large company.

769
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,800
Do you know
how many commercials I've handled?

770
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
See, this is the problem.

771
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,360
You never commit yourself
to a relationship.

772
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,000
You always stay on the outside.

773
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,160
To observe, to judge, and to calculate.

774
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,160
Why did he do that?

775
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,160
What's his purpose?

776
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,280
How should I respond?

777
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,000
How can I protect my own interests?

778
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,200
Come on.

779
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,680
That isn't love.

780
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,200
Love is an urge to take risks.

781
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,560
A choice that comes from the heart.

782
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,680
