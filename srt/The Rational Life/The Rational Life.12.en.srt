1
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,320
- What's wrong?
- It's strange.

2
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Come here.

3
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
Hello, can I help you?

4
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
Sir.

5
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
Your food…

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
I'm sorry, is it not to your taste?

7
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,080
Why don't I have the kitchen
make you something else?

8
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Did you get a new chef?

9
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Yes, we just got a new chef recently.

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
The chef is still new here

11
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,600
and doesn't know
what the regulars like yet.

12
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
Sir, you've misunderstood.

13
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
I mean to say

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
this is the best chicken lettuce wrap

15
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,680
that I've ever had.

16
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,160
Is that so?

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,720
That's good.

18
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,120
It's delicious.

19
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
It seems different now.

20
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,400
There's an extra flavor to it.

21
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,920
Can you tell what it is?

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,440
I don't know yet.

23
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
Sir?

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Can I see the new chef for a moment?

25
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,200
No problem. Just a second.

26
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
- Thank you.
- No problem.

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,160
Look at this.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes, it seems like…

29
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,560
Okay.

30
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
Hello.

31
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,760
- Hello.
- Hello, sir and ma'am.

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Why did you want to see me?

33
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,560
You're the new chef, right?

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360
I'm only temporarily helping out.

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
The thing is,

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,320
I've been ordering this dish for years.

37
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
But this time, it tasted the best.

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,080
It's as if there is a special flavor.

39
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
I can't put my finger on it.

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,760
Can you tell us what you did?

41
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,080
The thing is,

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,120
this chicken lettuce wrap

43
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,240
is a classic Western dish.

44
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,600
Most chefs follow
the traditional cooking methods.

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
Crisp lettuce combined
with a tender chicken fillet

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,880
is refreshing,

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,040
but I think it's missing

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,920
a lingering aftertaste.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,880
So while cooking the chicken,

50
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,120
I enhanced the flavor
by adding ingredients unique to China

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,680
such as star anise,
cinnamon, and lemongrass.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,040
That is what you taste.

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
See? I told you.

54
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,120
She combined Chinese and Western cuisines

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,800
to create her own unique flavor.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,760
Amazing. You're so awesome.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,040
Thank you.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,840
Sir, where did you find such a good chef?

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,040
You hit the jackpot.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
Thank you.

61
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,920
As a thank you
for being our loyal customers,

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,480
please enjoy this dessert on the house.

63
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,040
- This…
- That's nice.

64
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,480
I designed and improved this myself.

65
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
It's called "Beautiful Mango Pudding."

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,080
After you try it,

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
we would love to hear what you think.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,960
- Okay.
- Thank you.

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
- We'll try it. Thank you.
- Enjoy.

70
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Thank you, sir.

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,800
- Here, try one.
- That's nice.

72
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
What do you think?

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Ziyan.

74
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
Didn't you say

75
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
you want to improve the bar menu?

76
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
I think you can give it a try.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Yes, I think the items

78
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,160
on the bar menu

79
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,680
could use an update.

80
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,080
And it lacks charm.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,280
I told the head chef.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,920
He said he'll discuss it with you first.

83
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
How's this?

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
Just tell Mr. Qin

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,720
that I approved.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Really?

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
That's great.

88
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
I told him

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,200
our theme can be
foods all around the globe.

90
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,000
We'll take well-known classic dishes
from the five continents

91
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,120
and incorporate them
into our current menu.

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,200
It'll give our regulars
a fresh experience.

93
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Sir, please give me some time.

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
I'll make sure I get the job done.

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,920
Go ahead and go for it.

96
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
I believe in you.

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you, sir.

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,640
<i>Come to the bar and be my taste tester.</i>

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>Now?</i>

100
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
<i>I can't.</i>

101
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
<i>I'm busy today.</i>

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,040
<i>Maybe in the evening.</i>

103
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
<i>We're busy at night.</i>

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,720
<i>I won't have time for you.</i>

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
<i>It's okay.</i>

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,600
<i>It's just a tasting.</i>

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>Don't mind me.</i>

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
Your outfit is beautiful today.

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,680
It's perfect for today's event.

110
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,680
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

111
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
At the tea tasting today,

112
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,560
there will be two R&D directors
from technology companies.

113
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,360
I'll introduce you later.

114
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
We might work together in the future.

115
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,800
This is also a test to see
if you've done your homework.

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,360
Okay.

117
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Mr. Xu.

118
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,240
Can I come in for the tea tasting today?

119
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,760
Find a mall nearby later

120
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,760
and park there.

121
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,280
Have some coffee.

122
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
We'll be done soon.

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,800
Ruoxin,

124
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
I just want to gain some experience

125
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,160
so I won't embarrass you in the future.

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,680
This is a rare opportunity
for me to learn from Mr. Xu.

127
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
I promise to behave.

128
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Sure.

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
It's okay.

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
It's good to be curious.

131
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,840
Watch and observe.

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,680
It'll help you in the future.

133
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,520
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

134
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,520
GUANGFULIN, DARK FERRY

135
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,880
Mr. Xu.

136
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,280
- Hello, Michelle.
- Hello.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
- You're still so pretty.
- Thank you.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,760
Hello, ladies. I'm Xu Minjie.

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

140
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
- Hello, Mr. Xu.
- I'm Xu Minjie.

141
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
Let me introduce you.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,440
This is our company's amazing Shen Ruoxin.

143
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,720
- Hello.
- He is Qi Xiao.

144
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,320
- Hello.
- Ms. Shen.

145
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,720
Your outfit is really elegant.

146
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Isn't that the Spanish brand Pronovias?

147
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,560
It looks like quality fabric.

148
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,080
I don't think so.

149
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
With such a droopy hem,

150
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,360
I think it's the French brand Cymbeline.

151
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't think Cymbeline could
design something like this.

152
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
Let's ask Ms. Shen.

153
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,920
Which brand is it?

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,080
It was handmade by a designer.

155
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,440
It's not a major brand name.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,360
So it's custom-made.

157
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,000
No wonder Mr. Xu
strongly recommended Ms. Shen.

158
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,480
You have great taste.

159
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,320
This outfit must be expensive.

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,560
Michelle.

161
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll let you all talk. Excuse us.

162
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

163
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
I'll leave you to it.

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
- Mr. Xu.
- Mr. Wang and Mr. Li.

165
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,880
- It's been a while.
- Mr. Xu.

166
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,560
This is Ms. Shen
from our New Energy Department.

168
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,360
In our department,

169
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
- Ms. Shen is in charge of
- Hello.

170
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,280
liaising with other departments.

171
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,840
It's not an easy job.

172
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,760
Ms. Shen does an amazing job.

173
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,160
I brought her today
so you can get to know her.

174
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Any collaborations in the future

175
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
can be made smoother
with Ms. Shen as a liaison.

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
Ruoxin.

177
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Mr. Wang and Mr. Li are
the best in technology R&D

178
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,720
in this industry.

179
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,120
Mr. Xu.

180
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,840
Are all your salespeople this pretty?

181
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,040
Thank you for your kind words.

182
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
New energy is our company's future.

183
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,480
Our current vehicles
require specialized charging stations,

184
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
but we're continuing to develop

185
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,360
the F3DM solar cell,

186
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
a dual-mode charger for home use.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,920
You two are elites.

188
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
I hope we'll get
a chance to work together.

189
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,040
- Sure.
- Very well.

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,680
Our company's skills speak for themselves.

191
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,800
The art of tea is
about harmony with nature.

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,960
It is the highest level of tea tasting.

193
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,360
For this tea tasting,

194
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,160
we will be sampling

195
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,920
oolong tea from Dayuling, Taiwan,

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
cattail tea from Miyi County, Yunnan,

197
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,880
silver-tip green tea from Bangladesh,

198
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,240
Heavenly Lake floral tea from Xinjiang,

199
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,240
and Mansong <i>pu'er</i> tea from Xishuangbanna.

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,440
There are five teacups
in front of each of you.

201
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,840
A porcelain teacup for oolong tea.

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,400
A <i>zisha</i> teacup
with white glaze for black tea.

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,600
A glass teacup for green tea.

204
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,040
A blue and white porcelain teacup
with a lid for floral tea.

205
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,200
A Jianshui clay teacup for <i>pu'er</i> tea.

206
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,080
For this tea tasting,

207
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,800
we specially hired
a <i>zisha</i> master ceramicist

208
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,840
to create five famous <i>zisha</i> teapots.

209
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,640
They are the Windblown Sunflower,
Fish Transformed into Dragon,

210
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Raised Jade,
Stone Teapot, and Plum Blossom.

211
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Ruoxin.

212
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
- Five famous teapots
- Why can't we drink it yet?

213
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,280
- for five top-quality teas.
- Isn't this a tea tasting?

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
It's called tea culture.

215
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,800
Be quiet if you don't know.

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,200
Drinking tea doesn't need
to be this complicated.

217
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm dying of thirst.

218
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,640
Just wait.

219
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,400
I think we can drink it soon.

220
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,680
I'm going to drink my fill.

221
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
One cup to taste.

222
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
Two cups for the thirsty fool.

223
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,200
Three cups for the cows and mules.

224
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,320
What do you mean?

225
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,080
- Are you calling me a cow?
- Yes.

226
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,280
Hello. What would you two like to order?

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
One grilled jumbo shrimp, please.

228
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
Honey.

229
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,880
We're trying to conceive.
Don't eat seafood.

230
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
It can be cooling for the uterus.

231
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,200
A glass of Calpis soju, please.

232
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,680
You can't.

233
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,600
You must not drink that alcohol.

234
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,960
It has way too much sugar.

235
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
It can disrupt your glucose metabolism.

236
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,000
What about beef tartare?

237
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,040
That's even worse.

238
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,680
Listen, you are forbidden
from eating raw food.

239
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
It can mess up your digestive system.

240
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,800
I can't eat this or that.

241
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,280
What exactly can I eat?

242
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
- We need some more time.
- Okay.

243
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
Honey, I don't know what you can eat,

244
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,400
but drinks with caffeine and alcohol

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,520
are off-limits.

246
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,240
No pickled foods either.

247
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Those can cause premature birth.

248
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,120
No canned foods either.

249
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Those contain too many preservatives
and artificial coloring.

250
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
It's bad for your health.

251
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
No spinach either.

252
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,640
It affects the absorption
of calcium and zinc.

253
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
No watermelon either.

254
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,680
It's cold in nature too.
It can be cooling for the uterus.

255
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,400
Let's see. What else?

256
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,000
Honey,

257
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,520
did you memorize all of this?

258
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,840
That's right.

259
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,960
I bought some books on pregnancy recently.

260
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
I think

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,960
we need to do everything the books say.

262
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
This is so that

263
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,200
we'll have a healthy and smart baby.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
Let's try our best.

265
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
Honey,

266
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,760
if by some chance

267
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
I get a job,

268
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,680
then I can't have a baby.

269
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,600
We'll see about that.

270
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,760
Do you think I can't?

271
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,040
Ziyan,

272
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,320
you haven't had a job for a long time.

273
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,400
Even if you find a job,

274
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,520
you'll be competing with young kids

275
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,480
for entry-level jobs.

276
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,320
I don't think that's necessary.

277
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,760
Besides, at our age,

278
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,120
starting over is too hard.

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,120
Why are you doing this to yourself?

280
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
Work.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,920
It represents my social worth.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,600
It doesn't discriminate.

283
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,400
That's true.

284
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,920
But if you are willing
to be bossed around,

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,160
then that's not the Song Ziyan I know.

286
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,600
You're replaceable in the workforce.

287
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
But in our family,

288
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,840
you are the lady of the house

289
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,240
and a future mom.

290
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,800
The one and only.

291
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,560
You can't give up on this

292
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,840
for a job in which you could
be replaced at any time.

293
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,520
Now, I would like you all
to smell and taste the tea.

294
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
Ruoxin,

295
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,240
what was that about top-quality, aged,

296
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,160
or whatever tea?

297
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,680
Why is my mom's jasmine tea more fragrant?

298
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,360
Be careful with your cup.

299
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,920
If you break it,

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,800
it'll cost more than three months
of your wages.

301
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,200
Is it that expensive?

302
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,920
It's no different from the ones sold
on the street outside the City God Temple.

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,120
It's true.

304
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,640
I passed by the other day.

305
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
It's 3 for 25 yuan.

306
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,640
Here it comes.

307
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,320
Look carefully.

308
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,640
This is cheese salad
with eggplant and pear,

309
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
lobster balls with black truffle,

310
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
and fruity smoked squab.

311
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,640
Try it. They're still steaming hot.

312
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
It smells so good.

313
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,240
Let me try it.

314
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,160
There's more.

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
It's delicious.

316
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,040
This is called "tea-smoked ribs."

317
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,920
I added floral tea unique to China

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,120
to Western smoked ribs

319
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,880
and smoked them together,

320
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,880
infusing the ribs
with the fragrant aroma of the tea.

321
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,040
What's this?

322
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
Mackerel pike gratin.

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,080
I took saury from Japanese cuisine,

324
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
celery and dried tofu
from Chinese cuisine,

325
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,200
and French-style baked meatballs,
and combined them all.

326
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,640
Try it.

327
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,320
Song Ziyan, you are amazing.

328
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,440
Can you tell me

329
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,240
how you came up with so many dishes?

330
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,200
I was paying attention
when I traveled the world a few years ago.

331
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,720
I collected recipes
of specialty dishes from all over.

332
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,040
It's a pity that Zou Cheng
doesn't care much about food.

333
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,080
I work so hard to cook for him,

334
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,640
but in the end,

335
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,320
he doesn't appreciate it.

336
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,200
You finally have a place
to show off your talent.

337
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,680
Does Zou Cheng know that you got a job?

338
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,680
No.

339
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,160
I didn't tell him.

340
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,800
I don't think he wants me to get a job.

341
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,560
If I tell him that I got a job,

342
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,840
he won't be happy for me.

343
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,480
He might even complain.

344
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Do you know, Ruoxin?

345
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,640
Zou Cheng's enthusiasm
and insistence on having children

346
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,680
are getting ridiculous.

347
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
Then he probably doesn't know

348
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,400
you don't intend to have kids.

349
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,640
To prepare to conceive,

350
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,839
he has quit smoking and drinking.

351
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,240
He runs every day
and takes various supplements.

352
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,079
He forbids me from eating certain foods
and strictly follows the doctor's advice.

353
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,319
Do you know what's worse?

354
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,520
He even bought a lot of parenting books.

355
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,560
Last time, I blurted out

356
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,720
that he didn't make any sacrifices
or prepare for having children.

357
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Now, great.

358
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
He's doing so much.

359
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,720
If I tell him I don't want kids,

360
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,200
we'll definitely fight.

361
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,360
I don't want to fight.

362
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,040
Quarrels are a normal way
of communication.

363
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,320
You two are married.

364
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,560
You need to let him know
how you really feel.

365
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,440
I can't say it.

366
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,520
What do I say?

367
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,160
Should I tell him I've got a job
helping out in a bar

368
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,040
and don't plan on having kids
so I can make a bit of money?

369
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,960
He'll think I'm crazy.

370
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
This isn't about money.

371
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,000
We go through different stages in life.

372
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,240
He feels that you two are
at the stage that is the social standard.

373
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
But you still feel you need
to explore a new direction in life.

374
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,040
Your fundamental differences
aren't about money.

375
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,480
Even the issue of having kids
is just the surface.

376
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,360
See? You said it.

377
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,760
At the root,
we have such deep differences in values.

378
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,040
How can we discuss this?

379
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,760
Can he persuade me? Or can I persuade him?

380
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,680
Forget it.
I'll stall for as long as I can.

381
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,480
Avoiding the issue won't solve it.

382
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,480
Says who?

383
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,080
Maybe if I keep stalling,

384
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,520
the doctor will tell me,

385
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,640
"Song Ziyan,
you can't bear children anymore."

386
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,760
That solves everything.

387
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,800
Song Ziyan,

388
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,480
I never noticed you were so self-assured.

389
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,880
I cooked so much delicious food,

390
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
but it's not keeping your mouth shut.

391
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,720
Coming.

392
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Mom.

393
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,560
Why did you buy so much?

394
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
Don't you know the passcode?

395
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,600
You said I can't just come in unannounced.

396
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,960
It's your private space.

397
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,080
Besides, it's Saturday.

398
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,200
You need to catch up on sleep.

399
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,200
Xinxin.

400
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,760
I came to ask you something.

401
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,880
What are your plans
for your 36th birthday?

402
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,120
Mom, don't just make up a number.

403
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,360
I'm only 34,
still a couple of years away from 36.

404
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
A couple of years?

405
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Life passes you by in the blink of an eye.

406
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,680
I don't want to make you angry today.

407
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll imitate a kitten.

408
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
Dear Xinxin.

409
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,320
For your birthday this year,

410
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,720
I'll come by to make you
a bowl of noodles, okay?

411
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,840
Mom, don't be ridiculous.

412
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,400
It's not a major milestone.
We don't need to celebrate.

413
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
Don't you have a class that day?

414
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,280
And there's so much traffic at night.

415
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,400
It'll be a weekday.

416
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
I might have to work overtime.

417
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,480
- I don't care.
- What?

418
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
You have to work late?

419
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,800
I transferred to a new department.

420
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
New Energy Vehicle Department.

421
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,480
I have a new boss.

422
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,560
I've learned a lot
and I'm managing many new things.

423
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,160
I have to work hard.

424
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,040
I might even get promoted next year.

425
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,280
Promotion.

426
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,280
You'll just get busier.

427
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,720
Take care of yourself.

428
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,560
Is the new boss a man or a woman?

429
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,800
A man.

430
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,080
The young chicken I got you today

431
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,240
was freshly slaughtered.

432
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,840
You can steam it up when you are hungry.

433
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,080
You can make soup with it too.

434
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,000
There's no point in telling you this.

435
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,720
Okay, I'll make it for you.

436
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,160
You won't do it yourself anyway.
How do you survive?

437
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,560
You won't let me stop worrying.

438
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,400
Mom, bamboo shoots are in the cabinet.

439
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,680
Who's calling again?

440
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,680
My boss.

441
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
Mr. Xu.

442
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,920
Yes.

443
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm free.

444
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,440
Okay.

445
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,200
Have you told Qi Xiao?

446
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,040
Okay. See you later.

447
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
You're going out?

448
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes, the boss said
something urgent came up

449
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,600
and wants us there.

450
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,200
What about the chicken soup I'm making?

451
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,400
You can drink some when you are done.

452
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,200
I'll reheat it later.

453
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll get changed.

454
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,600
Ruoxin.

455
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,760
Where is Mr. Xu going today?

456
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
He didn't tell me. Do you know?

457
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,320
He didn't give me specifics.

458
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,880
He just said it's a personal business

459
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,120
and asked me to help.

460
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,600
Personal business?

461
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,280
Why is he always asking for you?

462
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,200
That's nonsense.

463
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,080
How can I say no when he's the boss?

464
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,480
But it seems that

465
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,880
today's personal business
isn't a social event.

466
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,040
At least your clothes aren't
out of character.

467
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,360
What do you mean by that?

468
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,560
What's "in character" for me? Tell me.

469
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
Your character is

470
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,440
bold, genuine, and mature.

471
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,200
Sophisticated, but not jaded.

472
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
The last part is acceptable.

473
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,720
I'll pretend you are sucking up to me.

474
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,480
Who's sucking up?

475
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,720
Am I wrong?

476
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,240
Of course, it's wrong.

477
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,200
Only one thing matters at work.
Just do your job. Remember that.

478
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,320
Okay.

479
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Mr. Xu.

480
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
Good morning, Mr. Xu.

481
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,080
Go to this place.

482
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
IMMACULATE JADE BLUE BAY

483
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
- Okay.
- Good morning.

484
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,240
Good morning.

485
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,960
Mr. Xu, are you looking for a house?

486
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,360
After the new energy car project
is launched,

487
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,800
I might be based in Shanghai.

488
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,120
My current living arrangements

489
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,000
aren't fully to my satisfaction
in a few areas.

490
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,000
Of course,

491
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,960
I'm not saying you did a bad job.

492
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,480
It was no easy feat

493
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,240
for you to find this place.

494
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,760
But it's a rental.

495
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,720
There's nothing like your own house

496
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,600
that is to your satisfaction
in every regard.

497
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,360
So I plan on buying my own house.

498
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,400
Even after the project
settles down in a year or two,

499
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,920
I can keep the house
as an investment and lease it out.

500
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,040
There's one thing
about buying a house though.

501
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,600
You're a local.

502
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,120
You know more about the city than I do.

503
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,200
So I thought

504
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,840
I could use your opinion.

505
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,920
- Do you mind?
- No.

506
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,520
I can even help you negotiate.

507
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,120
Ruoxin.

508
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,800
You haven't driven
our company's new energy car, right?

509
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm still driving our traditional car.

510
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,800
I was going to get a new car,
but I haven't had time.

511
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,080
I've been busy with work.

512
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,840
For better sales
and promotion of our products,

513
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,360
it's important for us
to experience it ourselves.

514
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,000
Next week.

515
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll put in an application.

516
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,400
I'll get you a new energy car
so you can test it out for a while.

517
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
No, it's okay, Mr. Xu.

518
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,880
I've decided to buy it myself.

519
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
And I've looked into it.

520
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,840
We get an employee discount.

521
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,040
I can even trade in my current car
when buying a new one.

522
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,560
Most importantly,

523
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,520
I can get a consumer's experience

524
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,880
of the purchasing process in the store.

525
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,560
I can even go for a test-drive.

526
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,080
This will be helpful for future marketing

527
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,960
and sales purposes.

528
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,720
Since you brought it up,
I'll get it done right away.

529
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,400
Okay, as you wish.

530
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,040
Mr. Xu, hello.

531
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
We spoke before.

532
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,160
- I'm the property consultant, Xiaoyu.
- Hello.

533
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,560
Ms. Shen.

534
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
So you are married?

535
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,880
That's great! So we're all friends.

536
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
Let me introduce the place.

537
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Well…

538
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,160
This property and area

539
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,760
are already part of the city's plans.

540
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
They're going to build a new landmark.

541
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,760
We'll have three new malls here.

542
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,200
Two are being built right now.

543
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,560
Do you have any children?
That's not a problem.

544
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,920
We have everything
from kindergarten to high school.

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,640
The luxury villas nearby are up.

546
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,160
Once you see our pricing,

547
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,560
you'll notice
we're particularly competitive.

548
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,160
Our units have great potential.

549
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,080
Most importantly,
our estate doesn't have small apartments.

550
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,560
All our flats range from 160 m² to 400 m².

551
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,400
Why don't you two have a seat there?

552
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,360
I'll show you some floor plans.

553
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,400
- Thank you.
- All right, Mr. Xu.

554
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,360
Hello? Are you seeing this?

555
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
See what?

556
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,600
Do you know where I am?

557
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
<i>Where?</i>

558
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,600
Mr. Xu brought Ruoxin to view houses.

559
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,080
He said he wants her opinion.

560
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
What do you think he means?

561
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,720
It's no longer just sparks flying.

562
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,440
It's a done deal.

563
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,080
<i>A house in Shanghai?</i>

564
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,200
<i>No woman can resist
that kind of temptation.</i>

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
No way.

566
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,920
Ruoxin isn't like that.

567
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
In this world,

568
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,840
anyone can be tempted
if the price is right.

569
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,480
Qi Xiao, wake up.

570
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,640
A house like this

571
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,240
must cost over 30 million yuan.

572
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,280
<i>It's way out of our league.</i>

573
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,800
<i>The woman who lives in that house</i>

574
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,520
is likewise out of our league.

575
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
Okay, I'm hanging up.

576
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Thank you.

577
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

578
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
Mrs. Xu, let me show you

579
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,160
our four main configurations,

580
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
ranging from 3 to 5 bedrooms.

581
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,360
The layouts are very spacious.

582
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,920
- Xiaoyu--
- We also have penthouses.

583
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I can show you the layout for that.

584
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,480
Xiaoyu.

585
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,080
Your client today is

586
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,080
the tenant I had asked you
to find a place for.

587
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,040
He's my boss.

588
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,240
So we're not…

589
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,160
You're not?

590
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm just here to take a look.

591
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,400
A misunderstanding.

592
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,200
Mr. Xu, please take a look.

593
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,680
We're currently promoting Model A.

594
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,360
It has a full river view.

595
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,600
The master bedroom,
second bedroom, and balcony

596
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,040
have a 180-degree river view.

597
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
We also have Model D.

598
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,320
It's a bit smaller without a balcony.

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,360
What do you think?

600
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,720
What do you think of this place?

601
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,880
Houses near the river can get humid.

602
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,280
And during monsoon season,

603
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,080
clothes don't dry quickly.

604
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,080
They stay wet all day.

605
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,560
And in high humidity,

606
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,960
appliances break down easily.

607
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Most importantly,

608
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,280
the river view from here

609
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,680
is marred by the skyscrapers in Lujiazui.

610
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,840
It's okay if you don't like it.

611
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,080
I also have two Victorian houses
in the city center for you.

612
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,680
Victorian houses are indeed

613
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,040
quite grand.

614
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,440
But the layout

615
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
is rather dated.

616
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,560
Moreover, that'll require
a lot of renovation.

617
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,200
If we want it as good as new,

618
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,880
we'll pretty much have
to raze it and rebuild it, no?

619
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,520
That's quite expensive.

620
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,720
Old houses

621
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,960
are bound to have ants, termites, or rats.

622
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,240
They're quite troublesome to get rid of.

623
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,360
Most importantly, the issue of parking.

624
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,200
Old houses are surrounded by narrow roads
that are inconvenient for driving.

625
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,840
That makes sense.

626
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,040
No, an old house would still be nice.

627
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,960
- Yes.
- It's nice.

628
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,760
- Xiaoyu. It's Xiaoyu, right?
- Yes.

629
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,720
I'll take these floor plans
and look at them later.

630
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,520
In the meantime,
find more quality listings.

631
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,080
The price is negotiable.

632
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,920
The most important thing is

633
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,840
that they're free of all the flaws

634
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,040
that Ms. Shen just mentioned.

635
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,160
Okay.

636
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,240
Take your time looking.

637
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,280
I'll call my colleague.

638
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,680
- Okay.
- Thank you.

639
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,000
- Sure.
- Thank you, Xiaoyu.

640
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,240
Don't mention it.

641
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,880
You rendered the young man speechless.

642
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,040
That's impressive.

643
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,560
I can't believe you have
such a unique perspective on houses.

644
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,480
Mr. Xu,

645
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,960
we need to play
the good cop and bad cop routine.

646
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,320
When we have higher demands,

647
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,760
the agents can't just take us lightly.

648
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,280
Otherwise, they'll try
to give you an average listing.

649
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,120
You want a luxury villa.

650
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,480
Commission from this sale

651
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,240
can last them a whole year.

652
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,040
We definitely need to demand more.

653
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,960
Actually,

654
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,840
in the long run,

655
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
I won't be staying in this house

656
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,400
for too long.

657
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,760
If it were you,

658
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,600
would you choose
a large flat with a river view

659
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,320
or an old house in the city center?

660
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,920
Me?

661
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,280
I can't afford such an expensive house.

662
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,400
You don't have to buy it.

663
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,040
Which would you like to live in?

664
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,760
These expensive villas are
for successful people like you.

665
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,280
I'm just an ordinary office worker.

666
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
I won't be able to afford it
or get used to it.

667
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
I probably can't
even afford the property fee.

668
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,720
I think the small place
I have now is better.

669
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
It's more convenient.

670
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,440
And there are families all around.

671
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,880
It's reassuring.

672
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,120
I feel safer.

673
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,080
Look at that.

674
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,120
SUBMISSION SUCCESSFUL

675
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,440
3D ANIMATOR, APPLY

676
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
ALIPAY: REPAYMENT REMINDER

677
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
Hello?

678
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,840
Yes, I'm Su Yang.

679
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,200
I have a question.

680
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
I submitted my draft a week ago.

681
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,720
When will you pay me the balance?

682
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,560
<i>Our chief editor is still
reviewing your last batch.</i>

683
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,680
<i>We'll pay upon approval.</i>

684
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,000
When will that be?

685
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,640
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

686
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,200
<i>We receive so many manuscripts every day.</i>

687
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,960
<i>He has to check each one.</i>

688
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
You should at least have an estimate.

689
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,440
<i>I can't rush it either.</i>

690
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,280
<i>Our chief editor is swamped.</i>

691
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,440
<i>Please be patient.</i>

692
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,000
Okay, then.

693
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,480
Thank you for your help today.

694
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,080
Goodbye, Mr. Xu.

695
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,920
Did Mr. Xu take you to see
all the villas in Shanghai today?

696
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,760
More or less. I viewed quite a few.

697
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,920
I should have worn flats.

698
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,760
My feet are sore now.

699
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,760
That feels better.

700
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
Ruoxin.

701
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,520
Were you tempted?

702
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,800
What?

703
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,200
The villas.

704
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,360
You viewed so many.
Were you tempted by them?

705
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,600
Please.

706
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,640
What's the point?

707
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,120
Can I afford it?

708
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,400
What if you don't have to pay?

709
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,760
Haven't you heard of this phrase?

710
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
"All the gifts you receive in life

711
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,520
have a secret price tag."

712
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,640
There is no such thing as a free lunch.

713
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,080
However,

714
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,840
following around a successful man
like Mr. Xu is eye-opening.

715
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,120
There were a few places
that were stunning and huge.

716
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,680
When I was sitting inside,
I felt like I was wealthy.

717
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,159
"The remaining 20%

718
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,159
will be paid in three business days."

719
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
Qi Xiao, take a look at this contract.

720
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,480
Leave me alone.

721
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,360
Hello, Sijia?

722
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,719
Are you free?

723
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,280
I don't know if
there's a problem with this contract.

724
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,000
Of course, there is.

725
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,760
You put in the work.
They didn't explicitly reject it.

726
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,400
So they should pay you.

727
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,840
That's true.

728
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
But my classmates said

729
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,960
they often encounter instances
when they don't get paid.

730
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,760
They say it's normal.

731
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Normal?

732
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,520
How is it normal?

733
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,360
Why are you taking the side
of the ones taking advantage of you?

734
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,680
There's a contradiction
in this contract. Look.

735
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
Here.

736
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,920
"When the company receives
a file from the contractor,

737
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,400
after confirmation,

738
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,560
the remaining 20% of the balance

739
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,560
shall be paid within three business days."

740
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,960
What's the problem?

741
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,520
We don't know if they confirmed it.

742
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,080
The problem is

743
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,480
what is defined as "confirmation."

744
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,840
Does this mean

745
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,240
payment after confirmation
of the content quality

746
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,080
or confirmation that the contractor
submitted all manuscripts due?

747
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,000
There is no explicit definition,

748
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,520
so this contract is ambiguous.

749
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,120
Do you understand?

750
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,920
You submitted your work a week ago, right?

751
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,480
If your work requires revision,

752
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,040
they would've already told you.

753
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,240
If they didn't,
then there are no problems.

754
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
So they should pay you
the remaining balance, right?

755
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,160
But like you said, there's ambiguity.

756
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,680
If they refuse to admit it,

757
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,000
there's nothing we can do.

758
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,680
Who says there isn't?

759
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,280
Give me the editor's number.

760
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,760
Come on.

761
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,040
Here.

762
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,480
It's this one.

763
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,160
Hello?

764
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,960
Dragonfruit Comics?

765
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm an attorney at Chengjia Law Office.

766
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
My client, Su Yang,

767
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,720
has decided to take legal action
because of your delayed payment.

768
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,240
I'll send you an attorney's letter.

769
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,960
If you have an attorney
who can liaise with me directly,

770
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,120
that would be best.

771
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,880
Hello?

772
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,160
They hung up!

773
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,880
They hung up on an attorney!

774
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
What's going on? Are they serious?

775
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,800
You have to sue them!

776
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,920
Who is it?

777
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,680
The editor! Answer it.

778
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,200
Answer it! He must want to settle.

779
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,520
What do I say?

780
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Just be firm.

781
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,640
They will either be hit
with a lawsuit or pay you.

782
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,560
Come on.

783
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,480
Lawsuit or get paid. Lawsuit…

784
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,960
Hello, Mr. Shen.

785
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,840
Has my attorney contacted you?

786
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,760
It's stated in the contract.

787
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,320
I submitted my work.

788
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,800
Once you have confirmed,
you should have paid the final payment.

789
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,000
It's been over a week since my submission.

790
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,360
You haven't paid me yet.

791
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,920
When there were issues
with previous manuscripts,

792
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,440
they were resolved then and there.

793
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,480
You have put it off for so long this time.

794
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,720
That's your problem, not mine!

795
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,680
Okay.

796
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,640
I'll wait until tonight.

797
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,080
If I don't receive the payment tonight,

798
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,640
my attorney will get involved.

799
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
Okay.

800
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
Good job!

801
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Here.

802
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Su Yang, don't you live with Qi Xiao?

803
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,600
Why didn't you ask him
to check the contract before signing?

804
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,880
He studied law too.

805
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,960
He's either busy with work

806
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,080
or distracted with something else.

807
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,520
I didn't think it was a big deal.

808
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,880
I didn't know people could be
so complicated.

809
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,040
What's on his mind?

810
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,160
It's nothing.

811
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,200
It's okay.

812
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,480
If you have any questions about contracts,

813
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,800
just ask me.

814
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,640
Thank you.

815
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,680
If you are asked
to sign something, just say,

816
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,040
"I need my lawyer
to go over the terms of the contract."

817
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,680
I guarantee no one
will take advantage of you again.

818
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,720
This is so pretty.

819
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you like this?

820
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,600
It's not for me.
Ruoxin's birthday is in two days.

821
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,880
I haven't decided what to get her yet.

822
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,960
This is so unique.

823
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
I'm sure she'll like it.

824
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,400
In two days?

825
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,680
It can reach 100 km/h in 3.9 seconds.

826
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,160
You can feel the acceleration.

827
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,880
This flagship car is

828
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,440
an ultra-safe and smart new energy car.

829
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,240
Let me tell you it's specifications.

830
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,480
What you are telling me

831
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,080
won't make customers feel
that our vehicles are superior.

832
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,000
And these specifications won't
make people want to buy it.

833
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,280
But the target market of new energy cars

834
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,560
has always been tech-savvy
and progressive young males.

835
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,160
They like hearing this data.

836
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
But we can't just limit ourselves

837
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,760
to a market of young men, right?

838
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,720
That's right.

839
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,680
But even if we want to stand out,

840
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,560
it'll take time
to build our customer base.

841
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,880
See? That customer isn't young.

842
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,880
Hey, kid!

843
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,840
- Don't run around.
- I'm sorry.

844
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,040
It's okay.

845
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
It's okay, little boy.

846
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,720
Is it boring to look at cars
with your parents?

847
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,520
I happen to have chocolate here.

848
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,640
- Do you want one?
- Okay.

849
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,200
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you, ma'am.

850
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,440
You're welcome.

851
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,920
Who said my parents brought me here?

852
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,480
I brought them here to see the cars.

853
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,760
You're amazing.

854
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,800
Let me ask you then.

855
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,160
Why do you like this model?

856
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,560
Because the teacher said

857
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,560
electric vehicles protect the environment.

858
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,400
The earth is getting warmer.

859
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,400
You're so smart, kid.

860
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,080
I really need to learn from you.

861
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,320
You're amazing.

862
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,960
- Go play.
- Come on.

863
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,080
What's wrong?

864
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,040
In a better mood now?

865
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,040
I wasn't in a bad mood.

866
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,360
So was the sulky guy earlier a ghost?

867
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,880
It wasn't me.

868
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
I have a secret. Do you want to know it?

869
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,800
What secret would you have?

870
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,040
The day after tomorrow.

871
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,840
It's Ruoxin's birthday.

872
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,880
I know.

873
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,960
Wait. How do you know?

874
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,280
You Sijia told me.

875
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Nice.

876
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,640
Things are progressing quite quickly.

877
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,320
What do you mean?

878
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,280
I asked her for some help.

879
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,480
Good.

880
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,800
In relationships,

881
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,600
it's all about helping each other out.

882
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,280
And in the process,

883
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,480
it just happens.

884
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,760
What? I don't even want
to think about it right now.

885
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,400
Qi Xiao.

886
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,720
What I said earlier wasn't for you.

887
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,400
It was for myself.

888
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,160
I'm not like you.

889
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,280
You're a local.

890
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,720
You have a house.

891
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,920
You have millions of assets too.

892
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
I'm just a part-timer from out of town.

893
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,200
No.

894
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,120
I want to work, but nobody's interested.

895
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,960
Shanghai is huge and beautiful.

896
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,320
The Bund, Lujiazui,

897
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,520
cars, houses, and dreams.

898
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,080
But what does that have to do with me?

899
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,920
Don't think like that.

900
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,840
Ruoxin said one thing today

901
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,640
that I agree with.

902
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,640
She said,
"All the gifts you receive in life

903
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,600
have a secret price tag."

904
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,920
So the struggles
that fate gives us right now

905
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,600
are paying for a future reward.

906
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,240
As long as we persevere,

907
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,360
our time will come.

908
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,400
Why does it sound like

909
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,520
you are obsessed with Ruoxin?

910
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,720
Right.

911
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,160
If we're friends,

912
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,760
you and You Sijia had better
help me out the day after tomorrow.

913
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,640
Who was it that ignored me earlier?

914
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,280
Our friendship has capsized.

915
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,880
Leave me alone.

916
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,800
Don't act this way, Su Yang.
We're friends, aren't we?

917
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,320
- Helping me will help you.
- I won't.

918
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,560
Helping me will help you.

919
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,800
Please, I'm begging you.

920
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,440
Helping me will help you.

921
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,680
Can we talk about this?

922
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,040
A good person can live in peace.

923
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,240
A good person can get a job.

924
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Okay?

925
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,640
I'll do your laundry for a week.

926
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,880
Two weeks. No more than that.

927
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,360
Deal.

928
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,600
Socks included.

929
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,680
Fine.

930
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,520
