1
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,000
Here, slowly.

2
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,480
Ms. Shen, I can tell
that you were from the Legal Department.

3
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,360
You're so meticulous.

4
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,240
You're so attentive to detail

5
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,440
even when putting up a display.

6
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,920
It has been nearly 20 minutes, right?

7
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Mr. Huang.

8
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,240
This is such a large display.

9
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
It would be more secure
to hold it up with something like nails.

10
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,160
Otherwise, it could easily fall.

11
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,960
But our PR colleagues said

12
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,360
it would be best to glue it.

13
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,800
That's why I'm quite conflicted now.

14
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,440
Ms. Shen, do you know

15
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
how much I paid for this display?

16
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,800
Designers are expensive too.

17
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,440
I spent so much money on this design.

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
If it has nails all over it,

19
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,360
what would that look like?

20
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,280
Besides,

21
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
in similar events in the past,

22
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
our team always used glue.

23
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,520
So I hope you try your best

24
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,920
to follow the convention.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
- Okay? Follow the convention.
- Okay.

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,240
- Mr. Huang.
- Amanda.

27
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
What's left to do?

28
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,720
Everything's pretty much done,
except for this.

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I see.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,880
Ms. Shen, after you're done
with the display,

31
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,040
do you mind finishing up?

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,200
My team has already been busy for a week.

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
Help us out, will you?

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,040
We've also--

35
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,400
Everyone, put down what you're doing.

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
I have an announcement.

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,600
You've all worked hard the past few days.

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,120
Mr. Liu is treating us to dinner.

39
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
- It's to cheer everyone on.
- That's great!

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
We have to keep fighting tomorrow.

41
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Other departments are already there.

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
We're the only ones left.

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,440
Everyone, wrap it up!

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,160
Ms. Shen, thanks for your hard work.

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,960
- Mr. Liu is treating us.
- Let's go.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,960
It'll definitely be a fancy restaurant.

47
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,960
That's for sure.

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
Our days of hard work are paying off!

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm starving.

50
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,680
There's so much to do.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,160
It looks like an all-nighter.

52
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Let's continue. Come on.

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,320
Coming.

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,400
- Ziyan.
- Aunt, it's me.

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,960
Is my brother not home?

56
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,680
He's working overtime. He'll be back late.
Do you want to come in?

57
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,080
It's okay. I have a flight to catch.

58
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,040
Xiaoxin's dad is out of town for an event.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,920
The housekeeper took time off

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
and I have a business trip.

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Can you take care of him for a few days?

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,560
By the way, this contains
Xiaoxin's clothing and toys.

63
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920
How many days?

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Two or three days.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm not sure exactly how long.

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,960
By the way,
Xiaoxin has a morning class tomorrow.

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,640
I'll message you the time and address.

68
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,160
Where are Mom and Dad?

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Don't get me started.

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,440
Dad has high blood pressure.

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,600
Mom told him to rest at home for two days.

72
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
She said you don't have to work anyway,

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,880
so I could have you
look after Xiaoxin for a few days.

74
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
Xiaoxin likes you,

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,320
so I can trust you with him.

76
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
Hold on.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,560
Hello.

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,760
I have the electronic boarding pass.

79
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
See you at the security checkpoint. Okay.

80
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,760
Ziyan, I'm sorry.

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
I have to get going.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm counting on you.

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,840
Xiaoxin, listen to your aunt, okay?
Be good.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,280
- Hey, you--
- Thank you, Ziyan.

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,720
Aunt, I'm sleeping with you tonight.

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
Isn't this a surprise?

87
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Hang in there.

88
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,160
INSPIRATION DRIVES INNOVATION

89
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,080
It fell.

90
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,280
Here.

91
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,280
Eat before you sleep.
Boost your blood sugar.

92
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Thank you.

93
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,400
It's hard to be my assistant, right?

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,920
It's tiring.

95
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,840
But it doesn't matter.

96
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,440
What matters is that I can learn.
I'm happy.

97
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
It's life-saving chocolate.

98
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,280
My earring fell off.

99
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,120
Stay still. I'll find it.

100
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,120
It's okay.

102
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,640
Found it. Here.

103
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,520
Thank you.

104
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,080
It's broken.

105
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,000
It's no longer a matching pair.

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,560
That's an easy fix. Give it to me.

107
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,400
Hold the light for me.

108
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,120
I can't believe

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,080
you're also good with your hands.

110
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,160
Remember your online shop partner?

111
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,800
You can sue her.

112
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,600
I can always earn more money.

113
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,280
What I can't stand
is the people I care about

114
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,120
leaving me one by one in the end.

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,560
Su Yang too.

116
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,560
His family gave him only a year's rent.

117
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,560
He said if he can't find a job,

118
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,560
he'll have to take the civil service exam.

119
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,720
He thinks he won't be able
to stay in Shanghai for long.

120
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,640
When he fails an interview,
I get more frustrated than he does.

121
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,360
I was wondering
why you don't live at home.

122
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
You live with Su Yang
to help him out with rent.

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,480
Then that will buy him more time.

124
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,720
Ever since I was young, aside from my mom,

125
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,880
the people I care about

126
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,080
always made me feel insecure.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,640
They all act as if they're passing by.

128
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,040
They come and go.

129
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,760
No matter how nice I am to them,

130
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,960
I can't change my destiny.

131
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,760
It's fixed.

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

133
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
Have you ever played with sand?

134
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,680
You use your hand.

135
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,360
You hold a handful of sand.

136
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
The tighter you hold on,

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,680
the faster the sand flows out.

138
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,240
If you just let it be,

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
things turn out better.

140
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Maybe.

141
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,160
I think

142
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
you should take the bar exam.

143
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,200
I don't want to be a lawyer.

144
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,640
Listen to me.

145
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
If you want to work as a legal counsel,

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,320
having experience at a law firm

147
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,360
makes a difference.

148
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,760
I don't want to be a legal counsel.

149
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
What do you want to be then?

150
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,320
Forever an assistant?

151
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,240
I just want to save up.

152
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,600
Then I'll set up my online shop.

153
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,640
I would still like to do jewelry design.

154
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,160
I like doing it.

155
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,680
I'm good at it too.

156
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,000
Is everyone in Generation Z
so irresponsible

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
with career planning?

158
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,480
It's not like you studied jewelry design.

159
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,680
The online shop is just a temporary hobby.

160
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,240
What about five years from now?

161
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,680
What will you do in ten years?

162
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,360
Ruoxin, how much a year do you make?

163
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,880
That's personal.

164
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
I won't tell you.

165
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I know how much I will make.

166
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,960
With permanent employment,

167
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,000
my starting salary
will be about 10,000 yuan.

168
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,320
After deductions and such,
I take home less than 10,000 yuan.

169
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,320
You've been working
for seven years, right?

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,800
You wanted to be promoted
to Legal Director, right?

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,560
I know that in companies like this,

172
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,000
a Legal Director's salary
is around 500,000 yuan a year.

173
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,320
Guess how much I made
per month in my online shop.

174
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
An online shop?

175
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,560
About 3,000 yuan a month?

176
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,240
8,000 yuan.

177
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,520
That's a lot.

178
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Yes.

179
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,360
Listen, I made a bracelet

180
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
that was a hot seller.

181
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,920
It's a silver bangle,

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,080
and all the beads on it

183
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,680
were hand-painted and molded by me.

184
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,240
They're all customizable.

185
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,440
For four years in college…

186
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
our press conference will now begin.

187
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,920
Please welcome Xu Minjie,

188
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,280
the new general manager
of our New Energy Department,

189
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,400
to the stage.

190
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
We all know that

191
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,480
Zenpro is a high-technology enterprise

192
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
dedicated to using technology

193
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
to satisfy people's aspirations

194
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,680
for a better life.

195
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,640
Ever since Mr. Xu joined the company,

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,120
he has continuously succeeded
at our headquarters.

197
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
For five years in a row,

198
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,640
he won the Automotive Marketer
of the Year Award.

199
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
With Mr. Xu joining
the new energy car project,

200
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,920
will the development of new energy cars

201
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,840
be a trendsetter in the Chinese market?

202
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Let's welcome Mr. Xu.

203
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,640
Hello, everyone.

204
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,720
Welcome to Zenpro Automotive's

205
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,040
new energy car press conference.

206
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm Xu Minjie.

207
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,880
We've never given up our philosophy
of using technological innovation

208
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,480
to achieve
safe and pleasant green commuting.

209
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,400
That's why we took the lead in mastering

210
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,800
core power technologies,

211
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,240
pioneered futuristic technologies
such as cloud services and the like,

212
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,760
and are striving to become
a leader in the industry.

213
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,960
Yes.

214
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,640
This time,

215
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Zenpro Automotive is a key player

216
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,400
in the category of new energy cars,

217
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,360
we are unveiling
a formidable flagship model.

218
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,360
Hey.

219
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,800
- Magic stabilizers.
- It's what customers need

220
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,280
after we analyzed the market segmentation.

221
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,400
This flagship model includes
an onboard system,

222
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,440
an all-new smart driving
assistance system…

223
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,920
Hello, Ziyan?

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,080
Ruoxin, come and save me.

225
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,080
What's wrong? What happened?

226
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,000
A little rascal arrived at my doorstep.

227
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,600
He's driving me crazy!

228
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,920
Talk louder.

229
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
It's so noisy here. I can't hear you.

230
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,480
I said--

231
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,200
<i>I'm busy with an event right now.</i>

232
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,520
I'll call you back when I'm done, okay?

233
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,960
- We only have one aim.
- I'm hanging up.

234
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,360
It will fully reflect your happiness
when driving.

235
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,360
Airplane!

236
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,720
Now let us all witness

237
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,080
Zenpro Automotive's flagship model

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,240
in the new energy car category.

239
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,160
Mr. Liu.

240
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,600
Xu Minjie was well-prepared.

241
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,360
He must want a foothold
in the East China region.

242
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,280
The East China region has flat terrain
and no severe weather.

243
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,880
Consumers here are the wealthiest

244
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,440
and open to trying new things.

245
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,320
If Xu Minjie's new energy car

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,840
fails to take off
in the East China region,

247
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,760
he'll have a hard time explaining

248
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,319
to the chairman.

249
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,599
- Mr. Xu.
- A huge success.

250
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,240
- Mr. Liu.
- Thank you.

251
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,680
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

252
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,160
It has been hard on you.

253
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,319
You came straight to the press conference
as soon as you landed.

254
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,240
Not at all.

255
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,640
It's all for the company.

256
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,320
New energy cars are the future.

257
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
Work still needs to be done

258
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
to change and guide consumption habits.

259
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Don't worry.
The first step is always the hardest.

260
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
No matter the car,
its core is still technology.

261
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,720
The technological development
of new energy cars

262
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,720
will indeed take time.

263
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,480
But I believe that with Mr. Xu on board,

264
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,960
sales of our new energy car

265
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
will be booming all the way.

266
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,840
Mr. Liu,

267
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,120
everything starts out
unknown to the world.

268
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,520
But in the end,
everything fades into obscurity.

269
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
So you and I

270
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,720
face different challenges
and hardships, right?

271
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,280
That's true.

272
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,360
We're all under pressure.

273
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,400
We're all under pressure.

274
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,600
What is it?

275
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

276
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,960
Your apartment hasn't been arranged yet.

277
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Please stay at a hotel for a few days.

278
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,840
Here's your keycard.

279
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
Mr. Liu.

280
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,320
Is this the efficiency
of the East China region's administration?

281
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,240
I remember I emailed them my requests

282
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,600
two weeks ago.

283
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,600
What happened?

284
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,360
I arrived today,
but my living arrangements aren't ready?

285
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,440
This is unacceptable.

286
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,720
Mr. Xu came all the way to Shanghai
to direct us.

287
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
Is this how you do things?

288
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,160
Mr. Xu, don't worry.

289
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,800
At this week's executive meeting,

290
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll be sure to critique
the Administration Department.

291
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,920
It's okay, Mr. Liu.

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
My New Energy Department

293
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,560
was just established.

294
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,600
For the time being,

295
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,080
I'll inevitably have to borrow
some of your staff.

296
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,760
This is great.

297
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
I'll be working with them directly
from now on.

298
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,600
I'll tell them the way I do things.

299
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,160
- Which floor is Administration?
- The 26th floor.

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,760
When my secretary transmitted the mail,

301
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,280
I saw that Ms. Li
is the administrative director, right?

302
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,840
Yes, Ms. Li.

303
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,880
Thank you.

304
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,760
"The way I do things."

305
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,440
Ruan Ye,

306
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
what is Xu Minjie's way of doing things?

307
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,760
Mr. Liu,

308
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
Xu Minjie's temper is flaring.

309
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,240
Will Ms. Li be burnt first?

310
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,400
Ms. Li?

311
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,560
Her?

312
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,240
She can handle herself.

313
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
I spoke to you

314
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,240
about the lease agreement three days ago.

315
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,400
Your refusal to amend
the unreasonable terms in the contract

316
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,320
has already caused losses for us.

317
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,640
If you don't amend it now,

318
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,560
I'll have to switch to another agency.

319
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,120
Please don't do that.

320
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
How do you want to amend it?

321
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You'll amend it?

322
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,440
I'll read it now. Write it down.

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,640
Number one.

324
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,800
"If the lessor's failure to conduct
timely maintenance of the premises

325
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,080
results in a destructive accident
to the premises

326
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,240
that causes
property damage or bodily injury

327
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,680
to the lessee,

328
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,520
the lessor shall be liable
to pay compensation." Okay?

329
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,120
Number two. Listen up.

330
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,960
"During the lease term,

331
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,360
should the premises be gifted,
inherited, sold, or transferred,

332
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,680
this lease agreement
continues to be valid.

333
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,240
We can continue renting."

334
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,240
Okay?

335
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,640
Okay.

336
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,040
<i>Here's number three. Listen carefully.</i>

337
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,440
"If the lessor needs to repossess
the premises before the lease term ends,

338
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,240
the lessor must first seek permission

339
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,520
or be liable for any losses
incurred by the lessee."

340
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,920
Is that okay?

341
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
<i>Okay.</i>

342
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,480
Number four.

343
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,680
"During the lease term,

344
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,920
the lessor may not unilaterally
and arbitrarily increase the rent."

345
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
Is that okay?

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,880
Wait.

347
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Ms. Shen, this is honestly--

348
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
Honestly, what?

349
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,920
These are from
<i>Administrative Measures for House Leasing</i>

350
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,040
issued in 2010 by the Supreme Court.

351
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,280
Refusal to implement this

352
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,720
would be a serious violation of the law.

353
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,920
I can report you to the government.

354
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
Ms. Shen.

355
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,160
Please, Ms. Shen.

356
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,920
I'll change it as you wish, okay?

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,920
In two hours,

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
I want to see the revised contract.

359
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,120
That's all.

360
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Ms. Shen.

361
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,280
Leftover gifts from the launch are here.

362
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,280
Please check them.

363
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,880
- Is it in your department?
- Yes.

364
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,880
- Come on.
- Okay.

365
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,720
Hello, Mr. Xu.

366
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,760
Hello, Mr. Xu.

367
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,920
Mr. Xu.

368
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,760
What?

369
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

370
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
This is unacceptable.

371
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
Hold on.

372
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,680
Where's Shen Ruoxin?

373
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
She's not at her desk.

374
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
Call her to my office.

375
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,000
- Okay.
- Go now!

376
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,560
What's wrong with Mr. Xu?

377
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,000
He's already being hostile.

378
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,120
I wonder who the unlucky one is.

379
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,120
I heard Xiaotian
just gave him a hotel room key

380
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,960
and told him his rental wasn't ready.

381
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,960
He was furious.

382
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,120
Wasn't Ms. Shen in charge of that?

383
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,000
Ms. Li sure was cruel.

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Shen Ruoxin is already
on the new supervisor's bad side.

385
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Ruoxin!

386
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,440
You're in big trouble.

387
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,920
Calm down. What happened?

388
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,880
Xu Minjie came to confront Ms. Li

389
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,000
and asked why his rental isn't ready.

390
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,680
Ms. Li put all the blame on you.

391
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,280
They're looking for you now.

392
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,920
Let me finish.

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
You're doomed this time.

394
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,760
Don't go. It'll just end badly.

395
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,560
Mr. Xu wants to cast blame.

396
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,000
I have to speak up and defend myself.

397
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,280
Qi Xiao, remember this.

398
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
In the workplace,
you can't hide from trouble.

399
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,880
Once you do,

400
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,520
every blame will be pinned on you.

401
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,560
Wait!

402
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Try this year's early-season harvest.

403
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,720
Young leaves, infused in a cup.
Old leaves, steep in a pot.

404
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,560
For young and tender leaves like this,

405
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,720
it would be better if you could
brew the tea in a clear glass

406
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,040
so that I can see
the tea leaves unfurl in the water.

407
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,760
The way that tea leaves churn in water

408
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
is just like life, isn't it?

409
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes.

410
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Come in.

411
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,080
You asked for me, Ms. Li?

412
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,480
Of course I did.

413
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,000
I told you well in advance

414
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,600
to prepare Mr. Xu's rental.

415
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,560
Why is it that Mr. Xu
has to stay at a hotel?

416
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,360
Mr. Xu,

417
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm really sorry about this.

418
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,560
The real estate agent included
some one-sided contract clauses,

419
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,400
so talks did not go smoothly

420
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,800
and delayed your move-in date.

421
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,880
Don't worry.
I will have this handled today.

422
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,160
Don't make excuses.

423
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,120
You used to be in the Legal Department.

424
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
You should've known from the start

425
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,080
such lease agreements
will require negotiation.

426
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Why didn't you make
your request earlier and confirm?

427
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,960
You've done a terrible job.

428
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,560
You're back to zero this month.

429
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
If you don't have

430
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,880
the key to Mr. Xu's rental waiting

431
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
at his hotel's front desk by tonight,

432
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,280
you'll also lose
your bonus for next month.

433
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,680
Mr. Xu, have I handled this
to your satisfaction?

434
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Mr. Xu, it's true
that I could've done better.

435
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
But for this assignment,

436
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
I was given a very tight timeframe.

437
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
What do you mean?

438
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,320
Don't try to search for an excuse.

439
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,520
When did you receive this assignment?

440
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,440
It has been a total of five days
since I received this assignment,

441
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,840
including the weekend.

442
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,640
You said you've already found a place.

443
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,200
Where exactly is it?

444
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,520
Are you sure
every aspect meets my demands?

445
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,840
I'm someone
who always strives for perfection.

446
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,400
Mr. Xu, don't worry about that.

447
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
I searched based on your requirements.

448
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,880
It's in the Wutong neighborhood,

449
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,800
a quiet oasis and easily accessible.

450
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,600
The layout of the house
also meets your demands.

451
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,240
The property and management
belong to Sunny World Group.

452
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,720
They're of good repute
and well-known in the industry.

453
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
The house was newly built in 2017.

454
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,120
If you're still not satisfied,

455
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,080
I'll call the agency right away

456
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,480
and show it to you in person.

457
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
It's okay.

458
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,040
I heard you talking on the phone
in the elevator.

459
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,200
You're very professional

460
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,520
and responsible.

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,520
You've gotten so much done
in just five days.

462
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,800
You're very efficient.

463
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,360
Thank you for your understanding.

464
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,320
I'll complete this task
as soon as possible today.

465
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,880
Ms. Li.

466
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,160
How many years have you been

467
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,400
in your current position?

468
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,400
Me?

469
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,400
I've been an executive director
for four years.

470
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,080
That's a long time.

471
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,320
Ms. Li.

472
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,400
I just arrived in Shanghai.

473
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,360
My way of doing things
may still be unfamiliar to everyone.

474
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,320
It's okay.

475
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,600
We'll be working
with each other a lot from now on.

476
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
I like giving my all when doing something.

477
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
I believe

478
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,720
that's what Mr. Liu asks of you too.

479
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,680
Right?

480
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,120
Of course.

481
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,040
Don't deduct Ms. Shen's bonus.

482
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,560
She prepared so many things
in just five days.

483
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,040
She has done a good job.

484
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,800
By the way, Ms. Shen,
there's one more thing.

485
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I need you to check whether my office

486
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
has a coffee machine.

487
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,720
In general,

488
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
apart from the obligatory tea-tasting,

489
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,040
I only drink coffee.

490
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,080
Okay.

491
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,040
Shen Ruoxin.

492
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,080
You're good.

493
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,760
You used me for your own ends.

494
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,600
Ms. Li, I was just stating the facts.

495
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,520
I wouldn't have had the chance
if I wasn't thrown under the bus first.

496
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,680
If there's nothing else,
I'll get back to work.

497
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,360
Ms. Shen, are you all right?

498
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
I'm fine.

499
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,280
You're not taking
the blame again, are you?

500
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
Do you think anyone
would get a kick out of that?

501
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,960
That's good.

502
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Is he asleep?

503
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,960
Leave it.

504
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,720
It'll be a mess again in the morning.

505
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,240
Luckily, we don't have kids.

506
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,560
Otherwise, I would go crazy every day.

507
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,480
Don't say that.

508
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,400
If Xiaoxin were your child

509
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
and you raised him,

510
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,160
you would love him
instead of finding him annoying.

511
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
Give me a break.

512
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm only confident

513
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,040
because he goes back to your sister

514
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
in a few days.

515
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,920
Otherwise, I would be in despair.

516
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,200
I know this is hard for you, Ziyan.

517
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,880
But don't you think

518
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
that with Xiaoxin here,

519
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,360
our home has become
lively, fun, and full of life?

520
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,000
Fun?

521
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,880
You're right.

522
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,280
You must be having fun.

523
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,240
You just play with him
for a bit after work

524
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,240
like he's a pet.

525
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,200
Of course that's fun.

526
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,480
Did you feed him?

527
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,960
Did you take him to class?

528
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,160
Did you bathe him?
Did you clean up after him?

529
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Did you read to him?
Did you clean after him?

530
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,400
I did everything by myself.

531
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
I feel like a vegetable right now.

532
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,320
I'll be all dried up in a few days.

533
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
This will take a toll on me

534
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
and I'll become a dried vegetable.

535
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,360
When you come home,

536
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,560
do you still see Song Ziyan?

537
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,760
Ziyan.

538
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,280
I know you must be going through
a hard time.

539
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,200
But if we have a child of our own,

540
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,720
when I come home,

541
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,960
I won't just see Song Ziyan,

542
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,480
but the mother of my child.

543
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,120
This woman gives birth to a child for me

544
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,480
and takes care of my home.

545
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,000
In this world, there is a life

546
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,200
that is half of me and half of her.

547
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,680
Then we won't be two separate individuals,

548
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,400
but an indivisible whole.

549
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
That is a normal home.

550
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
Those are the roles

551
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
that a woman and man

552
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,200
should experience.

553
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,400
But I don't want

554
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,800
to experience

555
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,720
a normal woman's life.

556
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,600
Life revolving around children.
Living in a dump.

557
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,040
Unkempt appearance and fitful sleep.

558
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,920
My life will be a mess.

559
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm not young anymore.

560
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,120
I really yearn

561
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,360
for a traditional life

562
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,920
with a wife and kids.

563
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,520
Sometimes, when work
gets really exhausting,

564
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,560
my mind wanders.

565
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
What is the point

566
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,640
in working so hard?

567
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,800
Will your life have meaning
by having a child?

568
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,960
Yes.

569
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,440
When I entertain clients I don't like,

570
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,720
I would tell myself

571
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,480
I need to earn money
to put my kid through school.

572
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,240
When I can't take it anymore,

573
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,720
I'll think of my wife and kids
waiting for me at home.

574
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,720
Ziyan,

575
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,320
for a Chinese man,

576
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,560
family is his everything.

577
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
So without a child,

578
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,040
is this not your family?

579
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,440
Am I not your family?

580
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,120
Where is the Zou Cheng
who once said I was his life?

581
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,360
Where is he?

582
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,480
I know, Ziyan.

583
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,960
You still can't accept it.

584
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,800
But I want to tell you this.

585
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,840
Yes, when we were young,

586
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,640
we wanted excitement and freedom.

587
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,320
But I think I've changed now.

588
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,360
I want warmth.

589
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
I want ties.

590
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
Come in.

591
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
Hello, Mr. Xu.

592
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,200
I'm a lobby attendant.

593
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,480
Ms. Shen asked me to give this to you.

594
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,640
Okay, thank you.

595
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,720
LIVING ROOM, TOILET, DINING ROOM

596
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,200
<i>Mr. Xu,</i>

597
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,720
<i>I'm sorry for the delay.</i>

598
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,120
<i>I've already had your house cleaned.</i>

599
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,080
<i>The mattress and daily necessities</i>

600
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,040
<i>have been purchased as you ordered.</i>

601
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,560
<i>Call me if there's any problem.</i>

602
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
<i>Shen Ruoxin.</i>

603
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,440
Nice handwriting.

604
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,120
Come in.

605
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,239
Mr. Xu.

606
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
What is it?

607
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,199
This confidentiality agreement came from
the Legal Department this morning

608
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
and needs a stamp.

609
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,760
It's the upcoming invitation
for the tender

610
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,360
to seek advertisers
for our new energy cars.

611
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,280
I think there are two clauses

612
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,239
that may lead to ambiguity.

613
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,440
I've marked them.

614
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,600
Please take a look.

615
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,239
What do you think the problem is?

616
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,040
The breach of contract clause

617
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,040
contains the risk
of unascertained damages.

618
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,440
If the other party
breaches confidentiality

619
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,000
and there is a lawsuit,

620
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,520
it will be hard for us
to determine our actual losses

621
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,680
or gather evidence,

622
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,360
and for the court to make a ruling.

623
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,480
In other words,

624
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,160
there isn't enough threat
to the other party.

625
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,080
Very good.

626
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,680
I'll check with the Legal Department.

627
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,720
Mr. Xu, if there's nothing else,

628
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,760
I'll get back to work.

629
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,160
Do you have
any urgent work to take care of?

630
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,080
No, not really.

631
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,920
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

632
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,680
I heard that

633
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,960
you were transferred
from Legal to Administration.

634
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,600
Normally,

635
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,280
such a transfer happens
when the higher-ups want you gone.

636
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
But you haven't left.

637
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,640
I'm curious.

638
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,960
Why didn't you quit?

639
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,880
I read your resume.

640
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,120
I looked into your abilities.

641
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,400
You're quite capable.

642
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,880
If you resign from your position,

643
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,240
it shouldn't be hard to find another job.

644
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
You might even get a better position.

645
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,160
Thank you for the compliments.

646
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,640
If this transfer
were a statement about myself,

647
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,920
I might've already left.

648
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,120
But if it's a statement
about my professional abilities,

649
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,440
then I won't stand for it.

650
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,000
Because I have pride in my profession.

651
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,640
You're an ambitious person.

652
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,840
I wouldn't call myself ambitious.

653
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,560
But I do hope

654
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,640
that my position can
commensurate with my abilities.

655
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,920
Nothing more, nothing less.

656
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,320
How long have you worked for Zenpro?

657
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Seven years.
Straight out of graduate school.

658
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,320
I'm new here.

659
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm not too familiar
with the personnel structure, work style,

660
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,840
and corporate culture
in the East China region.

661
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,760
However,

662
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,000
I need to get up to speed right away.

663
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Since you're a longtime employee,

664
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm wondering if you would like

665
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,640
to be my guide in the company.

666
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Give me some guidance.

667
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,840
Mr. Xu, I'm not qualified to be a guide,

668
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,920
but I can promise
that if you ask me any questions,

669
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,040
I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.

670
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,840
Thank you.

671
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,320
These Ethiopian beans
were imported by air.

672
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Would you like a cup?

673
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
It's all right, Mr. Xu.

674
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
I'll have some water.

675
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
Sparkling or still?

676
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,920
Just still.

677
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,360
Women should drink room temperature water.

678
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,600
Thank you.

679
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,120
Let's start
with the company's personnel structure.

680
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,760
In the East China region,

681
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,400
how many divisions does Liu Pei manage?

682
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,080
Ruoxin, why were you in there for so long?

683
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,680
The Legal Department
is in charge of contracts.

684
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,200
If they make mistakes,

685
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,840
why should you help them?

686
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,760
Are you stupid? I'm getting in with him.

687
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,560
This is to help us get back to Legal.

688
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
I'm not that kind.

689
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Who are you getting in with?

690
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,600
Mr. Xu.

691
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Ruan Ye is a director right now,

692
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,080
but he hasn't measured up yet.

693
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,600
We must return to Legal in glory.

694
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,440
I see.

695
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,960
But Mr. Xu oversees

696
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
the New Energy Department.

697
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,080
It operates parallel
to the East China region.

698
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,840
It's not in the hierarchy.

699
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,720
How can Mr. Xu interfere?

700
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,600
I don't care.

701
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,480
I think I understand now.

702
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,920
A good boss is crucial.

703
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,160
In that case,

704
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,920
I have to choose a powerful one.

705
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,520
Mr. Xu just arrived,

706
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,680
but he has the headquarters' support.

707
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,360
He also manages
our company's up-and-coming business.

708
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,520
Most importantly, he has a clear mind.

709
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,560
He has high standards,
but he's excellent at his job.

710
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,160
I have a feeling.

711
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,880
He'll be a good boss.

712
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,000
Have you gotten in with him yet?

713
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,080
Soon, I think.

714
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,720
He asked me a lot

715
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,640
about the East China region.

716
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,160
While he was talking to me,

717
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,640
I got the feeling that although

718
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,960
he'll transfer some people
from the headquarters,

719
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,320
he'll also select some elites

720
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,160
within the East China region.

721
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Not only do we need him,

722
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,280
but he also needs us.

723
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
Ruoxin.

724
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,160
- Does that mean--
- Quiet.

725
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,040
Does that mean we'll make a comeback?

726
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,160
It's a bumpy road,

727
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,880
but our future is bright.

728
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,120
Let's wait and see.

729
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
Go back.

730
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,160
Come in.

731
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,280
Mr. Xu.

732
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,280
Did you call for me?

733
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,240
Have a seat, Ms. Li.

734
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,880
Please, Mr. Xu.

735
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,280
Let me know what you need.

736
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,920
There is one thing you can do for me.

737
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,840
My New Energy Department was just created.

738
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,880
The team isn't quite ready yet.

739
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,840
The call for advertisement tenders
is coming up.

740
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,280
I hope the Administration Department
can cooperate with me

741
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,920
and transfer some staff to help me out.

742
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,880
No problem.

743
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,360
You have the Administration Department's
full support.

744
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,280
Thank you.

745
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
I need two people for the time being.

746
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,240
Ms. Shen, the one who arranged my rental,

747
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,600
was quite detail-oriented.

748
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,320
I like her work style.

749
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,760
I'll have her.

750
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,120
Ms. Shen can choose the other person.

751
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,600
Is there a problem?

752
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,440
No.

753
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,880
For the second person,

754
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,240
how about Qi Xiao?

755
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,800
He works for Shen Ruoxin.

756
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,000
They work well together.

757
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,840
If Ms. Shen is fine with it.

758
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
That's all.

759
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
I'll be outside.

760
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Thank you, Ms. Li.

761
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
Ms. Li, you wanted to see me?

762
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,680
Mr. Xu is transferring
you and Qi Xiao to help him.

763
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,080
From now on,

764
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,320
you two will work
for the New Energy Department.

765
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,720
Let me remind you of one thing.

766
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,080
It's just temporary.

767
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,880
You're still part of
the Administration Department.

768
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,000
You should know

769
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,440
where you belong.

770
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,960
Don't get ahead of yourself.

771
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,240
Of course.

772
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,480
Ruoxin, what's happening?

773
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,600
Mr. Xu is borrowing the two of us

774
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,840
to help him in the New Energy Department.

775
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,040
That quickly?

776
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,480
It's time for our comeback!

777
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,240
Keep it down.

778
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,240
There are no changes
in the organizational structure.

779
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,560
We're still employees
of the Administration Department.

780
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,760
So that means…

781
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,720
We're doing work for two departments
at the same time.

782
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,920
Will Mr. Xu give you a paycheck too?

783
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,960
Get to work.

784
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,840
Quit dreaming, kid.

785
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,680
Mr. Xu.

786
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,160
Mr. Xu.

787
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,640
- Has Ms. Li told you?
- Yes.

788
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Ruoxin,

789
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,640
before my team arrives in Shanghai,

790
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,440
I will be borrowing your help.

791
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,040
This is the information
on the invitation to tender

792
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,000
for advertisers for our new energy cars.

793
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,520
Get familiar with it quickly.

794
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,480
I need a tender document
as soon as possible.

795
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,920
When can I have the draft?

796
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,680
By two o'clock.

797
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,600
Good.

798
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,440
Nice lipstick color.

799
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,840
Do you have plans after work?

800
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,240
No.

801
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,240
If your draft passes my review

802
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,280
and all goes well,

803
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,640
would you be free after work

804
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,080
to meet a client with me?

805
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,120
Yes.

806
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,880
Hello, Mr. Xu.

807
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,600
I'm Ms. Shen's assistant, Qi Xiao.

808
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,040
- I'll be waiting for your draft.
- Okay.

809
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,840
"Ruoxin."

810
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,920
Does he need to sound so friendly?

811
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,160
Do you know him well?

812
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,040
If he's not friendly,

813
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,440
how can he get himself free labor?

814
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,480
