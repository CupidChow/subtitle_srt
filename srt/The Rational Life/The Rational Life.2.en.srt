1
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Hello, who is this?

2
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
<i>Hello, I'm from Zenpro's HR Department.</i>

3
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,440
<i>I'm Ms. Dong. Are you Mr. Qi Xiao?</i>

4
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
I am.

5
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,240
What is it?

6
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,960
<i>Hello, Mr. Qi.</i>

7
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,520
<i>I couldn't reach you last night.</i>

8
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,040
<i>Interviews for the assistant
of the Legal Department's manager</i>

9
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,240
<i>are at 10:30 a.m. today.</i>

10
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>Are you available?</i>

11
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,480
The assistant of
the Legal Department's manager?

12
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,400
<i>Yes.</i>

13
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
<i>Can you come by for an interview?</i>

14
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,360
Yes, sure.

15
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>The interview notice
has been emailed to you.</i>

16
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

17
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,800
The assistant of
the Legal Department's manager?

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Zenpro Automotive.

19
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
What's happening?

20
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,600
You're welcome.

21
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,440
I applied for you.

22
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
When did you apply for me?

23
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,960
I knew you wouldn't be able
to get the money back from Luoluo.

24
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
So when I applied,

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
I applied for you too.

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,640
Cherish this.

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,280
I've sent in over 200 resumes.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,600
No one has called me for an interview yet.

29
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
You're lucky.

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,920
Thank you.

31
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,240
Hello.

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,040
I have an interview on the 27th floor.

33
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,840
Okay, please register.

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Please wait here for the interview.

35
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
Thank you.

36
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,880
Mr. Wang Xiaojie.

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,320
Ms. Zhang Xiaqi.

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
This way, please.

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,800
Mr. Zhang Shuyu.

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,920
This way, please.

41
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Ms. Lin Haiqing.

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,360
This way, please.

43
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,120
Hello.

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
May I ask when it'll be my turn?

45
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
- Who are you?
- Qi Xiao.

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,560
I'm sorry, your interview was canceled.

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,040
Why?

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm not sure why.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,000
No, you told me to come for an interview.

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,560
I lost my entire morning waiting here.

51
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,280
Now you tell me it's canceled?
What were you doing earlier?

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,240
You owe me an explanation.

53
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
I'm really sorry.

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,600
The interviews are over.

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,240
Sir, you can't go in there.

56
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,240
You can't go in.

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,800
Ms. Shen, should I call security?

58
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,760
It's okay.

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,640
I want an interview.

60
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,840
Have a seat.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Do you know what position you applied for?

62
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,920
The manager's assistant.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,240
I'm the Legal Department's manager
in charge of hiring.

64
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,840
Do you think I'll hire you?

65
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
As the manager of the Legal Department,

66
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
you should be reasonable.

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,600
You are fresh out of college.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,800
You don't have any training experience.

69
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
And you like drinking.

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,880
What makes you think
you're qualified to be my assistant?

71
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,400
I managed various business contracts

72
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,200
for my advisor at school.

73
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,960
Also, last night was just
a distraction for a friend.

74
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,200
I don't like drinking.

75
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,040
Corporate legal affairs

76
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,600
are more than drafting contracts.

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
I can learn.

78
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,680
We pay people to work,

79
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,360
not learn, okay?

80
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,720
The interview is over.

81
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,720
You don't meet my standards.

82
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,160
Ms. Shen!

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,880
Ms. Shen.

84
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
If you have a misconception about me,

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
I can apologize.

86
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
But I really need this job.

87
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,480
What happened before was my fault.

88
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
I admit I'm prejudiced against you.

89
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
But my refusal to hire you

90
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,840
is because you're not qualified.

91
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
I accept your apology.

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,240
But it won't change my mind.

93
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,800
Ms. Shen.

94
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
You started out as a newbie, right?

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,240
Before you had your first job,

96
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
you had no work experience.

97
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,680
Please give me a chance.
I promise I'll do a good job.

98
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
Promises are cheap.

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
What I need is proof.

100
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
If you don't move aside,

101
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
I will really call security.

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
One iced Americano.

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,480
One vanilla mocha.

104
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,400
Hot.

105
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
Qi Xiao?

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,240
You're that cheerleading squid!

107
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,960
No, I'm sorry.

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,320
You…

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,440
You Sijia.

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,360
Do you all call me a squid?

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,080
I forgot who started it.
It's what the basketball team calls you.

113
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,120
Don't mind it.

114
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
It's okay.

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,400
Are you applying for a job?

116
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,840
I don't have a chance.

117
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,040
Do you work here?

118
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
No.

119
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
I started interning here
in my third year of college.

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
It has been two years.

121
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm not even sure if I'll get
a permanent position this year.

122
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,760
It's so hard to get
a job at a big company.

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,720
I hope I can stay here.

124
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
I'll buy you coffee.
I'm on a coffee run anyway.

125
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,520
No, it's on me.

126
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,200
You have a lot of experience.
I could use your advice.

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,200
- Come on.
- Come on.

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Thank you.

129
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,480
Ruoxin is quite strict.

130
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,840
But it's nothing personal.

131
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,159
Don't take it to heart.

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
That's how job searching is.

133
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,960
There's no end to the hurdles.

134
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,080
Even if you get a job,
you might not get a permanent position.

135
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,520
It's too hard to find a job now.

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
You thought ahead

137
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
and started interning so early.

138
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
I didn't think of it that far.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,640
I was shopping

140
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,000
and was just passing by.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,960
I saw so many office workers
going in and out of that building.

142
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,040
They seemed so elegant and classy.

143
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,840
I thought to myself

144
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,520
that it would be great
to work at that office too.

145
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,600
It was purely because of vanity.

146
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
You're quite honest.

147
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,320
Is she the reason
you can't get a permanent position?

148
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,720
No.

149
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,320
Ruoxin might seem unfriendly,

150
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,680
but she's kindhearted.

151
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,680
In the past two years,

152
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,960
she taught me everything
and gave me a chance.

153
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
And she's very professional.

154
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
She's hardworking and has high standards.

155
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,640
I really admire her.

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,280
If she gets promoted to director,

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,480
she would help me
get a permanent position.

158
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,120
But…

159
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,520
Never mind about that.

160
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,240
She's working on a big case right now

161
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
and isn't in a good mood,

162
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,680
so she might come off as a bit harsh.

163
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,280
You just met her at a bad time.

164
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,960
What kind of big case? Spill the details.

165
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,360
Look.

166
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,800
We just drained
the underground pipes last year.

167
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,280
How could water get in here?

168
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Also, look.

169
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,400
This is Mr. Jin's designated spot.

170
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,600
Even if water floods that area,

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
it wouldn't reach here.

172
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,880
Isn't that a security camera?

173
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
Do you have the footage?

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Show me the footage during the storm.

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,920
I don't have the authority.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
You'll have to ask our team leader.

177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Sure. Where is he? Let me talk to him.

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
He's probably eating at this hour.

179
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,560
Look, it's almost one o'clock.
I haven't eaten either.

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
Why don't you wait for our team leader

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,200
in the security room?

182
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,360
I'll grab something to eat.

183
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Then go and eat first.

184
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,480
- I'll go there later, okay?
- All right.

185
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,000
- Thank you.
- No problem.

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Hello.

187
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,880
Is this Mr. Wang
from the Inspection Department?

188
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm the Legal Department's Shen Ruoxin.
I have a question.

189
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,760
Is the report
on Jin Yuanhao's case ready yet?

190
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,920
Here.

191
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,160
Why are you here?

192
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm here to ask for a chance

193
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
to prove that I can be
a good legal assistant.

194
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
Get out of here. Leave, will you?

195
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't scold me just yet.
Worry about yourself first.

196
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,280
You haven't eaten all day, right?

197
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
Wait here. I'll be right back.

198
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Hello?

199
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,760
Ruoxin.

200
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm calling to apologize.

201
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,240
I may have been too harsh yesterday.

202
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,640
<i>Don't take it personally.</i>

203
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
No, I wasn't myself yesterday.

204
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,320
Ruoxin, listen.

205
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,560
If you think it's too soon
for us to get married,

206
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,280
I can wait.

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,080
<i>I'll wait until you're ready.</i>

208
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,880
I think I made myself clear yesterday.

209
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,880
We're just not right for each other.

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,040
Ruoxin, don't be rash.

211
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,840
Why don't we talk in person?

212
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
You're at Pudong Avenue, right?

213
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

214
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,040
How did you know that?

215
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,880
Well, they…

216
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,320
Yes, they said
you were out on Pudong Avenue.

217
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm working. I'm busy.

218
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,920
Let's talk after work, okay?

219
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,800
Whole wheat, red bean paste, and plain.

220
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,080
Take your pick.
I don't know your preference.

221
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,600
What are you doing here?

222
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,040
I'm here to see you.

223
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,080
I know you're busy
with a self-ignition case.

224
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,400
You said
I'm not capable of being your assistant.

225
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,200
I've discovered clues
that will work to your advantage.

226
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,640
If you hire me,

227
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,880
I'll give you the clues.

228
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,640
How much were the bread and milk?
Is 100 yuan enough?

229
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,240
That's not urgent.
Let's talk about the case first.

230
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Here's 100 yuan.

231
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,080
Is that enough?

232
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,200
Here's a parting gift.

233
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,920
Rookie, don't act like a know-it-all
with all sorts of shady tricks.

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
In this profession,
conduct and reputation are vital.

235
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
They stay with you for decades.

236
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,400
Be a good person.

237
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
Fine, I'll just tell you.

238
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,960
I ran into You Sijia after my interview.

239
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,600
We went to the same college.

240
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,880
She told me you're busy with this case.

241
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,240
I looked up Jin Yuanhao's post myself

242
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,600
and found this photo.

243
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Look.

244
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,400
What are you saying?

245
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,400
I had an online shop
that sells original bracelets.

246
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,040
I made this bracelet myself.

247
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,440
I remember the buyer
ordered three bracelets.

248
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,360
One men's and two women's bracelets.

249
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
The materials were from Italy,

250
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,360
so they were not cheap
and there weren't many suppliers.

251
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,560
I also stressed
that they were non-returnable.

252
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,880
The buyer assured me
that he wouldn't back out.

253
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,440
He gave me two addresses,

254
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,640
one in Xuhui and the other in Yangpu.

255
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,760
Are you saying one woman's bracelet
was sent to Yangpu?

256
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
That's right.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
Here is my chat log with him.

258
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,720
He specifically requested

259
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,760
different sizes for the women's bracelets.

260
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,440
That's when we thought
he had to be a player.

261
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,000
Aside from quality issues,

262
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,360
improper operation
can also cause autoignition.

263
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,640
The main reasons
include improper modifications,

264
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,680
major collisions,
storage of highly flammable items,

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
and water damage.

266
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,240
I looked it all up online.

267
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,240
But there was a big storm
in Shanghai two days ago.

268
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,080
Many garages were flooded.

269
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,680
I'm wondering if Jin Yuanhao's car

270
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
was also flooded.

271
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,920
Did You Sijia tell you all this?

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,280
I just guessed.

273
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,640
You Sijia told me
that we had the same idea.

274
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
You also checked Jin Yuanhao's garage

275
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
for flooding.

276
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,840
You're at his company too.

277
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
Looking at you, I guess
the company didn't have that issue.

278
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,440
I think

279
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,320
we have one more place left to go.

280
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,160
Do you want to use the Yangpu address

281
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
to get the assistant position?

282
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,080
That was my plan.

283
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
But now, even if you don't hire me,

284
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,920
I'll still tell you.

285
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Why?

286
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,520
The way you stick to your principles

287
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
is quite cool.

288
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,360
Kid, are you changing your strategy?

289
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,720
You went from coercion to flattery.

290
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,840
You're not playing hard to get, are you?

291
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,800
Why do you have to think the worst of me?

292
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I mean it.

293
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Whether you mean it or not,
give me the address first.

294
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,400
Honey, I want to be discharged.

295
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm fine anyway.

296
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,920
Since I'm not home,

297
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
Yuanyuan probably isn't
doing his homework.

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,880
Here.

299
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,360
You're badly injured.

300
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
Don't worry too much.

301
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,080
Be careful.

302
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,760
Here.

303
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,880
Just focus on getting better.

304
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,520
Mr. and Mrs. Jin, we meet again.

305
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,440
You people are unbelievable.

306
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
We agreed to meet the day after tomorrow.

307
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,160
Ms. Shen, I don't want to talk to you.

308
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll only talk to Mr. Ruan.

309
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,400
Mr. Jin,

310
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,400
we've learned some new information.

311
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,440
I would like to confirm it with you.

312
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Do you think we can speak in private?

313
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
Why do we need to speak in private?

314
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Say it here.

315
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
What is it that you can't say in the open?

316
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Yes, why do you want to speak privately?

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,040
I'm the victim here.

318
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
I'm right here, okay?

319
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
Here, honey.

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,520
Thank you, honey.

321
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,920
Mrs. Jin, what a unique bracelet you have.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,960
How pretty. Is it handmade?

323
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,800
He has good taste.

324
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
We have a pair.

325
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
Matching bracelets?

326
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,480
My husband had this bracelet made for me.

327
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
And he said this is the only pair.

328
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,600
My husband is so sweet.

329
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,200
I have a "cloud" character in my name.

330
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,000
Look at all the little clouds
on the bracelet.

331
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,680
- Thank you, honey.
- That's enough.

332
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,240
Is there really no second pair?

333
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
I think I've seen it before somewhere.

334
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,080
How could you have?

335
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,080
This was specially made for me.

336
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Of course, there's only one pair.

337
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,000
How could they understand?

338
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,360
Honey, how about this?

339
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
They're already here.

340
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,560
I'll just chat with them.

341
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,040
Let's head back inside, okay?

342
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,040
The nurse said
she'll change your dressing.

343
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,760
Okay. It's getting sunny.
I'll head inside.

344
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,880
Mr. and Mrs. Jin, allow me.

345
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,480
Have a good chat with Ms. Shen.

346
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
Mrs. Jin, I just remembered.

347
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,480
I saw your bracelet in an online shop.

348
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,120
But it was already sold.

349
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,320
So your husband bought it.
What a coincidence.

350
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,280
Yes, that must have been my husband.

351
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Ms. Shen,

352
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,280
I made a deal with Mr. Ruan.

353
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,920
Two million yuan in compensation.

354
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
Not one yuan less.

355
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,920
You saw her.

356
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,320
My wife is badly burned.

357
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,280
The scar will last forever.

358
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,760
Put yourself in her shoes.

359
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,560
If this happened to you,

360
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,920
wouldn't you be upset?

361
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,520
My wife and I

362
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,360
are severely traumatized

363
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,800
by this kind of vehicle.

364
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,200
My wife loves to cook.

365
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
Now she fears the sight of fire.

366
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,240
We were planning
to have a second baby this year.

367
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
What's the use in telling you this?

368
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,080
Let's keep it short.

369
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,080
Two million yuan. Not one yuan less.

370
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,560
Mr. Jin, I just came from Yangpu District.

371
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,920
I took some photos to show you.

372
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,560
Wait.

373
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,280
Where did you get that?

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,520
What would you do?
What do you mean by this?

375
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,040
I was just at that complex.

376
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
I spoke to the neighbors
and property managers

377
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
to understand and verify the situation.

378
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,720
On the day of the storm,
that area was flooded.

379
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
What a coincidence.

380
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,840
The property manager clearly remembered

381
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,240
your car was parked
in a corner that was flooded.

382
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
You have made a complaint.

383
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,880
They even helped you push your car out.

384
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,320
I also went to your company's
underground parking lot

385
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,560
to get security footage.

386
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,360
On the day of the storm,
your car wasn't at the company.

387
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,040
Neither your home garage

388
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,600
nor company parking lot was flooded.

389
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,600
I don't think

390
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,120
Mrs. Jin is fully informed
about the truth.

391
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,000
So…

392
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,200
So what?

393
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
So what about it?

394
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,120
Even if a little bit
of water got into my car,

395
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
that can't be proven
as the cause of the fire.

396
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,680
Ms. Shen,

397
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm absolutely furious now.

398
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,720
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

399
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,120
If this is your attitude, then I'm sorry.

400
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,360
Let me tell you.
I'll continue posting online.

401
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm sure victims like us can
stand up to unscrupulous businessmen.

402
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll see you in court!

403
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,680
Mr. Jin, please listen. Calm down.

404
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,840
Let me finish.

405
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,160
You have the right to indict.

406
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,840
Posting is freedom of speech.

407
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,600
But evidence is required to indict it.

408
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,040
Posts should also be truthful.

409
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,280
Otherwise, we will sue you for defamation.

410
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,440
Please also do us the same courtesy

411
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,040
and put yourself in our company's shoes.

412
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,280
If this gets out of hand,

413
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,280
we will want to prove our innocence

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,400
and bring forth all the evidence we have.

415
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,000
Wait.

416
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,040
All the evidence?

417
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,160
Yes.

418
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,360
Of course, that includes these photos.

419
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,960
So settling this as soon as possible

420
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,200
is all in the best interest
of you and my company.

421
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,520
Don't you agree?

422
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
Ms. Shen, how about this?

423
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,640
After all, the two million yuan

424
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,400
isn't coming out of your pocket.

425
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,040
If you give me two million yuan,

426
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,840
I'll make it worth your while.

427
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,800
I understand.

428
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,600
We're all working hard to earn a living.

429
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,000
Would you like 500,000 yuan?

430
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
We should--

431
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,120
Do you want to continue?

432
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,760
Mr. Jin, harmony brings prosperity.

433
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,040
I think this is the best solution for now.

434
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,000
Of course, we honor our word.

435
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,720
Your personal life won't
be included in the contract.

436
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,240
Yes.

437
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,080
Okay.

438
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,240
See you in the afternoon in two days.

439
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,560
Impressive.

440
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
The bracelet is beautiful.

441
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,440
NANPU BRIDGE

442
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,200
Aren't you happy it's settled?

443
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,120
Based on your performance,

444
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
I've decided to give you a chance.

445
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,960
A legal assistant on one-month probation.

446
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,760
We're covering up for Jin Yuanhao.

447
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,960
Isn't that a bit immoral?

448
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,080
His wife doesn't know anything.

449
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,440
She's quite pitiful.

450
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,520
I visited his wife yesterday.

451
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,800
We talked for a long time.

452
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,320
His wife is a full-time housewife.

453
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,280
She has a son
who goes to a private kindergarten.

454
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,640
She even lives in a mansion.

455
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Her son's school tuition,

456
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,960
trips abroad twice a year,

457
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,920
and the mansion's mortgage loan

458
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,080
are all paid for by Jin Yuanhao.

459
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,320
So?

460
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,280
Is that why she shouldn't have

461
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,520
the love and respect that a wife deserves?

462
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
You're getting married soon.

463
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,000
Can you tolerate this treatment?

464
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
I can't.

465
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
That's why I don't plan to get married.

466
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,240
Didn't your boyfriend propose last night?

467
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Did you reject him?

468
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Why should I tell you
about my personal life?

469
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
Anyway, I think what we did was wrong.

470
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,120
Mrs. Jin has the right to know.

471
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,760
How do you know she doesn't know?

472
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,880
Maybe she knew

473
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,840
and just wanted to use this

474
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,520
to make Mr. Jin feel guilty,

475
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,600
thus gaining herself a greater voice

476
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,480
in her marriage.

477
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,400
What kind of logic is that?

478
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm just analyzing the possibilities.

479
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,960
Luckily, I only have to work with you.

480
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,240
It's hard to imagine
how your boyfriend can date you.

481
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
It's downright scary.

482
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
You won't get such a chance, kid.

483
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,200
What a scary older woman.

484
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,560
What did you say?

485
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,080
Watch out for the cars!

486
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,080
I GOT MY DRIVER'S LICENSE,
DO NOT DISTURB

487
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,280
You're back late.

488
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,720
What's up?

489
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,600
Life is full of twists and turns.

490
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,120
You were hungover. Did it go badly?

491
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,040
Standing in front of you

492
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
is Zenpro Automotive Legal Manager's

493
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,760
assistant, Mr. Qi Xiao.

494
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,960
You're good at acting.
Why don't you become an actor?

495
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,400
Keep a low profile.
I'm on probation for a month.

496
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,440
I have good news too.

497
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,400
What?

498
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,560
I found a place.

499
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,960
We can move soon.

500
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,840
Really? Where? How much?

501
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,560
5,000 yuan.

502
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,240
5,000 yuan?

503
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,160
That's over the budget.

504
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,320
Hold on.

505
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
Check out the neighborhood.

506
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,560
What a fancy neighborhood.

507
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
It's such a nice location.

508
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,760
One bedroom must be over 5,000 yuan.

509
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,480
It's actually my friend's house.

510
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,720
They bought it as an investment.

511
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
They used it for storage

512
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,760
and had difficulty renting it out.

513
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,360
It's 5,000 yuan a month.

514
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,840
Is it necessary to rent there?

515
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,800
It's necessary, Qi Xiao.

516
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,560
In a big city like Shanghai,

517
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,280
rent is actually a composite index.

518
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,440
What do you mean?

519
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Look.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,840
If we rent in this neighborhood,

521
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
it's 2,000 yuan over our budget.

522
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
But first,

523
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,480
the location is close to Zenpro.

524
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,200
If you live in the suburbs,

525
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,040
you can't ride your motorcycle.

526
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,920
You'll have to take the subway.

527
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,120
No trains run late at night.
You'll take a taxi.

528
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,280
Every taxi ride
will cost hundreds of yuan.

529
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,080
Say you live here and work overtime.

530
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,440
You can hop onto your motorcycle

531
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
and get home in a couple of minutes.

532
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,600
Second, this is a well-developed area.

533
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,000
We won't be stuck
with expensive and nasty delivery.

534
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,480
That also saves money, right?

535
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,600
If we live in the suburbs,

536
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,760
we'll waste up to four hours commuting.

537
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,040
It will affect our happiness index.

538
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,040
So, overall,

539
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,280
the extra 2,000 yuan will be well-spent.

540
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,920
All right.

541
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,640
Since you've thought it through,

542
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
I'll have to speak with money.

543
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Let's rent it!

544
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
- There's one more thing.
- What now?

545
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,440
Actually, my friend uses one of the rooms

546
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,160
to store merchandise,

547
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,280
so there's only one bedroom available.

548
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,520
Moreover,

549
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,760
we have to pay a year's rent in full.

550
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,960
No wonder it's so cheap.

551
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,320
But we'll make do.

552
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,680
You can take the bedroom.

553
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,800
No, I'll take the living room.

554
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,200
You've never met my boss.

555
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,800
She's a devil.

556
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,360
There will be no shortage of overtime.

557
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't want to disturb you
when I get home late. It's fine.

558
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,520
Thank you.

559
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,360
No need for that.

560
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Tonight, I want beef skewers,

561
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,120
lamb skewers, pork belly…

562
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,360
- Five…
- Okay.

563
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,400
Order everything.

564
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,520
Thank you for the meal, Mr. Su.

565
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,600
When will I land a job too?

566
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,080
Don't panic.

567
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,240
You're a talented cartoonist

568
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,760
and designer.

569
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,680
Someone will recognize your talents.

570
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,200
Trust me.
The cream always rises to the top.

571
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,760
Guess who I met today.

572
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,520
- Who?
- You Sijia.

573
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
The squid in the cheerleading team.

574
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,440
We were at a karaoke bar once.

575
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,160
Did you sneak off with her?

576
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,560
No, I just helped her find her phone.

577
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,400
Are you serious?

578
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,960
I remember she seemed interested in you.

579
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,600
She's in the same office
waiting for a permanent position.

580
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,080
She was a big help in today's interview.

581
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,840
We should get together sometime soon.

582
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,400
Here's your chance

583
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,840
to pick up where you left off.

584
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,080
Pick up what?

585
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,520
I'm in no position
to date anyone right now.

586
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,760
Dating takes time and energy.

587
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,880
More importantly,

588
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,360
it costs money.

589
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,000
I don't have any of that.

590
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,800
What if she is

591
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,800
a smart, cute,

592
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,560
independent, cool,

593
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,600
and mature girl?

594
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,760
I wonder what dating such a girl

595
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,080
would be like.

596
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,440
Are you in heat?

597
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,400
Do you like You Sijia?

598
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,320
Don't worry.

599
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,040
If you do, I'll help you woo her.

600
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
Who says I like her?

601
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Gosh, you must be drunk after one can.

602
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,680
Hello, Mom.

603
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,360
<i>I left food in your fridge.</i>

604
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,600
<i>Have you eaten it?</i>

605
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,600
<i>Don't just microwave it.</i>

606
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,240
<i>Heat it on the stove
to kill off all the bacteria.</i>

607
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,160
Mom, it smelled odd

608
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,160
when I ate it yesterday.

609
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,960
I already threw it away.

610
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,280
Don't make so much food
for me from now on.

611
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
I can't finish it all.

612
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
You shouldn't eat leftovers either.

613
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,480
<i>You threw it away?</i>

614
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,320
<i>You're so wasteful.</i>

615
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,640
<i>I won't cook for you anymore.</i>

616
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,200
I'm hanging up.

617
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,040
<i>I'm not done talking.</i>

618
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
My goodness.

619
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,360
ONE MINUTE OF TIANWEN-1 ORBITING MARS

620
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
<i>Our homeland</i>

621
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,880
<i>actually contains
a much older source of heat.</i>

622
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,280
<i>The story of mankind originated
when the universe was born.</i>

623
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,400
<i>A 13.7 billion-year-old universe</i>

624
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,080
<i>gave birth
to countless planets and galaxies.</i>

625
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,400
<i>Incredible spectacles continue to play out</i>

626
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,040
<i>and every wonder is connected to us.</i>

627
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,000
This is the PR Department.

628
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,920
This is the conference room.
Meetings are held here.

629
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,040
We usually take breaks in the pantry.

630
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,920
Help yourself to drinks and tea.

631
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,800
This is the office area.

632
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,120
I'll show you your desk.

633
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,920
It's right here.

634
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
That's my seat over there.

635
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,360
Ruoxin's seat is inside.

636
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,200
Have a seat.

637
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,000
Thank you.

638
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,160
Qi Xiao,

639
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,080
you and Ruoxin are really amazing.

640
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,120
You two won over Jin Yuanhao in no time.

641
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,560
I'm telling you.

642
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,560
Since Ruoxin settled this case,

643
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,600
she might beat out Ruan Ye
and get promoted to Legal Director.

644
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,520
When that happens, your probation

645
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,240
and my permanent position will be…

646
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,680
My goodness! Watch this video!

647
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
My goodness.

648
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,440
- That's so romantic.
- It's a proposal.

649
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,880
Mr. Cui proposed to Ruoxin!

650
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
That's so romantic!

651
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,320
Qi Xiao, is that you?

652
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,680
- It's me.
- You…

653
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,320
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

654
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,560
Every little detail will be ready

655
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,160
when Jin Yuanhao comes in
to sign the contract tomorrow.

656
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,160
I'll get going.

657
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,720
Isn't this Ms. Shen?

658
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,120
I heard you took care
of Jin Yuanhao's case.

659
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,679
Mr. Ruan, you're so well-informed.

660
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,199
Yes, he's coming in tomorrow
to sign the settlement agreement.

661
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,480
Our company only needs

662
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,719
to pay for his wife's hospital bills.

663
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,480
Ms. Shen, you're amazing.

664
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,199
I have one more thing
to congratulate you on.

665
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,639
This is a double celebration for you.

666
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,880
What do you mean?

667
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,400
Ruoxin!

668
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,080
I want to see the big diamond ring.

669
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,199
What big diamond ring?

670
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,080
This…

671
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,159
Where's the ring?

672
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,000
I saw it in the video.

673
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,280
What video?

674
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,280
Mr. Cui posted a video
of the proposal to the office group chat.

675
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,880
Everyone is congratulating you.

676
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,840
He even sent out a huge red envelope.

677
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,800
But I only got 0.63 yuan.

678
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,760
That's so romantic.

679
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,640
- The flowers are pretty too.
- Thank you.

680
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,040
Good luck.

681
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,320
Ruoxin.

682
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,080
I was too impulsive yesterday.
That's why I'm here to apologize.

683
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,080
In front of all your coworkers today,

684
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,120
I promise you
that if you ever want to get married,

685
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,080
I'll wait until you agree.

686
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,480
I'll wait as long as it takes.

687
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Ruoxin, I love you.

688
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,840
Ruoxin, marry him.

689
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,840
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

690
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,520
Ruoxin, marry him.

691
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,880
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

692
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

693
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,480
- Mr. Liu, this is a place of business.
- Marry him.

694
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,280
- They're doing this so openly.
- Marry him.

695
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,320
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

696
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,720
- Come to my office.
- Marry him.

697
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
- Marry him.
- Marry him.

698
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,840
Excuse me. Thank you.

699
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,680
What's happening?

700
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,080
Let's go.

701
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,480
Cui Lixin, what are you trying to do?

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,840
Ruoxin, I made myself clear just now.

703
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm here to apologize to you.

704
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,000
I know I said
a lot of mean things to you that day.

705
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,520
I hope you don't mind.

706
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,080
And you have to understand
that I did all this

707
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
because I love you.

708
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,280
- You love me?
- Yes.

709
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,760
I broke up with you, but you still shared
the proposal in the office chat.

710
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,920
Did you say that speech
in front of everyone

711
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
because you love me?

712
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,440
You wanted it impossible for me to say no

713
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
by presenting this as a fait accompli.

714
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,880
Listen up, Cui Lixin.
We've already broken up.

715
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,160
It's past the point of no return.

716
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,040
Shen Ruoxin, sometimes,

717
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,440
I just want to rip open your skull
to see what goes on in your head.

718
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,320
Other women want romance and a big show.

719
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
If a man did this for a woman,

720
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,200
she would cry her eyes out.

721
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,600
But you're scolding me instead.

722
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,400
Why are you so cold to me?

723
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,720
For the past 100 days,

724
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,280
I've treated you as the apple of my eye.

725
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
Even an iceberg would've melted by now.

726
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,880
What more do you want me to do?

727
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,680
I put all my savings

728
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
into buying a house for us.

729
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,040
What else do you want me to do?

730
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,040
Do I have to spell it out for you?

731
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,360
I studied law.

732
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,640
You bought the house
with all the money you had.

733
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,280
It's a premarital asset.

734
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,120
Were you going to ask me
to help you pay off the mortgage?

735
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,960
Ruoxin,

736
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,880
you'll regret this.

737
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,240
Everyone, I have an announcement.

738
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,720
Cui Lixin and I have officially broken up.

739
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,960
That's all.

740
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,280
- What?
- What's going on?

741
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
<i>You're already 33.</i>

742
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,320
<i>What do you want?</i>

743
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,480
<i>Why are you so cold to me?</i>

744
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
<i>For the past 100 days,</i>

745
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,160
<i>I've treated you as the apple of my eye.</i>

746
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>Even an iceberg would've melted by now.</i>

747
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
<i>Luckily, I only have to work with you.</i>

748
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,320
<i>It's hard to imagine
how your boyfriend can date you.</i>

749
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,960
<i>It's downright scary.</i>

750
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,040
Xiaoxin Genie.

751
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,240
<i>Yes?</i>

752
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,560
Will I be alone forever?

753
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,760
<i>If a gorgeous and smart assistant like me</i>

754
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,160
<i>can't answer your question,</i>

755
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,720
<i>you'll forgive me, right?</i>

756
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,200
Xiaoxin Genie.

757
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
<i>I'm here. Go ahead.</i>

758
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,960
Do you think I'm cute?

759
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,960
<i>Master, you're the most
beautiful person in the world.</i>

760
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
Xiaoxin Genie.

761
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,360
<i>Yes?</i>

762
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,680
Do you love me?

763
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,040
<i>I'll always be by your side.</i>

764
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,960
You'll always be by my side.

765
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,560
You won't abandon me.

766
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,680
You'll be with me forever.

767
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,320
Will you love me forever?

768
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,280
Look at that.

769
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,320
Not even a machine can guarantee that.

770
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,320
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

771
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,880
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

772
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,480
- Good morning, Ruoxin.
- Good morning.

773
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,480
- Good morning, Ruoxin.
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.

774
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,440
Good morning.

775
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,960
Sijia, Mr. Jin will be coming
to sign the contract later.

776
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,320
Double-check the contract.

777
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,280
Okay.

778
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,000
Ms. Shen, is there anything else
I can help you with?

779
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,000
I want to learn too.

780
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,560
Sijia isn't free to teach today.

781
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,280
Look at the shared documents
and get familiar with the job.

782
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,920
By the way, bring me coffee.

783
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,040
Mom, I'm busy with work. Is this urgent?

784
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,440
<i>I'm downstairs. Come down.</i>

785
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Now? I just got to the office.

786
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,600
<i>If you don't come down,
I'll go upstairs. Your choice.</i>

787
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm coming right away.

788
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,440
Wait for me in the lobby.

789
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,720
Mom, what's so urgent?

790
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,480
Since you were young,

791
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,920
throughout school and work,

792
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,920
I never came to see you
unless it was serious.

793
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,360
But today, I really feel

794
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,440
as if

795
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,800
the sky is falling.

796
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,640
What is so serious?

797
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,080
What is it? You tell me.

798
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,800
Did you break up with Xiaocui?

799
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,520
How could he?

800
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Did he complain to you?

801
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,400
Don't try to distract me
with useless talk.

802
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,720
Just answer me. Yes or no?

803
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,400
Mom, you're fit to be a lawyer.

804
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,760
Yes, I broke up with Cui Lixin.

805
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
How old are you?

806
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,760
Your brain must be wired differently
from other people.

807
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,400
Mom, let's not talk here.

808
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,320
I'll talk to you at home later--

809
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,920
I want to hear
what you have to say right here.

810
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,960
Mom.

811
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,120
I don't like Cui Lixin.

812
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,360
That makes no sense.

813
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,080
If you didn't like him,
why would you date him?

814
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,360
He flattered you every day.

815
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,920
You kept nagging me to give him a try.

816
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,360
So I gave it a try.

817
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,640
I tried. He's not right for me.

818
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,520
Cui Lixin and I are not alike.

819
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,680
Even if we stay together, it won't last.

820
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,800
You're just unruly!

821
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,440
Marriage is just a part of life.

822
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,240
He's such a good man.

823
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,920
How can you say you can't live
the rest of your life with him?

824
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,360
Marriage is a part of life,

825
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,640
but it can be happy or unhappy.

826
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,360
I would rather stay alone forever

827
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,000
than be in an unhappy marriage.

828
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,240
You know that very well, Mom.

829
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,920
You're right.

830
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,520
I was very unhappy
after divorcing your dad.

831
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,640
You had to help me heal my wounds

832
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,600
and put up with my temper
for so many years.

833
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,520
But I want to make it clear to you.

834
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,960
Love is a ghost.

835
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,600
No one has ever encountered it.

836
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,640
And a woman's greatest misfortune…

837
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,040
is being discontented.

838
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,760
Okay, keep searching for it.

839
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,120
Even if you bring home

840
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,800
a man who doesn't care about you,

841
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
I won't care a bit.

842
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,920
Mom.

843
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,240
Go on!

844
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,000
Go as far as you can!

845
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,280
Just don't lose yourself in the end!

846
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,360
Xiaocui.

847
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,800
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,400
I didn't teach my daughter well.

849
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,760
I can't control her.

850
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,960
Let me apologize to you.

851
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,360
What a weirdo.

852
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,720
