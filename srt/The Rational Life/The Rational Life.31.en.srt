1
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I keep saying
that my dream is in Shanghai.

2
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,360
What's my dream?

3
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,200
Is it a promotion or a raise?

4
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,840
Is it to get married and have kids here?

5
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,440
Is it for everyone to see
the webtoons I drew?

6
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,680
Yes and no.

7
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
My dream

8
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,600
is to become a better version of myself.

9
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
One I can be proud of!

10
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,600
One who can handle life's struggles,

11
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
grab all opportunities,

12
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,440
and see a bigger stage!

13
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,920
Then do everything possible

14
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,880
to get a hold of it.

15
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,640
Mom.

16
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,440
There was a girl whom I liked before.

17
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
But I always told myself,

18
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,160
"She's too good for me.

19
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,640
I don't want to hurt her."

20
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,880
This is because I don't know
when I'll leave Shanghai.

21
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
But after she was gone,

22
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,520
I regretted it a lot.

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,920
I regretted it very much.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,160
I hated my cowardly self back then!

25
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,680
Dad.

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,080
I know

27
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,680
that if I don't go home with you today,

28
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
you'll be disappointed and angry.

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
But if I were to go with you today,

30
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,080
in the future,

31
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,240
I would hate myself for running away!

32
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
Maybe in a few years,

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,360
I still might not be able to afford
a house in Shanghai

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,480
and can't find a job.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
However,

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
I must at least do my best
and give it a try.

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,440
At least, I shouldn't let my future self
hate my current self!

38
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
Dad.

39
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,880
Can you understand me?

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
You've chosen

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
your path.

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,160
If you're a man,

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
see through this path by yourself.

44
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,440
Let me be proud

45
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,480
when I talk about my son

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
to others.

47
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Dad.

48
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,160
Do you agree?

49
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
I just hope

50
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,800
that you'll never

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,840
return to us
with your tail between your legs.

52
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,080
Thank you, Dad.

53
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,560
Mom.

54
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,840
I have one more thing to tell you.

55
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
What is it?

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,520
The girl I mentioned to you just now

57
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
didn't go away.

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,040
She's my girlfriend now.

59
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Really?

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,320
Do you have a picture? Show it to me.

61
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,360
Take a look.

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,960
She's so nice.

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,680
How long have you known each other?

64
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
Since college.

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

66
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,160
You're so good at keeping secrets.

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,760
She's quite a beauty.

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,040
She has a high nose bridge and big eyes.

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,760
This is great.

70
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
She's so beautiful.

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,200
You haven't had enough
of the movie earlier?

72
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
It was a bit illogical.
I couldn't enjoy it.

73
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm rewatching the highlights.

74
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,640
How much did she drink?

75
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
- Two glasses.
- What?

76
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,920
Two glasses?

77
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,160
Well…

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Do you want

79
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,080
to drink something?

80
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
There's water in the kitchen.

81
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
I don't want water.

82
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,240
There's cola in the refrigerator.

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,280
I don't want cola either.

84
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,840
Do you want alcohol?

85
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,760
I didn't drink while I was eating.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,880
I'll drink now to celebrate.

87
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,880
- Is red wine okay?
- Yes.

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,200
Didn't you tell me
to cut down even on coffee before?

89
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,680
Now, I can drink wine?

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
I especially agree with a phrase
that you said.

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
Life is short.

92
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,080
Eat if you want to, drink if you want to.

93
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,800
You mean, live in the moment?

94
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,920
Here.

95
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,040
Thank you, my girlfriend,
for letting me stay here today.

96
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,720
This is a good movie.

97
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
Wait.

98
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,280
Since when can you hold
your alcohol so well?

99
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,200
I get drunk easily

100
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,880
only when I'm feeling down.

101
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Young man.

102
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Are you

103
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
trying to make me drunk?

104
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
No.

105
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,440
If…

106
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,920
you were the one wandering the universe,

107
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,040
what would you want to do the most?

108
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Perhaps just like in the movie,

109
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,360
I want to hear my family's voice the most.

110
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,280
What about you?

111
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,880
I…

112
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,840
want to find a time travel portal

113
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,440
and go back to a time before my dad died,

114
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,480
give him a big hug,

115
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
and say goodbye properly.

116
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,480
If there was still time,

117
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,680
I would go back
to when you were a kid and tell you

118
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,560
not to rush into a relationship.

119
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
Wait for me.

120
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,040
When exactly will you provide
the "girlfriend benefit"?

121
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,200
It's late.

122
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,320
Get some rest.

123
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
The sofa is very comfortable.

124
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
We haven't finished the movie yet.

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,560
Did you sleep well last night?

126
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,160
I slept very well.

127
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,040
That's good.

128
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,080
Hurry up and eat.

129
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,040
Here.

130
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
<i>The last gathering was too short.</i>

131
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,840
<i>I didn't get enough.</i>

132
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,720
<i>Yes, we didn't get to talk much.</i>

133
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,760
<i>When will we gather again?</i>

134
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,040
<i>This weekend,
we can go to a scenic spot nearby.</i>

135
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,200
<i>Let's do a road trip.</i>

136
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,520
<i>If you all have time,</i>

137
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,680
<i>I'll set it up.</i>

138
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,560
<i>Yes, good timing. Gu Yutao has a new car.</i>

139
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,440
<i>Let's break in his car.</i>

140
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm free this weekend.

141
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,000
Just help me book a room.

142
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

143
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
What is the room for?

144
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,560
Are you going somewhere this weekend?

145
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,200
During our class's last gathering,

146
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,960
everyone thinks that
we can round up our resources.

147
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,440
It's a good opportunity

148
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,480
to get to know each other more.

149
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
This weekend,

150
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
you can draw

151
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,680
your designs in peace.

152
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I won't bother you.

153
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,280
Then

154
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,280
have you decided where to go?

155
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
They said Qionglong Mountain is nice.

156
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,760
Okay.

157
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
I'll just go for two days.

158
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,320
I'll be back after that.

159
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,720
Have an egg.

160
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,280
Why are you here?

161
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,280
I'm leaving soon.

162
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
I've prepared a power bank
and charging cable for you.

163
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Your phone's battery might die
and I won't be able to reach you.

164
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,120
I don't want my weekend

165
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
to be scary again.

166
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,040
This time, I swear

167
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,800
that my phone will have power
24 hours a day.

168
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,680
By the way, if that scenic spot
has dangerous activities,

169
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
you must be careful, all right?

170
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,920
Don't try water rafting,
bungee jumping, and the like.

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
Do you hear me?

172
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,680
Shouldn't youngsters

173
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,520
be very interested

174
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
in exciting activities?

175
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,960
Why won't you let me try them?

176
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,480
Don't worry.

177
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,720
I treasure my life.

178
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,880
I'm not with you.

179
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm worried.

180
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,000
Then do you want to go with me?

181
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,000
You'll let me tag along?

182
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,880
You'll introduce me to your classmates?

183
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm not sure yet.

184
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,920
I knew it.

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,960
Are you angry?

186
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
No.

187
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,040
I promise you then.

188
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll give you the "benefit" when I'm back.

189
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,880
What benefit?

190
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,160
The "girlfriend benefit."

191
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,400
It's…

192
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,520
- What do you think?
- Good.

193
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,520
- Nice car.
- It's not bad.

194
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,680
It looks great.

195
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,960
Nice!

196
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,360
- It suits your aura.
- It's purely electric.

197
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
It starts up quickly
and it's cost-efficient.

198
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
- Ruoxin.
- Ruoxin.

199
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
- What do you think?
- Ruoxin.

200
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,320
- It has been a while.
- I'm telling you.

201
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,840
This car is very popular.

202
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,000
I should tell you

203
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
something our sales representative says.

204
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,760
"You're lucky if you bought one."

205
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm so lucky.

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,360
- Here, let me help you.
- It's okay. I can do it myself.

207
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,840
Helping you is my pleasure.

208
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
Besides, you're our most
important classmate.

209
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,440
You're not just my classmate anymore.

210
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,640
You're my client too.

211
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,560
So I must insist
on being self-disciplined.

212
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,680
She's good with words.

213
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
Let's go and check in.

214
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

215
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,160
- Let's go.
- Come on.

216
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,080
This way.

217
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,600
SHEN RUOXIN

218
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,280
You're good. You've wrapped so many.

219
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,599
What's the matter?

220
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
Is your work not going well?

221
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
No, it's going well.

222
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,600
Zhu Lin has already found an investor.

223
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,800
My son, when starting a business,

224
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
don't feel pressured.

225
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,280
Your dad left us
this little house in the city center.

226
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,520
If I sell it,

227
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,560
it's more than enough

228
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,000
for whatever you want to do.

229
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,880
Mom. How many times do I have to tell you?

230
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,840
No.

231
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
Don't worry about my work.

232
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,480
I know what I'm doing with my work.

233
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,560
Are things not going well

234
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,880
with you and Ruoxin then?

235
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,880
Not really.

236
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,680
Lately,

237
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,920
I often go to the University for Seniors
to chat with her mom.

238
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,920
What do you talk about?

239
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,040
Just casual stuff.

240
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,840
But to be honest,

241
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,160
I really like talking to her mom.

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Her mom is very capable.

243
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,080
She's handling her work

244
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
and her life so well.

245
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,280
Unlike me, who is a mess
and always causes you trouble.

246
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,160
Listen to yourself.

247
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,080
Helping you is what keeps me going.

248
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
However,

249
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,400
does Ruoxin's mom know about us?

250
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,040
I don't think she knows.

251
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,360
She's still trying
to find a girlfriend for you.

252
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,880
I knew it.

253
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,400
My son.

254
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,760
Are you and Ruoxin arguing?

255
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,280
Tell me.

256
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Let me analyze it for you.

257
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,560
We didn't really fight.

258
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,320
But…

259
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,360
I can't figure out

260
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,920
what exactly she's thinking now.

261
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,720
When we weren't together before,

262
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,720
I know

263
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
what she's thinking about.

264
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,160
Now that we're together,

265
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,360
I feel like

266
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,600
she's holding back on me.

267
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,320
She won't let me meet her friends.

268
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
She didn't tell her mom either.

269
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,360
I really don't know

270
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,880
if she's serious
about this relationship or not.

271
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,280
I see.

272
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,120
Her mom told me

273
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,640
about their family matters.

274
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,760
Has it ever occurred to you

275
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,720
why someone as beautiful

276
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
and capable as Ruoxin

277
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,640
didn't have many serious relationships?

278
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,320
It's because

279
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,120
she doesn't like ordinary guys.

280
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
That's just part of it.

281
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,520
It's more because
she's afraid of getting hurt.

282
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,400
Think about it.

283
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,200
Her dad left Shanghai back then

284
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,480
because of his ideals

285
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,680
and divorced her mom.

286
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
Doesn't that also mean

287
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,560
that he abandoned Ruoxin?

288
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,200
This matter definitely affected her.

289
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,480
Mom.

290
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,200
You mean…

291
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,920
I mean,

292
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,960
some people

293
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,000
have thorns all over their bodies.

294
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
That's because she has to protect herself.

295
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,120
She's afraid of getting hurt.

296
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
If you really love her,

297
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
you must make her believe

298
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
that you can protect her

299
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
and you won't hurt her.

300
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,160
Then she doesn't need
those thorns anymore.

301
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,600
Ruoxin is much older than you.

302
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,240
So she thinks much more than you

303
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,960
in every way.

304
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,680
So her attitude towards your relationship

305
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,400
doesn't depend on her,

306
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
but on you.

307
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
Do you understand?

308
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,480
Mom.

309
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,000
Why didn't I realize

310
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,960
how wise you were before this?

311
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,280
It's like you can read people's minds.

312
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,920
Do you think I watched those interviews

313
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,960
and matchmaking shows in vain?

314
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,880
I'm going to say one more thing.

315
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Back then, your grandparents

316
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,000
were so against me marrying your dad.

317
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,440
Do you know
why I was so determined to marry him?

318
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,440
Why?

319
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,000
That's because

320
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,400
ever since I met your dad,

321
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,320
he writes a letter to me every day.

322
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,440
When he had time,

323
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,760
he would take the train
and visit me in Sichuan.

324
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,520
All his savings

325
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,920
were spent on traveling.

326
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,320
So I knew this man was the one.

327
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,360
He's reliable.

328
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,880
My son.

329
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,800
If you want Ruoxin to know
that you're the one,

330
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,840
that will depend on your abilities

331
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,680
and what you do.

332
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,760
I got it, Mom.

333
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,920
I'll go to her now.

334
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,720
Your hands are full of flour!

335
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,000
My mom is the greatest!

336
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,160
- You…
- I'm leaving!

337
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,400
Silly boy!

338
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,560
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

339
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
- Thank you.
- Here.

340
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,240
- Here.
- Come on.

341
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,520
Although it's Shanghai cuisine,

342
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,040
it's different
from what you eat in the city.

343
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
It's very fresh. Dig in.

344
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,880
Let's dig in.

345
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,880
This place Yutao chose is really nice.

346
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,200
It's designed
like a luxury bed and breakfast.

347
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
It's amazing.

348
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
That's right. My company
had its annual party here.

349
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
Even though it's expensive,
it's really worth it.

350
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,000
By the way,
send the bill to the group later,

351
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,960
so it would be easier
to transfer money to Mr. Gu.

352
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't bother.

353
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
I'll pay for everything this time.

354
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
We haven't met for so many years.
It's a gift to my old classmates.

355
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
How can we accept that?

356
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
You're so generous.

357
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
But don't you think

358
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,400
we seem to be benefitting
thanks to someone?

359
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,800
Why are you all looking at me?

360
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,320
I have a boyfriend.

361
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Don't create trouble.

362
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,280
Yutao is my client now.

363
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,760
Referring to him as a client
makes your relationship distant.

364
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,480
Regardless of the relationship,
we still have to split the bill today.

365
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,840
This meal is so expensive.

366
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,200
Staying in such a place
must cost a lot of money, right?

367
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
There's really no need.

368
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,080
Let me put it this way.

369
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,840
I've known the owner of this hotel
since we were in Singapore.

370
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,360
He's an old friend.

371
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,880
He gave me a VIP discount.

372
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,800
And he said

373
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,440
that my friends are his friends.

374
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,320
We just want you
to eat, sleep, and drink well.

375
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,280
We still have plenty of time ahead.
All right?

376
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
That's right.

377
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,040
Let's not worry about that today.

378
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,400
Let's look for a chance in the future
to make it up to Yutao.

379
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

380
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,160
I'll make a toast first.

381
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,520
Come on.
Here's to our friendship all these years.

382
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,480
- Here.
- Cheers.

383
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,560
Ruoxin.

384
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,800
This is Reeves shad.

385
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,960
It's your favorite. Here.

386
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,800
- Thank you.
- Reeves shad.

387
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
You don't get this, do you?

388
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,320
Eileen Chang once wrote in her novel

389
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,240
that there are three big regrets in life.

390
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,200
The first thing is hating
Reeves shad for having lots of bones.

391
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,760
When Ruoxin was in the university,

392
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,880
- she was a huge fan of Eileen Chang.
- That's right.

393
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,760
She was so artistic.

394
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,160
Gu Yutao remembers this very clearly.

395
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,520
That was ages ago.

396
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Back then, I liked to grieve
the changing of seasons.

397
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,360
Now, time has turned me

398
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,400
into a materialistic girl, right?

399
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Now that I'm all grown up,
I finally understand

400
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,520
that a lot of good things

401
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,040
must be left in the past.

402
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,640
Take the Reeves shad as an example.

403
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,920
What we're eating now
is either imported or farmed ones.

404
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Those wild Reeves shads
from the Yangtze River

405
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,920
are already extinct.

406
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
We can't buy it anymore, right?

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,200
But doesn't the Reeves shad
still taste the same?

408
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,160
- Right.
- Don't just talk.

409
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,760
Eat more.

410
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,120
Eat up.

411
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,640
By the way, if we have time after this,
let's walk to the hillside for a bit.

412
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
There's a stargazing pavilion over there
that's really nice.

413
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,360
- There's even a stargazing pavilion.
- Really?

414
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
That's great.

415
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,320
We all know

416
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,000
that Ruoxin likes to look at stars.

417
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,440
Tell me.

418
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,880
Is this trip customized for Shen Ruoxin?

419
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,760
We're just supporting characters
to the lead.

420
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,960
There you go again.

421
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,680
Yutao likes stargazing too, okay?

422
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,400
- Yes.
- Stop messing around.

423
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,400
You just want to create trouble.

424
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,440
Just eat.

425
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,240
Say something, Yutao.

426
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,120
Is it customized for her?

427
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,720
How can a gift from heaven be customized?

428
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,040
It's just a chance for us to gather.

429
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,760
You talk too much. Goodness.

430
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,440
- You're still a smooth talker.
- Here.

431
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,160
- Come on.
- Let's have another drink.

432
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,560
- Come on.
- Drink up.

433
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,920
After graduation,
we've all been busy with our own stuff.

434
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,480
It's so rare to have a relaxing
and casual gathering like this.

435
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,480
It's so nice.

436
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
Life in the city
is becoming more and more stressful.

437
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,920
Everyone's weighed down with work.

438
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,560
Who doesn't want to go back
to the time when we were students?

439
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,600
Do you remember that field trip
in our junior year?

440
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,520
We got separated from the group.

441
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,680
We stayed overnight in the mountains.

442
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,240
You were really scared back then.

443
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,480
You grabbed my arm and wailed.

444
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,880
You said that you still have
many unfulfilled dreams.

445
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,440
You don't want to die so soon.

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,120
Right now, I might only cry
because of my sales performance.

447
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,600
I've long forgotten

448
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,840
about my dream.

449
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,400
Actually, all these years,
I don't think you've changed at all.

450
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,200
You really deserve to have a better life.

451
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
The night view
from this stargazing pavilion

452
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,880
is so beautiful.

453
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,400
- The sky is full of stars.
- Yes, the weather is good.

454
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
What a rare sight.

455
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
I think this one is okay.

456
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,600
Look.

457
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
They look good together.

458
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,920
Why are you still so nosy
after all these years?

459
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
What do you know?

460
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,480
Life is so hard.

461
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,760
- We need a bit of gossip.
- Yes.

462
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,280
You don't know anything.

463
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,240
Regarding this, I'm telling you,

464
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
don't spread rumors.

465
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,080
- I'm just trying to set them up.
- Why are you laughing?

466
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,680
- He's coming.
- You look so happy.

467
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,840
You both look good together. Look.

468
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,040
Who are they? They look good together.

469
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,280
Send me the original photo.

470
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,160
Stop it.

471
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,400
They took a photo of us together earlier
and even said that we look good together.

472
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,400
How lame.

473
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,000
Qi Xiao!

474
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
Why are you here?

475
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,600
I miss you.

476
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,120
I'm worried because I'm not with you.

477
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,880
You suddenly came here.

478
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,240
How should I introduce you
to my classmates?

479
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,240
Say whatever you want.

480
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,560
A younger brother.

481
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,560
Your assistant.

482
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
Whatever you're comfortable with is fine.

483
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,520
Ruoxin, is he your friend?

484
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,200
Hey.

485
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,800
What a handsome boy.

486
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,160
- Who is it?
- Let me introduce you.

487
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,000
This is my boyfriend, Qi Xiao.

488
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,120
Hello. Nice to meet you.

489
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,000
Ruoxin, when did you get a boyfriend?

490
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,640
You're enjoying life too much.

491
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,240
Handsome guy,
where are you planning to stay tonight?

492
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,360
I've already arranged

493
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,560
our bed assignments.

494
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,680
I heard the hotel is fully booked too.

495
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,480
But don't worry.

496
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,320
There's an extra bed in my room.

497
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,520
If you don't mind,

498
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
you can spend the night there.

499
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,440
- Sure. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

500
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,080
I'll go back to my room.

501
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Mr. Gu.

502
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,320
Let's go.

503
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,480
You're not upset
that I suddenly showed up, are you?

504
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,520
Not really.

505
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Actually, before I came,
I've already decided.

506
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,600
If you don't want to introduce me
as your boyfriend,

507
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,280
I'll keep being your assistant.

508
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,600
As long as you're happy…

509
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,680
As long as I can see you

510
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,360
and protect you,

511
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm willing to do anything.

512
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,240
Because you're my girlfriend.

513
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,040
I love you.

514
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,160
Qi Xiao.

515
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,920
I know.

516
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,840
Maybe you're still not used to this.

517
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,920
But it's okay.

518
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,680
I can wait.

519
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,080
I've already waited
until you agreed to be my girlfriend

520
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,040
and let me

521
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
into your world.

522
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,080
Someday,

523
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,960
I'll wait until you're no longer guarded

524
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,040
and completely believe me

525
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,200
and trust me.

526
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,240
It will happen someday.

527
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,520
Don't worry.

528
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,160
I'll do my best.

529
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,480
Miss.

530
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,800
Just now,

531
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,800
you initiated it.

532
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
- You're here?
- Yes.

533
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,000
Hey, you're following her so closely.

534
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
Not really.

535
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,880
What's the matter?
Are you worried that Ruoxin came with me?

536
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,240
I'm her boyfriend.

537
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,520
I came to meet her classmates
and spend time with her.

538
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,120
That's normal.

539
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,960
It's nothing personal.

540
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,880
I really don't understand
young people nowadays.

541
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,680
Back in my day,

542
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,280
dating required
having similar backgrounds,

543
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,960
like financial status,
family background, career,

544
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,360
and outward appearance.

545
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
But appearance comes second.

546
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,720
The first few are what matters.

547
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,480
Yes, I won't deny it.

548
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,480
Some women prioritize

549
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,920
having a house and money, as you said.

550
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,560
But Xinxin

551
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,480
is definitely not like that.

552
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
After all, love is chemistry

553
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,280
between two people.

554
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,400
You can't exchange it

555
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,680
with a property ownership certificate
or money.

556
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,480
If you say such things,
that means you're too young.

557
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,600
You don't have that much experience yet.

558
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
I've known Ruoxin for decades.

559
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,600
She's completely practical and rational.

560
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,040
Of course,

561
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,520
a momentary passion

562
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,920
might attract her,

563
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,400
but if you want it to last forever,

564
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,920
I'm afraid that
just relying on passion won't do.

565
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,000
However, I'm her boyfriend now.

566
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,239
I think I know her better than you do.

567
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,440
I hope so.

568
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
Get some rest. Good night.

569
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,320
Good night.

570
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,320
- Ten.
- None.

571
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,080
- Ten.
- Five.

572
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,239
A bet is a bet.

573
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,080
If I win, let me kiss you.

574
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,199
What if I win?

575
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,199
I'll give you a kiss then.

576
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
- So I'm always at a disadvantage?
- I don't care. Come on.

577
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,120
Ruoxin.

578
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,840
Does dating a younger man
make you feel young again?

579
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,240
I'm as childish as him now.

580
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,280
"Childish" is a term that describes
someone innocent like me

581
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,160
who just started working.

582
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,880
Miss, you're old.

583
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,600
Qi Xiao.

584
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,760
I used to think that dating a younger man
is quite unreliable.

585
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,080
Now,

586
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,320
it seems nice.

587
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
As long as you don't consider
practical matters,

588
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,440
any relationship is romantic.

589
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
- Have some beverages.
- I didn't expect

590
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,200
that you would have
this kind of boyfriend.

591
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,520
This isn't your style.

592
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,480
What's my style?

593
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,840
You're competitive.

594
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,240
Ruoxin.

595
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,040
Do you remember when you wanted to join

596
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,040
the swimming competition in school?

597
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,600
You dragged me
into practicing with you daily.

598
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,520
You wouldn't let me go home
if you didn't do well.

599
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,440
I still feel scared now.

600
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,000
I was young back then.

601
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
I was eager to win.

602
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm grateful for that competition.

603
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,000
Since then, I fell in love with swimming.

604
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,960
We can go to the beach
on our next trip then.

605
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,000
Sure.

606
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,640
In terms of beaches, for farther ones,

607
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,880
I suggest Hawaii.

608
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,800
For someplace close, go to Phuket.

609
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,880
By the way, Bailey Island in Thailand
is very nice too.

610
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,160
It's not crowded and the resorts there

611
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
work with our law firm.

612
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,560
I can get the lowest price.

613
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,240
By the way, Qi Xiao,
do you have a passport?

614
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,880
You don't even have a passport?

615
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,840
Youngsters should go abroad
to see the world.

616
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
It's very important
to expand your horizons.

617
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,200
Ruoxin. I'm quite envious of you.

618
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,600
We've gotten enough rest.
Let's keep going.

619
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080
Come on. Let's go.

620
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,800
Clean up the table.

621
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,720
- Okay.
- Let's go.

622
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,880
Hurry up.

623
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,160
Let's go.

624
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Clean up well.

625
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,840
- Take this.
- Give that to me.

626
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,840
Come on.

627
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,600
Is it that tiring?

628
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,560
Give me your bag.

629
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,080
Don't force yourself, miss.

630
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,200
You're challenging me.

631
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,680
If you don't usually exercise,
hiking will show your real capability.

632
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,840
Can you do it or not?

633
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
Ruoxin.

634
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Why don't you give me your bag?

635
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,440
We still have a long way to go.

636
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,480
- I'm coming.
- There's no need.

637
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,360
You're already carrying a heavy bag.

638
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,400
It's fine. I have great stamina.

639
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,960
It's fine. I'm young.

640
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
I'll carry my girlfriend's bag.

641
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
Don't worry about it.

642
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,240
All right. Call me if you need anything.

643
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,440
Don't force yourself.

644
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,240
Give it to me.

645
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,440
- It's too heavy.
- It's fine.

646
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,680
Gu Yutao is a fitness expert indeed.

647
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,200
He's walking so fast
while carrying such a heavy bag.

648
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
Miss, I'll help you with your bag.

649
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
Thank you. I'm exhausted.

650
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,280
- It's fine.
- My bag is so heavy.

651
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,200
Mr. Gu, you can do it.

652
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
You're walking pretty fast.

653
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,880
Let's race.

654
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,080
Ruoxin, come on.
I'll take a picture of you.

655
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,080
Look at me.

656
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,920
Three, two, one. Okay, come on.

657
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,640
Three, two, one.

658
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,960
It's so beautiful.

659
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,760
- Letian. Take a photo of us.
- Okay.

660
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,440
Let's take a picture together.

661
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,000
Come on.

662
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,960
Smile.

663
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,200
Just a minute.

664
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,360
Wait a minute. Let's take one together.

665
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,640
Go ahead.

666
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,560
Okay, get ready.

667
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,680
Come on, smile.

668
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,600
One, two, three.

669
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,760
- All right.
- Qi Xiao.

670
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
You don't mind that my old classmate and I
take a photo together, right?

671
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,800
We haven't seen each other for years.
Just as a memento.

672
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

673
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,920
I'll take a photo for you.

674
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,480
Thank you.

675
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,120
- Sir, I'll take a photo for them.
- Okay.

676
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,280
Thank you.

677
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,000
Take a few photos
horizontally and vertically.

678
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,160
Hold on. Let the camera focus.

679
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,600
Three, two, one, smile.

680
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,640
Okay, one more.

681
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,200
Three, two, one.

682
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,480
It's so nice.

683
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
- Okay, a finger heart.
- A vertical one.

684
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Come on.

685
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,560
Make a finger heart.

686
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,760
Don't be shy. We're old classmates.

687
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,160
Why are you so shy? Come on.

688
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,480
- Here, miss.
- Thank you.

689
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,360
- Help me get one.
- Here.

690
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,600
- Here.
- Ruoxin.

691
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
Have some milk biscuits.

692
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

693
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,520
Sir, do you have any utensils?
I'll take one.

694
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,400
To be honest,

695
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,520
before coming here,

696
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,760
I really don't understand

697
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,080
why you would want

698
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,520
such a young boyfriend.

699
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,280
But from the looks of things today,

700
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,240
he does know how to cheer you up.

701
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,800
Qi Xiao may be young,

702
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,600
but he's very mature.

703
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,920
And he has a plan for his future.

704
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,320
He's smart and opinionated.

705
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,480
- He's a designer, right?
- Yes.

706
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,240
It's hard to find a job.
It's hard to start a business too.

707
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,360
Qi Xiao just applied
to the MOC Design Competition.

708
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,120
If he wins,

709
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm sure it will be
a good opportunity for his future.

710
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,160
MOC Design Competition?

711
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,840
The Shangli Group is hosting it, right?

712
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,240
Do you know about that competition?

713
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,480
I know them very well.

714
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,960
Our team was the legal consultant

715
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,760
for their IPO offering
when they went public.

716
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,080
Do you want me
to set up a dinner with their boss

717
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
and introduce you to him?

718
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,480
That will surely help in his competition.

719
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,960
I remember now.

720
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,080
The champion can get one million yuan
capital to start a business.

721
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,640
He can make his own designer brand.

722
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,000
Their company wants to scout new talents

723
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,760
to produce young brands

724
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,000
for a brand matrix.

725
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,240
For a newbie,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

726
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,240
He must grab it.

727
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,080
Then

728
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,760
please make an appointment for me.

729
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
It's not a big deal.

730
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,440
Thank you.

731
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,720
However,

732
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,760
I know that you're attracted

733
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,920
to a young fellow like Qi Xiao now,

734
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,400
who is young, handsome,

735
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,680
- and full of life.
- This is tasty.

736
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,640
After all,

737
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,280
in dating, everything is great at first.

738
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,560
But we must

739
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,360
go on with our lives.

740
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,560
After a while,

741
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,120
maybe you two will know

742
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,520
where the problem lies.

743
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,560
I think that

744
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,600
at Qi Xiao's age,

745
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,320
he's not mature enough
to shield you from difficulties.

746
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,560
I know that Qi Xiao and I

747
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,400
are bound to encounter
a lot of difficulties and problems.

748
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,240
But I really don't think I must find a man

749
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,080
who can shield me from difficulties.

750
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,440
When I'm with him,

751
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,720
I feel very comfortable, happy,

752
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,680
and carefree.

753
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,640
No one else can make me feel that way.

754
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,160
And when I encounter problems

755
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
and danger,

756
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
he's willing to stand by me

757
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,240
and accompany me.

758
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,760
That's enough.

759
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,680
Eat something.

760
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,600
Sure.

761
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,840
I'll let you two talk.

762
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,720
Have you eaten?

763
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,680
Try this.

764
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,760
- Have one.
- Try this.

765
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,720
You eat it.

766
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
What are you talking about?
You look so happy.

767
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,160
Here. Let's drink.

768
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,120
Come on.

769
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it. Come on.

770
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,320
Mr. Gu.

771
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,920
We can see your efforts.

772
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,200
I think you should let it go.

773
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,480
I think she's already taken.

774
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,520
Youngsters aren't steady.

775
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,120
Besides,

776
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,240
Ruoxin isn't the type
who thinks love is all that matters.

777
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,280
Don't think too much.

778
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,920
How benevolent.

779
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,880
Here.

780
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,560
It seems like, in terms of packing,

781
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,320
men are still better at it.

782
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,960
It's fine.

783
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,720
The one thing
that I don't lack is patience.

784
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,480
Starting your own business must be tough.

785
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
It's okay. I'm taking it slow.

786
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,640
You just graduated.

787
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,120
You have very little experience
and connection.

788
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,800
It must be difficult.

789
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,240
But I think you're quite smart.

790
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,720
You're a sweet-talker.

791
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Being able to please Ruoxin
is considered a shortcut too.

792
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,280
Mr. Gu.

793
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,200
I've respected you
from the moment I met you

794
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,080
because you're Ruoxin's friend.

795
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,680
I believe you're a man of character.

796
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,720
I want to tell you

797
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,640
I don't have ulterior motives
for being with Ruoxin.

798
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,120
I'll rely on myself to succeed.

799
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,160
I feel relieved for Ruoxin
that you think this way.

800
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,440
But do you really think

801
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,800
that you can succeed quickly

802
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,240
by just relying on yourself?

803
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,480
You should know.

804
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,960
Ruoxin has never asked favors
from anyone for herself.

805
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,480
But today,

806
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,440
I can't believe that

807
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,200
she sought to pull strings

808
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,600
for your design competition.

809
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,240
She asked me for connections.

810
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
