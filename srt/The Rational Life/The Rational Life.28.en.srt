1
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,040
Ruoxin.

2
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,240
What did Mr. Liu say?

3
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,440
Refunds and public apologies.

4
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,440
Who signed with him?

5
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
It was Xiaowang.

6
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,680
Could he be…

7
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Don't worry.

8
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,920
I'll protect him.

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,720
I'll report to Mr. Xu later.

10
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm sure there's a way.

11
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
Okay.

12
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,720
Let's go.

13
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,960
So the New Energy Department
was set as an example?

14
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
What example?

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,840
I think it was on purpose.

16
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
What do you mean?

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,000
The charging station problem
could be nothing.

18
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
But everything is up to Mr. Liu.

19
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
If he really wants to press it down,

20
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,400
he could have given the owner a discount.

21
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,440
You can ask Sijia.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,760
Everyone knows that
Mr. Liu and Ms. Shen have issues.

23
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,720
What's going on?

24
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,920
Ruoxin is so unlucky.

25
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,840
Are you still trying to figure it out?

26
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,400
Life.

27
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,360
When you're happy,

28
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,120
it'll hit you in the face

29
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,440
to keep you awake.

30
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
Let me ask you one thing.

31
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,519
What is it?

32
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,360
Won't you trust me

33
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,760
just because I'm younger?

34
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,160
I was worried about age

35
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
not because I didn't trust you.

36
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
You're nice and responsible.

37
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm just concerned
about the age difference.

38
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,440
I was hesitant.

39
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,160
Then you have to keep trusting me.

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,480
Have something sweet.

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't worry.

42
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,160
RESIGNATION LETTER

43
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,080
QI XIAO

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,600
Mr. Liu.

45
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
As you know,

46
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,200
Ms. Shen was hospitalized a while ago.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,280
I was in charge

48
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,440
of the promotion
of the new energy vehicle.

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,040
It was all on me.

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
Now that I think about it,
I was too inexperienced.

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,040
That's why the problem occurred.

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,520
Ms. Shen did nothing wrong.

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
Ms. Shen is usually very responsible.

54
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,200
Why did she

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,520
push you to take the fall?

56
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,320
No. This isn't Ms. Shen's idea.

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Qi Xiao.

58
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,640
You're well-educated.

59
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,840
You're also diligent at work.

60
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,360
You know what the problem is?

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,840
You followed the wrong person.

62
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,680
Mr. Liu.

63
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm an adult.

64
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,440
I know what's right and wrong
about my choice.

65
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
It was entirely my own choice.

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,240
No one else's business.

67
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,200
Besides, this incident

68
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,120
was the result of my mistake.

69
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,720
So I have to take the blame for it.

70
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,520
I'll take responsibility and resign.

71
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,120
I can also do a public apology.

72
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Okay, I agree.

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,960
APPROVE APPLICATION

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
APPROVE APPLICATION,
SIGNATURE: LIU PEI

75
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,440
The client was really emotional.

76
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
But I think we can still find a way.

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,160
<i>Liu Pei has reported this to headquarters.</i>

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,040
The installation company
doesn't have a better solution.

79
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,360
We can't solve the biggest problem.

80
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
So the headquarters want to follow

81
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Liu Pei's plan first.

82
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,520
<i>They are more concerned about brand image.</i>

83
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,960
It's for the bigger picture.

84
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
You have to understand.

85
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,120
This is clearly an installation problem.

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Now, Mr. Liu is trying
to put the blame on my team.

87
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,440
He wants us to resign

88
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,680
and apologize publicly.

89
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,400
That's too unfair.

90
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Do you have a better idea?

91
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
<i>Let's take care of this first.</i>

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
<i>You might have another chance.</i>

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,920
Do you understand?

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
Yes, Mr. Xu.

95
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Thank you.

96
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,480
What are you doing?

97
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,880
I quit.

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,040
The whole issue regarding Ms. Chang

99
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
is my responsibility.

100
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,080
I should be the one to resign.

101
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,040
I already sent my apology letter
to the PR Department.

102
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,400
If she has any more demands,

103
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
I'll do it too.

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
What did you do wrong?

105
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,240
What do you need
to take responsibility for?

106
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
Why are you taking the fall?

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
I said I'll take care of it.

108
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,760
Hey, don't be angry.

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
I know you'll find a way to fix this.

110
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,080
But now,

111
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,680
this is the most efficient way.

112
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,280
We won't lose a lot.

113
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
Did you get my permission?

114
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,600
I've talked to Mr. Liu.

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,400
He has already signed
my resignation letter.

116
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,240
Get your things and come with me.

117
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
Are you still mad?

118
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,720
This is a serious matter.

119
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,960
You didn't discuss it with me
before you make a decision.

120
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,760
Weren't you being too impulsive?

121
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
I know you're frustrated.

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,120
My resignation means
our department is taking the blame.

123
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
I let Liu Pei win.

124
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
But if I don't do this,

125
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
he won't give in that easily.

126
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,800
Do you think I care about Liu Pei?

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,560
He has nothing to do with me.
I only care about you!

128
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,240
I can't even protect you.

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,560
Do I have to let you do it?

130
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,160
I feel useless!

131
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,280
All right.

132
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,560
Don't be mad.

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,240
You don't have to feel guilty.

134
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,400
I was thinking about quitting anyway.

135
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,880
Didn't you want me to do what I like?

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,680
I went to see Zhu Lin the other day.

137
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
We talked about starting
a business together.

138
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,800
I didn't tell you
because we weren't sure yet.

139
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Look. I solved two problems
at the same time.

140
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
Killing two birds with one stone, right?

141
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,000
You've figured it all out.

142
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,520
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,120
In the future,

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,240
I'll discuss everything with you.

145
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,600
Okay?

146
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,640
But you have to do
what you've always done.

147
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
You have to trust me.

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
All right.

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Smile.

150
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Give me a smile.

151
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,720
I don't need to get up early from now on.

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
This is awesome.

153
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
<i>Good morning.</i>

154
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,120
<i>It might rain today,
so don't forget your umbrella.</i>

155
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,160
<i>I know.</i>

156
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,040
<i>Why are you up so early?</i>

157
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,360
<i>Being the first to say "good morning"</i>

158
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
<i>is my responsibility as a boyfriend.</i>

159
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Hi, beautiful.

160
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,560
Last night was a starry night.

161
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Were you too lonely to sleep?

162
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,760
Did you miss me?

163
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,360
Not really.

164
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,400
I looked through the files
on the charger last night.

165
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I dreamed of electricity and wires.

166
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
How boring.

167
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,160
It's too early to talk about work.

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm finally not your assistant anymore.

169
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,600
Can I just quietly be your boyfriend

170
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400
and do nothing else?

171
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,960
Then my quiet boyfriend,

172
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,120
what are your plans now?

173
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,560
Did you talk to Zhu Lin?

174
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
I'm already on it.

175
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,240
It's not a big deal. So don't worry.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
But I still feel guilty.

177
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,840
I feel like

178
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
I owe you.

179
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,800
Instead of saving you,
you're the one who has to take the fall.

180
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,960
There you go again.

181
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,160
You should be happy for me.

182
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,000
You encouraged me

183
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,160
to do what I really like, didn't you?

184
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
I have the chance to do that now.

185
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm happy.

186
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,600
You should be happy too, okay?

187
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
How much will you need

188
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,320
to start that online shop with Zhu Lin?

189
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,320
You're worried about that?

190
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,720
I've been thinking about this for a while.

191
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,480
I saved money every month.

192
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,960
Besides my rent and living expenses,

193
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,360
I gave half

194
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,080
of my monthly pay to my mom

195
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,240
and I saved the other half.

196
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,520
I've thought about it before.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,560
One day, when you agree to be with me,

198
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,920
I definitely have to resign.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,040
Whether I find another job

200
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,840
or start my own business,

201
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,400
I must have some savings, right?

202
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
Didn't I plan it well?

203
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,640
Aren't I very smart and reliable?

204
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,960
How much did you make per month?

205
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,920
You have to give your mom money

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,040
and pay the rent.

207
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,360
How much can you save up?

208
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,720
Starting a business costs a lot.
Do you have enough? Don't lie to me.

209
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't worry.

210
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,240
The government supports
young entrepreneurs now.

211
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,760
We're already looking
into policies and protocols.

212
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,040
We can get a loan without interest.

213
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,800
We'll figure it out.

214
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,360
Promise me.

215
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,320
No matter what hardships come your way,

216
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,480
don't hide it from me.

217
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,920
I can face any hardships.

218
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,640
I even managed to get you.

219
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
What a smooth talker.

220
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,280
If you really feel like you owe me,

221
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,080
pay me back tonight then.

222
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,440
You wish.

223
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
You're still as conservative as ever.

224
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,920
I mean

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
I made plans for tonight.

226
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,560
What were you thinking?

227
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,120
Tonight, after work,

228
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,080
come to Zhu Lin's place.

229
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,640
Let me be your boyfriend

230
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,040
and surprise you.

231
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,080
A good surprise or a bad one?

232
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,480
I can't tell you yet.

233
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,280
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a surprise.

234
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,880
Anyway, don't work overtime.

235
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,480
Come and find me earlier.

236
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Okay.

237
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
But miss…

238
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,440
If I want to do something else,

239
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,920
would it be impossible?

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,240
Just eat your food.

241
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,200
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

242
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,400
I should really thank Ruoxin.

243
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,120
If she didn't agree to it,

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,920
I'd still have to wait for you.

245
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,320
I was wondering

246
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,240
why you asked me about the loan.

247
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,520
It won't be a loss for you
to wait for me forever.

248
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
To be honest,

249
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,400
we really need to plan this carefully.

250
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,080
If we work together,

251
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,320
you can't just add to my designs.

252
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,960
You'll have to make
your own accessory set.

253
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
Preferably approachable ones.

254
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,280
It'll help with the sales.

255
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,240
That's what I thought.

256
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,000
And you can't rely on
your friends' recommendations.

257
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
Resources are limited.

258
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,960
We have to make an online shop.

259
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,480
An online shop?

260
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,520
I don't know.

261
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,440
You've done it before.

262
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,360
Then you handle it. I'll coordinate.

263
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,360
No problem.

264
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,640
There are two parts to it.

265
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,360
One is the cost of shop design.

266
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,480
The other one is for the operation.

267
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
Online and offline.

268
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
Let's do the numbers first.

269
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,920
Then I can apply for
the interest-free loan.

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,120
No problem.

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
By the way,

272
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,560
I've prepared a workshop for you.

273
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,600
What do you think? I'm sincere, right?

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
You're so efficient.

275
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,040
Ruoxin is here.

276
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,240
I'll let you two talk. I'll get going.

277
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,200
- Thank you.
- Bye.

278
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,200
Bye.

279
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,800
Miss, do you want to check out

280
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
my future workshop?

281
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,720
Are you already done?

282
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,359
I have a rough idea.

283
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,880
Let's go and take a look. Let's go.

284
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,680
Here. This is it.

285
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,319
Let me tell you my ideas.

286
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,640
In the future,

287
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,079
I will put my desk here.

288
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,960
And here, I want a really big mirror.

289
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
It'll seem more spacious.

290
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,520
But this mirror has to be well-designed.

291
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
What do you think?

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,240
That's good.

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
What are you thinking about?

294
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,840
You're about to start your new life.

295
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,680
There's an empty seat at the office.

296
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,320
I still can't get used to it.

297
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,800
So you missed me.

298
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,440
I just need the HR Department

299
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,600
to get me a new assistant.

300
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,680
Only females. No males.

301
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,320
If I think about how you'll be working

302
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,680
with someone else instead of me,

303
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,320
I won't be able to take it.

304
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
Fine.

305
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I'll tell them I want a female assistant.

306
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,960
That's better.

307
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
Miss, do you want to guess

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,760
my plan for later?

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,640
I don't want to guess.

310
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,200
I won't guess.

311
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,640
I just want a debrief.

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,840
Boss.

313
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,800
I've made a reservation
at a popular restaurant.

314
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
And they have…

315
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,080
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,800
It's the office.

317
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,240
Hello.

318
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,680
Hello, Ruoxin.

319
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I just sent you the client's information.

320
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
They are in the process of installing

321
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,320
and going to install the charger.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,240
I'm coming.

323
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,080
I'll tell you the priority.

324
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,600
Contact these clients as soon as possible.

325
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
I guess we have to cancel it.

326
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,120
Give me some time.

327
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,720
I'll take care of it, okay?

328
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
I knew it.

329
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,440
Even though I left,

330
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,880
the charging station problem
wasn't solved.

331
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,440
Liu Pei and Ruan Ye
will do anything to get to you.

332
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,120
Now that I've left,

333
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,640
I'm worried about you.

334
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
Why are you talking like an old person?

335
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,400
You sound like my mom.

336
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,880
Don't worry.

337
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I won't give them the chance.

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,720
About the charging station,

339
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,120
I'm sure they'll set you up again.

340
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,440
Have you found a solution?

341
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Can I help you with anything?

342
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,160
I have a plan.

343
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,000
You should worry about yourself first.

344
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,760
After I solve this problem,

345
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
I'll find a way to fight back.

346
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,040
I'll show them

347
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,040
why they shouldn't look down on me.

348
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,840
I'll prove to them

349
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,040
that they messed with the wrong person.

350
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,560
How assertive.

351
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,280
I'm smarter than them.

352
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,280
I never messed with you

353
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,840
and I never will in the future.

354
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,640
Am I that scary?

355
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,880
I won't mess with you

356
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,320
because I'll love you even more
in the future.

357
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,120
You can't take that back.

358
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,840
Never.

359
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,320
I don't think we can go

360
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,760
to that restaurant tonight.

361
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,000
I still have a lot of emails to check.

362
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,720
And there's also
a video conference call later.

363
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,320
It's okay.

364
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,680
We'll both do our work.

365
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
I need time to sort my ideas out.

366
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,800
But before that,

367
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
do you want to see the gift?

368
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,080
What gift?

369
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,800
Hold on.

370
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
I know.

371
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,560
Although

372
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,000
this diamond is a bit small,

373
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,600
I'll give you one every year.

374
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,920
And I promise,

375
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
every year,

376
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
the diamonds will get bigger.

377
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,200
Qi Xiao.

378
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,640
This isn't why I'm with you.

379
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,760
You just started your own business.

380
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
You'll need the money.

381
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,920
So tomorrow,

382
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,880
return this necklace.

383
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
I know you're not vain.

384
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,640
But I just want to prove

385
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,160
that I can give you the best.

386
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
The best thing you can give me

387
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,000
is right here.

388
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,760
And this.

389
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,400
To me, these are

390
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,560
more important than diamonds.

391
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,920
Su Yang.

392
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,960
Come here.

393
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
- What's wrong?
- Take a look at this.

394
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,960
Which one do you like better?

395
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,240
Aren't you going to sell
that popular bracelet?

396
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,160
Well, I was going to

397
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,880
and I think it'll sell well.

398
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
But that one

399
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,800
lacks a designer icon.

400
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,320
Tiffany comes to mind
when you think of the key.

401
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,600
For four-leaf clovers,

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,320
you'll think of Van Cleef & Arpels.

403
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
So we need to make our own brand
known to people first.

404
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,600
That's ambitious.

405
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,240
I like this one.

406
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
But my opinion doesn't matter.

407
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm not your customer.

408
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
You can ask Ruoxin.

409
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
She's busy with work.

410
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,640
I don't want to bother her.

411
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,560
Why don't you ask Sijia?

412
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
She's a girl.

413
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,320
She might like accessories.

414
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,560
- I'll go wash up then.
- Okay.

415
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,760
HELP ME. WHICH ONE DO YOU PREFER?

416
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,040
QI XIAO

417
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Hello, Qi Xiao.

418
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,800
I don't like

419
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,280
any of the ones you sent me.

420
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,040
When you're choosing a piece of jewelry,

421
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,080
what would you usually go for?

422
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,400
I think for women,

423
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
if it's just pretty,

424
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,400
it might be left forgotten
in the jewelry box soon.

425
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>Usually, people will choose the ones</i>

426
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
<i>with implications or symbols.</i>

427
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,040
<i>For example,
I saw a pair of earrings once.</i>

428
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,400
<i>The design was interesting.</i>

429
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,360
<i>The design was sound waves.</i>

430
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,560
The left one says, "I love you."

431
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,080
The right one says, "forever."

432
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
If combined, it's "I love you forever."

433
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
<i>They are earrings.</i>

434
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,760
<i>You can customize them.</i>

435
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,040
Since everyone's voice is different,

436
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,160
you have to record your boyfriend's voice

437
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,520
and send it to the shop owner.

438
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,880
They are fully booked in a month.

439
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I see.

440
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,200
You mean,

441
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,960
if there's a meaning to the jewelry,

442
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,960
girls might like it more, right?

443
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,560
<i>But it needs to have my mark on it</i>

444
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,320
and it needs to be symbolic too.

445
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,000
It's a bit difficult.

446
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,320
Shouldn't you be inspired?

447
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,240
You're so lovey-dovey with Ruoxin.

448
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,080
You must be feeling inspired right now.

449
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,000
You're right.

450
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Okay, I'll think about it. Thank you.

451
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,720
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

452
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
HOW TO CHARGE

453
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,360
CHARGING STATION CUSTOMER SERVICE

454
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,320
Mr. Xu, are you busy?

455
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
I have something to discuss with you
regarding work.

456
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,040
The thing is,

457
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,160
I'd like to talk to my team tomorrow

458
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,680
<i>and visit our clients door-to-door.</i>

459
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,240
<i>We'll ask them
about the use and installation.</i>

460
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,880
I plan on starting
with our recent clients.

461
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,360
But after counting,

462
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,320
we're a little shorthanded right now.

463
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,480
So I was wondering

464
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,320
if you can ask the headquarters

465
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,040
to lend us three people

466
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,880
<i>for just a few days?</i>

467
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes.

468
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,920
I'll arrange it now.

469
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,880
They'll be there tomorrow.

470
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,160
Great. Thank you, Mr. Xu.

471
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
Ruoxin.

472
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,600
This is a good idea.

473
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,960
But you have to contact the PR Department
and arrange the interview.

474
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,760
Don't worry. I've already contacted them.

475
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,440
I know I can trust you.

476
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,480
Liu Pei will cause trouble.

477
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I knew it when I left.

478
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,760
It's a no-brainer.

479
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,760
He must have
a lot of tricks up his sleeve.

480
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,560
<i>You're very enduring.</i>

481
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
<i>I've never heard you complain.</i>

482
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
When you're tired of him

483
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,360
and want to be at the headquarters…

484
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
I've told you this before,

485
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
you can just ask me.

486
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
He's the leader after all.

487
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,240
If he gives me a hard time,

488
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I'll just deal with whatever comes my way.

489
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,400
It's work.

490
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,200
There's always a different problem.

491
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,080
I can't keep running away.

492
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,000
If I run away,

493
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,880
he might get someone else instead.

494
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,320
Isn't that right?

495
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,840
<i>Shanghai is our major market after all.</i>

496
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,400
I must defend our home ground.

497
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,520
There'll always be solutions.

498
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,000
You're a heroine.

499
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Good luck.

500
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,360
Thank you, sir. I'll do my best.

501
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,680
Bye.

502
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
Say something.

503
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,720
Hold on, Boss.

504
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,120
After the news was released,

505
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,560
more people have come to ask
about the new energy.

506
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,040
No matter how our salespeople

507
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,440
tried to compare it to traditional cars,

508
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,680
we couldn't change their minds.

509
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,360
The people who are looking for
new energy vehicles…

510
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,920
It's like they have been brainwashed.

511
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,520
Besides, our salespeople

512
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,840
can only give them hints.

513
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,840
But we can't go too far.

514
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,640
If the New Energy Department finds out,

515
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,480
that'll be bad.

516
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,880
Okay, I got it.

517
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
Do what you have to do. You may leave.

518
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,960
Okay, I'll get going then.

519
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,600
Go ahead.

520
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
What are you doing here?

521
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,800
Mr. Liu.

522
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Did you see the satisfaction rate?

523
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,000
It's this big.

524
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
How can I not see?

525
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,720
Mr. Liu, Shen Ruoxin made her comeback.

526
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,400
She'll only get more arrogant now.

527
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
During the last meeting,

528
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,400
the way she talks…

529
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,400
It's like she's on the same level as you.

530
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,880
Liu Pei.

531
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
You were too softhearted.

532
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,600
That's why she didn't get fired.

533
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,800
And now?

534
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,080
Your problem has grown bigger.

535
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,320
Tea.

536
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,360
You're great now, aren't you?

537
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,640
You're telling me how to do things.

538
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,080
Liu Pei, you…

539
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,480
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't dare!

540
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,480
We can't touch her now.

541
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,960
Xu Minjie will defend her.

542
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,840
We have to find a way.

543
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,280
So that even Xu Minjie
won't be able to save her.

544
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,120
He wouldn't do this for a woman.
He has his concerns.

545
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,520
This is a large company.

546
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,880
He's risking his career and his prestige

547
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,720
to protect Shen Ruoxin.

548
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,360
He has to think if it's worth it or not.

549
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,520
If you come across any problem,

550
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,480
please call us right away.

551
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,600
Thank you so much.

552
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,920
I didn't expect that you'd come here.

553
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,200
I thought after selling us the car,
you wouldn't care anymore.

554
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
I have a colleague

555
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,600
who bought a new energy vehicle.

556
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,960
It's from another company.

557
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,320
It took forever because of the charger.

558
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
What a pain.

559
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,360
Good thing I bought the car from you.

560
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,280
It's our mission
to take care of our clients.

561
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,200
Don't worry.

562
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,360
We'll keep perfecting
our after-sales service.

563
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,240
You can give us feedback.

564
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,080
Our service is open 24 hours a day.

565
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
That's great.

566
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,760
Thank you again.

567
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,800
I'll leave you to it.

568
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,760
- Okay.
- Take care.

569
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,680
- Bye.
- Take care.

570
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,680
Bye.

571
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,120
Ms. Shen, you should go and rest too.

572
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,320
It's the last one today.

573
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,040
We'll follow up with the clients.

574
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,800
You don't have to do it yourself.

575
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,640
Customer service is very important.

576
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
We mustn't slack off.

577
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,520
You've been working hard lately. Let's go.

578
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,720
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

579
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,440
<i>- Hello?
</i>- Are you at the workshop?

580
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm finally done with work today.

581
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,600
No, Zhu Lin is busy today.

582
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,960
I didn't go.

583
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,840
My female warrior,

584
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,280
what do you want to eat today?

585
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,040
I'll make you a delicious meal.

586
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,160
I want Sichuan boiled fish and <i>mapo</i> tofu.

587
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,200
I want to eat spicy food
so much right now.

588
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,000
We're telepathic.

589
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,840
I just bought some fish today.

590
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
You gluttonous cat.

591
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,120
Really?

592
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,680
I'll go home now.

593
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,520
Let's have a feast.

594
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,960
Okay. Drive safely.

595
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,120
You're already home?

596
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,240
Dinner is ready.

597
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,000
Ms. Zhou.

598
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,840
What's happening?
The smell is suffocating me.

599
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,760
Qi Xiao.

600
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
Why are you in my house?

601
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,720
Where's Shen Ruoxin?

602
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
Ruoxin.

603
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,680
She went downstairs to buy something.

604
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,720
She doesn't know how to make boiled fish.

605
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,440
So I came up here to do it for her.

606
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,280
When this girl comes up here,

607
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
I will give her a good scolding.

608
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
Between business and personal life,

609
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,440
this is a serious violation.

610
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,600
Why--

611
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,720
Why are you so easy to be manipulated?

612
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,000
Why would you do
whatever she asks you to do?

613
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,080
Ms. Zhou.

614
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm happy to help Ruoxin.

615
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,120
Besides, it's my job.

616
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,080
It's burning me up.

617
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,360
The range hood is turned off.

618
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,520
I got it.

619
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,960
Ms. Zhou, get some rest. I'll do it.

620
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
- Turn it on.
- Okay.

621
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,760
I'm back.

622
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,320
Mom.

623
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,199
You're all dressed up
just to go buy things?

624
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,480
My co-worker asked for a document,

625
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,120
so I went out.

626
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,840
And I have a headache,

627
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,360
so I bought some painkillers.

628
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,880
You don't even have
medicine for headaches?

629
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,760
I'll buy it for you at the pharmacy.

630
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
No, Mom.

631
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,960
It's convenient to buy stuff downstairs.

632
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,840
- Xinxin.
- Yes?

633
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,000
If you want to eat something, tell me.

634
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,000
Don't bother Qi Xiao with it.

635
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,560
You're wasting his time.

636
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,800
Ms. Zhou, it's fine.

637
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
It didn't take long.

638
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,440
I want to eat fish.

639
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,040
- He happened to have bought one.
- Yes.

640
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,280
So I thought

641
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,560
it's convenient.

642
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,880
He bought the fish?

643
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,840
- Yes.
- Did you pay for it?

644
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,440
Qi Xiao, I'll pay for it via WeChat.

645
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
Ms. Zhou.

646
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,360
It has been paid.

647
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,720
Right?

648
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,200
Yes, through WeChat.

649
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,640
You already paid?

650
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
- Yes, I did.
- She did.

651
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,720
That's good.

652
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,560
Anything else?

653
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
No, it's nothing.

654
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
Your mom told me

655
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,880
that you don't even like spicy food.

656
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,520
Why are these two dishes so spicy?

657
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,240
Right, Ms. Zhou.

658
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,160
I've prepared something not spicy

659
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,200
downstairs.

660
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,600
I'll go downstairs then.

661
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,360
Enjoy your meal.

662
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,560
Go and see your mom when you have time.

663
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
She really wants to take
my calligraphy class.

664
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,240
But it's full for this semester.

665
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,760
I'll keep a spot for her next semester.

666
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,280
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

667
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,720
Bye, Ms. Zhou.

668
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,040
- Mom, I'll walk him out.
- Okay.

669
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Take care.

670
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,320
Qi Xiao, thank you for everything.

671
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,640
Don't mention it, Ruoxin.

672
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
Thank you for today.

673
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,680
<i>How pathetic.</i>

674
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,960
That was unlucky.

675
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,160
Do you want to go out and eat?

676
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,920
Forget it.

677
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,560
I just ate.

678
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,720
Did she leave?

679
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,200
Yes.

680
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,640
She needs some documents.

681
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,840
I helped her and printed it for her.

682
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,680
That was terrifying.

683
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,280
What are you afraid of?

684
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,520
Are you feeling guilty?

685
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,800
My mom won't eat you.

686
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
You're making me nervous.

687
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
Our relationship has changed.

688
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,800
I wasn't prepared.

689
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,040
It was too sudden.

690
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,880
It felt like
we're getting caught red-handed.

691
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Ruoxin.</i>

692
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,680
<i>It's about the additional clause
we asked the Legal Department to draft.</i>

693
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
<i>Mr. Ruan just told me.</i>

694
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>This clause should still be covered by us</i>

695
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>because the new energy vehicles
are more complicated</i>

696
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,200
<i>than the fuel vehicles.</i>

697
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,320
<i>He thought they might overlook something.</i>

698
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
<i>So any possible problem that may occur</i>

699
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,160
<i>and the responsibility,</i>

700
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,320
<i>we have to make them clear
in the additional clauses.</i>

701
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
<i>He also said that</i>

702
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,720
<i>you were a legal officer before.</i>

703
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,080
<i>You'll know what to do with these terms.</i>

704
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,400
He just doesn't want to take
the responsibility.

705
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,360
It's supposed to be their job.

706
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,920
<i>What should I tell him?</i>

707
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,080
Just tell them

708
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,960
to make a draft and I'll revise it.

709
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
<i>Okay.</i>

710
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,440
What's wrong?

711
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,840
Did Ruan Ye cause trouble again?

712
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,080
He's just a brownnoser.

713
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,480
He knows that Liu Pei is picking on us.

714
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,160
So he's taking every chance
to give me more trouble.

715
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,360
But don't worry.

716
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,360
Since you told him last time

717
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,200
that Liu Pei will retire in two years,

718
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
he wouldn't dare to go too far.

719
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,600
I should just mind my own business.

720
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,320
Liu Pei is the manager after all.

721
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,920
It's his territory.

722
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,360
If he's after you,

723
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,640
it must be hard for you.

724
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,360
I wish he'd retire soon.

725
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,960
There must be another way.

726
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
I already have something in mind.

727
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,920
Their domineering will come to an end.

728
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,400
Are you serious?

729
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,920
So you're the famous

730
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,680
Lady Wei Yingluo.

731
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,080
Yingluo.

732
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,200
Look, your mom already went home.

733
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,320
We don't have to eat out anymore.

734
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,920
Let's eat at your place, okay?

735
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
We can't.

736
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,160
I have work to do.

737
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
You're already leaving?

738
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
Hello, Mr. Xu.

739
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,680
I'd like to report our status to you.

740
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,320
Nicely done, Ruoxin.

741
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,880
You solved a public relations crisis.

742
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,240
And our new energy vehicle
has gained popularity in the market.

743
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,240
Good job.

744
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,800
Thank you for what you did.

745
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,040
You sent help from the headquarters.

746
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,720
After what happened,

747
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,120
I've thought about it a lot.

748
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,440
About how to develop
the follow-up for our department.

749
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,480
I want to have
a detailed conversation with you.

750
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,400
Okay. Tell me.

751
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,400
<i>We'll start with
the new energy vehicle sales.</i>

752
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,120
New energy vehicles are very different.

753
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,640
Our salespeople understand everything
about our new energy vehicles.

754
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,600
If the sales are mixed up,

755
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,080
they will affect each other

756
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,520
and lead to mistakes.

757
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,680
<i>It will eventually become
a management chaos.</i>

758
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
So what do you suggest?

759
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,760
<i>We can split it into two.</i>

760
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,360
First, the traditional sales.

761
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,360
Mr. Liu can still be in charge of it.

762
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
As for our department,

763
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,200
we can set up our own sales department.

764
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,800
<i>We can ask the headquarters
to send another manager.</i>

765
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,480
That's an interesting suggestion.

766
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,040
How about this?

767
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,760
In tomorrow's meeting,

768
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,520
I'll mention it to everyone.

769
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

770
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,400
Next is about

771
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,360
the Legal Department in Shanghai.

772
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,240
They're used to working with Mr. Liu

773
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,400
on the business of traditional vehicles.

774
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,600
They don't really understand
the new energy vehicles.

775
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,160
We have difficulties
working with each other.

776
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
So I think there are two solutions.

777
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,680
Either we improve their skills

778
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,280
or we'll hire new legal officers

779
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,120
<i>who specialize in
our new energy vehicle contracts.</i>

780
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,360
I'll think about that.

781
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,040
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

782
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,640
There's nothing else.

783
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,600
<i>Ruoxin.</i>

784
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,920
<i>You know exactly what the problems are.</i>

785
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,920
Your solutions are viable

786
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,560
and also effective.

787
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,000
I was right about you.

788
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,120
<i>Good luck.</i>

789
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,200
I'll keep working hard.
