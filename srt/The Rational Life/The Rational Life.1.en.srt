1
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Sijia.

2
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,520
- What's the matter?
<i>- Hello, Ruoxin.</i>

3
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,400
<i>Regarding the self-ignition
case yesterday,</i>

4
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>Mr. Ruan just came here personally</i>

5
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
and took all the information
of the car owner Jin Yuanhao.

6
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
He said Mr. Liu gave him the case

7
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,280
and told him to continue working on it.

8
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,600
He even told you to speak to Mr. Liu
if you can't accept it.

9
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
I just contacted

10
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,480
the car owner Jin Yuanhao yesterday
about this case.

11
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
He just calmed down

12
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,040
and acknowledged our sincerity
and how we're handling it.

13
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
But he posted something online
this morning.

14
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,600
Mr. Liu didn't like it.

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
<i>What did he post?</i>

16
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
I've sent it to your phone.

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,200
THE SCARY 24 HOURS AFTER
MY ZENPRO CAR SELF-IGNITED

18
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,520
<i>They are asking Jin Yuanhao
to come to the office.</i>

19
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,920
Sijia, send me the hospital address,

20
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
name, and room number

21
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,600
of Jin Yuanhao's wife now.

22
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,960
Okay, I'll send it now.

23
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
- Get out of the car.
- What are you doing?

24
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
I'm in a hurry. Can we talk next time?

25
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
No. Get out now.

26
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,320
- No. What are you doing?
- Miss, are you going or not?

27
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
She's not. Give me the bill.

28
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
Here.

29
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,880
Get out.

30
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,640
You still want to run away?

31
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,040
Didn't you come to ask for the money?

32
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,360
I don't have money.
You can kill me if you want.

33
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Luoluo.

34
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Over the past year,
didn't we work well together?

35
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Our online shop is so close to succeeding.

36
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
Why did you disappear?

37
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,200
And you took all the money
from the account without a word.

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,400
What exactly is going on?
Tell me if there's a problem.

39
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
I'll definitely help you.

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,000
Can you consider your half
of the investment as a loan to me?

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,760
- I'm giving up the shop.
- Why?

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Wait, we had an agreement.
I'll design, you'll operate.

43
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
I've decided.

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,960
I can't be apart from my boyfriend.

45
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,880
I can't stand long-distance relationships.
I'll go with him to study abroad.

46
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,400
Hello, can I help you?

47
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,200
Hi, I would like a fruit basket
for a patient.

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,320
- Okay, wait a moment.
- Thank you.

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
Hello, what's going on?

50
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,440
Ruoxin.

51
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,440
I went to your desk earlier
and noticed that you're not here yet.

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,400
I left the pork with century egg
porridge on your table.

53
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,520
Haven't I already told you?
I don't like porridge.

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
I'm in the middle of something.
I have to go.

55
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
<i>No, Ruoxin.</i>

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,560
I booked a French restaurant tonight.

57
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,280
Let's have dinner together.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,880
It's Ziyan's birthday today.

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,600
I promised to eat with her.

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
Ziyan can spend her birthday
with her husband.

61
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,040
Why are you going with them?

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,200
Right. Which restaurant
will you be going to?

63
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,360
Cui Lixin.

64
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm having dinner with my best friend.

65
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,560
Do you need to ask for all the details?

66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,600
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,280
He broke up with you so many times.

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,920
He's unreliable, you know?

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
To put it nicely,
you're accompanying him to study abroad.

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,600
To put it bluntly, you'll be his maid.

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,360
If something happens abroad,
you're so far away. Who can help you?

72
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,160
Don't talk about him this way.

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm going with him anyway.

74
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,600
Even if you've decided,

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,640
shouldn't you discuss
closing the shop with me?

76
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
You took my half of the money.
Shouldn't you ask for my permission first?

77
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
Luoluo, don't be rash.

78
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,680
Don't be emotional.

79
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Reconsider closing the shop--

80
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,400
Luoluo, stop!

81
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,160
<i>Ruoxin, the truth is,</i>

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,600
today is our anniversary.

83
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,600
<i>I want to spend a romantic time with you.</i>

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,200
<i>- I want--</i>
- I'm really busy. I have to go.

85
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,000
<i>Don't. When are you coming back
to the office?</i>

86
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I'm sorry, how much is it?

87
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,440
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
My fruit basket.

89
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,080
Stop running.

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,480
Let me go!

91
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Luoluo.

92
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,800
I think I've been very good to you.
And I didn't do you wrong.

93
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,560
It's over. I have nothing to say to you.

94
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,880
Can you two talk later?

95
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,040
- Let's talk about my fruit basket, okay?
- Be quiet. I'll pay you later.

96
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
It's over? I don't agree.

97
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,920
Luoluo, reconsider closing the shop.

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Miss, help me.

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
- Let me go!
- No.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
We need to clear things up today.

101
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,600
You're a guy,
yet you keep grabbing a girl.

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,120
Aren't you being too rough?

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,120
Who are you, ma'am?
How is this your business?

104
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Who are you calling "ma'am"?

105
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,840
What? Why are you filming me?

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
According to our country's law,

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,080
chasing, stopping, and insulting
can be considered disorderly behavior.

108
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
Don't be scared, miss.

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,160
If you encounter a clingy man,

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
you can call the police.

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
Call the police?

112
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,080
I'm the one who should call the police.
Ask her yourself.

113
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
- Thank you, miss.
- Luoluo!

114
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't go.

115
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,960
What about my fruit basket?

116
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,920
What's wrong with you?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,880
You don't know anything.
Why are you interfering?

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
Do you want to hit me?

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,920
According to the Public Security
Administration Punishments Law,

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
you can be detained for over 5 days
and under 10 days

121
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,840
for willful and malicious injury.

122
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,200
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because I work in legal affairs.

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,000
It's the law of this country.

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,200
All right, consider me unlucky.

125
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,800
I won't argue with you. Move.

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,040
What are you doing? Give me my phone.

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
Replace my fruit basket
and I'll return your phone.

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
Go on.

129
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
CUI LIXIN

130
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,200
Here.

131
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,480
You're pretty fast.

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Here you go.

133
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,920
You can go now.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
But let me remind you.

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,200
Leave that girl alone.

136
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,200
Relationships can't be forced.

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,640
The more you bother her,
the more she'll hate you.

138
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I don't want to explain.

139
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
Hold on.

140
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,760
What now?

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,240
You've already paid for the fruit basket,
so the fruits on the floor are yours.

142
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
Pick them up. Don't waste them.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
Be a civilized person.

<i>Does it provide insurance

<i>How much is the monthly salary?</i>

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,080

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,440
What's the big deal?

178
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
Who says we can't go to the Bund?

179
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,280
Let's go there.

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Come in.

181
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
You are…

182
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Hello.

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm Shen Ruoxin, the legal representative
of Zenpro Automotive.

184
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
I came on behalf of the company.

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,080
I hope you get well soon.

186
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,080
Mrs. Jin.

187
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,360
How are you doing?

188
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,000
Are you recovering well?

189
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Don't worry.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,760
Our company promised

191
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,840
to pay for your hospital bills.

192
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,840
I met with Mr. Jin yesterday
and talked to him.

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,960
He briefly told me what happened.

194
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,920
We're very regretful and apologetic.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,840
But the test results aren't out yet.

196
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,400
So we still don't know

197
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,960
what caused the car to self-ignite.

198
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,760
You don't know?

199
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,240
Isn't it obvious?

200
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
Of course it's your car's quality issue.

201
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
How can you not even tell at this point?

202
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,160
- Mrs. Jin--
- In the car, I almost…

203
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,520
I almost died, you know?

204
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,120
- Mrs. Jin.
- I'm a woman.

205
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,560
I have burn marks all over.

206
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,920
How can I face people during summer?

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
Don't be sad, Mrs. Jin.

208
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,840
Calm down.

209
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm really sorry.

210
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,600
I came here today

211
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,360
to find out what happened.

212
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,680
That way, it'll solve the problem faster.

213
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,400
So let me analyze it for you.

214
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,280
Indeed, the engine malfunctioned.

215
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,720
But a lot of factors
can cause the malfunction,

216
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,960
like getting water in the engine
or the like.

217
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,160
A while ago,

218
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,200
there was a rainstorm in Shanghai.

219
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,800
Many areas were flooded.

220
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
I don't know

221
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,280
if perhaps accidentally, you didn't notice

222
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,800
that the car was parked in a flooded area

223
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,720
and it was accidentally immersed in water.

224
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,200
That could also cause
a problem with the engine.

225
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,920
I don't think you can say that.

226
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,760
You can't say

227
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
that we misused the car

228
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,880
and caused this accident ourselves.

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Then tell me.

230
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,280
All right, on a rainy day,
there are so many cars on the road.

231
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,160
Why were the other cars fine?

232
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Why was it just this car?

233
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,680
Why did such a big accident
occur in this car?

234
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,920
I understand, Mrs. Jin.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
Don't worry. It's just a hypothesis.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
We can use the elimination method.

237
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,080
That way, we can solve the problem
faster and better, right?

238
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Okay.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm telling you this responsibly.

240
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,120
Our parking garage

241
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
was not flooded.

242
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
Hello, Mom.

243
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,680
I'll be home soon.

244
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,320
What's the matter? Do you miss me?

245
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Son, hurry.

246
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,240
Come home.

247
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,160
The new pressure cooker kept
making sounds. Now, it's quiet.

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,160
But I don't dare to touch it.

249
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,360
How should I open it?

250
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,320
Why are you using a pressure cooker?

251
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,640
<i>Mr. Ji brought a free-range chicken
from his hometown.</i>

252
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
<i>Since you're coming home today,</i>

253
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,760
<i>I made it for your nourishment.</i>

254
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,080
See if all the steam
has been released then.

255
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,360
Steam?

256
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,760
How do you release that?

257
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>Is the safety valve lifted or not?</i>

258
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,960
<i>If not, get something to lift it.</i>

259
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,960
Which one is the safety valve?

260
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,560
The black thing on the lid.

261
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
I see it.

262
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,200
But it's not moving now.

263
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,240
Don't touch it.

264
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,560
Turn it off and be very careful.
I'll teach you when I get back.

265
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,800
Be good.

266
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
I'll be right home. Bye.

267
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,560
MOM

268
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,840
- Hey.
- <i>I texted you so many times this morning.</i>

269
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,560
<i>Why didn't you reply at all?</i>

270
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,840
How many times have I told you?

271
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,880
Don't send 60-second voice messages
so early in the morning.

272
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,720
I can't listen to all of them
while I'm driving.

273
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
<i>Okay, I'll tell you now.</i>

274
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,280
<i>I went to a wedding exhibition yesterday.</i>

275
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,480
<i>There's a good wedding company.</i>

276
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,240
<i>They plan a lot of celebrity weddings.</i>

277
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,040
<i>I put down a deposit for you.</i>

278
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,040
<i>When are you going to call Xiaocui out?</i>

279
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,000
<i>Let's discuss it together.</i>

280
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,240
Mom!

281
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,320
Cui Lixin and I have only been dating
for three months.

282
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,320
We're not at the point of marriage yet.

283
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,320
<i>You've been dating for three months,</i>

284
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,000
<i>but aren't you colleagues?</i>

285
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,240
<i>Don't you know each other for years?</i>

286
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
<i>Xinxin.</i>

287
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,280
<i>You're already 33.</i>

288
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,320
I've reached the office, Mom.
I have to go.

289
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,000
<i>Hey, I'm not done yet.</i>

290
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,640
Ms. Shen.

291
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,480
Ms. Shen.

292
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,600
Ms. Shen.

293
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,000
- Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

294
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
Ms. Shen.

295
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,680
Ruoxin, Mr. Liu just came to see you.

296
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
He wants to see you as soon as you arrive.

297
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,080
He didn't look pleased.

298
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,400
They already know
that you went to the hospital.

299
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,720
Any news from the Self-Ignition
Inspection Department?

300
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,200
It hasn't been thoroughly tested.

301
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,120
- I think they'll need a few more days.
- Ms. Shen.

302
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,680
Mr. Liu wants you in his office now.

303
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
All right.

304
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
Ruoxin.

305
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,520
Mr. Ruan is still in Mr. Liu's office.

306
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Okay.

307
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,520
Miss.

308
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
You're an intern, right?

309
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,840
Are you the Legal Department's intern

310
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,200
or Shen Ruoxin's intern?

311
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm an intern hired by Ms. Shen
for the Legal Department.

312
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,840
Mr. Liu.

313
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,560
You met Jin Yuanhao's wife
at the hospital?

314
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,680
Yes.

315
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,800
I just visited her, we have a good chat.

316
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,720
I reported here as soon as I got back.

317
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,000
Good chat?

318
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,360
Did you see the online post?

319
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,000
Shen Ruoxin, do you know

320
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,720
how hard I worked all afternoon

321
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
before Jin Yuanhao
deleted the online post?

322
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,080
As for you,

323
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,640
fish for information
from Jin Yuanhao's wife.

324
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,800
You're good.

325
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,000
Mr. Liu.

326
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,760
When Jin Yuanhao found out about this,
he was so mad at me.

327
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,120
He almost turned
our conference table over.

328
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,080
It took a lot of convincing
to calm him down.

329
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,760
I don't think you convinced him.

330
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,880
You must have agreed to all his demands.

331
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,520
All right, Mr. Jin.

332
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,120
That's all for today.

333
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,360
We have received

334
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,040
all your requests.

335
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,520
But please understand.

336
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,920
I have to report to my bosses after all

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,560
before I can let you know.

338
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,280
Okay.

339
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
I hope

340
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,560
you can talk to your boss clearly.

341
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,560
Okay.

342
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,119
We've discussed it earlier.

343
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,680
During this period of time,

344
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,480
can you delete the online post?

345
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,920
The case was not
investigated clearly yet after all.

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
What do you think?

347
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,000
That's not a big deal.

348
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,760
If this matter is settled well,

349
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,320
I won't treat you shabbily.

350
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,040
Mr. Liu.

351
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,000
From what I know about this case,

352
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,840
it's not that simple.

353
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,360
Not that simple?

354
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,760
Why do you think so?

355
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
A woman's intuition?

356
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
You're quite funny.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,960
From my conversation
with Jin Yuanhao yesterday

358
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,120
and his wife today,

359
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,840
I can make a professional judgment.

360
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,240
Whatever.

361
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,840
That's enough.

362
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Stop arguing.

363
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,360
I'm telling you.

364
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,400
If Jin Yuanhao doesn't delete
his online post,

365
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,400
there's no point for us
to release any statements.

366
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,640
Shen Ruoxin, I really think
that you have long hair but short sight.

367
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,160
Ruan Ye!

368
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,040
Ruoxin.

369
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,320
This matter has become a big deal.

370
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,240
It's very bad for the company
and our reputation.

371
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,440
So in principle,

372
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,080
we must settle
with Jin Yuanhao right away.

373
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
As for the settlement amount,

374
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,200
it will depend
on how much evidence we have.

375
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,840
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

376
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll investigate this quickly.

377
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,560
I'll give you two more days.

378
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,880
But after two days,

379
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,840
Ruan Ye will be in charge.
You can't get involved anymore.

380
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,880
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.

381
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,360
For the benefit of the company,
I'll do my best.

382
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
Okay, I trust you.

383
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Ruoxin.

384
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,400
Have you eaten the pork
with century egg porridge I bought you?

385
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
How many times have I told you?

386
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,240
I don't like porridge.

387
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,280
You'll starve
if you keep skipping breakfast.

388
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,680
Look, your hand is so cold.

389
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,400
Cui Lixin, how many times have I told you?

390
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,080
We're at work. Don't be so touchy-feely.

391
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,240
You're so touchy-feely at work
early in the morning.

392
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
An office romance?

393
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,760
Mr. Ruan, you…

394
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,360
I'm here to see Mr. Liu.

395
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,280
Mr. Liu is waiting for you. Go.

396
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,040
- Okay.
- Mr. Cui.

397
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
You'll have to work hard
on your sales performance next month.

398
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
Yes.

399
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,200
Remember to eat the porridge.

400
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,920
Hurry up.

401
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
Ruoxin.

402
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
Look at Mr. Cui.

403
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,280
He's not that good in sales

404
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,560
and he doesn't make much.

405
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,480
But still, he's a sales manager.

406
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,040
He's quite suitable for you.

407
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,560
So don't be so fierce.

408
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,520
You have to be gentle like water.

409
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Mr. Ruan, are we close?

410
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,960
Yes.

411
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,800
I know you're a long-time employee
of the company.

412
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,480
The Legal Director position

413
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,800
should most likely be yours.

414
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,800
But since I joined the company,

415
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,520
yes, it doesn't feel good
and you have an issue with me.

416
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,200
I completely understand.
But it has been three months.

417
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,600
You should already be used to it.

418
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
Of course, I hope

419
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
that the Legal Department can be united

420
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,000
and you'll also cooperate with me well.

421
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
Mr. Ruan.

422
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,040
First, we're both senior managers
of the Legal Department.

423
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,640
We should be united
and cooperate with each other.

424
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
Second,

425
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,640
it has been seven years
since I graduated and joined the company.

426
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,920
I've seen countless colleagues
come and go.

427
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,280
I've always been professional about it.

428
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,720
You're not an exception.

429
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,120
There's no conflict between us.

430
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Third,

431
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
the Legal Director position

432
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,560
is still unoccupied.

433
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,360
We're both senior managers.

434
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,880
We're both qualified
to be considered for it.

435
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,440
Lastly,

436
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,200
from now on,

437
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,560
call me "Ms. Shen."

438
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
Don't call me by my name.

439
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,040
We're professionals after all.

440
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't you agree?

441
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,400
Okay, Ms. Shen.

442
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,400
I'll remember that.

443
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,840
Mom, I'm home.

444
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,160
What took you so long?
Come on, check my cooker.

445
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,160
Mom, I went to the supermarket.

446
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,000
I bought you some stuff.
It's good for you. You must drink it.

447
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,640
We have these.

448
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
Why did you buy them?

449
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll surely drink it.

450
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,960
What did you buy? More vegetables?

451
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,400
Why did you buy so many fruits?
We have them at home.

452
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
Look at you.

453
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,000
Look at how rotten
the pears you bought are.

454
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,000
I didn't buy these for you.
These are for Su Yang and me.

455
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,280
Are you broke lately?

456
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,440
I'll transfer some money to you then.

457
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,000
No, I have money.

458
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
Don't worry.

459
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,000
I didn't buy these fruits on purpose.

460
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,760
Forget it.
Let's check the pressure cooker first.

461
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,160
The pressure cooker.

462
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,320
My cooker. Hurry!

463
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,920
Come on, son.

464
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
Don't panic.

465
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,880
Look.

466
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Watch carefully.

467
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Be careful.

468
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,480
I'm fine.

469
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,040
Wait until all the steam is released
and there's no pressure inside

470
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,360
before you can open it.

471
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
So it's that simple?

472
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,680
If you told me clearly earlier,
I would know how to do it.

473
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
But every time I tell you clearly,

474
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
you would still forget.

475
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,920
I'll call you again if I forget

476
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,240
and ask you again.

477
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,920
Okay. Mom, don't use
the pressure cooker anymore.

478
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
It's dangerous if you mishandle it.

479
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,040
All right, stop nagging.

480
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,960
That's enough, go. I'll take care of this.

481
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,360
That's enough. Go.

482
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
- Don't burn yourself.
- All right.

483
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,680
Be careful.

484
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
All right.

485
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,640
USER GUIDE

PRESSURE COOKER GUIDE

491
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,800
I added a pressure cooker guide for you.

492
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,400
My son is the best.

493
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
MOM

494
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,600
Mom, I'm busy these days.

495
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll visit you in two days.

496
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,480
CUI LIXIN

497
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,400
CUI LIXIN

<i>Happy birthday.</i>

499
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,040
<i>Buy whatever you like.</i>

500
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,240
<i>I have a client meeting tonight.</i>

501
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,160
FROM ZOU CHENG: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

502
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,560
BUY WHATEVER YOU LIKE.
I HAVE A CLIENT MEETING TONIGHT.

503
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,440
MONEY TRANSFER: 5,200 YUAN

504
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,760
Happy birthday, baby.

505
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,360
The traffic was bad. I'm late.

506
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,320
I just reached here too.

507
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,320
Why did you buy a cake?

508
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,240
Actually, I'm just looking for a reason

509
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,120
for us to get together.

510
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,080
I don't want to celebrate my birthday.

511
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Should I remind myself
that I'm a year older?

512
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,120
In that case,

513
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
aren't I less qualified
to celebrate my birthday?

514
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
Why didn't you bring Cui Lixin here?

515
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,520
It's your birthday.

516
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,840
Why should I bring a third-wheeler?

517
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,040
If you miss him so much,
I'll arrange for you to meet him alone.

518
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,280
No way.

519
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,520
Damn you.

520
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I'm worried about holding you two up

521
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,920
from spending sweet,
quality time together.

522
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
Save it.

523
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,080
I miss being single even more now.

524
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,720
He treats you well.

525
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,200
What's wrong with you?

526
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,880
He follows you around
and gives you so much attention.

527
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,240
It's like

528
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,920
he's at your beck and call.

529
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,320
Shen Ruoxin, at your age,

530
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,680
if someone treats you well,
get married soon.

531
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,680
Do you want to say it louder
for everyone to hear?

532
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm looking for a man.
Am I looking for a nanny?

533
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,560
Besides, I know him too well.

534
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,680
I still haven't been able
to convince myself completely.

535
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,760
You're always so rational.

536
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,560
You keep analyzing things.

537
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,360
You analyzed people so thoroughly.

538
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,400
Aren't you tired?

539
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,520
Let's not talk about unhappy things.
It's your birthday.

540
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
- Let's talk about happy things.
- Happy things? Okay.

541
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,080
You can order anything in this restaurant.

542
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Zou Cheng will pay for it.

543
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,960
Waiter!

544
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,800
Keep it down.

545
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,920
- Thank you.
- Take a look at the menu first.

546
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,600
Have you made up your mind?
What can I get you?

547
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,960
Beer.

548
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,120
Two bottles.

549
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Do you need anything else?

550
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,040
- No.
- No.

551
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,000
I knew it's expensive here,
but not to this extent.

552
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,600
For two beers,
I can buy two boxes of instant noodles.

553
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Calm down.

554
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,920
How can I be calm?

555
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
Thank you.

556
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,200
Don't pour too much.

557
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
What are you doing?

558
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,320
Impressive. You're well-prepared.

559
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,840
Cheers.

560
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,280
Luoluo ran away.

561
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,400
Wasn't she long gone?

562
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,120
She's really gone this time.

563
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,840
I can never find her again.

564
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,480
What about the money you invested?
Can you get it back?

565
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,840
Is money more important than people?

566
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,880
We used to be on good terms.

567
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,440
And I put a lot of effort
into that online shop.

568
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,000
Then she just left.

569
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,160
Do you know how it feels
to be betrayed by your partner?

570
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,480
No.

571
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,400
What about the money?

572
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
Let's drink.

573
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,520
Bottoms up.

574
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,800
Why did you buy so many fruits?

575
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
What's there to celebrate today?

576
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,440
I met a crazy lady.

577
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,560
I'm sorry, but we don't allow food
from outside.

578
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,720
If you want fruits,
we have fruit plates here.

579
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,400
There's no need.

580
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,280
We don't need fruit plates, thank you.

581
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,080
I feel really uncomfortable here.

582
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,200
It's obvious that we don't belong here.

583
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,800
Let's go somewhere else.

584
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,280
What do you mean?

585
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,960
Why can't we come here?

586
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,720
Let's drink here. Come on.

587
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,520
Happy birthday.

588
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,880
I think he's going to propose.

589
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,160
Aren't you jealous?

590
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,120
- It's her.
- Really?

591
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,640
Ruoxin.

592
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,400
Today is our 100th day anniversary.

593
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
I hope you're surprised,

594
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,320
not shocked.

595
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm proposing to you here.
I hope you'll say yes.

596
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't eat it.

597
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Don't eat it.

598
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,760
What are you doing? Stand up now.

599
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,960
I don't want people to look.

600
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,200
It's Ziyan's birthday today,
can you get up?

601
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,360
Ruoxin.

602
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
It's so romantic. This is so nice.

603
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,120
And it's your 100th day anniversary.
A whirlwind romance.

604
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,320
I envy you so much.

605
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,760
Ruoxin.

606
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,960
If you marry me,

607
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,560
I promise I won't let you suffer.

608
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,120
I won't let anyone bully you.

609
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,400
You're the only one I love.
I won't marry anyone but you.

610
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,440
Say yes, Ruoxin.

611
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,800
- Marry him.
- Marry him!

612
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,800
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

613
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,240
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

614
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,800
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

615
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
What are you doing?

616
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,280
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

617
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,400
Are you stupid?

618
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Ma'am.

620
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,680
What a coincidence.

621
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,240
Who is this?

622
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
What's wrong with you?

623
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,840
Red wine is so expensive.
Why don't you finish it?

624
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,320
You have money to waste?

625
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,160
Why are you speaking this way?
Who are you? Go away.

626
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm sorry. My friend is drunk.

627
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,960
- I'm sorry.
- Go away.

628
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Sir.

629
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,120
I suggest you think things through.

630
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,040
Don't risk your life.

631
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,560
This woman is horrible.

632
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,840
Whoever marries her is unlucky.

633
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,400
This is my proposal.
Why are you making trouble?

634
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,200
- I'm sorry.
- Take him away.

635
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,480
How annoying.

636
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,880
Don't be angry, Ruoxin.

637
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,800
Cui Lixin, I think he's right.

638
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,520
I think you should reconsider.

639
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,440
I don't need to reconsider.
I think today is very special.

640
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,840
I love you,
I won't marry anyone but you. I mean it.

641
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,080
I love you.

642
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Wait.

643
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,880
She didn't say yes.
Why are you putting it on her?

644
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
Ma'am.

645
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,640
Is this a violation

646
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,000
of the Public Security
Administration Punishments Law

647
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,680
and considered disorderly behavior?

648
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,800
Yes, over 10 days and less than 15 days.

649
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,320
- No.
- How dare you talk this way?

650
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,960
Did you come to challenge me?

651
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,400
I'll beat you up if you don't leave,
let me tell you.

652
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,640
I'm sorry.

653
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
Who are these people?

654
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,320
How annoying.

655
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,240
He messed up such a good thing.

656
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't be angry, Ruoxin.

657
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,880
Don't mind that drunkard.

658
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm sorry, Ziyan.

659
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,320
I messed up your birthday today.

660
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll give you a big gift
as an apology next time.

661
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,160
There's no need.

662
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,480
This is already a big gift.

663
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,600
Ruoxin.

664
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,520
I'm looking forward
to attending your wedding.

665
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
Ruoxin, are you happy?

666
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,600
Cheer up.

667
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,200
I'll drive you home, Ziyan.

668
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,160
There's no need.

669
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,040
You two should spend some quality time.

670
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,000
Text me when you get home.

671
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

672
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,360
Ruoxin.

673
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,400
I want to take you somewhere
before you go home.

674
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,159
I'm tired. I want to go home first.

675
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,040
Don't worry. It won't take long.

676
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
And I guarantee you'll be happy, okay?

677
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,400
Come on.

678
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,280
Get up.

679
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,080
- Come on.
- Come on.

680
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
Come.

681
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,360
Ruoxin, come.

682
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,320
Look.

683
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,120
This is my surprise for you.

684
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,160
What do you think?

685
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,280
It's a 160 m² house.

686
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,840
It's 160 m².

687
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,160
The only downside is
that the kitchen is a bit small.

688
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,080
But the other areas are very good.

689
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,200
It's very comfortable.

690
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,200
I've already paid the down payment.
I did the math.

691
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,440
With our wages,
we can definitely pay the mortgage.

692
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,120
Cui Lixin.

693
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,400
We've only been together for three months.

694
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,560
Do you think it's time to get married?

695
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,360
It has been 100 days, my dear.

696
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,640
It's not that short.

697
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,200
I think we're headed towards marriage.

698
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,040
There are many things we need to plan.

699
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Do you know me?

700
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,000
I think so.

701
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,840
Look at you.
Early thirties, young and beautiful,

702
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,000
capable at your job,

703
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,760
a native of Shanghai,

704
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,000
a senior legal manager at Zenpro,

705
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,880
hardworking, responsible,

706
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
and you're good at what you do.

707
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,000
Even though I'm not from Shanghai,

708
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,960
we've been colleagues for so long.

709
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
You know me.

710
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,320
We're evenly matched in age
and qualifications.

711
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,440
We're both very competent at work.

712
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,560
What's important is that I love you.

713
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,000
Do you really love me?

714
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Of course I love you.

715
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,480
Otherwise, for 100 days,

716
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
how can I bring you breakfast daily

717
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,280
and give you so much attention?

718
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,680
Do you think this is love?

719
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,640
Do you think
you can get married with these?

720
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,560
What else do we need?

721
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,280
At our age,

722
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,520
we date to get married.

723
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,800
Then the most important things are
buying a house and having kids.

724
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,200
Let's achieve the major events
in life one by one.

725
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm sorry, Cui Lixin.

726
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,440
I don't like others telling me
how to live my life.

727
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,080
What do you mean, Ruoxin?

728
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,840
We're not a good fit.

729
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Let's break up.

730
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
You think I'm not nice enough to you?

731
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,080
Why are you breaking up with me?

732
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
You did a great job.

733
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,920
Like an alarm clock,

734
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
you remind me to wake up, sleep, and eat.

735
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,400
After sucking up to my mom daily,
you flatter my best friend.

736
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,520
You watch my every move in the office.

737
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,160
I really don't want

738
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,800
to live my life this way in the future.

739
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,800
Ruoxin, I'm doing this because I love you.

740
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,840
Do you love me?

741
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
Do you know my interests and hobbies?

742
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,480
Do you know when I'm happy and upset?

743
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,760
When I'm very stressed from work,

744
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,240
do you know how I console myself?

745
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,320
What do I like to do
when I'm happy or sad?

746
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,440
Have you ever cared about any of these?

747
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,160
I…

748
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,720
I admit, in these aspects,

749
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,280
maybe what I did wasn't good enough.

750
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,200
But Ruoxin, trust me,

751
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,480
give me a chance.

752
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,560
I'll do everything to your satisfaction.

753
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
Cui Lixin.

754
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
Stop wasting your time on me.

755
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,240
You have already tried enough.

756
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,640
I know that you never treated

757
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,920
your ex-girlfriends this way.

758
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,240
You're at the right age,

759
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,280
and with the stressful life in Shanghai,

760
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,520
you want to find someone
suitable for you in every way

761
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,840
to build a family.

762
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,120
You want to buy a house and car,
pay the mortgage,

763
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,600
have kids, raise kids,

764
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,280
and face difficulties in life together.

765
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,160
Yes, you're right.

766
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,000
When we first started dating,
that's what I thought too.

767
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,000
But now, I've thought things through.

768
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,720
This isn't the life I want.

769
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,400
Ruoxin.

770
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,040
Do you think I'm begging you?

771
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,880
Do you think I'm out of your league?

772
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,680
Will you please look in the mirror?

773
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,040
You're already 33.

774
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,040
Girls who are younger and more beautiful
than you are everywhere.

775
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,720
Even dating agencies
despise people your age, you know?

776
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,080
We've been colleagues for so long.
Don't we know each other?

777
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,360
Why are you pretending with me?

778
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,560
This is all you can be.
That's all you're getting paid for.

779
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,320
You're just a lowly legal manager.

780
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,640
You really think you can be
the Legal Director?

781
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,600
Don't you know
that Ruan Ye is Liu Pei's man?

782
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I suggest

783
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,720
you stop reading self-help articles.

784
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
Indulge less in dramas.

785
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,400
Face reality.

786
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,040
The reality is that
it's good for someone like me

787
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,360
to be willing to take you.

788
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,640
Thank you, Cui Lixin.

789
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,160
You let me see once again
how harsh reality can be.

FROM MOM

791
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,200
<i>I threw away the instant noodles.</i>

792
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,560
<i>I made some food
and left them in the fridge.</i>

793
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,280
<i>Heat them up before eating.</i>

794
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,520
<i>Eat less junk food.</i>

795
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,480
<i>It's healthier and cleaner
to cook at home.</i>

796
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,520
Hello, Mom.

797
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,120
Before coming to my house next time,

798
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,920
can you call me first?

799
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
Also,

800
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,720
all my suits can't be washed
in the washing machine.

801
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,560
Don't throw away my things
without permission too, okay?

802
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,760
<i>Am I not doing it for your own good?</i>

803
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,520
<i>Is it bad for you to eat less junk food?</i>

804
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
Mom, I'm exhausted today.

805
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,480
I don't want to fight with you.

806
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,240
<i>Don't talk about these things first.</i>

807
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,960
<i>Xiaocui proposed to you today, right?</i>

808
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,800
Did he tell you that?

809
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,720
<i>Xiaocui came this morning to fix the pipes</i>

810
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,680
<i>and formally discussed it with me.</i>

811
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,320
<i>He was so sincere.</i>

812
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,440
<i>With him taking care of you now,</i>

813
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,280
<i>I can finally rest in peace.</i>

814
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,640
Mom, don't say ridiculous things.

815
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,440
<i>How is that ridiculous?</i>

816
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,120
<i>At my age, I don't know
what will happen tomorrow.</i>

817
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,400
<i>I'm worried about you the most.</i>

818
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,520
<i>You're always letting me worry.</i>

819
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
<i>Now,</i>

820
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,960
<i>you finally have Xiaocui
to take care of you.</i>

821
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,440
<i>I can feel at ease then.</i>

822
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,400
<i>Right.</i>

823
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,440
<i>Are you engaged?</i>

824
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,760
<i>Let's have a meal together sometime.</i>

825
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,800
<i>I'll show you the wedding materials</i>

826
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,440
<i>I booked for you.</i>

827
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,960
<i>Your mom has foresight.</i>

828
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,320
Mom, regarding me and Cui Lixin,

829
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,120
I'll come to you
and explain everything another day.

830
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm really tired today.

831
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Get some rest too.

832
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
I'm hanging up. Bye.

It's so beautiful.

Let me restore the original color
of the universe for you.

840
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,920
It looks so nice.
