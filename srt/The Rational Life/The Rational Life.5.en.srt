1
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,040
- Do you want a sugar daddy?
- Mom!

2
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,200
Go then!

3
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,920
What are you doing?

4
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,640
You finally managed to find someone

5
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,920
who treats us wholeheartedly.

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
What more do you want?

7
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,800
He even bought a house.

8
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,120
What more do you want?

9
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,160
What he bought was his premarital asset.

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,480
It belongs to him.

11
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
Even if we marry

12
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,680
and I move in,

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,000
I only have usage rights
and not ownership rights.

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,120
You, young lady,

15
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,640
are really exceptional.

16
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,560
Your convoluted thinking

17
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,080
is something I can't fix
even in my next life.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,960
All right.

19
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
It's because of the house, right?

20
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,880
I'll give Xiaocui a call

21
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,880
and tell him

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,160
to include your name
in the property certificate.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,760
What do you think?

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Mom, stop making trouble.

25
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,960
Cui Lixin and I are over.

26
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,240
It's impossible.
I won't go back on my word.

27
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,520
I think you are too self-absorbed.

28
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,480
Do you really think you are invincible?

29
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Okay then.

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
Don't look back and go ahead.

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,400
Go find someone.

32
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,240
Find a suitable guy and show me.

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,520
Go find one!

34
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,720
Why should I?

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,920
Can't I not find one?

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,520
Why must women marry?

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm fine being alone, aren't I?

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,080
After you divorced Dad,
aren't you living happily too?

39
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Am I?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
Am I living happily?

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,120
You're trying to make me happy,
aren't you?

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,000
Relying on the fact that you're young?

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
You order takeout for me.

44
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
You hired me a part-timer,

45
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,080
letting me live comfortably.

46
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,400
Wait until you've reached my age

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,400
and you'll finally understand

48
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,640
what loneliness means.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,080
Wait until you've reached my age

50
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,720
and you won't even be like me.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,440
Because at least I have a daughter.

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,960
You work until you retired, but one day,

53
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,720
you go to the streets

54
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,640
and feed those stray dogs and cats.

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,560
You heat a meal or two at home

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,959
and eat it for two weeks.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,959
In the end, you eat at a cafeteria.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
At the University for Seniors,

59
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
there are many lonely old men and women.

60
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,040
They are together

61
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,720
and have a group chat.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,720
Every day, when the sun rises

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
and the sun sets,

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,600
they send a message to their group chat.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
Do you think it's because it's fun?

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
Wrong.

67
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,360
They are afraid they'll die at home

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
with no one to collect their bodies

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,440
and with no one knowing.

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,120
Mom, don't say such things.

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,680
Is this about me?

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
Do you think I'm talking about me?

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm talking about you.

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
One day, I won't be here anymore,

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,680
and I keep thinking

76
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,520
that I will leave you alone in this world.

77
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
How will you survive?

78
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
Why wouldn't you be here?

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
I have my own life.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll be responsible for my own life.

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,720
All right.

82
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,320
I was waiting for these words.

83
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
Your life.

84
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,400
Your responsibility.

85
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,360
I do not have to worry.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,840
Mom, wait!

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,120
I went to the mart today
to buy you some stuff.

88
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
- I'll bring it up for you.
- No!

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,760
It's my life.
I'll be responsible for my own life too.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,040
<i>What's the matter? Do you miss me?</i>

91
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,840
Shall we go for a drink?

92
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>I'm not free tonight.</i>

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,160
<i>My husband just returned from his trip,</i>

94
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,040
<i>so I'm still unpacking his laundry.</i>

95
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,960
<i>You sound depressed.</i>

96
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,320
It's okay. Forget it.

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Let's talk later.

98
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
- Your drink.
- Thank you.

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,320
- One more glass, please.
- Okay.

100
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,760
Quick! Cockroach!

101
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,559
I'm coming!

102
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm coming!

103
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
There!

104
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,400
Over there!

105
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,760
Hit it!

106
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,480
Quick! Is it dead?

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,720
Did you kill it?

108
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
It's dead.

109
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,920
It's dead.

110
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
It scared the hell out of me!

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,440
It's all right now.

112
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
That was so scary.

113
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,760
It's all right. It's all done.

114
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,280
All thanks to your swift actions.

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,000
I still want to discuss this
with you though.

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,000
This house in the city center
that your dad has left us…

117
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,040
Let's sell it.

118
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
The house is good,

119
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,680
but it's too old

120
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
and there are too many bugs.

121
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
If we sell it,

122
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,640
we can move to another place

123
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,760
and buy a better house.

124
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,040
You and Su Yang don't have to rent a place

125
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,400
and you can stay home.

126
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,640
No way.

127
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,560
There are fond memories
of you and Dad here.

128
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,960
How can I sell it?

129
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,520
We have to keep this place.

130
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,480
One day, when I've made a lot of money,

131
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,080
we will move to a bigger house.

132
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,120
- I'm counting on you then.
- Of course.

133
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
Look at you. You're in such a good mood.

134
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,200
Is your work going well?

135
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Not bad. It's quite good.

136
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
That's not right.

137
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
I often see in movies

138
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,240
that newly hired recruits

139
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
are often tormented by their bosses.

140
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,120
Like the drama, <i>Empresses in the Palace</i>.

141
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,160
It's about palace life, internal rivalry,

142
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,240
- and fights--
- Mom.

143
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm a guy

144
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,640
and I work in a company,

145
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
not a palace.

146
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,200
All right.

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,720
My leader is a nice person.

148
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,920
Nobody dares to bully me

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,960
and I'm not stupid.

150
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,040
That's true.

151
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,440
How can you be stupid
when you have my genes?

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Miss.

153
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Miss.

154
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,960
Miss.

155
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,080
Look over here.

156
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
One more glass, please.

157
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,920
QI XIAO

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
Why would she listen to me?

159
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,920
She thinks she's pretty.

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,960
- Really?
- Yes.

161
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,560
Hello, Ruoxin.

162
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,520
You are…

163
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,560
Okay.

164
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
Where is that?

165
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,680
Ruoxin.

166
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,720
Ruoxin!

167
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,080
- Are you Qi Xiao from the call just now?
- Yes.

168
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,200
How much did she drink?

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
- Two glasses.
- What?

170
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,040
Two glasses?

171
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
Why would you go drinking alone?

172
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Where is your car?

173
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
You came?

174
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,640
Let's drink.

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
You have such a low tolerance for alcohol.

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,840
Where did you park your car?

177
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,720
Car? My car?

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,160
My car.

179
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,640
Stay still. Come with me.

180
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,360
Come.

181
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,000
Slowly.

182
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,120
- Kid.
- Slowly!

183
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
She's too drunk. Please get another car.

184
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't want her to throw up.

185
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,080
- Change to another car, okay?
- What are you saying?

186
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,840
- Who said I'm drunk?
- You're too drunk.

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,160
- Did I throw up?
- She drank too much.

188
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
No, Ruoxin.

189
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Did I throw up in your car?

190
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,640
- Why would you say such a thing?
- Please change cars.

191
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
- Are you refusing a client?
- It's okay.

192
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,080
- Let me tell you.
- It's okay.

193
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
I'm going to file a complaint on you.

194
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,880
Where's my phone?

195
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,040
Give me my phone.
I want to file a complaint.

196
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,200
Okay. Let's file a complaint
when we get home.

197
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
Right. Home.

198
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,920
That's right. I'm going home.

199
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
I'll take the subway.

200
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,480
The subway is far, Ruoxin!

201
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,720
Are you okay?

202
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,200
- Who says I'm not okay?
<i>- The train is approaching.</i>

203
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,760
- I'm okay!
- <i>Please wait in the line as shown</i>

204
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,480
<i>on the platform sign.</i>

205
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,360
- Are you all right?
- Don't hold me.

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
- Are you okay?
- I can do it.

207
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Don't hold me.

208
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,080
Why are you holding me?

209
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I can walk on my own!

210
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,600
- Okay.
- I can walk!

211
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,880
Be careful.

212
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
It's here.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
This way.

214
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,560
No, not this one.

215
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,560
This side.

216
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,160
It's leaving!
Why aren't we taking this ride?

217
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,600
- This way, let's go home.
- Stop pulling me!

218
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
Not there!

219
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,560
Come, stand up.

220
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,160
Stand up.

221
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Move away.

222
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you all right?

223
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,920
Hey!

224
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey.

225
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey.

226
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,200
<i>We are now at the Jinjiang Park.</i>

227
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>The doors will open on the right.</i>

228
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,400
<i>Please mind the gap.</i>

229
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,400
Where are you going?

230
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,880
We're at Jinjiang Park.

231
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
Not Jinjiang Park.
We have three more stops.

232
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,800
- We're going to Jinjiang Action Park.
- Look at the time.

233
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
It's closing soon.

234
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's go next time, okay?

235
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,680
- Let's go home.
- No.

236
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,160
- <i>Jinjiang Park.</i>
- Hey!

237
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,360
<i>Those taking public transports
to the highway,</i>

238
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,720
<i>please keep to…</i>

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,960
Where are you going?

240
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,280
Over here! That's the opposite way.

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,520
<i>After arriving at the station,
please head out to North Two.</i>

242
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,360
Can you please run slowly?

243
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
We're here!

244
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,400
JINJIANG ACTION PARK

245
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,360
Ruoxin!

246
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,800
Ruoxin, what are you doing?

247
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,520
Who comes to the park at this hour?

248
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,560
Me! I'm here!

249
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
It's closed.

250
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,360
Who said it's closed?

251
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,000
Why is it closed?

252
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
Who closed it?

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,800
Why is it closed?

254
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,360
I just got here!

255
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,640
I came here and they are closed!

256
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
Why is it closed?

257
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,360
I don't want this.

258
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,400
My dad used to bring me here.

259
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,880
Ever since he passed away,

260
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,680
nobody brought me here.

261
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,120
Do you want to visit the amusement park?

262
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,320
My mom never brought me here!

263
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,160
Next time, I'll bring you here, okay?

264
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,200
All right. Look up.

265
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,720
Have a look.

266
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,319
Quick. Have a look.

267
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,240
It's so pretty.

268
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,280
It's so pretty.

269
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,120
Why is it so pretty?

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,320
It's so pretty.

271
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,600
Why is it so pretty?

272
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Put me down. I want to throw up.

273
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
Don't throw up on me, Ruoxin.

274
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,080
I lost my car.

275
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,440
Are you having blackouts?

276
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
You didn't drive yesterday.

277
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,880
I have a meeting today and I'm in a rush.

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Can I ride with you?

279
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Didn't someone say

280
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
she doesn't take risky transportation

281
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,360
because it's her principle?

282
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,080
Principles are meant to be broken.

283
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,080
Let's go now!

284
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,120
Sit tight.

285
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,200
We'll be quite busy this month.

286
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,240
A new leader will join us

287
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,120
to form our New Energy Department.

288
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,880
Next, we'll discuss with the PR Department

289
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
to assist and facilitate
their brand promotion.

290
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,800
Everyone, please focus

291
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,160
and avoid making mistakes.

292
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,520
What's important now

293
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,320
is to help the new leader settle in

294
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,800
as soon as possible.

295
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,800
Arrange his accommodations,

296
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,840
a company vehicle,

297
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,600
hire a domestic helper,

298
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,120
and a driver.

299
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,600
Ms. Li, I'm not done
with my warehouse inspection yet.

300
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,760
Ms. Li,

301
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,160
HR Department wants me
to assist other departments

302
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,680
in sorting personnel needs

303
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,840
and work on reports.

304
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,480
I think I'm busy this week.

305
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,760
Ruoxin.

306
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,800
You're the most attentive one
among us here.

307
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,120
These kids lack attentiveness.

308
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm afraid if something goes wrong,

309
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,560
the new leader might have

310
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,280
a bad impression on our department.

311
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
You're the oldest

312
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,200
and most attentive one,

313
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,160
I won't worry

314
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,720
if you're the one handling this.

315
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,560
Okay.

316
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,760
Hand me the specific requirements

317
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,120
and I'll get in touch with the agency.

318
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Thank you.

319
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,000
No problem.

320
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,560
HOUSING REQUIREMENTS, HELPER
REQUIREMENTS, DRIVER'S REQUIREMENTS

321
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,800
Any problems?

322
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
No problem.

323
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
That's all for today.

324
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,880
Are we coolies and nannies now?

325
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,560
You shouldn't have agreed to this.

326
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
If I don't, we'll be stuck here.

327
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,440
In the end,

328
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,920
the fault will still be on us.

329
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,440
I can't be bothered
to bicker with these people.

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
Take it as a breath of fresh air.

331
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,640
This Shen Ruoxin girl.

332
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I can't believe she's still in
the Administration Department.

333
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,480
I didn't expect her to be so tough.

334
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,800
But don't worry.

335
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
I've set up another pit for her.

336
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,880
That Xu Minjie

337
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,520
is known to be a problematic guy.

338
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,160
I heard he has a bad temper.

339
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,320
If she doesn't do what he wants,

340
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,960
she'll have to take the blame.

341
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,680
Ms. Li.

342
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,080
This is indeed a big pit.

343
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Good.

344
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,560
However,

345
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,080
you shouldn't be too careless.

346
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,800
You have to be meticulous with everything.

347
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,000
When Shen Ruoxin was still
in the Legal Department,

348
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
she was actually more capable
than Ruan Ye,

349
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,360
but she wouldn't yield.

350
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,480
I know what I'm doing.

351
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,400
Everyone has a weakness.

352
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,080
I've been observing her.

353
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,080
She's very close with her assistant.

354
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,240
There's always a way
to make her uncomfortable.

355
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,440
HUNAN STREET MANSION WITH GARDEN,
HELPER, SUBWAY, NEWLY FURNISHED

356
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,800
NAME, AGE, YEARS OF DRIVING,
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE

357
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,000
Ruoxin.

358
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,880
I've sorted the drivers' details out
and sent them to you.

359
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
You can filter gender,
age, driving experience,

360
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,760
and all relevant information directly.

361
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,240
I've also copied the pictures.

362
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,760
Good, I'll have a look.

363
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
I'll get back to you
after the preliminary selection.

364
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,480
Please inform the HR Department
to arrange for interviews.

365
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,280
As early as tonight

366
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,520
or tomorrow before noon,

367
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,200
we need to select a driver
and get him to pick up the car.

368
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,360
Okay, I understand.

369
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,160
Ruoxin, this is my KPI for this month.

370
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,120
Okay.

371
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Hello?

372
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm in the Administration Department now.

374
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,120
I'll buy it now.

375
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,800
A cheesecake too, right? Okay.

376
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,360
Ruoxin, I have to go now.

377
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
YOU SIJIA

378
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,800
Qi Xiao.

379
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,160
There's a lady called Zhao Na
at the HR Department,

380
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,560
and she's quite friendly.

381
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,720
Go and make
pleasant conversations with her

382
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,360
and find out when Sijia's internship ends.

383
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
Now that I'm following you,

384
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
not only do I have to squat to eat,

385
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,280
but I have to sacrifice my charms too?

386
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,600
I have my limits too, okay?

387
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,040
We are in the legal field.

388
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,480
Choose your words wisely.

389
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,280
I didn't and will not allow

390
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,880
my assistant to seduce others.

391
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,720
Otherwise, it will be called
as workplace sexual harassment.

392
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,440
I hope you can just change the mood

393
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,040
in a dignified manner.

394
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
All the while completing your mission.

395
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
- Understand?
- Yes, I understand.

396
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,080
Have a flexible limit.

397
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,880
- Good luck.
- Got it.

398
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,240
- Are these ours?
- Yes, please sign here.

399
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,280
Okay.

400
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,960
Here.

401
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,560
Goodbye.

402
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
Xiaotian.

403
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,920
You come here just in time.

404
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,880
Have you handed out all the fragrances?

405
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,560
Get all departments to collect them

406
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,880
to make room for these.

407
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,840
Ms. Li, I've called them countless times.

408
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,960
It's either they're busy or they forget.

409
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,160
Like the last batch of fragrance,
I've called many times yesterday.

410
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Neither the Sales Department nor Insurance
Department has come to collect them.

411
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,280
They are busy. Can't you send it over?

412
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,720
Ms. Li, I haven't finished my report

413
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,720
and it needs to be handed over today.

414
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,760
All right.

415
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,720
You're always pushing away work.

416
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,120
Don't say I didn't warn you
about your year-end evaluation.

417
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,080
There is someone who is fast
and good at her work.

418
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,800
So why not let her handle it?

419
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,160
I don't even have an assistant.

420
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,480
What about you?

421
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,040
If you're so capable, get one.

422
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
You're right, Ms. Li.

423
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,240
They couldn't get along in
the Legal Department so they end up here

424
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,800
and act like this department is theirs.

425
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Ruoxin.

426
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
- Ms. Li--
- You're capable.

427
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm busy looking for his accommodation.

428
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,840
I know.

429
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,760
I know you are full to the brim,

430
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
but our department
is always short of people.

431
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,840
Or else, Mr. Liu wouldn't send
a capable person like you

432
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,600
to this small department, right?

433
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,800
Plus, you have Qi Xiao to help you.

434
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,440
By the way, where is Qi Xiao?

435
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,840
All right, Ms. Li.

436
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,840
I'll move it.

437
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,080
Great.

438
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,760
Please send all the fragrance
to every department while you're at it.

439
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Thank you.

440
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,040
- Ask Qi Xiao to see me when he's back.
- Ms. Li.

441
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,280
What's the matter?

442
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,840
You can tell me.

443
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,320
I have to report everything
about Qi Xiao to you?

444
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,640
Are you his guardian?

445
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,160
All right. Just come with him.

446
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,320
Here.

447
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Are they bullying you again?

448
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,920
They said I'm capable
and I have an assistant.

449
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm sorry.

450
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
Next time,

451
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,720
I'll be more careful with my words.

452
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,120
Learning from one's mistake.

453
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,440
That's how the corporate world works.

454
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
So how did it go?

455
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,040
What did Zhao Na say?

456
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
Sijia's internship ends this month.

457
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
No word from the Legal Department

458
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,440
whether to proceed with her papers or not.

459
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,080
But Ruoxin,

460
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,000
Sijia didn't betray you.

461
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,880
She didn't take Ruan Ye's side.

462
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,480
I think she's a good person.

463
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
A good person needs to defend herself.

464
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,280
This young lady…

465
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,680
Anyway,

466
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,680
Ms. Li wants to see you.

467
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
She wants to see me? Why?

468
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,480
Nothing good, probably.

469
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,720
I'll finish up and go with you.

470
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,920
I see you came well-prepared.

471
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,840
I knew I had to do labor work here,

472
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,480
so I won't wear heels to torture myself.

473
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,120
As a working individual,

474
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,040
always prepare your own tools.

475
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,160
Move these dates onto the cart.

476
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,360
Then I'll move the cart

477
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,880
to the Legal Department
and Sales Department.

478
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,080
I'll go to the Legal Department.

479
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Qi Xiao.

480
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,920
When we were in school,

481
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,320
do you know those girls
who often get bullied by bad boys?

482
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,520
They are the kind

483
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,360
who'd sob immediately.

484
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,040
People think they're easy targets.

485
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,880
My mom is a teacher.

486
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,400
She told me,

487
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,120
"Don't let others bully you.

488
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Either you fight back

489
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,080
or you let them feel

490
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,800
that bullying you isn't fun at all."

491
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,800
Then I should go with you.

492
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,760
It's all right.

493
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,400
Take these to the Promotion Department
and PR Department.

494
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,760
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

495
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiao. Here's the coffee.

496
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,200
Your Americano.

497
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I ordered a latte.

498
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,720
The Americano is mine.

499
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,440
I'm sorry, I was confused.

500
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,600
Your latte.

501
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
Your Americano.

502
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,680
Put it there.

503
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
Okay.

504
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,760
Your cake, miss.

505
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,320
Coffee, Mr. Ruan?

506
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,880
You look pretty today.

507
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
Gifts from the company.

508
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
Ms. Qiao, could you please sign here.

509
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,760
Personal delivery, Ms. Shen?

510
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,920
Isn't that too much?

511
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,680
These dates again?

512
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,080
Who eats them these days?

513
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,760
And the fragrance from this brand

514
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,160
is not even pleasant.

515
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
You know, your department

516
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,320
is an auxiliary department
created to serve others,

517
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,240
but doesn't even know what we need,

518
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,120
and they call this welfare.

519
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,320
Something is fishy. Don't you think?

520
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm sorry.
I'm not the one who purchased them.

521
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,160
But the feedback you shared
will be reported

522
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,760
to Ms. Li for future reflection.

523
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,320
Ms. Qiao,

524
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,560
you're mistaken.

525
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,800
The Administration Department

526
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,480
might look insignificant,

527
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,440
but it's needed to ensure
a company's normal operations.

528
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,400
Do you understand?

529
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Apologies, Ms. Shen.

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,840
Hey, I haven't seen you for a while.

531
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,320
You look exhausted.

532
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,960
The new role must be tough.

533
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,080
I heard

534
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,880
that internal complaints

535
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,760
must be reported as KPIs.

536
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,760
Don't worry.

537
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
We've known each other so long,

538
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
I'll definitely give you
a five-star review.

539
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,840
Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

540
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,360
I almost forgot to congratulate you

541
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,960
on your promotion to director.

542
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,920
Thank you.

543
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,240
You know,

544
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,360
you have no idea how busy we are.

545
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,280
If you were still here,

546
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,680
you'd be of great help.

547
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,120
After all, you're a senior here
and you're familiar

548
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,240
with the environment, aren't you?

549
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
You know,

550
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
after the Jin Yuanhao case,

551
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,960
I will talk to Mr. Liu

552
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,120
to have you reinstated.

553
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,640
Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

554
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,520
I wonder if you have some time now.

555
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,800
I would like to discuss a matter with you.

556
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,480
Discuss?

557
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
Let's see.

558
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
I have a meeting in five minutes.

559
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,360
Let's talk next time.

560
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,680
That's plenty of time.

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,360
After all, it's about the KPI
of the Legal Department.

562
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,160
Right. In my office then.

563
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,560
Pass this on to the Sales Department.

564
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,520
Have a seat.

565
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,480
Thank you.

566
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,640
What do you think about the office?

567
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,640
Not bad.

568
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,240
The light could be brighter.

569
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,600
Dark is calmness.

570
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,040
It brings out stability.

571
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Ms. Shen.

572
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,640
My old friend,

573
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,680
how can I help you?

574
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,560
I'll get to the point then.

575
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,760
You Sijia is my intern.

576
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,880
She has been here for two years.

577
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,040
Last year, there were no open positions,

578
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
but not this year.

579
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,960
I hope you can promote her
to permanent staff.

580
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,560
Ms. Shen, what I can say is…

581
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
The situation is…

582
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,800
As a senior employee,

583
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,480
you understand that
the company has sets of rules.

584
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,480
Promoting an intern
requires a minimum benchmark.

585
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,200
Even if I wish to assist, Ms. Shen,

586
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,600
I still can't cross the line.

587
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,360
- Correct.
- However,

588
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,280
since you asked me personally…

589
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,080
Don't worry.

590
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,400
As long as this young lady
meets all the requirements,

591
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
I will consider her.

592
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,520
Sijia has worked under me for two years,

593
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,360
and I'm aware of her performance.

594
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,640
She's more capable
than half the seniors outside

595
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,280
and more competent.

596
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,640
For example,

597
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,600
recently she told me,

598
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,560
that Kelai Enterprise's contract
has expired and requires renewal.

599
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,960
But there's a missing clause
that requires amendment.

600
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,440
At that time, I was too busy
with Jin Yuanhao's case

601
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,600
and overlooked it.

602
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,960
Coincidentally,

603
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,640
today, she came
to the Administration Department

604
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,120
and I remembered this case and asked her

605
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,240
if she had reported it to you.

606
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,720
But Sijia said

607
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
that she couldn't reach out to you.

608
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,680
Mr. Ruan, you might be new

609
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,760
and unfamiliar with the internal situation

610
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
that is going on.

611
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,880
The Legal Department
has signed many contracts.

612
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Of course,

613
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm very well aware of all the details.

614
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,400
But you're an old-timer here,

615
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,680
so you should understand

616
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,240
that a newly appointed boss

617
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,520
needs to grasp everything
in the shortest time.

618
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,080
That can be quite challenging.

619
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,520
If you have someone like Sijia,

620
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
who knows the internal business
to assist you,

621
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,880
wouldn't that be great?

622
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,040
Do you mean…

623
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,159
Let me make it clearer for you.

624
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,760
Sijia is just a young intern.

625
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,440
You've seen her work.

626
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,920
She's capable, responsible,

627
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,159
and won't pull you down.

628
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,719
Her character is reliable.

629
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,679
Of course,

630
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,080
after two years under your wing
and she has accumulated enough experience,

631
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,159
she might want to move on.

632
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,199
You might not be able to keep her,

633
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
but she can work hard

634
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,159
without a problem.

635
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,560
Why not let her help you?

636
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,239
Wait a minute.

637
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,800
Ms. Shen, what did you say
about Kelai Enterprise's contract?

638
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,679
Mr. Ruan.

639
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,440
Let me say something

640
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,400
that is even clearer.

641
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,880
I have been in Zenpro Automotive

642
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,720
for over seven years,

643
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,480
and I never like forming cliques.

644
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,720
That's how I ended up where I am.

645
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,520
I believe Mr. Liu and yourself

646
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,960
know it better than me.

647
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,080
Nevertheless,

648
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,720
I've worked here for seven years.

649
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,000
In every department,

650
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,560
I have some acquaintance

651
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,480
and connection.

652
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
So…

653
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,920
I know everything about this department.

654
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,920
Actually,

655
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,360
I've already surrendered.

656
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,800
You should understand this.

657
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,720
Do not push an enemy at bay.

658
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,800
Beware of a silent dog.

659
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,200
I took too much of your time. I'm sorry.

660
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,680
Please attend your meeting.

661
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,160
Let's talk again next time.

662
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,600
Goodbye, Mr. Ruan.

663
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,040
Are you here to beg me

664
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,760
or threaten me?

665
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,640
When Mr. Ruan calls you,

666
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,400
bring him the contract I showed you.

667
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,520
Quick.

668
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,520
You Sijia,

669
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,600
come to my office.

670
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,520
Go.

671
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,880
All signed, Ms. Qiao?

672
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,960
Thank you.

673
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,080
By the way,

674
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,960
please don't send You Sijia

675
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,320
for your future coffee runs.

676
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,800
She's an intern. A skilled worker.

677
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,400
But what you said today is true.

678
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,120
Simple tasks like serving tea and coffee

679
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
should be my responsibility

680
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,800
and yours,

681
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,320
a secretary's job.

682
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,840
You should be worthy of your salary.

683
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Excuse me,

684
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,360
where should I put the gifts
for the Sales Department?

685
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,560
Over there, at that empty table.

686
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,240
Don't block the pathway.

687
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,200
Thank you.

688
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
Let me help you.

689
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,760
I'm fine, Mr. Cui.

690
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,040
- I can do it.
- It's okay.

691
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm free now,

692
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,600
so don't worry about me.

693
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,160
Mr. Cui.

694
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
I'll do it.

695
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,840
It's our job. We shouldn't trouble you.

696
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,880
All right.
Just let me know if you need anything.

697
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,680
You're fast.

698
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,480
By the way,

699
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,720
did the Legal Department trouble you?

700
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,280
I used to be on the debate team

701
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,160
and I've never lost a fight.

702
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,680
Hurry, let's finish this
and go see Ms. Li.

703
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Come in.

704
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,080
- Ms. Li.
- Ms. Li, Qi Xiao is here.

705
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,640
Hey.

706
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,800
You both really came together?

707
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,720
What took you so long?

708
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,520
We sent the gifts to all departments,

709
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,200
so it took some time.

710
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,760
Qi Xiao.

711
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,440
The reason I called you here

712
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,640
is because I want to clarify
a certain matter with you.

713
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,640
As you can see,

714
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,160
there's no assistant position
in the Administration Department.

715
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
Your term ends

716
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
this month, right?

717
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,440
You should plan ahead.

718
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Survey other departments
that are looking for an assistant.

719
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,800
Move to other departments

720
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,480
and become permanent staff.

721
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,040
Or else, it will be a waste.

722
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,800
Usually, your direct leader
will be the one to inform you about this.

723
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,200
But I think

724
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,280
that you're a nice kid

725
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,760
and a likable person.

726
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,640
Let me be upfront with you

727
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,560
to save you from being hopeful.

728
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,280
Ms. Li, converting assistant
to a permanent staff

729
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,480
has always been directly assessed
by the leaders.

730
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,840
Plus,

731
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,680
every department manager has an assistant.

732
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,480
I'm not the first to have one.

733
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,480
So…

734
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,480
What you said doesn't apply
to the Administration Department.

735
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,040
As you can see,

736
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,360
there's no assistant position here.

737
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,160
Even I, the chief of this department,

738
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,800
don't have an assistant,

739
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,720
do I?

740
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,880
Ms. Li,

741
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,480
Qi Xiao is assigned

742
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,080
by Mr. Liu to me.

743
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,640
About Mr. Liu…

744
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,600
Regarding him transferring you here
has occupied one spot.

745
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,960
I've been very generous in your case.

746
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,120
Both of you have been here for a while.

747
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,040
You know

748
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,520
that we can't afford another recruit.

749
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Qi Xiao,

750
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,360
I'm really sorry.

751
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,200
Ms. Li,

752
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,680
we've been with the company for many years

753
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,240
and we understand that
every department has its privileges.

754
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,480
Can you please help me out with this once?

755
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,000
I'll be owing you a favor.

756
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,880
You put me in a tough spot.

757
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,040
You have to think about me too.

758
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,000
You see, there are two of you,

759
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,840
but there's only one position.

760
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,840
I have it tough too.

761
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,000
Or you can leave.

762
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,680
I don't mean anything by that.

763
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,680
Ruoxin,

764
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,880
I think you're capable

765
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,080
and you can find a job soon.

766
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,360
But look at Qi Xiao.

767
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,120
His situation might be different.

768
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,120
Qi Xiao.

769
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,040
Do you understand what I said?

770
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,480
I understand.

771
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,640
You really do?

772
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,080
- Qi Xiao.
- Ruoxin.

773
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,000
I know

774
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,640
that she's stirring a fuss.

775
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,200
Don't worry, I believe in you.

776
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,160
Don't resign because of me.

777
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,720
Do you think she can get rid of me?

778
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,440
I understand.

779
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,560
Ruoxin, I will find another job.

780
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,800
Don't worry about me.

781
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
Qi Xiao,

782
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,160
let me repeat this

783
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,440
one last time.

784
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,880
The day you decided
to leave the Legal Department,

785
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,840
from then on,

786
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,880
you are my people.

787
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,080
Don't ever say such things like

788
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,880
"Don't worry."

789
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,200
Do you understand?

790
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,320
LIST OF WELFARE ITEMS
OVER THE PREVIOUS YEARS

791
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,440
Ruoxin, what are you writing?

792
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,760
Nuclear weapon.

793
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
What time is it now?

794
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,920
Four o'clock.

795
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,640
She leaves at 4:30 p.m. every day.

796
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,920
I must get this done.

797
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,240
Your coffee.

798
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,360
Americano. No milk. No sugar.

799
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,840
WELFARE PURCHASE PROPOSAL

800
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,640
Resignation letter?

801
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,960
I think

802
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,280
you were right.

803
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,520
I've reflected on it.

804
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,520
My transfer was too sudden.

805
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,200
I should learn from the past

806
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,040
and combine my recent work
at the warehouse and distribution,

807
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,000
familiarize myself with all documents,

808
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,720
and sort out my next job focus
and direction

809
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,760
for you to review.

810
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,160
When I was distributing welfare,

811
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,840
many colleagues have given feedback

812
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,280
on the items they've received
over the years.

813
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,040
They're not happy with it.

814
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,960
And I thought

815
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,760
that it should be rearranged.

816
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,640
The list of company's benefits

817
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,960
and those at our warehouse.

818
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,640
Items that have the most leftovers.

819
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,360
I also searched where the items are from
and who purchased them.

820
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,960
I incorporated the purchase price

821
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,320
and made a statistic to show to you.

822
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,360
In the future,
when you look for suppliers,

823
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,760
you'll have a rough idea

824
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,680
and you can avoid minefields.

825
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,600
What do you think?

826
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,120
Shen Ruoxin.

827
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,120
What do you mean by this?
What are you trying to do?

828
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,040
Ms. Li.

829
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,960
Purchasing welfare items
is the highest priority of our department.

830
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,520
You're most concerned
with the department's budget.

831
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,680
About half of the budget

832
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,000
goes here, right?

833
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,240
Look,

834
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,680
I've written an open letter.

835
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,640
Please have a look.

836
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,640
I've prepared to send this
to all my colleagues in this company

837
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,800
to ask for their advice
on the welfare items.

838
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,760
If you have no opinions or ideas,

839
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,760
I will post it on the forum.

840
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,320
What do you think?

841
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,160
