1
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
- Ms. Zhou, I'll get going now.
- Qi Xiao!

2
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm really sorry.

3
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,160
I wasn't able to help you today.

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,840
You cooked all this food.

5
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,760
And now look.

6
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
You're even taking out the trash.

7
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
Don't mention it.

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,960
Mr. Xu needs a car.

9
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
I need to go anyway.

10
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,680
Call me if you need anything.

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,960
- Bye.
- Bye, Ms. Zhou.

12
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,400
Qi Xiao is a good kid.

13
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,240
Mom, don't try to match him up again.

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Given Xiao'ai's personality,
she'll send him running in two days.

15
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,720
I'm glad they are not dating.

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,440
If they did and broke up,

17
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,960
how would you face Mrs. Wang?

18
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,240
Don't worry. Even if it kills me,

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,840
I won't introduce
another boyfriend to Xiao'ai.

20
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,760
I'm sorry

21
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
for contacting you last minute.

22
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,080
I'm sorry to make you work this late.

23
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
Did you eat?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,160
It's okay, Mr. Xu.
I already ate at Ruoxin's place.

25
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
Okay.

26
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Ruoxin's place?

27
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
Ruoxin's mom invited me
to her house for dinner.

28
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,280
She cooked so much food.

29
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,400
Is her hand all right now?

30
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,800
She has taken off the bandages
and she's better.

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,520
But I did most of the cooking.

32
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,000
I've been so busy lately.

33
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,960
I haven't even visited her.

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,640
All right, Qi Xiao.

35
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,960
I have cordyceps
given by a friend in the trunk.

36
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,480
Help me bring them to her.

37
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
What?

38
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,200
Aren't you and Ruoxin neighbors?

39
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,760
Yes.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Ruoxin told me before.

41
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,680
You live close by.

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,320
It's quite serendipitous.

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,400
You're her assistant.

44
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,360
And you live close to her.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,200
You're able to take care of her for me.

46
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
It's a relief.

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
- Mr. Xu.
- Yes?

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,440
It's my choice to take care of her.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Even without your orders,

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
I would do it anyway.

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,680
Qi Xiao.

52
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,840
You're still young.

53
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,080
You probably don't know

54
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,520
what a woman truly wants.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,480
Mr. Xu.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,800
What do you mean?

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,680
It depends on the woman.

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,000
Ruoxin is special.

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,200
Yes, that's right.

60
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,480
Women are different on the outside.

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,760
But in reality, they're all the same.

62
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,600
They all want a sense of security.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
So as a man,

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
you had better ask yourself first.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who are you?

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
What do you have?

67
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,520
What can you do?

68
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,920
What kind of security can you give her?

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
Do you understand?

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,200
Why are you following me?

71
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,480
Do I have a magnet on me?

72
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,320
Wait.

73
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,080
You were upstairs past 10 p.m.

74
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Why would you be unhappy?

75
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,400
What? Aren't you satisfied?

76
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,640
It was okay.

77
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Look at you grinning from ear to ear.

78
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,240
What about you?

79
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,680
How did it go with You Sijia?

80
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
What do you mean?

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
Don't play dumb.

82
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,160
She's making it so obvious.

83
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,880
Are you going to answer her or not?

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Be straightforward, won't you?

85
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,360
Are you really a man?

86
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
That's a sore spot.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,760
You overthink and plan too far ahead.

88
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,000
I bet you'll be alone all your life.

89
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,600
When you're rich and have a career,

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,680
those who loved you will be long gone.

91
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,320
That's true.

92
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,360
But who can handle the harsh reality?

93
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,040
Qi Xiao, I'm not like you.

94
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,680
- You are--
- A local.

95
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,440
You're always bringing that up.
You're so annoying.

96
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
I know I'm annoying.

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,440
But this is the reality.

98
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,560
Ruoxin's mom told me this today.

99
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,880
So I'm going to say it to you too.

100
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
"Don't belittle the young for being poor."

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,960
You don't even believe in yourself.

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,080
Of course you'll fail.

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I have a message for you too.

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
This isn't like the old days.

105
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,800
Have you heard of the "Gen Z effect"?

106
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm just a small fry.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,960
Who am I to pursue happiness?

108
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,920
Why can't you be happy?
Do ordinary people not have that right?

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
Are small fries not allowed to be happy?

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,720
Yes, there are many people
like Xu Minjie in this society

111
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,520
who drive luxury cars,
drink champagne, and live in mansions.

112
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,080
But there are many
like you, me, and You Sijia.

113
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
Why should we look down on ourselves?

114
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Why should we hand over
our right to define happiness?

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
Take me for an example.

116
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,280
My mom told me this when I was a kid.

117
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,720
Although we're poor

118
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,160
and I don't have a dad,

119
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
as long as I love her and she loves me,

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,720
we can be happy too.

121
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,440
I can't win with you.

122
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
<i>Ruoxin.</i>

123
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Try my sweet and sour pork ribs.

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,600
Dad,

125
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Mom doesn't let me eat
greasy food at night.

126
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
Your mom is grading homework.

127
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,560
She won't notice.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,880
Eat up before it gets cold. Here.

129
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,480
It's so good!

130
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
Mr. Xu, we contacted
this car critic very early on.

131
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,760
He eagerly accepted
our invitation at that time.

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,520
But he flaunted his popularity
and kept stalling on signing.

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
I thought he just wanted to negotiate.

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,160
But he suddenly stood us up.

135
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
I really didn't expect it.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,280
What do you mean?

137
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,880
Ms. Wu,

138
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,520
this isn't your first time working
with a big-time KOL.

139
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
You should know that they delay signing
so they can compare prices.

140
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
They're just using us as a backup.

141
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,440
The event is in three days.

142
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,280
You know how hard it is
to find someone on short notice.

143
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,840
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,200
I already asked someone to reach out
to other KOLs.

145
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,240
We're trying to make up for this mishap.

146
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
This kind of apology is meaningless.

147
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
This isn't the time to apologize.

148
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,600
Our common goal
is to make the event a success.

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,880
Let's put our heads together

150
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,600
to find a solution.

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,600
Does anyone know somebody?

152
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
Anyone?

153
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Ruoxin, why did you stop me?

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
I saw what you were doing.

155
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,320
Do you think I would let you
get me into trouble?

156
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,000
You're paying so much attention to me.

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
I do know somebody.
I'm just not sure if it's the right fit.

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,360
I was just about to ask.

159
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,440
It's the Branding Department's problem.

160
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,400
If it works out,

161
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,080
we don't have to take any credit.

162
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,040
But if it fails,

163
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,960
you'll be the first to be blamed.

164
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,960
Can a newbie like you afford the blame?

165
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
Didn't you hear Mr. Xu?

166
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,840
We work as a team.

167
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,280
My source is reliable.
We can give it a try.

168
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,920
I know you care about me.

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't worry.

170
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,400
You're learning to sweet talk now.

171
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
Why is the coffee so sweet today?

172
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,120
This time,

173
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
how long will the silent treatment last?

174
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
There's no silent treatment.

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,480
You're the one who won't talk to me.

176
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
I know.

177
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,120
You're still mad at me about having a kid.

178
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,000
We can still discuss this issue.

179
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,200
You shouldn't shut me up
by being a server.

180
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,480
You're the one who thought
I stayed at home doing nothing.

181
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,680
Now that I have a job,
you're ashamed of it.

182
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Yes.

183
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
At first,

184
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,320
I only got a job to prove myself.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,120
But I'm having fun at work now.

186
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,520
I think it's nice.

187
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,080
Okay.

188
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,560
I apologize.

189
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,760
I shouldn't have said
you couldn't find a job.

190
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,200
I shouldn't have said
I'm the breadwinner either.

191
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
A family consists of different roles.

192
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
I'm filling a role
that I think I ought to fill.

193
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,840
So will you stop being a server
just to spite me?

194
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,760
Aren't you trying
to embarrass me on purpose?

195
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
How many times have I told you?

196
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,280
Why don't you ever listen?

197
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,280
I'm not working at the bar
to piss you off.

198
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,200
I really like it there!

199
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll get the door.

200
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,400
- Mother! Father!
- Xiaozou.

201
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,040
Mom. Dad. What are you doing here?

202
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
I missed you guys.

203
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
- Come, Father.
- We were in the area.

204
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,240
So we dropped by.

205
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,200
Mother. Father. Please sit down.

206
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

207
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,360
- Father, have a seat.
- Okay.

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,120
Mother and Father are here.

209
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,480
Will you stay home?

210
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,880
Mother. Father. Have a seat first.

211
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,240
I'll bring you some fruit.

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Ever since we moved to Fengxian,

213
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,360
your mom doesn't like coming downtown.

214
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,160
She just looks after the plants at home.

215
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,600
I said we haven't seen
our daughter and son-in-law in a while.

216
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,760
We should visit them.

217
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,920
- Right?
- Yes.

218
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Look.

219
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
Crab with rice cake.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
Your mom made it. It's your favorite.

221
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,640
- It's still hot. Eat up.
- Zou Cheng, come.

222
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,880
- Eat up.
- Dad.

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,880
The reason you come here…

224
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,480
Both of you and I already know.

225
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,920
Your mom

226
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,480
doesn't just grow plants and flowers now,

227
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,080
but vegetables too!

228
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,080
Look at that.

229
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,120
One vine, five melons.

230
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,360
- I brought you the two best ones.
- Right.

231
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,160
There are also
your favorite chili peppers.

232
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,680
Your dad scattered some seeds

233
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,440
and they grew out so well!

234
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,520
Did Zou Cheng get you
to come here to persuade me

235
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,600
not to work

236
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,880
and have kids?

237
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,520
Look at you.

238
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,560
Xiaozou cares about you.

239
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,400
Having you out at night is worrisome.

240
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,720
To be honest,
I'm really worried about you.

241
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,720
You're a woman working at a bar
and with a night shift at that.

242
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,280
Those places aren't safe.

243
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,760
What if you encounter bad people, Ziyan?

244
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,440
Whether you have children or not

245
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
is for you two to work out.

246
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,680
When you said you wanted to be DINK,

247
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,720
we didn't object, did we?

248
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,640
Now that you want to work,

249
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
we're fine with it too.

250
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,960
But you can work during the day instead.

251
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,760
Yes, it's nice to have a normal job.

252
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,760
A bank job

253
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,560
- is a reliable nine-to-five job.
- That's right.

254
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
Even if you can't work at a bank,

255
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,760
you can get an office job.

256
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,040
What did you say you're doing?

257
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
A server at a bar?

258
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
People would laugh if I told them.

259
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
- Mom--
- Yes, Ziyan.

260
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,360
Mother and Father are right.

261
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,720
Stop throwing tantrums.

262
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
Why don't we eat at home today?

263
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,640
Don't go out.

264
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,040
Why not?

265
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,680
Why is everything my fault?

266
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,840
And Mom,

267
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm not a server.

268
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm a kitchen assistant.

269
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,760
Why don't you two ask

270
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,160
why I got a job?

271
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,640
Yes.

272
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,800
Father. Mother.

273
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm also responsible for this.

274
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,920
I didn't ask her how she felt

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
and rushed to get her pregnant.

276
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,120
I've been too busy with work
and inattentive to her.

277
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,600
Ziyan, with Mother and Father here,

278
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,119
I promise you.

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,839
I'll communicate with you more.

280
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,440
Let's talk it out, okay?

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,319
Xiaozou loves you so much.

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,440
We can see that.

283
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,240
Don't let the sun go down on your anger.

284
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,680
Are you still a child?

285
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
Do you need to be coaxed?

286
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,720
If Xiaozou didn't treat you well,
would we take his side?

287
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,040
That's how married couples are.

288
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
There will be conflicts.

289
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm not telling you to just bear with it.

290
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,000
If Zou Cheng is wrong,

291
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,920
you have to say so right away.

292
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,320
You can't be willful.

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Face the problem.

294
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,360
No silent treatment.

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,520
I chose to work at the bar.

296
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,840
No one forced me.

297
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,760
And Mom, I'm having a great time.

298
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,760
Look.

299
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,960
Zou Cheng works every day.

300
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,880
He's busy too.

301
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,840
He has frequent business trips
and works overtime.

302
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,200
If you go out to work at night,

303
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,520
when will you two see each other?

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,160
It will affect your relationship with him.

305
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,360
Then it'll be because
he's too busy with work.

306
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,680
Why should I give up my job?

307
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,360
Mom.

308
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,800
Are women not allowed to live
for themselves after having kids?

309
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,680
You're a small family.

310
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,240
You must weigh the pros and cons.

311
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,280
From the view of household income,

312
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,440
Zou Cheng's job supports the family.

313
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
It's something that your job
at the bar cannot replace.

314
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,480
From your personal point of interest,

315
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,080
I'm certainly pleased that you're happy.

316
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,640
But working at a bar
isn't the only way to make that happen.

317
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
Now let's take a step back.

318
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,240
Back when you quit your job
to travel the world,

319
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,760
I didn't approve, did I?

320
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,240
But you said

321
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,240
you can handle the consequences.

322
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
Then what about now?

323
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,200
Have you really faced the consequences?

324
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,360
Ziyan?

325
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Ziyan!

326
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
What is it this time?

327
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,240
I asked for sugar. You gave me salt.

328
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,720
- Here.
- Okay.

329
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,960
So that's what's going on.

330
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,280
I think my mom has a point.

331
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,240
Why am I acting like a wayward child?

332
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,080
I don't know what to do now.

333
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,440
Look.

334
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,000
THIS PLACE'S NEW ALMOND TOFU DESSERT
IS ON POINT!

335
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
So?

336
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
You might get into a lot of trouble,

337
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,080
but many people envy you.

338
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,080
But whether it's trouble or envy,

339
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,720
it's someone else's voice.

340
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,280
You have to ask yourself
what your heart says.

341
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,920
Did you get this job out of spite?

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Or did you want to find a job you love?

343
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,880
I also don't know what I was thinking.

344
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,160
Then flip the coin.

345
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,760
Let fate decide.

346
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
Hello, Ruoxin?

347
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm almost done here.

348
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,480
Are you sure you don't need me?

349
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,840
No, I got it.

350
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,840
If you insist on coming,

351
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,520
you can wait
until I've finalized all the terms

352
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,840
for you to sign.

353
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,280
Okay, I'll throw a celebration for you.

354
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,640
<i>Okay.</i>

355
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,480
So? Is he here?

356
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,400
Yes.

357
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,640
I had to promise him a free outfit.

358
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,640
He sounds difficult.

359
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,080
Try talking to him.

360
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,040
Come on.

361
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,240
Sir.

362
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,280
This is Qi Xiao.

363
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Qi Xiao, this is Mr. Wind Rush,
a celebrity in the car industry.

364
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,320
Have a seat.

365
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,080
Hello, I've heard a lot about you.

366
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm from Zenpro Automotive.

367
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,000
Call me Qi Xiao.

368
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,960
This is my business card.

369
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,640
Zhu Lin?

370
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
Do you manage this store by yourself?

371
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,960
You could say that this is a niche brand.

372
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,080
The sales and scope are limited.
I'm on my own for the time being.

373
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,600
- Qi…
- Qi Xiao.

374
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,720
Qi Xiao.

375
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,400
From my understanding,

376
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,200
Zenpro is a pretty big corporation.

377
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,120
Yes.

378
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,440
Our company is considered
a rising star in the industry.

379
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,720
We've distinguished ourselves

380
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,680
and things are going well for now.

381
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,400
In particular, our new energy car.

382
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520
Take a look.

383
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,840
It's a huge corporation.

384
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,080
Did they send you alone
to discuss business with me?

385
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,040
Why did I come here alone?

386
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,680
Because I'm the boss.

387
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,960
The people below me

388
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,480
go out in teams
to discuss business with clients.

389
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,520
Why are you alone?

390
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
An assistant?

391
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,480
If we discuss a collaboration,

392
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
can you call the shots?

393
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
Sir, you must be thirsty.

394
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,080
Have some tea.

395
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
That's hot.

396
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,520
That burnt my tongue.

397
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
My poor tongue is burnt.

398
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,280
The designs in your shop are very nice.

399
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,480
Qi Xiao designed these.

400
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,040
You can have it if you want.

401
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
Your designs are nice.

402
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,880
Why be an assistant?

403
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,840
She's pretty.

404
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,880
Is this your wife?

405
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,320
No, she's a previous client.

406
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,280
A client?

407
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,480
Zhu Lin.

408
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Where is Qi Xiao?

409
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
How did it go with Mr. Wind Rush?

410
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,000
Qi Xiao is…

411
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,520
Ruoxin.

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
Mr. Wind Rush won't talk to me.

413
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,040
He said to have Mr. Xu go
to his office tomorrow.

414
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,320
This is his business card.

415
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,960
Have Mr. Xu talk to him?

416
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,920
He has quite a high opinion of himself.

417
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll meet him tomorrow.

418
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,680
WIND RUSH AGENCY

419
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,560
Mr. Wind Rush,

420
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,440
I've reviewed your quote.

421
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,040
Let's not beat around the bush.

422
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,600
Can we negotiate on the price?

423
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,600
Ms. Shen, to be honest,

424
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,160
our top promotional stories

425
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,760
are booked for three whole three months.

426
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
Since Zhu Lin referred you,

427
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
I'm fitting you in.

428
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,000
Your event is so last minute.
It's in less than two days.

429
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
All my employees
will have to work overtime,

430
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,760
sacrifice eating,
sleeping, drinking, or dating

431
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,720
to do this for you.

432
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,680
That's why the price is very reasonable.

433
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,480
I know your team is outstanding.

434
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,640
We also know that
your team previously focused

435
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,360
on campaigns for conventional vehicles.

436
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,680
You've probably never dabbled

437
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,320
with our new energy car.

438
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,240
So from our perspective,

439
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,040
the value is in the experience.

440
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,400
Yes, we have a tight timeframe,

441
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,080
but rather than blindly choosing someone,

442
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,440
we care more that the content

443
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,920
doesn't lead consumers astray.

444
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,360
Look.

445
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,320
I'll give you an example.

446
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,200
Take Zhu Lin as an example.

447
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,520
He's a good designer, right?

448
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
His brand, clothes,

449
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,640
as well as materials,

450
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
are on par with the big brands in malls.

451
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
But why doesn't it sell well?

452
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,440
Because his brand has no influence.

453
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,880
He's not a brand.

454
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,520
But our KOLs?

455
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,360
Our KOLs are the brand.

456
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm sure you know.

457
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,000
Our brand is very influential
in the industry.

458
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,560
So trust me.

459
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,360
For us,

460
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,800
new energy vehicles only change
a tiny bit of our content.

461
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
We'll be fine.

462
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,200
Sir,

463
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,960
if we work together this time,

464
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,720
it'll be our first collaboration.

465
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,200
I believe that

466
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,040
familiarity and rapport
are built up little by little.

467
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,240
So why don't we both

468
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,080
show a bit more sincerity?

469
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,400
I've looked into the quotations
your team has issued before.

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,800
The quotations you gave us

471
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,160
are indeed

472
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
a lot higher.

473
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,280
How about this?

474
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,800
If you give us an offer

475
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,400
that is on par
with the market price or a little higher,

476
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,360
we'll take it and move forward

477
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,720
with contract negotiations.

478
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,720
What do you think?

479
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,760
We're giving you the usual price.

480
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,720
The price points you gathered

481
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,440
are the offers we give
to longtime clients.

482
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,800
You're a new client. You just got here.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,680
If you get the same offer,
what will I tell my clients?

484
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
Sir,

485
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,360
new friends can become old friends too.

486
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,760
Short-term collaboration
can also become long-term.

487
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,160
It's true that new energy vehicles
are a rising industry,

488
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,520
so if big shots like you

489
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,680
give us a helping hand,
we won't forget it.

490
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
After this collaboration,

491
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm sure we can develop
a close-knit relationship.

492
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,800
So--

493
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,960
I heard you've already put out ads
for your test-drive event.

494
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,520
So far,

495
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,520
you still haven't found the right KOL yet.

496
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,040
Taking on your project at this price,

497
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,720
we are already doing you a huge favor.

498
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,400
That's hot.

499
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,040
Xiaozhang!

500
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
Give me something cooler!

501
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,120
Is that enough to bring you down?

502
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,080
I just feel that I've wasted your time.

503
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,880
We didn't get a deal.

504
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,480
We didn't know Mr. Wind Rush before,

505
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,160
but after this encounter,

506
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,760
I think he's too difficult to work with.

507
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,600
If we do work with him in the future,

508
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,000
he'll take advantage
of our time constraints

509
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,800
to make one ridiculous request
after another.

510
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,680
When the time comes,

511
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,240
we'll have to keep compromising.

512
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,360
That's why I think a failed deal

513
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,760
is actually a good thing.

514
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,440
The Branding Department
doesn't have a deal either.

515
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,040
Can we make it in time?

516
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,280
I think our visit today wasn't in vain.

517
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,120
After talking to him,

518
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,280
it has broadened my horizons.

519
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,320
For our conventional vehicles,
we mostly reached out

520
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,280
to automotive technology critics
and KOLs on the driving experience.

521
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
But this time,
we're making a new energy vehicle.

522
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,200
Its main feature is clean energy.

523
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,320
So I'm thinking that

524
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,360
maybe we can invite

525
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,600
technology, lifestyle,

526
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,120
and sustainability KOLs

527
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,680
to help us promote
our stargazing-in-the-city event.

528
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
You can't beat wisdom in old age.

529
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,880
Who are you calling old?

530
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,800
Me.

531
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,440
Do you feel better?

532
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
Was I too naive?

533
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,240
I met him once
at a gathering with Zhu Lin.

534
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,440
I thought we could strike an easy deal.

535
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,800
Some friends do help,

536
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
but others will take advantage of you.

537
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Don't assume that

538
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,880
friends you met while drinking
can be a resource.

539
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
You lose if you think like that.

540
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,680
Live and learn.

541
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,120
What's wrong, Ziyan?

542
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,840
Where?

543
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,680
Are you hungry?

544
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,320
I'll see you at our usual place.

545
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
Okay. See you later.

546
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,080
Let's go. I'll treat you to a feast.

547
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
So this is a feast?

548
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Young man,

549
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,400
you'll be ashamed of
your youth and ignorance soon.

550
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I already did, a little while ago.

551
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,720
This place was our favorite
when we were in college.

552
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,360
And after all these years,
the taste is still the same.

553
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,560
If it's not good, I'll be your assistant.

554
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,120
It's not good.

555
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
I'll eat it.

556
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,560
I'll just eat it.

557
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,440
It's delicious.

558
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,440
Has he never eaten before?

559
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,560
He's still growing up.

560
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
Is it good?

561
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,120
It's okay.

562
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll be right back.

563
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,920
It's nice to be young.

564
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,600
They can do anything they want

565
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,680
without worry.

566
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,560
Look at how sad you are.

567
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,160
You look like an old lady.

568
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,080
Look at you. You haven't changed.

569
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,240
I thought you might regret
breaking up with Cui Lixin.

570
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,240
But look at you now.

571
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,720
You're wiser than I am.

572
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
Shen Ruoxin,

573
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,760
are you really going to remain celibate?

574
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,760
What does that mean?

575
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,720
I always hear my seniors say,

576
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
"You should act your age."

577
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,680
I think it's more like,

578
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,560
"Be wise for your age."

579
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,000
At our age, we should understand

580
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,880
that not everyone can see
the view at the top.

581
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,560
What if we're the ship that ran aground?

582
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,280
Then we just rest
until the next wave comes.

583
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,080
I knew it.

584
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,880
A broken heart makes a poet.

585
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,160
I'm that stranded ship.

586
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,560
I've forgotten how I used to look like.

587
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,880
There you go again.

588
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,080
Let me show you.

589
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,640
You can experience it once again.

590
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,440
I can't believe you have
that ugly photo of me!

591
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,560
It's not ugly. You look cool.

592
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,720
When I saw you play the drums,
I went home and dug up my old desktop.

593
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,400
I saved all the pictures.

594
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,280
- Look at this one.
- Shen Ruoxin.

595
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,960
- This one's better.
- Digging up photos? Look here.

596
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,840
- Song Ziyan!
- What?

597
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,160
That's ugly. Delete it!

598
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,640
- It's so ugly!
- No way.

599
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,120
- Delete it!
- No way!

600
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,280
Don't!

601
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,240
Ruoxin, is this you?

602
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,680
- No!
- You used to be fat!

603
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,880
- Give it!
- Were you a sumo wrestler?

604
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I'll beat you up.

605
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,120
Did you get liposuction in Korea?

606
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
- A sumo wrestler.
- Give it!

607
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,440
Ziyan, save me!

608
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,080
- Ziyan!
- I'll kick you!

609
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,280
I'll die!

610
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,000
- Ziyan, have you caught this big dino?
- The big dino?

611
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,840
- Is it that easy?
- Of course.

612
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,840
One more time.

613
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,400
Come on, you try.

614
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,360
Hurry, keep going.

615
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,280
- You can keep playing.
- Hold this.

616
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,400
Ruoxin,

617
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,920
in the normal course of events,

618
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,160
after eating, drinking,

619
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,120
and reminiscing about youthful times,

620
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,280
shouldn't we go home and sleep?

621
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,320
Dear, here's a reminder.

622
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,720
The price of indulgence for grown-ups
is working overtime.

623
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,080
Dear,

624
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,720
I'll tell you a secret too.

625
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,480
When we were eating noodles earlier,

626
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,160
I chatted with college students
about motorcycles.

627
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,560
One of them asked for your number.

628
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Did you give it to him?

629
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,560
Of course not!

630
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,760
I told him that you're already taken.

631
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,360
If he wants a chance,
it'll cost 1,000 yuan up-front.

632
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,520
It's like those popular milk teas online.

633
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,360
He'll be notified when it's his turn.

634
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,160
How could you?

635
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,320
Is he good-looking?

636
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,720
Quite handsome.

637
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,520
But compared to me,

638
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
he falls short just a little bit.

639
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,680
Stop bragging.
You called me a sumo wrestler.

640
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,400
I'll squash you with one foot.

641
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,440
I think it'll take two feet.

642
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,800
One foot won't kill me.

643
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
Get back to work.

644
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,640
The automotive KOL, Car Name Please,

645
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,640
stood us up.

646
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,920
What do we do now?

647
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
The test-drive event is tomorrow.

648
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,840
Don't get me started.
I called a few today.

649
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,840
They're automotive KOLs with influence.

650
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,400
Nobody is free tomorrow.

651
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,600
If no KOLs attend the test-drive event,

652
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,200
we'll be missing
an important piece of publicity.

653
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,560
Why don't we postpone the test-drive event

654
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,360
until we find a KOL?

655
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,040
Do you think this is a joke?

656
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,520
It can't be rescheduled.

657
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,800
We've sent out invitations
to dozens of families.

658
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
The media is coming.

659
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,200
The venue has been booked.

660
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,840
If we change the date now,
our reputation will be ruined.

661
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,040
Think of another solution.

662
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,680
I don't think it's necessary
to have an automotive KOL

663
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
at our test-drive event.

664
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
Ms. Shen, did I hear you right?

665
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,960
Who would we invite
if not an automotive KOL?

666
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,120
An expert on agricultural products?

667
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
Let Ms. Shen finish.

668
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,880
Ms. Shen, tell us

669
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
your reason and idea.

670
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,320
Yes, Mr. Xu.

671
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,760
This test-drive event is a promotion

672
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,560
for a new energy car,

673
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,480
not internal combustion engine vehicles

674
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,040
selling performance,
speed, and driving experience.

675
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,200
That's why I believe we can invite

676
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,680
KOLs on ecotechnology and healthy living

677
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
to our test-drive event.

678
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,520
Ms. Shen, I think
you're right to an extent,

679
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,240
but inviting KOLs who aren't
car enthusiasts to a test-drive

680
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,760
is unprecedented.

681
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,320
Besides, we don't have
the data analysis to support this.

682
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm worried that
it might affect our campaign.

683
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,200
The theme of this test-drive event

684
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,120
is stargazing in the city.

685
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,720
We're promoting a new energy car
that reduces exhaust emissions

686
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,960
and protects our environment.

687
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
So I think

688
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,720
ecotechnology and healthy lifestyle KOLs

689
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,240
are a better fit

690
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,800
with the main selling point
of our new energy car.

691
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,040
It might be more effective.

692
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,120
But we've never invited
non-automotive KOLs.

693
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,120
Which KOLs might be suitable
for this type of event?

694
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,680
Don't worry about that.

695
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,400
We've done our homework.

696
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,880
Please look at the screen.

697
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,600
First, we sorted through

698
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,560
the categories of sustainability,
technology, and healthy living

699
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,600
for the most influential KOLs.

700
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,160
Then we focused on finding
those who have a connection to cars.

701
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,200
Even so,

702
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,320
we only have one day left.

703
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,640
Besides, tomorrow's test-drive event
runs on a tight schedule.

704
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,760
We don't even know
if they're available yet.

705
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,080
That's the third condition
we took into account.

706
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,560
We narrowed down our options

707
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,440
and we have two people

708
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,600
with influence,

709
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,640
a connection to cars,

710
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,120
and are available tomorrow.

711
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,520
One is Green Frog,
a KOL on eco-friendly lifestyle.

712
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,480
And the other is Professor Teng,
a KOL on ecotechnology.

713
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,360
We've already reached out to them

714
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
and they've expressed their interest.

715
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,760
I believe we can ask Green Frog

716
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,040
to be our chief health officer

717
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,600
and Professor Teng
to be our chief sustainability officer.

718
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,080
They can help steer our project.

719
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,880
We can publish this

720
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,200
in tomorrow's press release.

721
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,480
Are you sure these two are available?

722
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,640
It has been confirmed, Mr. Xu.

723
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Then it's decided.

724
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,560
Ms. Shen will be in charge of

725
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,240
tomorrow's test-drive event.

726
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,520
From now on, all of you

727
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,480
will follow her arrangements.

728
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,880
Time is of the essence.

729
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Go and get ready.

730
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,000
Meeting adjourned.

731
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,680
Get ready.

732
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,040
Mr. Xu, if there's nothing else,
I'll get back to work.

733
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,960
Hold on.

734
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,880
You were very confident in your solution.

735
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,880
I can see that

736
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
you did a lot of research
in your own time.

737
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
I put more effort
into things I'm interested in.

738
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,160
I like to challenge my career goals.

739
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,160
It's all up to you tomorrow.

740
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,680
Do it right.

741
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,720
Yes, Mr. Xu.

742
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,160
I'll do my best.

743
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,800
Hurry, we have to finish setting up
before the event in the afternoon.

744
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,000
- Okay.
- Thank you.

745
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,000
Be careful.

746
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,840
Bring everything inside.

747
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,320
Ruoxin.

748
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,760
Why are there so many boxes?

749
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,200
We have a parent-and-child theme.

750
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,720
Families will be attending
with their children.

751
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,480
We need to provide booster car seats

752
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
or they won't be able to drive.

753
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,200
Driving without one
would be a traffic violation.

754
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,160
Professional.

755
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,840
Here, bring it over here.

756
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,360
FAMILY 5, RED TANG EV,
QUANTITY 1/ NAVY BLUE

757
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,720
Ruoxin, you're so meticulous.

758
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,720
This customer experience
is practically out of this world.

759
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,360
Stop sucking up and get to work.

760
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,640
Watch and learn.

761
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,560
- Go.
- Okay.

762
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Load them in.

763
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,120
Be careful.

764
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,000
Does a test-drive event
require so many toys?

765
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,840
This is like a toddler's playdate!

766
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,800
- Here.
- You don't understand.

767
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,040
Ruoxin said

768
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,200
the kids might throw tantrums at the event

769
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,720
and distract the adults

770
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
from the test-drive.

771
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,960
That directly affects sales.

772
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,720
By having toys ready,
the kids will be kept calm.

773
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,720
Hey, You Sijia.

774
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,160
Why are you here instead of in the office?

775
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,160
Ruoxin.

776
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,800
We clearly don't have enough staff.

777
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,440
We have a lot of gear. It's messy.

778
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,840
Sijia volunteered to help us.

779
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,040
The office is no fun.

780
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,280
I can work with Ruoxin.

781
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,200
It's a chance to pick up some skills.

782
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,160
It's almost time. I'm going to go first.

783
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,600
I'll leave this to you.

784
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,520
Qi Xiao, aren't you taking
the bus with us?

785
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,040
You don't understand.

786
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,040
This motorcycle is convenient.

787
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,720
It's called experience.

788
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Don't be late.

789
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,080
Okay.

790
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,120
- I'll take this inside.
- Okay.

791
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,880
Hold on.

792
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,880
Here.

793
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,680
Buckle it tight.

794
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,200
All right.

795
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,600
Drive carefully.

796
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,600
- Okay.
- Go on.

797
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,840
Bye.

798
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,640
Come on, let's head out.

799
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,120
Stop posing.

800
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,840
Hey, you.

801
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,440
How's the setup going?

802
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,400
Our three new energy test-drive cars
are in place.

803
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,080
That's enough to allow several guests
a test-drive at the same time.

804
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,520
The stage is set.

805
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,120
The lights, stereo, and all equipment
have been checked

806
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,080
and are ready for use.

807
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,960
On-site security has been notified
to be at the venue by 4 p.m.

808
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,320
The documents and releases

809
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
for reporters and KOLs
have also been arranged.

810
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,600
Not bad.

811
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,160
You're making progress.

812
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,200
Of course.

813
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,960
I earned my reputation.

814
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,000
Have you watched too many
Hong Kong martial arts films?

815
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,160
Hong Kong martial arts films?

816
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,840
I'm saying everything is ready.

817
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,680
Did you contact the farm and plantation?

818
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,200
Of course.
I called to remind them yesterday.

819
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,640
Just a call?

820
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,640
- That's right.
- Farms are privately-owned.

821
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,720
They're not used
to providing professional service.

822
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,600
You have to be there in person

823
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,320
to make sure the process is clear.

824
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,320
Our clients will be here soon.

825
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,120
What will you do if something happens?

826
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,880
Okay, I understand. I'll go now.

827
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,880
Wait, I'll go with you

828
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,320
and check for myself.

829
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,280
Ruoxin, leave the unloading to me.

830
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,240
I'm counting on you, Sijia.
Make sure you keep an eye on it.

831
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,120
- Don't worry. I'll do a good job.
- Okay, go.

832
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,920
I got it.

833
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:35,960
It's okay.

834
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,760
Come on.

835
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,120
