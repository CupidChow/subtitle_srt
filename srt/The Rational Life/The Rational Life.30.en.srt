1
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
- Hello?
<i>- Ruoxin.</i>

2
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,960
<i>Can we have lunch near your company?</i>

3
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,680
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

4
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,480
Mr. Gu is asking me for help?

5
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,640
<i>I've been back for quite some time.</i>

6
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,840
<i>Actually, I'm comparing cars these days.</i>

7
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
<i>I used to drive
new energy vehicles in Singapore.</i>

8
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
<i>But I'm really unfamiliar with local cars.</i>

9
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
<i>So I thought I should ask you.</i>

10
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Okay, no problem.

11
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Let's meet later.

12
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,480
- Ruoxin, come and sit.
- Thank you.

13
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,400
I didn't expect
that I'd acquire a new client.

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm very particular about cars.

15
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,960
If your new energy vehicle is good enough,

16
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,520
then I'll become a client.

17
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course.

18
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,960
We will meet your requirements.

19
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,240
Here's some information I got today
for the models we have launched.

20
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Each has its advantages

21
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,440
and is suitable for driving in the city.

22
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,000
After lunch,

23
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
you can follow me to our flagship store

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,400
to look at the real car

25
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
and you can have a test-drive.

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,000
Sure, buying a car is more than

27
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
just about aesthetics.

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,200
I'll take a look at this.
Go ahead and order.

29
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,200
- Okay.
- Waiter.

30
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,080
Last time when we had dinner,

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,120
you said you have a boyfriend now.

32
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,920
Who is he? Which industry is he in?

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Why are you gossiping?

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
I'm not gossiping.

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,040
We need clients on my line too.

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
I just returned and I don't know anyone.

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,680
I need old friends' recommendations.

38
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,600
He's in design.

39
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
He's a very sensible boy.

40
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Boy? Is he younger?

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
Is he the one
we had dinner with yesterday?

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,760
Correct.

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
It's him.

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
But

45
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,080
my mom doesn't know.

46
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
So please keep it a secret.

47
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
I really didn't expect it.

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,519
Expect what?

49
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,560
My impression of you

50
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,000
is someone who's opinionated,

51
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,600
won't make rash decisions,
and is always logical.

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
You have solid life plans

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
and life goals.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,240
I thought you're the kind

55
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
who likes to be conquered.

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,400
- "Be conquered"?
- Yes.

57
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,920
You just said I'm opinionated

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,200
and hardly rash.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,960
How did you come to the conclusion

60
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
that I would be conquered by someone?

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Something is wrong with your logic.

62
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
You got me wrong.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
What I meant of being conquered is…

64
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
you should find someone

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,360
who's successful in his career

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,200
and not someone like…

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
A truly independent woman

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
does not need to be attached
to a strong man

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,200
to live her life.

70
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know what's the definition

71
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,360
of your so-called "success."

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,120
Maybe in your eyes,
Qi Xiao is not successful,

73
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,920
but in my eyes,

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
I think

75
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,760
he has potential and is very capable.

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,920
You've misunderstood me.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
I'm just considering this

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,400
from an old friend's perspective.

79
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,920
As they say,

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
five years age difference
is considered a generation gap.

81
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
Youngsters nowadays

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
are volatile and unpredictable.

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,720
Plus, they're impulsive in relationships

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
and unreliable.

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
As an old friend,

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,880
I'm afraid you'll fall

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,160
and hurt yourself.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,520
Actually, I have been

89
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,160
in short-term relationships

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
and had other suitors.

91
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
I can clearly feel that

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,040
they just wanted what's best for them.

93
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,080
I see it all too clearly.

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,200
But with Qi Xiao, there's no such thing.

95
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
It's just plain, simple happiness.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm enjoying this whole thing.

97
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,760
I think

98
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,440
this is how love should be, right?

99
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,720
Love?

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,840
I haven't heard that term for years.

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,680
Then do you think this love will last?

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,880
Just like you didn't know

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,400
when you first got married

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,240
that you'll leave her one day, right?

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,880
Future matters

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
are out of our control.

108
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,000
We have to enjoy the moment.

109
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,800
All relationships take time

110
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,520
and will have its ups and downs.

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,080
But what's important is,
when faced with troubles,

112
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
both of us can stand together

113
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,800
and overcome them.

114
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,480
That's why I think everything is good now.

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,880
As long as you're happy.

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
But I can't imagine

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,040
what Ms. Zhou would say
when she finds out.

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
Slowly,

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
she'll accept it.

120
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,040
Hello?

121
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,680
<i>You left early today.
Is there something urgent at work?</i>

122
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,440
Urgent notice.

123
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
A new vice president has been appointed.

124
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,240
Everyone is informed ahead of time

125
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,840
that we need to have a meeting.

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>I must go early to prepare a report.</i>

127
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,040
Hot Americano medium size.

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,880
Your coffee.

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
That's fast.

130
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,800
It has already been paid for.

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,040
Thank you.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
Qi Xiao,

133
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,360
how many spies do you have?

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,000
I told you

135
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,480
that I'll be responsible
for your coffee from now on.

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,160
So you told them
to make me such a small cup?

137
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm helping you control your intake.

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
What's a little difference
going to do to me?

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
<i>Doesn't it save your time?</i>

140
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
It can be made in advance.

141
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,680
You don't have to wait, right?

142
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,800
All right, have a good day. Bye.

143
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,120
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Ruoxin, here's the report you requested.

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,240
But the latest figures are not in yet.

146
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,360
I went to the Sales Department
this morning,

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
but the new vice president

148
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,600
is their immediate superior.

149
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,840
They are very busy now.

150
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
This is the best that I can do.

151
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,120
Thank you for your work. I'll do the rest.

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Ruoxin,

153
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,880
did Mr. Xu mention

154
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,120
the newly appointed leader's background?

155
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,679
I've heard a lot of rumors.

156
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,120
What sort of rumors?

157
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,440
The HR Department sent word

158
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
that she's a lady.

159
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
We were disappointed.

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
The new leader is a lady?
What's the problem?

161
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,120
Mr. Liu is too powerful.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,240
We had hoped that the new leader

163
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,880
could challenge Mr. Liu

164
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
and fight for the New Energy Department.

165
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,520
Look at the executives under Mr. Liu.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,640
They are arrogant and domineering.

167
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,640
One small mistake and you'll be bullied.

168
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,680
With a lady boss,

169
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,280
how can we fight back?

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,600
Are you guys skeptical of a lady boss?

171
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
I don't mean you.

172
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,880
When you and Mr. Xu were cooperating,

173
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,800
it was fantastic!

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,480
So you think that, in the workplace,

175
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,720
women deserve to be only in second place

176
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
and can't be independent enough

177
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,920
to take the lead at the top?

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
That's not what I mean.

179
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,720
It doesn't matter.

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
The key is the results.

181
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,080
I believe in the headquarters and Mr. Xu.

182
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,320
They have their reasons.

183
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,840
Okay, I'll go back to work.

184
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
Ruoxin,

185
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
Mr. Xu

186
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,920
just come and go.

187
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,040
Initially, I thought

188
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,520
you were sincerely following him.

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,520
He should have taken you
to the headquarters.

190
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,120
Since he didn't,

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,080
he should have at least promoted you.

192
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
In the end,

193
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,520
he sent us a new leader.

194
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,480
If I were you, I would've panicked.

195
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,560
You're too serious, Ms. Li.

196
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,920
As employees of the company,

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
without a doubt,

198
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,320
we'll do our best for the company.

199
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,760
Now that the headquarters has sent us
a vice president,

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,080
I believe everyone
at the New Energy Department

201
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,520
is very delighted.

202
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,320
I say, Ruoxin,

203
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,440
what a high EQ.

204
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,720
Even without a leader,

205
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
she's still loyal.

206
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,520
- We should learn from her.
- Yes.

207
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes. You know,

208
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,880
I heard this new leader

209
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,240
is also a woman, right?

210
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
Mr. Xu is so unusual.

211
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,440
He likes to use female generals, right?

212
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,760
That's also part of their capabilities.

213
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,480
Look at how sarcastic you're being.

214
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,200
You're envious, aren't you?

215
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
It depends on your abilities.

216
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
But I heard this newcomer…

217
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,920
Ms. Fang, was it?

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,480
She's from the Sales Department.

219
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,840
Women in the Sales Department

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,880
are all tough cookies.

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
She's either a fox

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
or a female bandit.

223
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,280
Ms. Li, I do not agree

224
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
with what you just said.

225
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,920
If Ms. Fang

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,960
has proven herself
in a predominantly male sector

227
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,320
like the Sales Department,

228
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,960
this means she has overcome
many prejudices

229
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,080
and has put in more effort than others.

230
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,800
Don't you think so?

231
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,000
Everyone,

232
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,680
this is the vice president
from the headquarters.

233
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,440
Our new leader
at the New Energy Department

234
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,360
and the Sales Department, Ms. Fang.

235
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,840
Welcome.

236
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,800
Nice to meet you. My surname is Fang,

237
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,600
but I prefer to be called Lisa.

238
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm new here, but I'd like to take
this chance to meet everyone.

239
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Mr. Liu isn't here yet?

240
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
Before I arrived,

241
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,360
I did some basic research on East China

242
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
- and I understand…
- Lisa,

243
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,720
Mr. Liu has some tasks at hand,

244
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,960
but he'll be here soon.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,360
While waiting for Mr. Liu,

246
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,920
let me briefly introduce myself.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,600
I started at the headquarters
more than ten years ago

248
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,040
as a first-line salesperson

249
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,720
to the sales director
and the management team.

250
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,680
I believe the headquarters sent me here

251
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
due to my background
in the Sales Department.

252
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,560
We, the people in the Sales Department,

253
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,840
have clear goals.

254
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,080
Only numbers speak.

255
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,320
Thus, my management style

256
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,840
is direct and straightforward.

257
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,960
I wish to minimize our communication costs
to reach our goals.

258
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,880
Of course,

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,680
if I offend anyone in the future,

260
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,280
I would like to apologize in advance.

261
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm impartial.

262
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Everything I do

263
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,040
is for the company.

264
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm very sorry.

265
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,240
I was suddenly delayed.

266
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,080
Everyone is here. Welcome.

267
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,720
- I'm Liu Pei.
- Lisa.

268
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,600
Mr. Liu.

269
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,200
If you're late next time,

270
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,520
please inform us.

271
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,360
We're all busy.
There's no need to sit here and wait.

272
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,480
My mistake.

273
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,640
Lisa,

274
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,120
you've just arrived
and still unfamiliar with everything.

275
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,520
Let me introduce ourselves.

276
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
The company has two departments,

277
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,520
the department for traditional fuel
vehicles and new energy vehicles,

278
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,440
with unified management and planning.

279
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,920
The leaders of some of the departments
are here today.

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ms. Li

281
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
- from the Administration Department
- I'm Li Fang.

282
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,400
Mr. Ruan Ye from the Legal Department.

283
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Mr. Liao

284
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
is the sales director.

285
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,280
And Mr. Bao from the PR Department.

286
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,120
They are my old subordinates.

287
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
They are always on duty.

288
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,520
Did you hear me?

289
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,160
From now, whatever Ms. Fang needs,

290
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
give full cooperation to it.

291
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,960
No need to report everything to me.

292
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,080
We're all elites here.

293
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
We are now comrades in arms.

294
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm late today.

295
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Let me represent the Shanghai branch

296
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
and welcome Ms. Fang.

297
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,400
A round of applause.

298
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Thank you, everyone.

299
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,960
Now that we've all gathered,
I'll be upfront.

300
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,280
Let me announce

301
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,160
the headquarters' latest plans
for the East China region.

302
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,400
Soon, the East China branch will have
traditional and new energy cars.

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,640
Two business divisions.

304
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
Independent but cooperating.

305
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,680
Independent?

306
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,360
That is to say,
these two divisions will not overlap,

307
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
be it in work or management styles

308
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,800
as well as regular meetings
and work reports.

309
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,040
They will be separated.

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,880
Mr. Liu.

311
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,800
In the future, the New Energy Department

312
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
will no longer concern you.

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,120
Legal Department, Finance Department,
and Administration Department.

314
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
Separate your affairs with haste.

315
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,320
The person in charge
will have to attend both meetings.

316
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,640
Give full cooperation

317
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
while performing both processes.

318
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,280
What are you looking at?

319
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,520
I agree.

320
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,120
Headquarters has thought it over.

321
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Since the establishment
of the New Energy Department,

322
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,920
we've had management issues
and a few accidents.

323
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,560
Also, Mr. Xu

324
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,840
left abruptly

325
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,080
with loose ends unresolved.

326
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,120
It's all good now

327
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,920
with this arrangement.

328
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,160
With a clear structure,

329
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,320
our roles are clearer

330
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
and we can work better.

331
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,440
Right, Ms. Fang?

332
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Thank you, Mr. Liu,
for your understanding.

333
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
The new rules are in process

334
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,560
and will be applied soon.

335
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm informing you about this now

336
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,840
as I hope everyone has a new plan.

337
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
Make your statement.

338
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,800
I think, Lisa,

339
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,600
the issue is not about cooperating.

340
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,160
If the company is divided

341
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,960
into two divisions,

342
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,400
the people in charge like us

343
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
will be overwhelmed.

344
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,960
To hold two regular meetings

345
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,640
would be hard on us.

346
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
My regular meetings

347
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
will try not to coincide with Mr. Liu.

348
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,040
Of course,

349
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,600
once we are at the peak
of the marketing season,

350
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,280
everyone will be tied up.

351
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,280
If anyone thinks

352
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,120
the current staff aren't enough
to complete these tasks,

353
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,760
you can bring it up to me

354
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
and I will inform Mr. Xu.

355
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,960
We'll see if we need the HR Department

356
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
to recruit people of the same level

357
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,360
to take charge

358
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,720
of splitting up the department.

359
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,160
What do you think?

360
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,080
The Administration Department is fine

361
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,240
because our work isn't as demanding.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,760
We can, of course,

363
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,800
as you said,

364
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
we'll cooperate.

365
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Mr. Ruan.

366
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,840
No problem from the Legal Department.

367
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll do my best to cooperate.

368
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,080
Then I'll have an individual consultation
with everyone.

369
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,960
Mr. Liu, if there's nothing else,

370
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,280
that's all from me today.

371
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Yes, sure.

372
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,600
Ms. Shen, come to my office in an hour.

373
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,280
Okay.

374
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
That's it?

375
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,240
After the meeting,
the boss said to expect big changes.

376
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,599
What does it mean?

377
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,160
The new vice president came
and Mr. Liu was reassigned.

378
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,119
The New Energy Department stands alone.

379
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Let me tell you something.

380
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,440
The new vice president

381
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
is quite something.

382
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,760
She looks pleasant,

383
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,960
but she's aggressive.

384
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,960
After the meeting, she wanted
to talk one-on-one with the leaders

385
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
to report on their work.

386
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,560
Then has Mr. Ruan talked to her yet?

387
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
It's not his turn yet,

388
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,600
but he looks very pressured.

389
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,800
What should we do then?

390
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Before, we had to tiptoe around Mr. Liu.

391
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,560
Now, the company is divided into two.

392
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
We are forced to choose sides.

393
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,800
What if we ended up on the wrong side?

394
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,080
Enter.

395
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,320
Lisa.

396
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
I've organized a report

397
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,600
on the New Energy Department
for the past three months

398
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,880
and added the latest sales figures.

399
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,880
Please check.

400
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,240
It's very clear.

401
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,160
I especially like this summary

402
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,640
and suggestion column.

403
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
I can tell, Ms. Shen,

404
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
you've put in the effort.

405
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,120
It's my duty.

406
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,240
Sit.

407
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,160
Thank you.

408
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Before I came, Mr. Xu had mentioned you

409
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,240
many times.

410
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,680
He said that the situation in East China
is a bit complicated

411
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
and that you'll be a great help to me.

412
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Now, I believe him.

413
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm from the Sales Department

414
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,440
and I value

415
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,040
efficiency and results.

416
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
They say mixed methods
in the workplace are crucial.

417
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,760
But I think being direct
isn't such a bad thing at times.

418
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,280
Indeed,

419
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,520
especially when the situation
is complicated.

420
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,880
The headquarters has devised a strategy
for the New Energy Department.

421
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,520
Now, the hardest part

422
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
is to remove the weak

423
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,360
and establish new ground.

424
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,920
Liu Pei

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
is old-school.

426
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
He relies on seniority
and winning people's hearts

427
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,560
to establish power

428
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,160
and he thinks
everything is going to be okay.

429
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,480
The New Energy Department

430
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
will be the catalyst for change.

431
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,640
Although we are now independent,

432
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,800
the headquarters' resources are limited.

433
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,440
The rest is up to us.

434
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,760
I'm honored

435
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,400
to be your comrade in arms.

436
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,080
I will do my best

437
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,080
to fight for this department.

438
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,480
Before I arrived,

439
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,920
I heard rumors

440
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,680
that this department

441
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
was established by you and Mr. Xu.

442
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,800
Yet you were not promoted
and I was brought over.

443
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,240
Do you have any opinion on that?

444
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Lisa.

445
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,720
Honestly,

446
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
with my qualifications,

447
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
even if I was promoted,
I won't make it to where you are now.

448
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,400
If it's not mine, I do not want it.

449
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
If it's mine,

450
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,920
I will slowly gain it.

451
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,640
You're straightforward.

452
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I like it.

453
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Thank you.

454
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
I'm really happy

455
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,280
with the headquarters' decision to bring

456
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
someone like you over.

457
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,760
Why?

458
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,560
I was like the others.

459
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,800
I didn't expect

460
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
the new leader to be a woman.

461
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,600
But

462
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,760
your performance and qualifications

463
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,560
are outstanding

464
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,120
and made true by yourself.

465
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,040
You're a good example
and a role model for me at work.

466
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,720
I hope one day,

467
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,840
I can be a strong woman like you.

468
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,360
"Strong woman"?

469
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,520
These are not easy words.

470
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
If men are strong,

471
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,200
people say that it's only natural.

472
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,440
But if women are strong,

473
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,920
we get oppressed by others.

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If men have goals and ambitions,

475
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,480
we praise them.

476
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,680
If women have goals and ambitions,

477
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,800
people will be on guard.

478
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,200
Ms. Shen,

479
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,480
if you're taking me as an example,

480
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,200
the first thing you have to do

481
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,960
is to not be swayed by others' comments.

482
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't retract and surrender

483
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,120
just because you're a woman

484
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,960
and you haven't reached your goals.

485
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,360
I'll remember that.

486
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Thank you, Lisa.

487
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

488
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,680
Hello?

489
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,280
Has the meeting ended?

490
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
<i>Yes.</i>

491
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,800
How's the new vice president?

492
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,640
A decision-maker.

493
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,960
Liu Pei has met his rival.

494
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,480
This lady boss gave me so much confidence.

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,960
It's a lady boss?

496
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,440
<i>Do you have any doubts?</i>

497
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,280
No,

498
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,840
I wouldn't dare.

499
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,240
You know that

500
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,520
I love lady bosses.

501
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,440
Should we have dinner tonight?

502
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
Are you taking the initiative

503
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,280
to ask me out on a date?

504
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm always available.

505
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
Let's celebrate tonight.

506
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,560
See you tonight.

507
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,520
Hi, Mr. Ruan.

508
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
Mr. Liu, are you looking for me?

509
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,120
Mr. Liu.

510
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
No, I…

511
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,160
Mr. Liu, just now,

512
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,800
I was busy with a contract.

513
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,440
I came as soon as I'm done.

514
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,760
Have you reported your work?

515
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,120
I was just about to report to you.

516
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,880
This woman is too difficult.

517
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,200
She was picking on details to ask me!

518
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,720
She told Ms. Li

519
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
that she wants to prepare

520
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,880
a new office
with a report system software.

521
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,280
All office procedures and documents

522
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,680
must be transparent and electronic.

523
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
She has also assigned a task
to the IT Department

524
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
to set up an internal forum.

525
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
And I am not aware

526
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,120
about any of these.

527
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,040
No, what's her intention?

528
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,320
What's she up to?

529
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Don't you understand?

530
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,040
Human relations are complicated.

531
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,080
She's opening a new platform

532
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,400
for those at the bottom

533
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
to see everything clearly.

534
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,680
Once the office process is transparent,

535
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,160
everyone's responsibilities

536
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,840
and the company's resources

537
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,120
will be clear to all.

538
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,520
You guys

539
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
can't go against the law anymore.

540
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,200
This lady,

541
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,160
compared to Mr. Xu,

542
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,120
is a lot more aggressive.

543
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
It's not easy.

544
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,960
You see,

545
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,640
she's on my turf.

546
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,760
If she conspires against me,

547
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,400
she will not get away so easily.

548
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,360
But she's the opposite.

549
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,880
She initiated changes

550
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,280
and got me tied up.

551
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,000
Now, I can't say anything.

552
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,240
It's true.

553
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
Women are deadly.

554
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
Ruoxin, how is it?

555
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,000
Just a moment ago,

556
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,680
we heard a lot of rumors.

557
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,440
Everyone, check your shopping cart.

558
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,840
- Shopping cart?
- What do you mean?

559
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,040
We've worked hard these past few months.

560
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,240
Last quarter's bonus

561
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
and special allowance
from the test-drive event

562
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,120
have been approved by Ms. Fang.

563
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,480
It's time to empty your shopping carts.

564
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,480
- Amazing.
- That's great!

565
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,760
Good news on the first day
she's in the office.

566
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,480
- We have support now.
- Yes.

567
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Not just that,

568
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,160
I heard that during the work report,

569
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,640
she had a good grasp
of all heads of department too.

570
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
She is so amazing!

571
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,640
It's a pity Qi Xiao isn't here.

572
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,680
Don't worry.

573
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
He will be compensated.

574
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,160
We won't let him be the scapegoat.

575
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Ruoxin, with you and Ms. Fang,

576
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,280
the future KPI of our department

577
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,960
- will not be a problem!
- Go for it!

578
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,760
Let's keep up the good work.

579
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,320
- Yes!
- Yes!

580
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,800
Hey, pretty.

581
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,160
Are you available tonight?

582
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,520
You scared me!

583
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,720
Didn't we agree
to not meet at the company?

584
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,400
I've resigned.
Are you still afraid of being discovered?

585
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,360
Don't worry.
Everyone leaves earlier than you.

586
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,520
Everyone knows
you used to be my assistant.

587
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,600
What if people see and gossip?

588
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,800
How long did you wait?

589
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,320
Not long.

590
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,480
I get to observe some beauties.

591
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,080
Which one do you like?

592
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,440
They are not as beautiful as you.

593
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,640
Let go. People are going to see us.

594
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
Let go! Quickly!

595
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

596
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,560
And then?

597
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,560
"Mr. Liu,

598
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,520
next time if you're busy,

599
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,520
please inform us ahead.

600
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,720
Everyone is busy too.

601
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,200
We don't need to wait for you."

602
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
That was a low blow.

603
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,160
Liu Pei must be very upset.

604
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,000
His facial expression was something.

605
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,280
Incredible.

606
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Why wasn't I there? I'd like to see that.

607
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,760
Keep it low.

608
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
I can't control it.

609
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
Why do I feel like

610
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,320
I'm the villain here?

611
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,640
At first,

612
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,880
I thought you were putting up
with the humiliation,

613
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,280
but I was naive.

614
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,160
You're dormant but lethal.

615
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,720
I won't allow you

616
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,160
to be the scapegoat.

617
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,080
You're so nice.

618
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Let me share some good news.

619
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,280
Zhu Lin and I

620
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,960
don't have to apply for a loan.

621
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Zhu Lin found an investor.

622
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,480
Now, we just need to win
the jewelry design contest

623
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,480
and make our name.

624
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,120
This will boost our shop

625
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,960
so that our business will thrive.

626
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,880
That's great.

627
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,680
And the design ideas? Any inspiration?

628
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,800
We're overflowing with inspiration.

629
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,120
Are you that confident?

630
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,240
What's the design theme?

631
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,960
It's a secret.

632
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,360
But you can look forward to it.

633
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,680
It's related to you.

634
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,320
Could it be

635
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,920
something like

636
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,720
a cupid design?

637
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,920
So conventional.

638
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,240
You're underestimating me.

639
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,560
Let's eat.

640
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,800
Try this shrimp.

641
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,120
Hi, number 23's bill.

642
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,360
Sir, the lady has settled the bill.

643
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,320
Thank you.

644
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,240
What's the matter?

645
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,760
Why did you pay?

646
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,360
This should be my treat.

647
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,320
Whenever we had dinner,

648
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,240
I'd pay the bill.

649
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,920
This is not like before.

650
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,280
Before, you were my leader.

651
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,320
Now, you're my girlfriend.

652
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,400
This is also our official first date.

653
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,600
There's no dating policy

654
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,280
that the boyfriend has to pay.

655
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
I don't care about others.

656
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,720
I can't have my girlfriend pay.

657
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,960
Why are you so old-fashioned?

658
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,840
You're in such a hurry to pay.

659
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,480
It makes me feel like I'm Gu Yutao.

660
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,440
It's the same treatment.

661
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,800
Why?

662
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,160
You don't want to be in-debt

663
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
and have a long-lasting relationship?

664
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
Yes, my boyfriend.

665
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,480
From now onwards, you pay, okay?

666
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,080
That's better.

667
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,280
No more next time.

668
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,920
So, my manly boyfriend,

669
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
mealtime is over.

670
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,680
What should we do next?

671
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
The classic dating operation.

672
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
After a meal, it's movie time.

673
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,280
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

674
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,600
Your popcorn.

675
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

676
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,160
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

677
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,400
<i>Have you bought tickets?</i>

678
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,600
Let me tell you.

679
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,920
That horror movie is effective.

680
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Sijia was constantly in my arms.

681
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,840
It's done. I've even bought popcorn.

682
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,800
All the best.

683
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
I wish you luck.

684
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,120
- I'm scared.
- Okay, it's all right.

685
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
My goodness!

686
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,120
It's all right.

687
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,080
I'm here. It's okay.

688
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,360
- I'm here.
- I'm scared.

689
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,400
It's all right.

690
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Don't be scared.

691
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,080
Qi Xiao.

692
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,040
Qi Xiao.

693
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,400
Does it hurt?

694
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,040
We just ate

695
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,000
and you bought a big bucket of popcorn?

696
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,600
We can eat together.

697
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,960
I'm not eating. I'm full.

698
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,440
I can't eat anymore.
Too many calories in that bucket.

699
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,200
At my age, my metabolism isn't like yours.

700
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
- How many days must I run?
- I also just ate.

701
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,360
Popcorns are fine.

702
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,240
I'm not eating. Which hall is it?

703
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,880
- Number three.
- Let's go.

704
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,800
I love watching horror movies.

705
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,240
I've watched <i>The Shining</i> eight times.

706
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,320
Have some popcorn.

707
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
I don't want to. You should eat them.

708
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,520
Are you okay?

709
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm fine.

710
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,120
It's fake.

711
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,280
It's all fake.

712
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,920
That's not right.

713
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,160
Logically, it doesn't make sense.

714
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,400
As a human or as a ghost,

715
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,160
it should appear at least once.

716
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,240
Why are you quiet?

717
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,760
Don't you like the movie?

718
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I liked it.

719
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,160
I just had too much popcorn.

720
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
Then let's go home and rest early.

721
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,880
Wait. That's it?

722
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,880
It's ten o'clock.

723
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,120
I have work tomorrow.

724
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,520
My boyfriend.

725
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,520
Today's date

726
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
makes me very happy.

727
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,360
Didn't you say

728
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,360
the light in the bathroom is broken?

729
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,679
- Do you want--
- I've already

730
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,440
repaired it.

731
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,120
Then

732
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
have a good rest.

733
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,920
Good night.

734
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,680
It's getting chilly.

735
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,520
You should stay warm

736
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,640
and close the windows.

737
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

738
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,520
- Good night.
- Good night.

739
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,800
Then I'm going home.

740
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,280
Why isn't he home yet? It's late.

741
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,160
This boy works so hard every day

742
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,560
and for what reason?

743
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
- Seriously.
- I'll call him.

744
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,440
Sir, ma'am, what are you doing here?

745
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
Qi Xiao.

746
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
We are here to see Su Yang.

747
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,520
Su Yang said he changed jobs

748
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,640
and hasn't called us for a long time.

749
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,680
We are worried,

750
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,920
so we came to see him.

751
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
Qi Xiao,

752
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,120
you got off work quite late.

753
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,840
We have been knocking for half a day.

754
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,760
Su Yang is still working overtime.

755
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,280
I'll give him a call.

756
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,440
- Let's go in first. Come.
- Thank you.

757
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,520
This neighborhood looks good outside,

758
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,800
but the house is too shabby.

759
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,080
This used to be an office, right?

760
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,800
There is so much stuff piled up.

761
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,080
How can you live here?

762
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,480
Ma'am,

763
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,360
our room might look ordinary,

764
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,800
but this neighborhood is great.

765
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,200
Transportation is convenient
for Su Yang and me to get to work.

766
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,120
I say,

767
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,440
you guys are asking for trouble.

768
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,120
For all of that,

769
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,760
the rent is 5,000 yuan a month?

770
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,800
Sir.

771
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,840
Actually, for such a neighborhood
and area,

772
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,840
5,000 yuan is okay.

773
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,440
Please sit. I'll peel some fruits.

774
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
Qi Xiao, don't worry.

775
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,120
When Su Yang returns,
we'll just have a short chat.

776
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,240
Okay.

777
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Sir, ma'am.

778
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,120
When you come to Shanghai,

779
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,720
did you inform Su Yang?

780
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,040
We didn't tell him.

781
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,360
If Su Yang knows,

782
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,800
he won't let us come.

783
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,040
This child is stubborn

784
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,680
and always fights us.

785
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,120
- My son.
- Mom.

786
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,840
You're finally home.

787
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,520
Did you lose weight?

788
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,200
Your face looks smaller.

789
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,400
Mom, I've gained weight.

790
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,720
Honey, look at your son. He looks darker.

791
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,880
Mom, I work in an office every day.

792
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,200
I don't go under the sun.

793
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm not dark.

794
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,880
Why didn't you inform me

795
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,440
that you're coming to Shanghai?

796
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,400
Why?

797
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
Aren't you happy that we're here?

798
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,760
No.

799
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,000
You guys arrived late

800
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,480
and I didn't get to prepare
a place for you to stay.

801
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,720
You don't have to worry about that.

802
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,720
- Your mom and I will manage.
- Yes.

803
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
It's okay, you two.

804
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,000
You guys can stay here.

805
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,400
I will go back to my mom's place.

806
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,240
Don't trouble yourself, Qi Xiao.

807
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,880
After we talk to Su Yang,

808
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,480
we will go to a hotel.

809
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
That won't do.

810
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,680
You came to Shanghai.

811
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,240
How can you stay outside?

812
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,520
Don't worry. Please stay.

813
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,120
Qi Xiao,

814
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,640
we apologize for troubling you.

815
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,840
Thank you, Qi Xiao.

816
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,600
Since Su Yang
has a friend like you in Shanghai,

817
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,800
we feel at ease. Thank you.

818
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,800
You're welcome.

819
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,560
Su Yang and I are like brothers.

820
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,600
Talk nicely.

821
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,720
Goodbye, you two.

822
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,200
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

823
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
Please take me in.

824
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,720
Su Yang's parents arrived unnoticed

825
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
with no place to stay.

826
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,040
As a good citizen,

827
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,760
I did what's right

828
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,320
and gave up my room.

829
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
I'm saving the old folks the trouble.

830
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,840
I was thinking

831
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,880
of returning to my mom's place,

832
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,320
but at this hour,

833
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,680
she's probably asleep.

834
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,880
As my girlfriend,

835
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,760
shouldn't you step in at a time like this

836
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,000
and take me in?

837
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,280
Come or I'll shut the door.

838
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
Yangyang, if we didn't call,

839
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,560
will you still be at the office working?

840
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,680
What kind of company is that?

841
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,640
Keeping you at work so late.

842
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,840
Have you eaten?

843
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,840
Let me make you something.

844
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,800
Mom,

845
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,040
we have meal plans at work.

846
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm a little busy now,

847
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,520
but

848
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,080
I'm working towards my dreams.

849
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,600
I don't feel tired.

850
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
We're here today

851
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,920
to discuss something with you.

852
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,760
We're not here to discuss
but to notify him.

853
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,880
Mr. Ling said that

854
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,360
our area is expanding
and recruiting civil servants.

855
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,400
Your dad and I think

856
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,400
you should apply to be a civil servant.

857
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,040
Mom.

858
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,200
I've told you many times
I don't want to be a civil servant.

859
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,200
No, don't worry.

860
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,960
Our neighborhood is developing well.

861
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,480
Being in civil service

862
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,880
is a good thing.

863
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
It's close to home

864
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,040
and it's not hard work.

865
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,280
Sure, whatever.

866
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,960
Watch how you talk to your mom.

867
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,160
Mom.

868
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
I think civil servants are good,

869
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,200
but I do not wish for that life.

870
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,160
If you want me to have a leisurely life

871
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,680
and apply to be a civil servant,

872
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,720
then you're mistaken.

873
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,000
The requirements are now very high.

874
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,840
Even the lowest levels are often busy.

875
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,800
Although you'll be busy,
it's still a secure job!

876
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Look at what you're doing now.

877
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,640
You sound like you earn well,

878
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
but after paying the rent,
how much is left?

879
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,320
Also, if you work for a private entity,

880
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,520
what's your guarantee?

881
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,080
They can go bankrupt at any time.

882
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,640
They can fire you anytime!

883
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,440
Did you watch the news?

884
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,440
In Shanghai,

885
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,080
a vice president of a company

886
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,240
got cancer

887
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,360
due to being overworked.

888
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,440
What did the company do?

889
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,280
They got rid of him immediately!

890
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
Your mom and I saw the news.

891
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,000
We couldn't sleep the entire night.

892
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,480
That's it. This decision is final.

893
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,640
Dad,

894
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,600
I'm an adult.

895
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,000
Can you please let me decide?

896
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,640
What sort of nonsense is that?

897
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,600
If you don't want us to decide for you,

898
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,080
then don't worry us!

899
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,840
Your mom was softhearted back then.

900
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,840
She didn't insist that you come back
after graduating.

901
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,240
Look. The job at the design institution
we got you

902
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,720
has been taken by others!

903
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,240
If you can't get into civil service,

904
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,520
- your life is ruined!
- Dad! Mom!

905
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,640
Can you listen to me?

906
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,240
All right, sit down.

907
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,720
Talk nicely.

908
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,240
I know

909
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,360
we are just an ordinary family

910
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,280
and I'm

911
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,120
an ordinary person.

912
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,960
Aside from enrolling
into East China Normal University,

913
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,880
I have never made you guys proud.

914
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,880
You're worried about me.

915
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,920
I understand.

916
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,560
I also worry about myself

917
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,000
when I didn't have a job.

918
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,200
I was worried that I wouldn't find a job.

919
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,360
When I have a job,

920
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,560
I'm worried that I'll lose my job.

921
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,720
I used to ask myself,

922
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,560
"Shanghai is so big.

923
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,240
Is there a place,

924
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,520
a corner,

925
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,040
that belongs to me?"

926
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,480
Sometimes when I look at Qi Xiao,

927
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,000
I envy him.

928
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
I envy him

929
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,400
because he doesn't worry.

930
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,080
It's like there's always a way out.

931
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,680
It's like he's not afraid of failures.

932
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,680
My son,

933
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,920
you have a way out.

934
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,080
We are your way out!

935
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,880
No, Mom.

936
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,280
I came to realize that

937
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,240
I can definitely go back with you

938
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,120
and work a 3,000-yuan salary job,

939
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,720
live a stable, peaceful life.

940
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,360
Then I can blame this city
for how bad it is.

941
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,680
And I can be glad that I returned.

942
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,120
I can also blame how unfair society is,

943
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,320
be cynical,

944
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,760
and push everything onto others.

945
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,680
But…

946
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,720
Someone told me

947
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,920
that I don't have to be like that.

948
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
I keep saying
that my dream is in Shanghai.

949
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,240
What's my dream?

950
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,040
Is it a promotion or a raise?

951
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,720
Is it to get married and have kids here?

952
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,400
Is it for everyone to see
the webtoons I drew?

953
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,640
Yes and no.

954
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,720
My dream

955
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,600
is to become a better version of myself.

956
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,040
One I can be proud of!

957
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,760
One who can handle life's struggles,

958
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,360
grab all opportunities,

959
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,480
and see a bigger stage!

960
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,000
Then do everything possible

961
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,560
to get a hold of it.

962
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,240
