1
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,080
That's the problem.

2
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,240
If a couple gives birth
to a child without having any clue at all,

3
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,080
they don't know what they are facing.

4
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
They don't know what to prepare.

5
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
Isn't that scary?

6
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
And you're raising a child.

7
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
It'll probably take 18 years.

8
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
But it's your spouse
who stays by you, not your kid.

9
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,840
To me,

10
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
Ziyan is the one
who will stay by me for life.

11
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
So her condition and opinions

12
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
are what matters the most to me.

13
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,880
I married her.

14
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Not some baby-making machine.

15
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,600
Of course, having kids and raising kids,

16
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm sure I'll do my best

17
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,120
in carrying out my responsibilities.

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,800
But don't you think that in the process,

19
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
a mother sacrifices the most?

20
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,480
So…

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,840
I respect Ziyan's decision completely.

22
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
What you say is true.

23
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,520
Mothers have responsibilities.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,000
I raised you and your sister.

25
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Have I not sacrificed?

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Ziyan.

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
If you think that you don't have time

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,720
to care for the kids,

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
I'll take care of them.

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
Mother.

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
In recent years,

32
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
I've seen the bond

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
between Zou Ying and Xiaoxin.

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,200
Truthfully,

35
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm very touched and jealous.

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
I thought that…

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,640
One day,

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
when I have kids,

39
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,960
I want to be like Zou Ying.

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Despite everything,
I will raise them myself.

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
Because I feel

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
that kids are not pets.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,960
They need a lot of love

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
and dedication to nurture.

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,760
Mom.

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,480
I…

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,720
Indeed, a while ago,

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
I had a bit of a midlife crisis.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,000
I was dissatisfied with life.

50
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,720
I lacked drive

51
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,920
and passion.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,160
I thought that

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,120
maybe if I had kids,

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
life would be different.

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
But I finally understood.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,440
My ordinary life, albeit plain,

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,120
is not something
I can solve by having a baby.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
In fact, it could be worse.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
I want to thank Ziyan.

60
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
Ever since I met her,

61
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
I could feel this aura of hers

62
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,680
that wants to live life to the fullest.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,480
My days with her
made me see the light again.

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
I think you are right.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,240
We are comrades.

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,760
You may think that I'm the breadwinner.

67
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
But it's actually Ziyan

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,000
who uses her passion in life to touch me.

69
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,720
Mom.

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
Dad.

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,640
If you really want what's best for us,

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
then let us make our own decisions.

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
When Ziyan is ready,

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,480
we will reconsider this matter.

75
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,000
- But this--
- Mom.

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
Stop overthinking

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
about carrying on the family name.

78
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Maybe death and old age
will no longer be a thing.

79
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,080
I think Zou Cheng and his wife

80
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
have healthy thinking. Truly.

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,960
All right.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
I think

83
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
these kids have their own way of thinking.

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
Let them decide

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,320
how they want to live, okay?

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,360
Father.

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
Mother.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,200
Both of you have worked hard
for your entire life.

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,200
Honestly,

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,480
I feel your pain.

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,520
I think
this is the best time of your life.

92
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
Look. You're in good health,

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,480
can think clearly,

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,000
and have no financial constraints.

95
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,200
It's rare to have

96
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,040
this stage in your life.

97
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
Xiaoxin is older now.

98
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,400
He doesn't need you to spend your freedom

99
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,840
to take care of him.

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,480
I just received

101
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
my first quarter bonus.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,760
I bought my parents

103
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,240
and both of you some travel tickets.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
Sanya!

105
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
Mother.

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,800
When I went

107
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,600
overseas to have fun,

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,760
you took care of Zou Cheng.

109
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,480
Mother,

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
thank you.

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,720
There's no need to worry.

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Zou Cheng and I are fine now.

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Both of us

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,360
learned how to take care of ourselves.

115
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
So you guys have fun

116
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,560
and have a good time.

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
Thank you, Ziyan.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Actually, she has been wanting

119
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,600
to go to Sanya.

120
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,760
Her group of friends

121
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,360
shared in their circle

122
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,200
some pictures and travel stories

123
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,440
and it made her bitter.

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Says who? I wasn't bitter.

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,640
I know.

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,160
Grandma feels bitter
because she ate medicine.

127
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,320
All right. Come.

128
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,320
- Talk later.
- Come.

130
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
- Mother.
- Thank you.

131
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
It's not bad.

132
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,800
It's almost finished.

133
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
It's not quite there yet.

134
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
I've made a few adjustments today

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,320
and tomorrow, Mr. Wang will take a look.

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,600
Hopefully, it'll be done by then.

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,640
Actually, the factory
that Xiaoyan introduced

138
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,840
is quite good.

139
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
They definitely have the best factory

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,120
and a master jeweler.

141
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,520
Them being too great and too famous

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,760
is why I don't want them.

143
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
Think about it.

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,200
They deal with hundreds of thousands

145
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
of jewelry customization orders.

146
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,320
They won't bother with our products.

147
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,960
Meanwhile, Mr. Wang

148
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,640
has just started his factory, like me.

149
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I think that, as long as we are skillful,

150
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,720
we will make progress slowly and steadily.

151
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,080
All right.

152
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Hello?

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Done for the day?

154
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,760
<i>Yes.</i>

155
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,560
<i>Do you want me to visit and bring supper?</i>

156
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
It's all right.

157
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,680
Isn't your department
busy with recruiting?

158
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
Go home and rest early.

159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,840
You have an early meeting tomorrow.

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,480
You sure you don't want to eat

161
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,480
kebab?

162
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,680
Zhu Lin, come and join us.

163
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,200
I bought a lot.

164
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,360
- So much.
- Yes.

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,800
So much food.

166
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Of course. How's your preparation?

167
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
The due date is this weekend.

168
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,560
Everything is within my grasp.

169
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,480
Let me see.

170
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,520
My goodness.

171
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,760
It's gorgeous.

172
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,160
I think the real thing

173
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
is better than the drawings.

174
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,000
Try it on.

175
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Okay.

176
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Here.

177
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Perfect fit.

178
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
Of course.

179
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
This was tailor-made for you.

180
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,160
You're my first client
for a custom-made design.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
Right now,

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,200
this Venus

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
belongs to my Mars

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,520
and she can never leave.

185
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,880
You've become quite the sweet talker.

186
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,400
I'll eat outside.

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,200
Hear no evil, see no evil.

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Look, that was embarrassing.

189
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
He was looking.

190
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,720
Come, let's eat.

191
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,520
Look at you. You're getting thinner.

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Your dark circles are obvious.

193
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,760
I'm okay.

194
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,840
It's nothing a few naps can't heal.

195
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,760
I'm still young.

196
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,600
Quick, eat.

197
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,080
- What are you doing?
- Feed me.

198
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,400
Let me tell you.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
Back in college,

200
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,360
I hated couples who fed each other.

201
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
I think it's gross.

202
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,000
Humans will eventually turn

203
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,320
into the person they hate, right?

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
No one's here.

205
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,920
- Quick.
- No.

206
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,000
No!

207
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,600
- Quick.
- Just one mouthful.

208
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,680
Quick.

209
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,720
Eat it yourself.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,920
- Tasty?
- Tasty.

211
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
- It's cold now.
- You take a bite too.

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,880
No.

213
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,040
- One bite.
- No.

214
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,360
- I'll do it myself.
- Just one bite. Come.

215
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
- I'll do it myself.
- Quick, one bite.

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
There are no napkins outside

217
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm here to get some.

218
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,200
Please continue.

219
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,320
You see. He saw us.

220
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
Zhu Lin isn't an outsider.

221
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Quick, one bite.

222
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,200
- No.
- One bite.

223
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,760
Quick. Come.

224
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,480
- One bite only.
- Okay, one bite.

225
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,320
That's right.

226
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,640
Seriously.

227
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Wait a minute.

228
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
SHEN RUOXIN

229
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
<i>Have you arrived home?</i>

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,240
<i>Yes, I just got out of the shower.</i>

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,120
<i>I want to see this beauty
right out of the shower.</i>

232
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,160
SHEN RUOXIN

233
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,760
<i>I was shocked.</i>

234
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,560
<i>My little heart couldn't take it.</i>

235
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,080
<i>You have to be responsible.</i>

236
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,240
Hello, Mr. Xu.

237
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
Is there anything wrong?

238
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,840
I've arrived in Shanghai.

239
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
I just want to inform you.

240
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
That's great.

241
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,560
With you here, we'll be at ease.

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
<i>I'll be attending tomorrow's meeting.</i>

243
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm calling to inform you in advance.

244
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,280
Tomorrow, dress smart and formal.

245
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,840
I understand, sir.

246
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
See you tomorrow.

247
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,240
SHEN RUOXIN

248
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
PRETTY

249
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,200
Everybody, our New Energy Department
started from nothing

250
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,080
to rise to this current state.

251
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,840
From mere strategy

252
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,040
to being an operational

253
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,400
independent department.

254
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
This can't be realized

255
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,520
without everyone's contribution.

256
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,920
Today, I would like

257
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,840
to heartfully thank everyone.

258
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,240
Also, I want to assure you

259
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,280
that all your efforts will be rewarded.

260
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,640
The future of new energy

261
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,920
is limitless.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,440
Your futures are also limitless.

263
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
Let me announce

264
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,880
the board of directors' approval

265
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,280
for personnel appointments.

266
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,560
The New Energy Department
is a stand-alone business line.

267
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,400
I, Xu Minjie, will be the President.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,640
Lisa Fang

269
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,640
as the CEO.

270
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,280
Shen Ruoxin

271
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,760
as the Operations Director.

272
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,720
Zhang Xiaohua as the HR Director.

273
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,400
Mr. Xu, I'll take my leave.

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,200
How is it?

275
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
Are you satisfied?

276
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu
and the company for its recognition.

277
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,920
I will do my best

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,080
and not disappoint you.

279
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,960
I believe in my choices.

280
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,880
Follow me.

281
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,680
Do you like it?

282
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,120
Mr. Xu, what is this?

283
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,480
Lisa has prepared this space
for your office as a director.

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,120
I think it's a bit cramped but quite cool.

285
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,560
What do you think?

286
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,200
I think it's really lovely.

287
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

288
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,320
I heard

289
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,600
someone didn't go to Shenzhen

290
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
because she's in love.

291
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,240
How's Qi Xiao?

292
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,360
He's doing well.
He's doing jewelry design now.

293
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,760
He participated
in Shangli's design competition.

294
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,800
This weekend is the finals.

295
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,160
That's great.

296
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,000
Qi Xiao is a young talent.

297
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,360
I know some friends
in the design industry.

298
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,880
If needed, you can find me.

299
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,160
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

300
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
No need to thank me.

301
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,000
Keep your stuff and prepare to move in.

302
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,640
My office is right there.

303
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
Talk to me if you need help.

304
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,359
Okay.

305
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,119
Shen Ruoxin,

306
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
do your best.

307
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,280
- Did you wait long?
- No.

308
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,440
While I was waiting,

309
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
I bought you some milk tea.

310
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,720
It's the one that's famous online.

311
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,840
No ice. Half sugar.

312
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,320
Plus, boba and coffee jelly.

313
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,440
You know me best.

314
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,520
I have good news to share today.

315
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,880
What a coincidence.

316
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
- I also have good news to share.
- You tell me first.

317
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,360
Ruoxin has been promoted

318
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,560
to Operations Director.

319
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,240
She has talked to the new Director
of the Legal Department

320
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,240
to do an internal transfer immediately.

321
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,120
That's great.

322
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,320
- You can finally work with Ruoxin again.
- Yes.

323
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
And you?

324
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,680
What's your good news?

325
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Have you received the 50,000?

326
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
You're amazing, Su Yang.

327
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Let's not eat hot pot tonight.

328
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's have a romantic Western dinner.

329
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,960
What do you think?

330
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,320
Money speaks.

331
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,800
You choose.

332
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

333
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,440
Come in.

334
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,440
Ms. Shen, there's a delivery for you.

335
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,360
Thank you.

336
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>Director Shen.</i>

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,760
<i>I've been preparing this gift
for some time.</i>

338
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
<i>This meteorite fragment</i>

339
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,520
<i>is a gift from space.</i>

340
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,760
<i>After thousands of light-years,</i>

341
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
<i>it finally came to us.</i>

342
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,440
<i>Ever since I met you,</i>

343
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
<i>I've always thought</i>

344
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,640
<i>that the universe is so vast.</i>

345
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,480
<i>Humans are a speck of dust</i>

346
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,600
<i>in time and space.</i>

347
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,400
<i>Just a meager change</i>

348
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,240
<i>and I might not be with you</i>

349
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,360
<i>in the same dimension.</i>

350
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,240
<i>Luckily,</i>

351
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,800
<i>I met you in this life.</i>

352
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,480
<i>I wish you every success.</i>

353
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
<i>Continue to be a great boss.</i>

354
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,360
<i>Your forever assistant, Qi Xiao.</i>

355
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,880
That is all
for my Stars Bracelet design concept.

356
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you, judges and audience.

357
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,000
For the teachers, are there any questions?

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
It's 7 minutes and 35 seconds.

359
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,720
Just in time.

360
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,520
As you advised,
I have simplified the first two slides.

361
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
It's a design competition.

362
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,960
The design statement
is the most important.

363
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,200
Your stage presentation

364
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
and performance were good.

365
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,920
I'll give you 80 marks.

366
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

367
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Only 80 marks?

368
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,080
I want more praise.

369
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,800
What else do you want?

370
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Kisses and hugs.

371
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,680
Stop fooling around.

372
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,880
Just now,
for the slide on the design concept,

373
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,440
you have to rehearse it well.

374
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,720
You only have ten minutes.

375
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,720
You can't exceed it.

376
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,920
Have you rehearsed?

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,400
I've prepared for it.

378
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,640
Don't worry.

379
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,840
I'm not telling you
because it's a surprise.

380
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,960
Something is fishy.

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm just not ready yet.

382
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,960
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

383
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,200
Wait for a bit.

384
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,840
Who is it at this hour?

385
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,960
Thank you.

386
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,280
Here. It just arrived.

387
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,800
I chose this for you

388
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
and Zhu Lin adjusted it.

389
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,920
Your suit for tomorrow.

390
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
- What do you think?
- My goodness.

391
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Let's see.

392
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
This is so grand.

393
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,360
You're going on stage tomorrow.

394
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,400
It should be grand.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,920
It's not bad.

396
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm wearing this, but what about you?

397
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,680
You're the star tomorrow.

398
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
I'm not important.

399
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,040
No. You're my companion.

400
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,880
We need to be in sync.

401
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,200
Let's choose a dress.

402
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,960
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

403
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,040
This is good.

404
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,200
It shows your waist.

405
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,520
This is not bad.

406
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,400
This dress defines your collarbone.

407
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,800
And this?

408
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,000
Not this one.

409
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Let's go with this then.

410
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,240
It goes well with your outfit.

411
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,920
Right.

412
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Let me try it on.

413
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,040
You don't need to.

414
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,040
You look good in everything.

415
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,720
It's such a match.

416
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,840
Ruoxin.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,760
I've waited for so long.

418
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,400
Shouldn't we take it to the next step now?

419
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,720
I need to change.

420
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,640
Qi Xiao.

421
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
My zipper is not working.

422
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm coming!

423
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
It's perfect.

424
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,760
You look stunning.

425
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,640
And I'm yours.

426
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
You sweet talker.

427
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,240
You don't look nervous.

428
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,240
Nervous?

429
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
Of course, I am nervous.

430
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm nervous and that's why
I need to disperse my focus.

431
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,080
You're the best.

432
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,520
We will be in the audience
cheering for you.

433
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,000
Ruoxin, we're here.

434
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,160
Ruoxin.

435
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,400
Qi Xiao, I've looked
at all the other finalists' designs.

436
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,560
The best design

437
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,480
is still yours.

438
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,040
Thank you.

439
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,800
I hope today's judges will think the same.

440
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
It's almost time.

441
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,560
I'll head backstage and prepare.

442
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,480
Do your best.

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,840
Do your best.

444
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,560
Do your best.

445
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,360
Why don't you go in first?

446
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
- I'll wait for Ziyan.
- Okay.

447
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,080
There's no seat number on the tickets.

448
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,880
Su Yang and I will grab seats first.

449
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,640
- Okay.
- Let's go.

450
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Ruoxin.

451
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,160
Yutao.

452
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,120
Feifei said she wants to attend,

453
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,120
so I asked Mr. Ma for two tickets.

454
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,440
I remember you.

455
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,720
We had dinner together last time.

456
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,480
Honey said there's an after-party.

457
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,440
Will you join it?

458
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,040
It's an organizer event.

459
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,200
Only the top winners and your honey,

460
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,360
an elite, were invited.

461
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,320
Honey, you're the best.

462
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
We'll head in first.

463
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,640
Wish your boyfriend, Qi Xiao,

464
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,400
- good luck in the finals.
- Thank you.

465
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,080
Bye.

466
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,840
Ruoxin, you know that girl?

467
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Yes, she's my old friend's girlfriend.

468
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,560
A rich girl
who has just returned from the UK.

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Really?

470
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
I took part
in an online finance class before.

471
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,520
I met her at the gatherings.

472
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
I think her name

473
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,760
is Xiaofei.

474
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,200
She's an online model.

475
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,360
During the gathering,

476
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,120
she would be around the finance guys,

477
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
flirting regularly back and forth.

478
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,880
That's why I remember her.

479
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
Really? Is that true?

480
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,080
I'm certain.

481
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,600
She even organized

482
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,520
some kind of celebrity training class

483
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,200
with the girls in our class.

484
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,680
That's why I can't forget her.

485
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,280
Why are you out here?

486
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,320
I was worried you'd be distracted
since it's noisy.

487
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
So I came out to tell you

488
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,120
that we've found seats.

489
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

490
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm here.

491
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,600
- You came.
- Ziyan, you came.

492
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,920
- I've found seats, let's head inside.
- Let's go.

493
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
DAZZLING LIFE

494
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,120
PARADISE ON EARTH

495
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,720
Now, let's welcome

496
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,160
our last contestant,

497
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,160
Mr. Qi Xiao,

498
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,440
with his design, Stars Bracelet.

499
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Please welcome.

500
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,360
Do your best.

501
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,920
MAYBE LOVE IS
THE UNIVERSE'S UNIMAGINABLE MIRACLE.

502
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,760
Dear judges, teachers,

503
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,840
and everyone. Hello.

504
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,520
My name is Qi Xiao.

505
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,360
My design today

506
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,480
is called Stars Bracelet.

507
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,360
My design

508
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,960
is inspired by my love life…

509
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,920
STARS BRACELET

510
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,880
…with my girlfriend.

511
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,840
My girlfriend loves to look at the stars.

512
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,600
So I often thought

513
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,880
that the universe is vast.

514
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,480
The distance between the stars

515
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,600
is so far apart

516
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,800
as they orbit in their own system.

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,280
It's just like all of us.

518
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,400
We live our lives

519
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,040
in bustling cities.

520
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
Often,

521
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,480
we go around alone

522
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,680
orbiting

523
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,160
in our own system.

524
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,600
Love.

525
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,480
How does it happen?

526
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,360
After I met my girlfriend,

527
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,760
I started to think

528
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,080
that maybe all the physics in the world

529
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,040
can't explain it.

530
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,600
Two clearly different individuals

531
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,160
circling their own tracks.

532
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,360
It's impossible for them to intersect.

533
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
But it allows us

534
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,720
to meet

535
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,280
and to love.

536
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,200
To allow yourself to put down your guard

537
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,640
and throw away logic.

538
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,280
Be willing to believe

539
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,840
that love

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
may be the universe's

541
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,720
unimaginable miracle.

542
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,880
This is my design, Stars Bracelet.

543
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Thank you, everyone.

544
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,240
SIX MONTHS LATER

545
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,160
Come in.

546
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,520
Lisa, you asked for me?

547
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,520
- Sit, Ruoxin.
- Okay.

548
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,240
I called you as I wanted
to know about your work.

549
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,960
Are there any opinions or feedback?

550
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,840
I talked with the Finance Department
about next year's budget.

551
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,320
I've also recently discussed with
the Sales Department about their KPIs.

552
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,680
Everything is going well.

553
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,040
Since the restructuring,

554
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,560
the New Energy Department

555
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,880
has received great support.

556
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,120
Next, for our department,

557
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,560
the most important task

558
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,880
is the upcoming annual new car launch.

559
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,880
I will filter all the proposals first

560
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
and then let you decide.

561
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,200
Good.

562
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,720
Ruoxin,

563
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,200
there's something
I really admire about Mr. Xu.

564
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,320
It's his instinct
to find the right people.

565
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,600
After some time working with you,

566
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,400
I agree with what he said.

567
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,560
You are indeed brilliant.

568
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
Thank you.

569
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,720
I have good news

570
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,240
and bad news.

571
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,600
Which do you want to hear first?

572
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,160
Bad news first.

573
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,320
The bad news is
I'm going back to headquarters,

574
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,840
maybe by this weekend.

575
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,240
Lisa, this is too sudden.

576
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,600
The duty handover should be

577
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,120
at least next month
after the annual car launch.

578
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,840
This is the headquarters' decision.

579
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,440
Shenzhen has some urgent matters

580
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
that I must attend to immediately.

581
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,080
But…

582
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
You know our business well.

583
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
We are compatible when we work together.

584
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,040
If a new leader comes--

585
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,520
Don't you want to hear the good news?

586
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,720
What's the good news?

587
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,080
The good news

588
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,280
is my position in the East China region

589
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,560
will be succeeded by you.

590
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,000
Me?

591
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,520
Lisa, this is too sudden.

592
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,720
It's not sudden at all.

593
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,639
Actually, Mr. Xu had me transferred here

594
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,360
because he's worried that your level
wasn't enough to convince others.

595
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,639
He wanted me to lead

596
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,040
and remove some obstacles.

597
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,400
But now we think that

598
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,280
the time is right for you to take over.

599
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,800
Prepare yourself.

600
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,239
The official announcement
will be released soon.

601
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,040
Congratulations, Shen Ruoxin.

602
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,280
Thank you, Lisa.

603
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,880
Are you sure it's Shen Ruoxin?

604
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,840
Why would I lie?

605
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,080
I heard the appointment

606
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,040
has been issued to the HR Department.

607
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,760
I heard that Mr. Liu's life is not good.

608
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,280
With Shen Ruoxin
taking over Ms. Fang's position,

609
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,040
doesn't that mean the East China region…

610
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,440
Is Ms. Shen's empire?

611
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,560
If I had known,
I wouldn't have taken Mr. Ruan's side.

612
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,680
Me too.

613
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,080
- Morning, Sijia.
- Hi.

614
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,320
Sijia!

615
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,480
- Sijia.
- Sijia.

616
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
This coffee is normal.

617
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,120
I'll take you downstairs to drink

618
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,400
- at the newly opened hand drip coffee bar.
- Yes.

619
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,320
It's okay.

620
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
I just need to stay alert.

621
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,640
I have a lot of contracts to edit.

622
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,960
You need some rest.

623
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,640
Have you had that famous cake?

624
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,040
Let's go. My treat.

625
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,000
Right.

626
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,040
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

627
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,000
How do I look?

628
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,880
Perfect.

629
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay, go.

630
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,080
Ms. Shen.

631
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,200
- Slowly.
- Mr. Ruan is really adaptable.

632
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,240
Slowly. Let me.

633
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
You're so careless.

634
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,080
Come. Make way.

635
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,120
Quick.

636
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Slowly.

637
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,320
Be careful.

638
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,080
What?

639
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,440
Mr. Ruan, you're here too?

640
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,440
Come.

641
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,440
Slowly.

642
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,400
It's true. Anything is possible.

643
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,000
Ms. Li.

644
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Mr. Ruan.

645
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,960
To what do I owe this pleasure?

646
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,240
It's nothing.

647
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,720
This is our department's responsibility.

648
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,240
We've worked together for many years.

649
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
As colleagues,
we'd like to congratulate you.

650
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Ms. Shen.

651
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,160
A bright future to you.
I wish you success forever.

652
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,600
For a rewarding future.

653
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,720
In your new position,
money will keep coming.

654
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
Is this

655
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
a couplet?

656
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,440
No way.

657
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,920
Stop joking.

658
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
Your lipstick is pretty today.

659
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,280
- It looks youthful.
- Absolutely.

660
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,320
This lipstick color with the dress

661
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
is absolutely impeccable.

662
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It's not the dress.

663
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,840
- It's the person.
- Correct.

664
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,400
- She's pretty.
- Pretty.

665
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,480
I have

666
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,560
always been using this lipstick.

667
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,360
It's really because of the person.
You look great.

668
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,680
It looks

669
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,360
youthful, modern, and pretty.

670
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,920
I say, Ms. Shen.

671
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,720
We are old colleagues.

672
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,480
- Old comrades.
- Yes.

673
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,760
We fight side by side

674
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,360
with a deep understanding

675
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,680
and affection for others.

676
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,000
Our previous wrongdoings,

677
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,000
- we hope…
- You can wipe the slate clean.

678
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,600
When needed…

679
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,320
- We will be there…
- Every step of the way.

680
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,240
Full-heartedly…

681
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,440
Complete loyalty…

682
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,840
- With body and soul until death.
- Until death.

683
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,400
Are you immortal?

684
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,040
Choose your words.

685
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,920
Watch your words when you speak.

686
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,360
You've ruined it.

687
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,360
From…

688
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,760
From the bottom of my heart.

689
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,720
Did both of you rehearse this
before coming?

690
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,120
- No.
- This--

691
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
It's the truth and purest words.

692
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,280
From our hearts.

693
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Thank you.

694
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,840
For the new employee training,

695
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,200
remember to emphasize
the company's privacy policy.

696
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,320
Understood.

697
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,920
In my eyes,

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
you still look the same.

699
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,480
But now, surprisingly,
you're training rookies.

700
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,560
Ruoxin, I'm a senior legal officer now.

701
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,680
Okay.

702
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,120
That's why you must work hard

703
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,080
and strive for promotion in two years.

704
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,480
Yes, Ruoxin.

705
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,480
Go.

706
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,640
Hello, everyone.

707
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,200
I'm in charge of this training.

708
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,320
My name is You Sijia.

709
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,840
Please pass around

710
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,520
the training materials in hand.

711
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,520
One each.

712
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,120
There's a total of four pages.

713
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,400
Please check.

714
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,000
Mr. Liu.

715
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
Are you heading out?

716
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,760
Yes.

717
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,400
I resigned.

718
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,160
No one bothered to send me out.

719
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,520
I didn't think

720
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,840
you'd be the last one I meet
in the company.

721
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,760
But I guess

722
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,080
we won't meet anymore.

723
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,640
What's your plan, Mr. Liu?

724
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,600
No plans.

725
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,160
Gardening or fishing.

726
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,840
Go sightseeing.

727
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,880
I've been here for 20 years.

728
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,560
I was here when this building was built.

729
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,000
I was like you.

730
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,400
I was in high spirits,

731
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,480
thinking this era was the height.

732
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,360
In the blink of an eye,

733
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
the era left me.

734
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,280
Mr. Liu,

735
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,800
when I first joined the company,

736
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,560
you set a good example

737
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,600
of what a leader should be.

738
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,560
I should thank you.

739
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,520
Goodbye.

740
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,080
Forget it.

741
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,240
I hope you'll have better luck.

742
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,360
- Why did you say that?
- Why did you say that?

743
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,320
You go first.

744
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,680
Okay, me first.

745
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,680
Look.

746
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,920
Su Yang's webtoon

747
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,880
is taking on shampoo advertisements.

748
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
This little kitten

749
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
is using the shampoo.

750
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,560
This guy is shameless.

751
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,040
He's making big money.

752
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,240
What did his fans say?

753
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,200
Don't say it.

754
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,480
His fans are not even mad.

755
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,440
They commented,

756
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,800
"This feeds you well."

757
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,480
Seems like Su Yang has really done it.

758
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,240
What was yours about?

759
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,840
Let me show you.

760
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,480
The kid Ziyan is teaching

761
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,560
has received an award.

762
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,720
Look at the award picture.

763
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,520
- So cute.
- That's cute.

764
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,720
It's almost time.

765
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,840
STARS BRACELET

766
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,080
Look.

767
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,040
Designer, Mr. Qi.

768
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,640
This is amazing.

769
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,120
You're incredible.

770
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,840
It's beautiful. Look.

771
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,920
Although I only won fifth place,

772
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,640
Mr. Yu was really nice.

773
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,680
He appreciates my talent

774
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,840
and brand concept.

775
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,000
He used his resources
to help us promote it.

776
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,560
Step by step,
we made it to this billboard.

777
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,760
He's uncovering new talents.

778
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,440
He thinks you are a potential dark horse.

779
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,480
What about you?

780
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,960
How are you going to invest in me?

781
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,200
When can I give you a ring?

782
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,360
Let me know in advance.

783
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,920
I don't want to be

784
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,640
like how you treated Mr. Cui

785
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,080
on the first day I met you.

786
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,400
Do you still remember Cui Lixin?

787
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,920
When you said
that you had a surprise for me today

788
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,920
and you brought me here
to see the advertisement,

789
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,560
I thought it was something else.

790
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,920
It's unlike the last time

791
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,480
you hacked into my official account

792
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,040
and posted a confession.

793
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,320
Thankfully, it's a surprise

794
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,480
and not a shock.

795
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,480
Okay.

796
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,840
I promise you, as a rational person,

797
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,560
there are no more surprises.

798
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,520
All right?

799
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,280
STARS BRACELET

800
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,600
It's my mom.

801
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,400
Hello, Mom.

802
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,680
Xinxin,

803
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,640
when are you coming back?

804
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,760
Qi Xiao's mom and I are already here.

805
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,880
<i>We just went</i>

806
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,000
<i>to a wedding show.</i>

807
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,920
There's a good wedding company.

808
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,240
Mom,

809
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,000
you should discuss this with Qi Xiao.

810
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,360
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

811
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,560
I'm outside with Ruoxin.

812
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,960
We're coming home soon.

813
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,240
I'll pass you to your mom.

814
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,360
My son, let me tell you.

815
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,800
The company we went to today

816
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,720
was really good.

817
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,320
We've put down a deposit.

818
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,320
The weddings that they organized

819
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,160
are so romantic, just like in the dramas.

820
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
Wedding?

821
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,080
Wait a minute.

822
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,600
<i>You haven't told them</i>

823
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,320
<i>if it's indoors or outdoors.</i>

824
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,320
<i>Yilan, listen to me.</i>

825
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
<i>It should be indoors.</i>

826
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,960
<i>Look at this lighting indoors.</i>

827
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,520
<i>It's as pretty as a fairy tale.</i>

828
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,520
<i>Young people prefer the outdoors.</i>

829
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,000
<i>The outdoors have freedom.</i>

830
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,240
<i>Outdoors are good</i>

831
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,560
- but there's a flaw.
- What?

832
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,000
What if on that day,

833
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,160
there's no sunshine?

834
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,320
But you look at this.

835
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
It will look clear at any time.

836
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,320
<i>- Look at the lighting--</i>
- Mom, we're coming home.

837
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,960
Let's discuss when we arrive.

838
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,000
See you later.

839
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,320
Let's go.

840
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,000
<i>I'm Shen Ruoxin, 35 years old.</i>

841
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,000
<i>An unmarried senior executive.</i>

842
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,960
<i>I'm a rational lady</i>

843
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,960
<i>who has my life and goals figured out.</i>

844
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,520
<i>Compared to an innocent 18-year-old</i>

845
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,520
<i>or a 20-year-old who's still searching,</i>

846
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,760
<i>I like myself better in my thirties.</i>

847
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,080
<i>Although nobody thinks</i>

848
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,720
<i>I'm cute anymore</i>

849
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
<i>and I'm aging by the minute,</i>

850
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,680
<i>the 35-year-old me,</i>

851
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,200
<i>compared to my past,</i>

852
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,040
<i>knows me better than I've ever before.</i>

853
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
<i>I know what I want.</i>

854
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,640
<i>Be it career, family,</i>

855
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,960
<i>or relationships,</i>

856
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,560
<i>I gradually begin to steer my life.</i>

857
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,000
<i>I'm self-certain,</i>

858
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,560
<i>yet I still fully embrace</i>

859
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,640
<i>the unlimited possibilities of the future.</i>

860
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,680
<i>I like the current me very much.</i>

861
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,680
<i>I hope that the current you</i>

862
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,360
<i>feel the same.</i>
