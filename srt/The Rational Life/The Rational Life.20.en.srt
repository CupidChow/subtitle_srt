1
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,280
- Ruoxin.
- Come in.

2
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
Why so much stuff?

3
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
Your mom bought these.

4
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,720
She met Mr. Xu downstairs

5
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,080
and they're having a talk
so I brought these up.

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,200
My mom is with Mr. Xu?

7
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Ruoxin.

8
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,040
Yes?

9
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,120
I won't bother you.

10
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll get going.

11
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,080
Okay.

12
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,440
- Ruoxin.
- Yes?

13
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,440
If you encounter any unhappy events,

14
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
don't forget to tell me.

15
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,480
I might not be of help,

16
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,320
but I can share your frustration.

17
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,560
Okay. I'll do that.

18
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,000
Also, I…

19
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
Sijia and I would like
to treat you to dinner

20
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,000
as gratitude for taking care of us.

21
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
Let me know the time.

22
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,720
- Bye.
- Bye.

23
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,520
Qi Xiao.

24
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,640
You have…

25
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,160
to take care of yourself in Shanghai.

26
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,760
I'll get going now.

27
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
Mom.

28
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
What did you talk about with Mr. Xu?

29
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
I sent my car for maintenance today,
that's why Mr. Xu drove me home.

30
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Don't overthink.

31
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,760
I didn't overthink.

32
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
Don't worry.

33
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
He is your boss.

34
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,160
We met and exchanged a few greetings.

35
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
Can I act like I don't know him?

36
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Mom,

37
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,400
why did you buy so much stuff for me?

38
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,480
These are Shanghai specialties.

39
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,800
They have been your favorites
since you were a kid.

40
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
Nowadays, everything is online.

41
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Even if it's not,

42
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,640
I can give you my address in Shenzhen,

43
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
and you can send them to me.

44
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,440
There are too many things,

45
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,880
my luggage can't fit all.

46
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,640
Express delivery takes days,

47
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,480
and these can be checked-in.

48
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
I don't mind buying them.

49
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,640
So why do you mind bringing them?

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,680
When you miss mom's cooking,

51
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
you won't mind these.

52
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,560
No problem at all. I'll bring them all.

53
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,360
I'll pack them into boxes.

54
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,080
What is this mess?

55
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,960
Everything is scattered.

56
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,440
Mom.

57
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,400
I'll be heading out for a while tonight.

58
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,960
Where are you going?

59
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
To say goodbye to a friend.

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Lower this a bit more.

61
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,640
IN THE BLUE SKY, STARLIGHT IS AROUND US

62
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,360
That's enough.

63
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Take a look.

64
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,400
What else do you want to change?

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,560
It's good.

66
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,120
Send it to me.

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,760
Thank you Master Su for the design.

68
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Are you sure you want
to put this on her page?

69
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Will Ruoxin accept this confession?

70
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,160
I've even found a guy to do it.

71
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,600
Isn't this a bit too much?

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
I don't know why,

73
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,480
but I just can't say it to her face.

74
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,960
Are you sure
she'll check her official page?

75
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,080
What if she doesn't?

76
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,880
Unlikely.

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
She posts once every three days

78
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,000
and has never missed.

79
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
It's about time she updates.

80
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,960
Did you see the post I sent you?

81
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
And the official account?

82
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Yes, I want you to hack into the account

83
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,840
and replace it with the image I sent.

84
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,240
As soon as possible. I'll wait.

85
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
Whether I succeed or not
all depends on this.

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Pinch this.

87
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Right hand.

88
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,040
Have you really made up your mind?

89
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
Yes.

90
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
Actually, going to Shenzhen

91
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,880
is not about the raise.

92
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,159
You know that too.

93
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,600
I think the most important thing

94
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,559
is to broaden one's horizon.

95
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,280
I like new energy vehicles.

96
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,280
I think this industry is very promising

97
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,960
and very meaningful.

98
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,640
Looking at you in high spirits

99
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,240
reminds me of my youth.

100
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
Dad, when I was young,

101
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,080
I couldn't understand you.

102
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
But now,

103
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
I finally understand.

104
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,400
I think in our lives,

105
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,600
we should do something we like

106
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,960
and it should be something meaningful.

107
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
Otherwise, our life will feel empty.

108
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
What did your mom say?

109
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,440
She didn't say anything this time.

110
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
She bought me a lot of stuff

111
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,000
as though

112
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,760
I'm getting married
with a bunch of dowries.

113
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
I'm only married to my job.

114
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
Don't get angry at your mom.

115
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,240
Since her stroke two years ago,

116
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
she didn't say it,

117
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,200
but she's worried about you.

118
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,600
She hopes

119
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,920
to see you marry

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,240
because she wants you

121
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,720
to have a good husband.

122
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
She must think
if something were to happen to her,

123
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,960
you have someone to take care of you.

124
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
I know.

125
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
But marriage is not something

126
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
that you can rush.

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm not a child. I'm an adult.

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,680
I know what I'm doing.

129
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,880
But these past few years,

130
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,880
Mom's temper has never changed.

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,800
She can't understand

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
that she has her ideals

133
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,800
and I have my own ambition.

134
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,320
Back in those years,
when I wanted to leave,

135
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,120
she would fight with me every day.

136
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,040
I thought it's because
your college entrance exams

137
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,880
will be affected.

138
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,160
So when she suggested a divorce,

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,880
I agreed and left.

140
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,160
But later on, I realized

141
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,320
she was offered
a promotion to become a director.

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
After I left,

143
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
she needed to care for you
and let go of the opportunity.

144
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,440
Years later, when I recall this,

145
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,840
I feel guilty.

146
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes, I've achieved my ideals.

147
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
But what about her?

148
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,760
She gave up her own to complete mine.

149
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,600
But Dad, this incident,
even after so many years,

150
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,640
why didn't she tell me?

151
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
You know her temper

152
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
and her headstrong character.

153
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
She'll never open up.

154
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
For you,

155
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,560
for this family,

156
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,480
she has sacrificed a lot.

157
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,800
I can't even compete with that.

158
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,520
That's why her accusations

159
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,640
and blames towards me,

160
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,480
I think

161
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
I deserve them.

162
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,160
That's why

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,880
make sure you call and talk to her

164
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,840
when you reach Shenzhen.

165
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
<i>You know her temper</i>

166
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,320
<i>and her headstrong character.</i>

167
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,080
<i>She'll never open up.</i>

168
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
<i>For you,</i>

169
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,520
<i>for this family,</i>

170
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,160
<i>she has sacrificed a lot.</i>

171
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
Mom, aren't you tired
after all this packing?

172
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
Go sit and rest for a while.

173
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,000
Why are you back so early?

174
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,800
You didn't pack a down jacket with you.

175
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,480
I know Shenzhen is warm,

176
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
but it will turn chilly after spring.

177
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,960
You have to be prepared.

178
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,240
Who's going to take care of you
if you fall sick?

179
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Also,

180
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,000
in this book

181
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,680
are all your favorite dishes.

182
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,360
I've written everything down for you.

183
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
Don't be lazy.

184
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120
You need to learn how to cook.

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Don't just eat takeouts.

186
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
It's oily

187
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,680
and unclean.

188
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
Self-cooked food is better.

189
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,040
At this age,

190
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,240
don't just rely on facial masks.

191
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Women should consume tonics.

192
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,640
Why did you pack your stuff?

193
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,680
Are you leaving too?

194
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,400
When you're not around,

195
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I will move back to my place.

196
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,200
It's closer to the University for Seniors.

197
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,040
If you plan to stay long in Shenzhen,

198
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,280
I suggest

199
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
you rent out this place of yours.

200
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,480
Mom, your place is so old

201
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,560
and there's no elevator.

202
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,000
Your legs are hurting.

203
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
It's inconvenient for you.

204
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,800
Stay here and help me
look after my apartment.

205
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
That's enough.

206
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,760
I'll trouble you by being here.

207
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,320
I touch your stuff.

208
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,640
I know,

209
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,840
in these two months

210
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,520
the both of us

211
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,160
could live together for so long.

212
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm so happy.

213
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,880
Don't worry.

214
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,600
I will take care of myself.

215
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,720
I've made up my mind.

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,680
I'm not leaving.

217
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,120
What?

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,640
Why not?

219
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
I don't want to.

220
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,160
I want to stay in Shanghai.

221
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,560
I say, child,

222
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,440
what's with this fickleness?

223
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,120
You flip faster than turning a page.

224
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,200
I can get a promotion anywhere,

225
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,800
even in Shanghai.

226
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Why choose not to go?

227
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,400
Did Mr. Xu do something again?

228
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,560
It has nothing to do with him.

229
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
I don't want to leave.

230
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,480
I can't bear to leave Shanghai.

231
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,360
What was that?

232
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,320
What do we do with all this stuff then?

233
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
You scared me.

234
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,320
Unpack them.

235
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720
No.

236
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,560
You've seen it 30 times.

237
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
You've reached 5 km with that pace.

238
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,920
Aren't you tired?

239
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,960
Do you think she has read it?

240
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,600
If she had,

241
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,600
she would have come down
and talked to you.

242
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,280
What should I do? How do I look?

243
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,200
Go inside!

244
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,360
Quick!

245
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
Quick!

246
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
You haven't slept?

247
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,800
Ms. Zhou?

248
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,800
You see, I've bought a lot of stuff today,

249
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,360
so our fridge can't fit all

250
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,160
and we can't finish them.

251
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,360
I brought some for you and your friend.

252
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,880
Xinxin decided not to go to Shenzhen.

253
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,680
What?

254
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,080
She's not going to Shenzhen?

255
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
Yes, she's not going to Shenzhen.

256
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,080
Are you saying she's staying in Shanghai?

257
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,720
She's staying in Shanghai.

258
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,880
That's amazing!

259
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,720
- She's really not?
- What are you doing?

260
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,840
You've deafened an old lady.

261
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
Hurry.

262
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,640
Put it in the fridge.
My goodness, this kid.

263
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,120
- Bye.
- Rest early, bye.

264
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,880
Congratulations.

265
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,880
Congratulations?

266
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,640
What do you mean "congratulations"?
I'm finished!

267
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
What's the matter now?

268
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,880
You're finished if Ruoxin is leaving.

269
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
Now that she's not,

270
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,320
why are you finished?

271
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,240
No.

272
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,680
I thought she's leaving,
so I gambled everything.

273
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,680
Now that she's not, I…

274
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,040
How can we work together in the future?

275
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,200
Weren't you the one who said,
"I must confess that I like her"?

276
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,360
Who said,

277
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,280
"I'm prepared. I've decided"?

278
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
No, I have to remove the post.

279
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
Hey, something happened.

280
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,960
Can you go to the account
and remove the image?

281
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
<i>Are you insane, dude?</i>

282
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,560
<i>I just uploaded it
and now you want it removed?</i>

283
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,120
<i>You think this is a minor advert?</i>

284
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,920
<i>Removing it takes time too.</i>

285
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,240
How much time do you need?
The shortest time.

286
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,160
<i>At least two hours</i>

287
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,920
<i>and at double the price.</i>

288
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,320
Okay, the price is not a problem.
This isn't about money.

289
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,720
Quick. Faster.

290
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm begging you.

291
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Ruoxin hasn't come looking for me.

292
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
That means she hasn't seen it.

293
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,080
So there's only one way around it.

294
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,200
And what is that?

295
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
Stay close and stall her.

296
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,440
Coming.

297
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,960
Ruoxin, Qi Xiao has a bad stomachache.

298
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,480
The medicine he took is not working.

299
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,160
- Do you have medicine for gastritis?
- I do.

300
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,680
Is it serious?
Should he go to the hospital?

301
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm not sure either.
Why don't you go check on him?

302
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,040
Okay.

303
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,400
You're screaming with pain.

304
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,200
Are you having stomach flu?

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
Don't take random medicines.

306
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
It must be stomach flu

307
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,680
because nowhere else hurts.

308
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
How painful is it?

309
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,960
It's like…

310
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,080
It's like a spasm. It comes and goes.

311
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
We need to go to the hospital.

312
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,480
I'll call my dad.

313
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,760
He's on duty today.

314
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,080
No. It's fine.

315
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,320
It's not my first time.

316
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,560
I know.

317
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,880
But you can't keep this up.

318
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
It's my phone. Give it to me.

319
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,120
Give it to me.

320
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,400
What are you doing?

321
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,760
I need to pick up this call.

322
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,280
Ziyan.

323
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
Shen Ruoxin,

324
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,360
why didn't you tell me about Shenzhen?

325
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,160
Come to the bar tonight and explain.

326
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,880
I just decided not to go.
I haven't had the time to tell you.

327
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,000
<i>Why are you so ambiguous?</i>

328
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,200
What happened?

329
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,440
Come here quickly.

330
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760
I can't go. I'm at Qi Xiao's.

331
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,600
He's quite sick.
So I want to send him to the hospital.

332
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
I'll call you later.

333
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,240
I--

334
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,360
Him over friendship?

335
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,440
Where does it hurt?

336
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,960
Your stomach hurts?

337
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,920
I'm okay. It doesn't hurt anymore.

338
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
Doesn't hurt anymore?

339
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,000
I think it's because

340
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,960
I haven't had dinner.

341
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,600
I was hungry.

342
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
What's the time now?
Neither of you has eaten yet?

343
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,480
What do you want? It's my treat.

344
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,560
Hot pot.

345
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,040
You like hot pot.

346
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,160
You can't eat hot pot in this condition.

347
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,120
I can. Of course I can.

348
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,280
Hot pot is great. I want hot pot.

349
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
I'll do the booking.

350
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
A separate mix soup.

351
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,240
No.

352
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
Let Sijia do the booking.

353
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,880
Sijia said she knows

354
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,680
a delicious hot pot restaurant.

355
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
We were actually going to treat you there.

356
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,160
Then let me call Sijia to book.

357
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,360
Let Su Yang contact Sijia.

358
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,120
Give him a chance.

359
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,280
I'll contact Sijia.

360
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
It hurts again.

361
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
Can you eat hot pot? Let's not eat it.

362
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
Now it doesn't hurt anymore.

363
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,960
What's wrong with you?
Why did you mention Sijia?

364
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
Are you going to keep hiding from her?

365
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,040
Keep avoiding her?

366
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,040
Your love life is your--

367
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,520
Why drag me into it?

368
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
You must help me.

369
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,040
Let me tell you.

370
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,840
Our little friendship

371
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,800
is over.

372
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,840
Stop.

373
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,640
I tell you, today it's because--

374
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,960
What's the matter with you two?

375
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

376
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,800
- This is the last time.
- If it doesn't work--

377
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,640
Ruoxin, how is it? Tasty?

378
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,080
Sijia, have you been here before?

379
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,360
How did you find it?

380
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,720
This place is a five-star.

381
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,200
I thought to share this place
if it's tasty.

382
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
But now we're here.

383
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,360
Right, I haven't ordered the drinks.

384
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,840
Order anything you like.

385
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,320
Ruoxin, try this.

386
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,840
You should eat. Aren't you hungry?

387
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,880
Right,

388
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,840
I'm hungry.

389
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,880
Eat more.

390
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,760
Ruoxin, I heard you're no longer
going to Shenzhen.

391
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,880
Yes.

392
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,640
Actually, I can't bear to leave everyone.

393
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,120
I knew you'd cherish us.

394
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Sijia.

395
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,800
Today…

396
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,680
Are you and Su Yang okay?

397
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,600
We're fine.

398
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,160
We are alumni

399
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,480
and Qi Xiao's friends.

400
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,840
Ruoxin, do you want to order more?

401
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,680
Let's check online comments

402
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,720
- and see what else is recommended.
- No need.

403
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,840
No need.

404
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,440
Ruoxin, Qi Xiao and I invited you today,

405
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,680
so we'll do the ordering.

406
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,880
Qi Xiao, you order.

407
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,320
Right, I'm ordering. I'll do it.

408
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,440
Ruoxin, help me make a shabu-shabu.

409
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,640
How do you do it?

410
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,960
Seven to eight times.

411
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I have some.

412
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
Ruoxin, help me make it. Yours is tastier.

413
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,560
Seven times is enough.

414
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,920
Help settle the bill.
I'll transfer you the amount.

415
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
- Bill, please.
- Yes.

416
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
The total is 794 yuan.

417
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,640
EYES OF THE SKY

418
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,320
Why is it not down yet, dude?

419
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,320
Can you do it faster?

420
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
<i>I'm doing it now.</i>

421
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,960
<i>Stop urging when you need it
and don't need it.</i>

422
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,720
<i>- I'm trying.</i>
- No--

423
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,800
Hello?

424
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,600
What should I do?

425
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,720
Serves you right.

426
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,040
- Is it done, Qi Xiao?
- Yes.

427
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,760
It's done.

428
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,760
- Ruoxin.
- Yes?

429
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,120
I'm too full.

430
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,320
Let's go somewhere else.

431
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
You guys want round two?

432
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,640
Ruoxin, let's go sing.

433
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,320
You, youngsters, go. I'm not going.

434
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
I want to rest early.

435
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,400
I have to get up early tomorrow.

436
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,400
Ruoxin, let's visit Ziyan at her bar.

437
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,000
She invited us last time.

438
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,640
Yes, I have never been there.

439
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,960
Ruoxin.

440
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,200
Let me give her a call.

441
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,320
No need.

442
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,920
Let's give her a surprise.

443
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,000
Something's not right about you guys.

444
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,880
- Not right?
- Yes.

445
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
- No.
- Everything is all right.

446
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm happy you're not going to Shenzhen.

447
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
I'm so happy.

448
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,040
- Let's go, Ruoxin.
- Let's go.

449
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
Let's go.

450
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,040
- I'm almost done with work.
- Thank you.

451
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,520
EYES OF THE SKY

452
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,720
What's up with you today?

453
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,880
Nothing.

454
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,720
You have something to tell me?

455
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,880
You've been acting a lot today.

456
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,560
First, stomachache.

457
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Then, hot pot.

458
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
Now, even at the bar.

459
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
What are you thinking about?

460
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm happy.

461
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
I'm so happy.

462
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
Because you're not leaving.

463
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Why don't I feel that you're happy?

464
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,720
I think you're nervous.

465
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,520
Nervous?

466
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,320
I'm not nervous.

467
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm happy, from within.

468
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,160
Happiness from within.

469
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,320
Don't drink so much.

470
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,880
This is alcohol, not water.

471
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,080
None of your business.

472
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,320
Amazing!

473
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Ruoxin, thanks for coming.

474
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
They insist on listening to the music.

475
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,440
Did you change band members?

476
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,200
EYES OF THE SKY

477
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,760
The drummer from before had already quit.

478
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,160
We used a temporary replacement today.

479
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,720
We're still trying to adapt.

480
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,120
Why not ask Ziyan then?

481
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,880
She formed a band in college.

482
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
She played the drum.

483
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,560
Really? She didn't tell me.

484
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,560
Amazing.

485
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,920
Are you talking about me?

486
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,960
I'm not a professional.
I was just playing.

487
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,200
Why not try it out?

488
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,240
You know all our songs
and you're familiar with the rhythm.

489
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,640
- Try--
- No.

490
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,680
Don't listen to her. I really can't.

491
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,920
You can.

492
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
You were the best girl drummer
in our school.

493
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,080
Ziyan, you're so cool. Show us.

494
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,360
Show us.

495
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,280
- Come.
- All right.

496
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,280
I know you can. Come on, show me.

497
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,520
Okay?

498
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,720
EYES OF THE SKY

499
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,040
Good!

500
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,240
Here. Let's drink.

501
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,320
Sijia, let's drink.

502
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,840
Let's drink. Come.

503
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,200
Good!

504
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,240
Good!

505
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,600
Morning, Mr. Xu.

506
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,960
Morning.

507
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,760
Mr. Xu, Ms. Shen brought that over
this morning.

508
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,120
A peculiar gift.

509
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,560
This is handmade by a designer's friend.

510
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,159
He kept the patterns of the log.

511
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,239
Refined, but not fancy.

512
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,880
When I first saw it, I felt it was unique.

513
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,320
It reminded me of my childhood

514
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,320
playing tops with my friends.

515
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,440
Can I interpret it as

516
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
you've given me your word?

517
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,400
- Mr. Xu.
- You decided not to go?

518
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,679
When we choose to leave,

519
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,160
it's inevitable that we'll feel nostalgic.

520
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,760
Shanghai has been your home
since you were young.

521
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
I understand your hesitation.

522
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,440
But such nostalgia

523
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,840
will keep you locked up
in your comfort zone

524
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,880
and come in the way
of your future developments.

525
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,680
Isn't it a pity?

526
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,160
That day…

527
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,880
When you said

528
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,920
you wanted to bring me to Shenzhen,

529
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,120
all I could think of in my head

530
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,960
is that finally, there's a reason

531
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,880
to leave Shanghai
and run away from my mom.

532
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,320
But after I returned home

533
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,480
and saw my mom packing for me

534
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,640
to leave for Shenzhen,

535
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
I realized at that moment,

536
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,840
escape in the name of self-improvement

537
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,120
is just me lying to myself.

538
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,640
It's not so much nostalgia.

539
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,040
It's my hope

540
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,760
that every choice I make
is pure and simple.

541
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,960
My mom is old.

542
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,920
She really needs me.

543
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,560
That's why I've decided

544
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,760
to stay here with her.

545
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,360
Is this your final answer?

546
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,840
Mr. Xu,

547
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,920
I'm very grateful

548
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,800
for all the opportunities you've given me.

549
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,000
From now on, in Shanghai,

550
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,840
I will do my best to cooperate
with you at the headquarters.

551
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,840
My intentions,

552
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,160
as you already know,

553
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,840
are very clear.

554
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
You are a good boss.

555
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,520
When I was about to fall,

556
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
you reached out to me
and turned me around.

557
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,320
I really appreciate our teamwork

558
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,240
and mutual trust.

559
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,640
I believe

560
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,320
this communication

561
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,520
is the best for us.

562
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,320
I…

563
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
respect your decision.

564
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,240
Mr. Xu.

565
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm sorry for the promise

566
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
that I broke.

567
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,640
Actually, I'm quite satisfied.

568
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,320
This is the first time

569
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,280
you've expressed such thoughts to me.

570
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
The first time.

571
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,760
Although you refused to go.

572
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,360
This the first time
I felt our relationship

573
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,800
got a bit closer.

574
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,680
It's good.

575
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,960
I hope from now on,

576
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
aside from work,

577
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,760
I can have the honor to be

578
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,640
your old acquaintance?

579
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,080
Your friend?

580
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,600
Thank you for your understanding

581
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,040
and tolerance.

582
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,480
I hope,

583
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,280
as you stay here,

584
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,960
you will continue to be
as I first met you.

585
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,840
An ambitious person.

586
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
I will do my best

587
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,800
to cooperate with you.

588
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,120
All the best.

589
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,520
IF LIFE ONLY HAS…

590
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,960
The success of the New Energy Department

591
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,680
is all thanks to everyone's support.

592
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,200
Thank you for your hard work.

593
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,920
Tomorrow, I'll return to headquarters.

594
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,560
For the upcoming sales and PR work,

595
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,080
hopefully, everyone will keep it up.

596
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,640
Thank you, everyone.

597
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,680
What's important in sailing?

598
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,280
Helmsman.

599
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,440
Mr. Xu has always been

600
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
our company's winning general.

601
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
Mr. Xu,

602
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm impressed.

603
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,680
Good work.

604
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,360
As the saying goes,

605
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,040
"The speed of the train
depends on its engine."

606
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,880
To be honest,

607
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
for me to be here today

608
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,120
is all thanks to Mr. Liu.

609
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,760
That's why today,

610
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,560
the one who needs to thank Mr. Xu

611
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,560
should be Ms. Shen.

612
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,560
As you all know,

613
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,040
Ms. Shen used to be
in the Administration Department.

614
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,160
It's hard to achieve any results there,

615
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,680
am I right, Ms. Shen?

616
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,240
Thank you for reminding me, Mr. Ruan.

617
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,880
This time, I was able
to succeed in my mission

618
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,600
because of Ms. Shen's contribution.

619
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,280
From now on, for affairs related
to the New Energy Department,

620
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,440
I'll have to bother Ms. Shen.

621
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
In terms of work,

622
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,000
you can connect with me directly.

623
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,920
If there are any problems,

624
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,600
come straight to me,

625
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,920
I will be in charge of the discussion.

626
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,440
I will definitely do my best.

627
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,160
Ms. Shen, congratulations.

628
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,480
I'll finish this glass.
It's up to you to drink or not.

629
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,040
We all know what this is.

630
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,720
Actually, life

631
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,080
is like a top.

632
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,720
Some people spin to survive.

633
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,680
Some people spin to profit.

634
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,680
Some people spin to dream.

635
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,560
In their course of spinning,

636
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,640
there will be those who'd give you a push

637
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,000
and those

638
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,200
who'd push you down.

639
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
But in the end,

640
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,440
only you have the final control.

641
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,800
Mr. Xu,

642
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,200
this hobby of yours

643
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,000
is quite unique.

644
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,760
Given to me by a friend.

645
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,960
- Right. Thank you once again.
- Yes.

646
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,680
Zhu Lin,

647
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,200
where's that wooden top in your shop?

648
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,680
Ruoxin bought it.

649
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,640
That one?

650
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,560
Yes.

651
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,680
The handmade one. There's only one.

652
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,120
I wanted to make one

653
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,520
as an ornament for the shop.

654
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,680
Ruoxin said she likes it
so I gave it to her.

655
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,560
<i>But she said she's buying it as a gift</i>

656
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
<i>and paid me for it.</i>

657
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,160
<i>I couldn't say no.</i>

658
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,160
Okay, I get it.

659
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,440
I have faith

660
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,640
that we'll meet again soon.

661
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
ANHUA

662
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,960
Mr. Xu.

663
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,080
Have a safe journey.

664
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,800
Mr. Liu.

665
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,600
Mr. Xu, have a safe journey.

666
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's go.

667
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,400
