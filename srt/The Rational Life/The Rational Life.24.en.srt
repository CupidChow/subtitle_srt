1
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
Yes, Mom. I understand.

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
I'm working right now.

3
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,720
I'll tell you tonight, okay?

4
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,680
- I have to go.
- Class Four on Friday--

5
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,440
I'm sorry, ma'am.

6
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,840
I bumped into you.

7
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm sorry for breaking your Tianwen-1.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
You can tell this is Tianwen-1?

9
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,440
Tianwen-1 is China's first
interplanetary mission into Mars orbit.

10
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,760
It was launched into Mars in July 2020.

11
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,080
It will take nine months to reach Mars.

12
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,400
You've done research on it?

13
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,880
I wouldn't call it research.

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm just interested in astronomy
and love stargazing.

15
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
You don't seem to be from our school?

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,320
No, I'm not. I'm with Zenpro Automotive.

17
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,040
By the way, at the plaza,

18
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
there's an event
to promote new energy vehicles.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Ma'am, if you have the time,
you can have a look.

20
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,760
The vehicles are eco-friendly
and energy-saving.

21
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
I believe that promoting new energy

22
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,000
can improve the air quality in cities.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
Also, our new energy car motto is,

24
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
"Bring back starry skies to the cities."

25
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
No wonder you wanted to work
with the Astronomy Club.

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,320
I've been paying attention
to your new energy vehicles.

27
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,720
Astronomy Club?

28
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you the Astronomy Club's teacher?

29
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,800
That's great.

30
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,520
All the more reason to take a look.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,680
We really need your support and guidance.

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
Is that okay?

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,440
- Okay.
- That's great.

34
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's go. Please.

35
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,920
In our country,

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
we've attained great results

37
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
in terms of
curbing environmental pollution.

38
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,960
A lot of experts

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,640
gave credit to
the control of gasoline vehicles

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,600
and the increase in
new energy electric vehicles.

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,840
Please look at this.

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,560
These are the live test results

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,000
of air pollutant emissions

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
from gasoline and new energy vehicles.

45
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,520
The difference is clear as day.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
With innovative technology,

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
we can realize a safe
and pleasant green journey.

48
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,000
It cleanses the atmosphere.

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
This is also my wish.

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,240
I don't want our descendants to live

51
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,160
- in a highly contaminated environment.
- Ruoxin.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
- How did you get Ms. Fang on board?
- As you all know,

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,680
- I invited her when I contacted the club.
- humans,

54
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
- But she turned me down.
- there have been many changes…

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,280
That's right.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,279
Ms. Fang likes to keep a low profile.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,760
Ever since I entered the school,

58
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,760
it's my first time seeing her
attend such an event.

59
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,880
- Is that so?
- Yes.

60
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,240
- It's mainly carbon dioxide emissions.
- You're amazing.

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,520
The earth will become warm
and the glaciers will melt.

62
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,280
That will destroy the earth's ecosystem.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Ms. Fang.

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Thank you so much for today.

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
With you joining us,

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,560
we gained more trust.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
You're welcome.

68
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,320
I just think we share the same belief.

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
I just did what I could.

70
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
I heard that

71
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,520
you turned us down previously.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,440
Frankly speaking, I always thought

73
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,400
this kind of campaign was too utilitarian.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,440
The emphasis on eco-friendliness
is just a marketing stunt.

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,960
But today, when I saw that
you said the name of the model accurately,

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,840
you should be an astronomy fan as well.

77
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,360
You would have a passion
for promoting new energy vehicles.

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,080
- Thank you for understanding.
- You're welcome.

79
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,640
- I'll get going.
- Yes, Ms. Fang.

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
- Bye.
- Bye.

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,880
Hello, Ms. Fang.

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Ruoxin.

83
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960
Ms. Fang has posted our information
in their online school newspaper.

84
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,360
Many astronomy teachers were
very satisfied after the test-drive.

85
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Three people signed on for
the College-Exclusive Car Purchase Plan.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
What do you want to eat tonight?

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,840
Order anything you want.

89
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
It's on me.

90
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,600
That's generous.

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
It's tasty but who eats like you do?

92
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
I finally got my treat.

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
I must not let it go to waste.

94
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
What's wrong?

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
My stomach hurts so much.

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,840
Have a seat.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,840
Are you having indigestion?
Should I take you to the hospital?

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,760
No.

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,160
I guess I've been too tired lately.

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
It must be stomach flu.

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
I might be fine after some sleep.

102
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
That won't do.

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
Wait here. I'll get you medicine.

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
No need…

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,560
Do you have gastric pills?

106
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Thank you.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,080
QUANYI HEALTH PHARMACY

108
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,200
This is for abdominal bloating.

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,600
This one is for stomach colds.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,120
This is to help with digestion.

111
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
What are your symptoms?

112
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,520
You should've asked first
before buying them.

113
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,680
I was too anxious to get you the medicine.

114
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,680
Which one is it?

115
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Here, take your medicine.

116
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Thank you.

117
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,800
RUOXIN

118
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,240
<i>Does your stomach still hurt?</i>

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,680
Shen Ruoxin!

120
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,880
Shen Ruoxin!

121
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,240
Are you okay, Shen Ruoxin?

122
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,800
Open the door!

123
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
Shen Ruoxin, answer the phone!

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
Give me the passcode!

125
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,600
Six, nine…

126
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,080
Six, nine, zero, seven, two, zero.

127
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,440
Okay.

128
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,280
Shen Ruoxin!

129
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,960
What's wrong?

130
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,400
It hurts so much.

131
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,240
Hang in there.

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm taking you to the hospital.

133
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,680
Here.

134
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,920
It's okay. Come on.

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,680
Sir, please drive faster.

136
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,600
Okay.

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
- It hurts.
- Sir, please hurry.

138
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
Faster, okay?

139
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
- Okay.
- We're almost there.

140
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,120
BLUE LEAGUE

141
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Doctor.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,280
- What's wrong?
- Her stomach hurts so much

143
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,560
- that she can't stand up.
- Over here.

144
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
- This way.
- Okay.

145
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
Here.

146
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,480
Lie down here.

147
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
- What's wrong with her?
- All right. Please wait outside.

148
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,760
Please wait outside. I need to check.

149

SECTION A
RESUSCITATION AREA

150
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
Who's Shen Ruoxin's family?

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,800
Doctor, I am.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,320
How is she now?

153
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
The patient has acute appendicitis.

154
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,040
- Does she need surgery right away?
- Yes.

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,480
We need her family's consent
for the surgery.

156
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll sign it.

157
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,480
Are you the patient's brother?

158
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
No, I'm her boyfriend.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
Her parents can't be reached.

160
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
What's wrong? I can't?

161
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,120
- Ask for the patient's authorization.
- Okay.

162
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,280
Doctor, her current condition,

163
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
is the surgery dangerous?

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
We do minimally invasive surgery
for appendicitis.

165
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,240
It's a little expensive,
but all surgeries involve risks.

166
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,600
Even minimally invasive surgery?

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
It's still surgery.

168
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,200
The patient agreed. You can sign it.

169
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640

QI XIAO

171
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,120
Doctor, how did the surgery go?

172
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
It's a small surgery.
It was a success. Don't worry.

173
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,160
She'll be discharged in a few days.

174
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,120
Thank you.

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,400
This patient just had surgery
so she's still under anesthesia.

176
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,000
She can only have a small amount
of liquid diet these days.

177
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,960
Raw, oily, and spicy food,

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
avoid all of those.

179
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
No smoking and no drinking.

180
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,800
Okay, I'll remember that. Thank you.

181
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,520
Be careful. Slowly.

182
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,440
Be careful. Slowly.

183
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,320
You're still here?

184
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,960
You scared me.

185
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,960
You're such a coward.

186
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,840
If you don't feel well,
you shouldn't hold it in.

187
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,280
You have to go to the hospital right away.
Do you hear me?

188
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
What's with the attitude?

189
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,880
Does it still hurt?

190
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Just sleep if you are drowsy.
I'll be here.

191
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,000
Stay still.

192
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Mind your wound.

193
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
Be careful.

194
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,400
I'll raise it for you.

195
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Is that okay?

196
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,600
I brought you breakfast.

197
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,960
You didn't sleep at all?

198
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,520
I took a nap. Don't worry.

199
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,880
Did you apply for leave?

200
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
It's done.

201
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,520
Rest well.

202
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
I finally understand

203
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,640
why your mom keeps nagging
about your irregular lifestyle.

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,640
You can be her son then.

205
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,320
If you last a week, I'll let you win.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,160
I'm serious.

207
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Acute appendicitis might be
caused by stomach flu.

208
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,080
Here.

209
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,800
I can feed myself.

210
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,400
Just behave and eat, wounded comrade.

211
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,040
It's not hot, is it?

212
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
Your boyfriend is so sweet.

213
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,560
If he didn't bring you here
in time last night,

214
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,320
it's troublesome
if appendicitis aggravates.

215
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,320
He stayed with you all night
and doesn't complain at all.

216
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,920
He went out to buy breakfast
before sunrise

217
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,520
and complained about our hospital's food.

218
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,160
Miss--

219
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,800
You authorized it yesterday
so that I can sign off as your boyfriend.

220
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
If you deny it now,

221
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,760
I'll bear legal liabilities.

222
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,080
Miss.

223
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
My girlfriend has
a really irregular lifestyle.

224
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
When she's busy,
she only grabs a few bites.

225
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,040
When she has time to eat,
she only eats spicy food.

226
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,720
Shouldn't she be disciplined?

227
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,080
- Is your stomach quite weak?
- Yes.

228
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,280
After the surgery,

229
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,080
your boyfriend kept asking
the doctor questions

230
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,360
and specific details.

231
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,720
He's way more attentive than you.
Don't ignore his advice.

232
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,280
Did you hear that?

233
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,040
I didn't make it up.

234
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,080
Take this 30 minutes after the meal.

235
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,800
Okay, thank you.

236
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,960
Take care of your girlfriend.

237
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,680
Did you gang up with the nurse
to discipline me?

238
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,880
I'm innocent.

239
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,640
How is that disciplining you?

240
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,079
I am obviously…

241
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,280
Just a boyfriend
who cares about his girlfriend.

242
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,240
You want to get hit?
How dare you take advantage of your boss?

243
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,280
At work, you are the boss.

244
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,640
In the hospital, you are just a patient.

245
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
Here.

246
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Hurry up.

247
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,920
Drink some water.

248
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,880
You didn't tell my mom, did you?

249
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,000
No. It was too late last night.

250
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,280
Your mom's traveling,
so she can't make it back.

251
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,120
She'll only worry if I tell her.

252
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
You wouldn't want her to worry, right?

253
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
You are quite thoughtful.

254
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
Right.

255
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,320
As for the campus campaign,
you should check on it.

256
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,840
I'm fine here.

257
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,680
Call me if anything comes up.

258
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay.

259
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,120
Give Ziyan a call.
I'll leave when she gets here.

260
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,320
No, it's just an appendicitis surgery.

261
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
It's no big deal. I'm fine.

262
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,240
No way. I'll leave when she gets here.

263
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,280
Why are you so stubborn?

264
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,520
Do you know how important
the campaign is to us?

265
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,320
Nothing is more important than you, okay?

266
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Shen Ruoxin,
why don't you put yourself first?

267
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,880
You don't need to be taken care of?
Are you Superman or Spider-Man?

268
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,160
You are now a patient.

269
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,040
Can't you understand
that you are a patient?

270
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,320
I'll call her later.

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,520
If I call her, she'll come right away.

272
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,720
You can leave first.

273
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,880
Call her right now.

274
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,880
Have some water.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,120
Take a look first.

276
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,120
GIFT REDEMPTION COUNTER

277
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,920
What's the matter?
Why aren't we getting any sales?

278
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,320
I just got a call from the company.

279
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,680
Two sales representatives suddenly
took annual leave, so they couldn't come.

280
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
Why did they pick this day?

281
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,480
Qi Xiao, if anyone wants
to sign a contract,

282
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,400
can I just let them sign up for pre-order?

283
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,520
Okay, thank you.

284
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,920
I'll handle it.

285
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,280
Ruoxin.

286
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,640
Both sales representatives are
suddenly off today.

287
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,600
Neither came.
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

288
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
How can that be?

289
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Mr. Liu must be behind this.

290
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,320
What should we do now?

291
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,280
Should I tell them to cancel their leave?

292
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,840
Wait for my call.

293
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,960
Handle the event
and wait for me at the office.

294
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Okay.

295
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,840
XU MINJIE

296
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,480
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Mr. Xu?

297
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
<i>What is it?</i>

298
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
The new energy vehicle's campus campaign
is doing pretty well.

299
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,120
That's why I would like to ask

300
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,120
if you can offer our sales representatives

301
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
a higher incentive?

302
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
How much higher?

303
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,560
I think…

304
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,000
How about raising 1%?

305
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

306
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,920
But

307
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,560
it's only for the campaign.

308
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

309
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,960
What's wrong, dear?

310
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Why are you in the hospital?
What did the doctor say?

311
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,200
Yes, it's just appendicitis.
A small surgery.

312
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
You are hospitalized,
yet you are still on the phone.

313
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,040
You sure are worth hiring.
Is this an occupational hazard?

314
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,360
I'm working. What can I do?

315
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
That kid sure nags a lot today.

316
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,320
Who is it?

317
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
Qi Xiao?

318
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,160
He made me call you.

319
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,160
He got mad at me when you didn't show up.

320
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,840
He acts like he's my boss.

321
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,280
This kid, Qi Xiao really cares about you.

322
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm his boss.

323
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,800
If I die,

324
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,080
what's in it for him?

325
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,960
You are a sickly kitty now.

326
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,240
Who's protecting whom?

327
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,680
I have to answer a call.

328
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,320
Hello?

329
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,600
Are you at the company?

330
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,560
Okay.

331
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
Listen carefully.

332
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,120
Go to Mr. Liu's office right now.

333
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,040
<i>Get him to assign sales representatives.</i>

334
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,440
<i>He won't agree
and will make all sorts of excuses.</i>

335
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,720
<i>But it's okay.</i>

336
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,720
<i>Just make him agree that</i>

337
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,320
as long as the sales representatives
are willing, he'll approve.

338
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
Go straight to the Sales Department.

339
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,040
Mr. Xu already agreed to my request.

340
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,360
During the campaign,
the sales representatives

341
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,560
who sold out cars for us
will get an extra 1% in incentive.

342
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,320
<i>Money talks.</i>

343
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,240
Okay, I understand.

344
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,960
Mr. Liu.

345
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,920
May I come in?

346
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,200
- Mr. Liu.
- What's the matter?

347
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,680
Mr. Liu.

348
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,760
The New Energy Department

349
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,360
is doing a campus campaign for a few days.

350
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
Our assigned sales representatives
are taking annual leave.

351
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,880
They can't make it.

352
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
What a coincidence?

353
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,800
How can you sell cars
without sales representatives?

354
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
Indeed.

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
That's why I came here
to ask for your help.

356
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,800
Ms. Shen had
acute appendicitis surgery yesterday.

357
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
She's still in the hospital.

358
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm holding the fort alone.

359
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,760
It's hard to accomplish anything.

360
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
Ms. Shen was hospitalized? How is she?

361
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
The surgery went well.

362
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,880
She just has to be observed
for a few days.

363
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,160
Okay.

364
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,760
It's good that she's fine.

365
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
Mr. Liu, be careful, it's hot.

366
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
All right. Get back to work.

367
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,600
Mr. Liu.

368
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,160
I would like to borrow a few
sales representatives from you.

369
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,360
That's a problem.

370
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,160
KPI is really important
in the Sales Department.

371
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
Mr. Ma came to me a few days ago

372
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
about recruiting a few more
sales representatives.

373
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,000
How about this?
Once I'm done with my work,

374
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,200
I'll check with the Sales Department.

375
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,720
They might be able to help.

376
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,120
Mr. Liu.

377
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,440
The new energy vehicles they sell
also count as their sales.

378
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
They also count as their sales?

379
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,800
Look at the sales
of your new energy vehicles.

380
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,720
I can't pry into
what the Sales Department prefer

381
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,120
or don't prefer to sell.

382
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,640
It's normal if they turn down
such a difficult task.

383
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,480
Yes, you are right.

384
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,720
I checked with the Sales Department.

385
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
They all seem reluctant.

386
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,920
Since you worked your way up from sales,

387
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
your words must carry some weight
in the Sales Department.

388
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,000
Even if they don't want to,
you just say the word

389
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,000
and I'm sure a few will agree to it.

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,920
The company is all about sales.

391
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,080
It's about KPI.

392
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,520
Even my words might not work.

393
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,720
What should I tell Mr. Xu then?

394
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,280
Mr. Xu seems

395
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
to have just reported to the chairman

396
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,680
about our series of campaigns.

397
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
You've mentioned both of your bosses.

398
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,040
Fine, listen up.

399
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,280
Don't say that I've hindered
the new energy campaign.

400
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,920
Tell the Sales Department that

401
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,160
if they want to do it, I'm fine with it.

402
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,640
That's great.

403
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Mr. Liu,

404
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,880
I've asked around.

405
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,480
Make a few calls and get them involved.

406
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
Qi Xiao, this is as far as I can go.

407
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
You are on your own.
Close the door on your way out.

408
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,120
Thank you for your support, Mr. Liu.

409
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,440
Goodbye, Mr. Liu.

410
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,040
Everyone, the New Energy Department

411
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,560
is holding a campus campaign
for a few days.

412
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,120
We need a few people at the venue.

413
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Will any of you join us?
Mr. Liu has agreed to it.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,920
Qi Xiao.

415
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,360
Look how busy everyone is.
No one can make time.

416
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Look at this.

417
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
We all have missions and plans.

418
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,440
We have to top it.

419
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,040
Didn't we just have the October 1st sales?

420
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,080
It's still early for
Double 11 and Spring Festival sales.

421
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,360
It's the off-season now.

422
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,120
There might not be any clients
even if you wait around.

423
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,840
Waiting around is better

424
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,040
than working for nothing, right?

425
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,040
What if we wait and get a good catch?

426
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,680
Well,

427
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,200
anyone who helps out at
the campus campaign for a few days,

428
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,840
for every car you sell,

429
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,200
you get 1% more than the incentive you get
from a traditional vehicle.

430
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,840
You don't have the power to do that?

431
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,840
Ms. Shen doesn't either?

432
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,880
- That's right.
- Right.

433
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,800
It's Mr. Xu's exclusive deal.

434
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,280
A few teachers

435
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,960
already signed it the other day.

436
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,800
There are so many intellectuals
in the school.

437
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,880
They do have a different understanding
of new energy vehicles.

438
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,560
Let me make myself clear.

439
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,800
It's a rare opportunity. Just this once.

440
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,240
- I'm free.
- Take me with you.

441
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,920
- I love playing basketball in school.
- I can go with you, okay?

442
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,920
Take me with you.

443
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,880
Aren't you busy?

444
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,280
How can you go if you are busy?

445
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
We should support
our company's new product, right?

446
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,480
Even if we are busy,
we have to make time for it.

447
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,040
- You are busy? Go ahead.
- Exactly!

448
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
- Let's go.
- Yes, take us with you.

449
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,680
- We can go by ourselves.
- You are always busy.

450
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,280
I was actually going to tell you that day.

451
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,640
That early learning center

452
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,640
wants me to teach drums.

453
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,160
The job

454
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,840
is pretty good.

455
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm just hesitant.

456
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,480
Why are you hesitating?

457
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,600
You don't have to go
to the bar during the day.

458
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400
Also, you don't have to teach every day.

459
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,040
The thought of teaching children

460
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,320
makes me cringe.

461
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,560
I think I'm allergic to kids.

462
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,000
What?

463
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,520
My wound hurts. You're allergic to kids?

464
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,680
Why are you allergic to kids?

465
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,920
Didn't you grow up as a kid?

466
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
What's so hard about that?

467
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,320
Just teach them what you learned.

468
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Kids these days

469
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
are different from how we were young.

470
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Haven't you seen those kids out there?

471
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,280
When things don't go their way,
they cry and scream.

472
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,920
I really want to shut them up.

473
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,240
Isn't it better than an adult
who has to fake a smile all day?

474
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,720
Now that you mentioned it,

475
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
I feel like

476
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,400
the older you get,
the more aggrieved you are.

477
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,240
Don't worry. It won't be a problem.

478
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
What's so scary about kids?

479
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,920
Just teach them what you learned.

480
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,520
It's going to be fine.

481
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,360
Just think, kids who learn the drums
can't be too young.

482
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,480
You can do it.

483
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
We'll see.

484
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
My life as an employee is back.

485
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,160
Sijia.

486
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,200
Hello? Are you in the hospital?

487
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,320
Which hospital?

488
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,200
I'll visit you after work.

489
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
Thank you, Sijia.

490
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,520
Can you stop by my house before you come?

491
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,160
Get me some clean clothes.

492
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,000
<i>I'll text you my passcode right now.</i>

493
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,360
No problem.

494
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,800
Ruoxin.

495
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
About the additional agreement
for the ad you proposed,

496
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,560
Mr. Ruan is holding on to it.

497
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,880
It hasn't been processed.

498
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
<i>Qi Xiao came to urge me again.</i>

499
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,200
But I don't dare to urge Mr. Ruan.

500
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,200
Regarding this matter,
I still want to inform you.

501
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,560
Okay, I understand.

502
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,240
Look at how busy you are.

503
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,680
You should go. Don't stay with me.

504
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Aren't you getting the bar
some new utensils? I'm fine.

505
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,920
I'll get going then.

506
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
Go on.

507
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,800
- Be careful on the way.
- All right.

508
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,880
Qi Xiao.

509
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,360
Did you settle the sales issue?

510
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,080
It's okay. Three of them went over.

511
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,200
I'll be on my way too.

512
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,240
<i>Hold on.</i>

513
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,400
<i>Sijia just called me</i>

514
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,800
- <i>about the ad's additional agreement.</i>
- That's right.

515
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,960
Didn't she say it's still processing?

516
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,560
It's definitely not in the process.

517
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,640
This is clearly a way to buy time.

518
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,120
Next, it's Double 11,
New Year's Day, and Spring Festival,

519
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
the three best-selling seasons.

520
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,560
<i>The advertisers need to come up with
three proposals at once.</i>

521
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,280
<i>It's a lot of work.</i>

522
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,320
They can't keep waiting for our agreement.

523
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,720
If we miss the timing,

524
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,920
there will be no budget
for our new energy product.

525
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,640
We are really going to miss out
on the best sales season.

526
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,840
That's such a sly tactic.

527
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,120
Sure, I'll find a way to urge them.

528
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Make sure you get
the agreement signed today.

529
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,560
Get it delivered to them
before they clock out.

530
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Okay.

531
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,200
You're mapping out strategies
from miles away.

532
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,520
Does it feel great?

533
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,480
It's not bad.

534
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,440
Come in.

535
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,160
Mr. Ruan.

536
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,120
What is it?

537
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,200
The New Energy Department's
additional agreement with the advertiser.

538
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,600
When will it get processed?

539
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,200
Is there another problem?

540
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,760
Can we get it signed today?

541
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,800
You see,

542
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,800
it's peak season right now.

543
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,280
There are lots of big collaborations
in the company's events.

544
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,720
We are totally swamped
at the Legal Department.

545
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,160
Yours is a…

546
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
A supplementary agreement, right?

547
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
Let me finish what I'm doing first.

548
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,720
Mr. Ruan.

549
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,960
Since ours is just

550
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,000
a simple supplementary agreement,

551
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,000
Take a look at ours first.

552
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,760
Everything…

553
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,440
There's an order to things.

554
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,040
Shouldn't there be priorities?

555
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
Qi Xiao, you used to be
in the Legal Department.

556
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,520
How can you not know that?

557
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,440
Mr. Ruan.

558
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,080
Why are you making things
difficult for a nobody like me?

559
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,680
As you know,

560
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,600
Mr. Xu is promoting
the new energy vehicle.

561
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,960
Mr. Liu wants to hold on
to the traditional vehicles.

562
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,280
One is powerful
with the support of the chairman,

563
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,800
the other is the local head
of the East China region.

564
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
In the fight between the best,

565
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,960
it's us, the minions that suffer.

566
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,679
If they end up fighting each other

567
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
without falling out,

568
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,880
won't they still make us the scapegoats

569
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,199
to take the blame?

570
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,760
We work so hard.

571
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,360
What wrong have we done?

572
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,880
Right?

573
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,199
Mr. Liu has been
with the company for years.

574
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,920
Everyone respects him.

575
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,480
We all want him to do well.

576
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,480
After two years,

577
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,520
he can retire glamorously.

578
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,560
But we should appease Mr. Xu as well.

579
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,880
You know that, right?

580
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,320
Mr. Xu is already angry
with the previous slope in the sales.

581
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,520
If this ad campaign goes wrong again,

582
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,560
he's definitely going to…

583
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
sacrifice someone.

584
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,840
Mr. Xu is the youngest senior partner

585
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,120
in Zenpro Group.

586
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,960
He's also the chairman's favorite.

587
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,160
I can't afford to offend him.

588
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,880
Mr. Ruan, please do me a favor.

589
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,400
Spare my life, will you?

590
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,320
Qi Xiao, you…

591
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,360
It's just a supplementary agreement.

592
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,360
It's no big deal. I'll get it done today.

593
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
Thank you, Mr. Ruan. You are a great help.

594
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,840
- Go ahead. I'll pick it up after work.
- Okay.

595
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,800
Let me take a look first.

596
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,240
Right.

597
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,520
Qi Xiao, come.

598
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
Have a seat.

599
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,520
Have a seat.

600
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,080
Qi Xiao.

601
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,600
I think you're absolutely right.

602
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,360
When the best fight, the minions suffer.

603
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,360
That's right.

604
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
We are both just part-timers.

605
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,400
This matter…

606
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,320
By the way,

607
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I heard that

608
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,560
Ms. Shen is sick?

609
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,600
Yes.

610
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,600
This is…

611
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,280
- Please send her my regards.
- Okay.

612
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,520
Tell her not to work too hard

613
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,760
and take good care of herself.

614
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,640
Health is the most important thing.

615
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
If she needs any help,

616
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,040
she can talk to me.

617
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,040
I'll help if I can.

618
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Sure, no problem.

619
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
I'll surely relay the message.

620
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,760
Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

621
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
You're welcome.

622
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,000
You don't have to come over later.

623
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,440
I'll get this done right away
and ask You Sijia to deliver it to you.

624
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,480
No problem. Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

625
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,600
See you, Mr. Ruan.

626
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,120
It's just work. You're welcome.

627
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,240
- Go.
- Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

628
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,400
- Mr. Ruan, please go ahead.
- Okay, bye.

629
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,200
- You can leave the door open.
- Okay.

630
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,800
Thank you, Mr. Ruan.

631
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,040
I only analyzed
our company's structure to Ruan Ye.

632
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,880
I didn't need to sound tough.

633
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,880
He already knows what to do.

634
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,360
I didn't expect you to threaten Ruan Ye.

635
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,320
I don't believe someone like Ruan Ye
is loyal to Mr. Liu.

636
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,760
Mr. Liu is over 50 years old.

637
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,960
He might retire anytime.

638
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,720
Look at Mr. Xu, he's in his prime.

639
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,640
I don't believe
that he doesn't have his own plans.

640
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,600
I thought you were a kid.

641
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,440
I didn't expect you to be
quite a good judge of character.

642
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
Ruoxin.

643
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,240
I usually don't want to think about

644
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,680
those troublesome matters.

645
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,360
But you are hospitalized,

646
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,240
I have to take care of things
for you at the company

647
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,760
so you can rest with ease.

648
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,280
Hold on.

649
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,760
Sijia, were you looking for me?

650
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,080
No.

651
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,640
Please press the 13th floor.

652
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,920
Sijia.

653
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
I have something to tell you.

654
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,720
That day,

655
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,680
I said a lot of harsh things to you.

656
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,880
It's because I offended a client
and I got a complaint.

657
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,040
I was so upset and depressed.

658
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,200
I thought that

659
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,960
I'd be fired very soon.

660
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,560
It doesn't matter.

661
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Sijia.

662
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,360
- What are you doing?
- I have to come clean to you.

663
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
I'm afraid I'll get back
to being that timid Su Yang.

664
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
That day,

665
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,440
I offended a client

666
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,320
because he wanted me to draw a cat image.

667
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,240
I refused.

668
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I got scolded by my boss.

669
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
When you've been ignoring me,

670
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,760
I've thought it through.

671
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,720
I'm afraid to leave Shanghai.

672
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,800
It's not just because

673
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,920
Shanghai is a big city
with a lot of opportunities.

674
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,480
But it's because…

675
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,000
You're in Shanghai.

676
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,240
I don't know if I'll get another chance.

677
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,960
But…

678
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,800
I want to tell you that

679
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,320
I've always liked you.

680
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,160
I'm sorry.

681
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,200
Can you give me another chance?

682
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,040
SAD, MEANINGLESS LIFE

683
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,080
We're not getting off. You can come in.

684
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,720
The eighth floor, please.

685
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,720
I just had porridge

686
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,240
for three meals a day.

687
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,160
I'm already nauseous from it.

688
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,280
Listen to me.

689
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,160
The doctor said
you can only have porridge now.

690
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,280
But I bought you pork floss today.

691
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,000
I'll add a bit more in.

692
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,560
Add less. I'm on a diet.

693
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,360
All right.

694
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,720
I'll feed myself.

695
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,800
Slowly.

696
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,360
Why are you staring at me like that?

697
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,080
I'm not.

698
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,360
Eat up.

699
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,560
You can't even stay quiet
while having porridge.

700
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Stay still.

701
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,280
