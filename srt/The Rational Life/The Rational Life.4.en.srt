1
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,440
Thank you.

2
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
Hello.

3
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
I have a question.

4
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,720
Where is my desk?

5
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,120
Ms. Shen.

6
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
That's your desk.

7
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,600
Our administration office
is nothing compared to yours.

8
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
Only the director has an office.

9
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,040
So you'll have to make do with us,

10
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,960
cramped in the same office.

11
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,040
There's nothing to make do of.

12
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,640
I can work anywhere.

13
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,960
I look forward to working with everyone.

14
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,640
Thank you.

15
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,160
Here.

16
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,440
Here.

17
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's switch desks.

18
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,680
I get hot easily.
I like to be near the air conditioner.

19
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,520
What are you doing here?

20
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,400
I applied to be your assistant.

21
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
I made a deal with Ruan Ye yesterday.
I'll go wherever you go.

22
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,880
Are you crazy?

23
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,200
You applied to the Legal Department.

24
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,960
You're not my personal assistant.

25
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,400
You're a law major. Why are you
in the Administration Department?

26
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
You studied law too.

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
Why can't I be
in the Administration Department too?

28
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,960
You're the one who hired me anyway.

29
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
So you'll be responsible until the end.

30
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,000
How is it?

31
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,560
Aren't you touched?

32
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,240
Don't you think
I'm a very loyal friend to you?

33
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
Have you lost your mind?

34
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,400
But come to think of it,
there's nothing wrong

35
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,640
with what you're doing now.

36
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,680
The Legal Department knew that I hired you

37
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,880
because of Jin Yuanhao's case.

38
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,640
If you stay behind by yourself,

39
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,760
Ruan Ye won't go easy on you.

40
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,920
Forget about the one-month probation.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
By joining me
in the Administration Department,

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,240
you might still get a chance.

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,360
One, you'll get a good reputation
for workforce loyalty.

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
Two, I've been in the company
for so many years after all.

45
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
Although I've been demoted,

46
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,080
I'm still a senior manager.

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
It shouldn't be a problem

48
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
to let you pass your probation?

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
How can you be so ungrateful?

50
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
Just sit where the air conditioner is at.

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,560
I was so stupid to work
for a boss like you.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000
I am the manager.

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,800
I should choose the desk first.

54
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,760
I'll sit there.

55
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,760
But I need you to help me unpack.

56
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,000
I need to make a call.

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Thank you, my assistant.

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,120
<i>Cindy, can you talk?</i>

59
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,880
Sure.

60
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,080
Why would the busy Ms. Shen
think of calling me the headhunter?

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
The thing is,

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,160
I have a college graduate working for me.

63
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,920
I'd like to know if you have
any jobs for freshmen?

64
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,480
I see.

65
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,280
Let me be honest with you.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,880
It might be harder for a rookie
than for you to find a job now.

67
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>You know how the market is now.</i>

68
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,040
<i>All the big companies are taken.</i>

69
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,400
Especially for an entry-level job.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,880
If he doesn't have a forte,
his resume won't even go through.

71
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,360
<i>It's a good thing that he's young.</i>

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>If you really care about him,</i>

73
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,320
let him work for you for a few years.

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,080
This way, with some experience,
it's easier to change jobs.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,360
Okay, I understand.

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,040
What do you mean "harder to find than me"?

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,840
Yesterday, on a job-hunting site,

78
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,440
I saw many positions for
senior legal managers and directors.

79
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,680
Of course you did.

80
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,680
But I've known you for so long.

81
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll be honest with you.

82
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,960
With your qualifications,

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,560
you're definitely not
the company's priority.

84
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,360
<i>You're in your early thirties.</i>

85
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,040
<i>It would have been easier
if you were a few years older.</i>

86
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,640
What do you mean? I don't understand.

87
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,920
This is a bit difficult to say.

88
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,520
But it's understandable
from the company's perspective.

89
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
<i>You should know</i>

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
<i>that companies are afraid to hire
women in their early thirties.</i>

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,160
What if you get the job, fall in love,
get married, and have kids?

92
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,680
<i>The company has to find a replacement.</i>

93
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,480
Why is it better to be a bit older then?

94
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,040
<i>Think about it.</i>

95
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,920
<i>If you are a few years older,
your life is already stable.</i>

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
<i>When looking for a job,</i>

97
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
<i>this is a huge advantage.</i>

98
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,800
<i>That means</i>

99
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,600
you can serve the company wholeheartedly.

100
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
Okay then.

101
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,560
I'll contact you in five years.

102
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,840
You look so handsome.

103
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,720
You have a girlfriend, right?

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,640
No.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,120
No? Then let me introduce you to someone.

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,520
I have all the information
about the single ladies

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,640
in our company.

108
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
What kind of girls do you like?

109
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,440
Quiet ones.

110
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,240
"Quiet ones."

111
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,120
Ms. Shen, you're back?

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
This is…

113
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,360
Ms. Li asked you

114
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
to go through these statistics charts

115
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,160
and file them into the database.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
She needs them in two days.

117
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,960
The statistics are too old.

118
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,600
The format has changed.

119
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,240
It will take some time.

120
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,680
Two days might not be enough.

121
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,920
Ms. Li said that

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
because this is hard and time-pressing,

123
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,640
none of us can handle it.

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,040
That's why we're asking you for help.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,320
Ms. Li also said

126
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,560
that everyone in the company knows

127
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,760
that Ms. Shen is the best.

128
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
You're not going to refuse to work
when you've just joined us, right?

129
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,160
You make it sound like you don't like
the Administration Department.

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,880
I have to thank Ms. Li for trusting me

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
with such a huge challenge and motivation.

132
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,680
I'll do my best to get the job done.

133
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,800
That's good.

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,080
I knew Ms. Shen is a good sport.

135
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,280
It's such an old document.

136
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,280
I don't believe it's urgent.

137
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,800
Are they bullying you?

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Are they trying to force you out?

139
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,200
What's the point in whining?

140
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,200
Get to work.

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,280
One for you, three for me.

142
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
<i>Ruoxin.</i>

143
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,840
<i>Don't you ever get upset?</i>

144
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
<i>How does that resolve anything?</i>

145
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>Given your reputation
and competence in this industry,</i>

146
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,680
<i>a lot of companies want you.</i>

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,480
<i>So you're not me.</i>

148
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,680
<i>Pick yourself up from where you fall.</i>

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Get in.

150
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,600
No, thank you.

151
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm really leaving.

152
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,520
- Where do you live? Enter the address.
- Sure.

153
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,640
It's done.

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
<i>Your destination is Fenghua Apartments.</i>

155
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
<i>It's 1.8 km away.</i>

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,080
- You live in this neighborhood?
- Yes.

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,760
It's my first day there.

158
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,760
It belongs to my roommate's classmate.

159
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
It's rented to us cheap.

160
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
It's close to the office,
so I can work overtime.

161
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
I worked overtime on my first day.

162
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,920
I live in this neighborhood too.

163
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,360
Turn off the GPS. It's annoying.

164
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
Are you serious?

165
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,560
Will I be able
to hitch a ride from you from now on?

166
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
You wish.

167
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
How odd. Why is your phone so hot?

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,120
Is it because there are too many apps
in the background?

169
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
There's no app.

170
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
I only use it to answer texts,

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,800
order takeout, and call once in a while.

172
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,560
Do you want me to check the system?

173
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,560
Sure.

174
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm warning you. Don't probe around.

175
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,880
Don't worry, Boss.

176
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,920
That's a lot of data.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Are you a subscriber to dramas or videos?

178
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Are you kidding? Do I have time for that?

179
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,080
It'd better not be the Trojans
or some hidden software.

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
By the way, Ruoxin,

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,640
my buddy in the computer major told me,

182
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120
it's quite difficult to track
the IP address of the user.

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
Some virtual cryptography is applied.

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,880
I can't explain it anyway.

185
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,040
He'll keep helping us when he has time.

186
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,200
<i>Two months ago,</i>

187
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,440
<i>he asked,</i>

188
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,640
"How do I install a tracking app

189
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,680
on my wife's phone?"

190
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
<i>Whoever filmed you secretly,
he must have stalked you.</i>

191
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,520
<i>I booked a French restaurant tonight.</i>

192
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
<i>Ziyan can spend her birthday
with her husband.</i>

193
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,400
Why are you going with them?

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,000
Right. Which restaurant
will you be going to?

195
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm having dinner with my best friend.

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,160
Do you need to ask for all the details?

197
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,840
Hi.

198
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,880
<i>Why don't we talk in person?</i>

199
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,280
<i>You're at Pudong Avenue, right?</i>

200
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,280
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

201
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,120
How did you know that?

202
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,080
Well, they…

203
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,600
Yes, they said
you were out on Pudong Avenue.

204
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,360
What do you think, Ruoxin?

205
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
Ruoxin?

206
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,080
What?

207
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,360
What's on your mind?

208
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,360
It's nothing.

209
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,040
My goodness!

210
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,560
Being in the same neighborhood
is one thing, but even the same block?

211
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
Ruoxin, I'm on the twelfth floor.

212
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,280
Are you also on the twelfth floor?

213
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
Can there be such a coincidence?

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,520
Good night.

215
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,920
Okay.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,960
SURVEILLANCE ON GIRLFRIEND

217
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,360
MONITORING GIRLFRIEND'S CELL PHONE

218
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
It's so late. Who is it?

219
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
- Did you order takeout?
- No.

220
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,440
- I'll go and check.
- Okay.

221
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,160
- Ruoxin?
- Yes.

222
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,720
- It's late. What's wrong?
- I have a favor to ask.

223
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
What is it? Just say the word.

224
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,160
It's about…

225
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,440
monitoring the cell phone.

226
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
The IP address.

227
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
SHAMELESS ZENPRO AUTOMOTIVE LEGAL
CONSULTANT THREATENING CAR OWNER

228
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,600
SUSPECT WIFE OF ADULTERY

229
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
"CWW84"?

230
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,000
QI XIAO

231
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
Hello? Qi Xiao?

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,120
Ruoxin.

233
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,640
I have big news to tell.

234
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,520
My brilliant computer major buddy

235
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,880
decoded the IP address
of the user who spread the rumor online.

236
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,640
Really? You've found the guy?

237
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,200
The general location is found.

238
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,720
It's in Baoshan District.

239
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,360
As for the specific location,
we should get it tonight.

240
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,360
Tomorrow, when you get to work,

241
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,920
I can give you the results.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
That's great.

243
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,520
Once you get the address tomorrow,
I'll visit Mr. Liu Pei.

244
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,960
Whatever it takes, we must find
this person who is slandering the company.

245
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,240
You said the company
will call the police, right?

246
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Of course.

247
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
He's spreading malicious rumors

248
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,960
that have affected
our company's reputation.

249
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,400
It's not just civil damages,

250
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
but also a violation of the criminal law.

251
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,640
That's great. I've been waiting to bring
this bad guy to justice.

252
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,120
Okay. Get some rest today.

253
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,440
- I'll see you at work tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

254
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,160
RUOXIN, HOW IS IT? ARE YOU…

255
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,720
<i>How was that, Ruoxin?</i>

256
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
<i>I didn't mess up, right?</i>

257
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,960
<i>Let's see if the human mind
is as evil as I thought.</i>

258
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
<i>I think you're wrong.</i>

259
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
<i>If a man loves a woman,</i>

260
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,280
<i>he wouldn't wish for anything bad
to happen to her.</i>

261
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,440
<i>What do you know about love, little kid?</i>

262
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,320
<i>I'm not a kid.</i>

263
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
<i>I'm a man.</i>

264
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,680
<i>What I'm telling you
are a man's true feelings.</i>

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,080
CUI LIXIN

266
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
<i>He called. You lost the bet.</i>

267
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,760
<i>I was right.</i>

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,040
<i>Actually…</i>

269
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,880
<i>Don't think about him.</i>

270
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,320
Ruoxin.

271
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Ruoxin.

272
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,760
Why are you here so early?

273
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,680
Why didn't you answer my call yesterday?

274
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
We broke up.

275
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,440
You called me so late at night.

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,280
Ruoxin.

277
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,440
There's something
I don't know how to tell you.

278
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,160
I have a cousin, you know.

279
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,920
He has been staying with me for a while.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,359
Then he found out that we broke up.

281
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
That's why he's angry.

282
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,240
He felt bad for me and…

283
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,880
- And then he--
- Cui Lixin.

284
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,920
Don't play
the cat-and-mouse game with me, okay?

285
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,680
You're lying through your teeth.

286
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,240
I'm really disgusted.

287
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,760
I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth.

288
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,200
When did it start?

289
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,440
Two days ago.

290
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,320
My cousin got here two days ago.

291
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,920
CWW84.

292
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
You were born in 1984.

293
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,360
I couldn't figure out what "CWW" meant.

294
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm in the Administration Department now.

295
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I have requested your employee file.

296
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
You had another name, Cui Weiwei, right?

297
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,880
Ruoxin, I can explain this.

298
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,240
It really was my cousin.

299
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,600
He used my computer and ID--

300
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
HOW TO INSTALL A SURVEILLANCE APP
IN HER CELL PHONE

301
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,560
This article

302
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,200
was posted a month ago.

303
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
When did you install
the surveillance software?

304
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,280
When did you take my phone
during this time?

305
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,960
Ruoxin, I…

306
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,200
Let me explain. I really…

307
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,160
I love you so much.

308
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm afraid of losing you.
I'm scared of you leaving me, Ruoxin.

309
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,400
Really, I'm begging you.

310
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,760
- Ruoxin, please give me a chance?
- Don't grab me. Let go, okay?

311
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,600
- Will you give me a chance?
- What are you doing?

312
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,880
I really love you, Ruoxin.

313
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,120
- It's true.
- Let go of me!

314
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
What are you doing? Let go!

315
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,720
Are you okay?

316
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,360
Ruoxin, I can explain.

317
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,280
Listen to me--

318
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,920
You can explain it to the police.

319
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,080
Ruoxin, let's go.

320
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,200
Ruoxin!

321
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,320
What is it?

322
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,560
Is my makeup smudged?

323
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,920
No.

324
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,920
I didn't sleep well last night.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,400
I was worried about you.

326
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
Ruoxin.

327
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

328
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,320
It's just that you happened
to have met a jerk.

329
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,520
That's right.

330
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
I didn't do anything wrong.

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
But what you just said…

332
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,440
Was it scripted?

333
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,160
You can explain it to Mr. Liu now.

334
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't want to.

335
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,280
What?

336
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,560
Why won't you explain it?

337
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,960
I don't want to stoop to his level.

338
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
I don't understand.

339
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
Why did you forgive him?

340
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
Isn't that why you're demoted
to the Administration Department?

341
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
Now that you can clarify it,

342
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,800
you'll return to the Legal Department.

343
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,840
- Why cover up for a jerk?
- I'm not covering for him.

344
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
Liu Pei forced me out.

345
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,000
This is just an excuse.

346
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,000
Even without it, he'd find another reason.

347
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,680
It's not the time to return
to the Legal Department yet.

348
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,720
If things get out of hand,

349
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
Cui Lixin will face criminal charges.

350
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,600
He did something like this,

351
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,320
so he should bear the consequences.

352
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Why does he get off scot-free
while you take all the blame?

353
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,560
We dated for 100 days.

354
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,480
Although during that time,

355
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,200
I was not in love with him.

356
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,880
At least he treated me well
the way he thought was right.

357
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,760
But I didn't acknowledge it,

358
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
and it hurt him.

359
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
A month ago,

360
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,000
when he asked online
about installing surveillance,

361
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
that's when we weren't getting along.

362
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,360
I wanted to break up with him,

363
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,680
and he must have sensed it.

364
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,440
Qi Xiao.

365
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,800
Are you from Shanghai?

366
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,760
Yes.

367
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,400
So you probably don't know what it's like

368
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,920
to want to stay in Shanghai so badly

369
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,600
that you'll go all out to squeeze in.

370
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,680
To feel like you have
a foothold in Shanghai.

371
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,760
I really don't get it.

372
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,920
Even if he wants to stay in Shanghai,
why did he have to frame you?

373
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
Perhaps right from the start,

374
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
it wasn't me that he loved.

375
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,960
Perhaps it's the sense of achievement

376
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,360
that he gets from dating me.

377
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,360
But I turned him down.

378
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,360
I denied all of his worth.

379
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,560
He couldn't stand it.

380
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,120
You sounded like

381
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,400
you were the one reading
the psychology blog all night.

382
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,600
So you're letting him off?

383
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm not going to let it slide.

384
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,400
He thinks we have something on him

385
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,880
and we'll rat him out anytime.

386
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,320
He's worried about getting fired
and going to jail.

387
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,680
Such psychological stress
will torture him.

388
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Maybe

389
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,000
he has gone to Liu Pei to turn himself in.

390
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,280
A woman's heart is indeed more vicious.

391
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
You're the one I have to watch out for.

392
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,320
Remarkable.

393
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,640
Truly remarkable.

394
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Ms. Li.

395
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,240
- Promotion Department again?
- Yes, Ms. Li.

396
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,080
We're counting on you guys every year.

397
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
There's more every year.

398
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,880
Thank you, Ms. Li.

399
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
I'll leave it here.

400
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
Come on.

401
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,000
- Ruoxin.
- Ms. Li.

402
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,920
The product marketing documents
need to be archived.

403
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,840
The others have work to do.
So I'll leave these to you.

404
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,760
Ms. Li, I haven't finished the data
you gave me yesterday.

405
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,280
- It's urgent and needed tomorrow.
- What data?

406
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,560
This one.

407
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
Put that aside first.

408
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,120
The product marketing is more urgent.
Come here.

409
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,600
Okay.

410
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,920
When do you need them done?

411
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,360
Listen to me first.

412
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Mark all the marketing materials
in these magazines and newspapers.

413
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,000
Make two copies each.

414
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,560
There's also brand culture
and product introduction.

415
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,720
Categorize them separately.

416
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,680
Categorize different
production lines as well.

417
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,280
Oh, right. The tests and reviews
must also be sorted.

418
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,520
Thank you.

419
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
By the way,

420
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,880
you just broke up with Cui Lixin, right?

421
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
I don't want to gossip.

423
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,600
I just feel like

424
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,120
I've given you so much work
when you're still upset.

425
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
Do you have a new boyfriend?

426
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
No, I'm single.

427
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
It's Cui Lixin's fault then.

428
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,680
He has another woman?

429
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,960
That's not it. Our opinions differ.

430
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
We broke up amicably.

431
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,960
"Amicably"?

432
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,240
Ms. Li, if that's all,

433
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,360
I'll get back to work.

434
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
Okay.

435
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,160
Take care of yourself.

436
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,880
Get to work. I need them fast.

437
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
A bunch of tongue-waggers.

438
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,560
Talk less and do more work.

439
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,640
I guess I have to work late again.

440
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,840
CUI LIXIN

441
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
Ruoxin.

442
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,200
Cui Lixin sent me a friend request.

443
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,360
Should I accept it?

444
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
No.

445
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,240
"Please relay my message.

446
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,800
I went to see Mr. Liu.

447
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,600
I know you didn't say anything. Thank you.

448
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,960
During lunch break,
please come to our old haunt.

449
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,480
I have one last thing to tell you."

450
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,000
That's the remark he sent.

451
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,000
Take a break.

452
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
I'll go get some sticky notes.

453
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
Have you eaten?

454
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,920
Hey, are you done?

455
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
No, not yet. Not the newspapers.

456
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,640
We handled the magazines first
to make some space.

457
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,880
You two work well together.

458
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,280
Have you been with her for a long time
in the Legal Department?

459
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,320
Not really. I'm still on probation.

460
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
I've been Ms. Shen's assistant
for less than a month.

461
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I thought you've worked
with her for years.

462
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,640
I guess we work well together.

463
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,320
What a nice young man.

464
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,240
That's too bad.

465
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,400
She left the Legal Department.

466
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
You didn't have to leave.

467
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,680
Did someone give you a hard time there?

468
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,920
No.

469
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,640
I just thought
I could learn more from Ms. Shen.

470
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,840
What's there to learn in this department?

471
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,120
There is.

472
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Didn't she get work that others take
a week to do done well and fast?

473
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,280
- Hurry up. I'm waiting.
- Okay.

474
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,120
My mom always used to tell me,

475
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,320
"If you don't study hard,
you can only squat and eat on the street."

476
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,360
I never thought that

477
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,920
after doing well in school,
I still have to squat and eat.

478
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,200
You do look like a beggar.

479
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,480
I heard what you said earlier.

480
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,320
Why would you piss Ms. Li off?

481
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,560
What if that cost you your job?

482
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,400
She outranks me after all.

483
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,080
Even I don't want to mess with her.

484
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
I tried to hold it in.

485
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,840
But I couldn't help it.
Who told her to criticize you?

486
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,880
I think she's just jealous.

487
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,560
Let her say what she wants.

488
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
It won't hurt a bit.

489
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Ruoxin.

490
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,600
Let me ask you something.

491
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,840
How could you not take it to heart

492
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,400
when they bully you in the company?

493
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,920
Do you know

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,400
how to remain undisturbed?

495
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,080
Whether you're favored or disliked,
remain undisturbed.

496
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Don't worry about
what people say about you.

497
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,320
Know your goals.

498
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,480
Stay on the target and achieve it.

499
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,040
That sounds really advanced.

500
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,560
Hey, kid.

501
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
You still have a lot to learn.

502
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,720
All right, don't be so undisturbed.

503
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,960
It's almost lunch break.
You should get going.

504
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,600
Go check on your ex-boyfriend.

505
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,280
He's the person who threw you
off your track to your goal.

506
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,680
What lies will he tell you?

507
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
You're getting better at talking.

508
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,040
Of course. I learn from the best.

509
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,960
By the way, Ruoxin,

510
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,680
your old haunt…

511
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,960
Where is it?

512
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,040
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

513
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,840
<i>please wait in line as shown
on the platform sign.</i>

514
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,360
<i>Passengers alight first.</i>

515
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,520
<i>Enter and head towards
the back of the car.</i>

516
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,240
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

517
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,760
A PURE HEART MAKES THINGS BEAUTIFUL

518
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,080
I thought you would never come.

519
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Have a seat.

520
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,680
Just say what's on your mind.

521
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,960
Do you remember that
this is where we first met

522
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,680
four months ago?

523
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,120
<i>That day, your car was in maintenance
so you took the subway.</i>

524
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,800
<i>That's how I got to talk to you.</i>

525
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,280
Put this on.

526
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,600
You'll feel better.

527
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,360
Thank you.

528
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Let me help you.

529
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,920
Thank you.

530
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
You're welcome.

531
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,760
Actually, we've met before.

532
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,480
I also work for Zenpro Automotive.

533
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,480
We're colleagues.

534
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,520
- Is that so?
- Yes.

535
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,920
Which department are you in?

536
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,720
Sales Department.

537
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,440
I'm Cui Lixin.

538
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,440
- I'm Shen--
- Shen Ruoxin.

539
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,440
I know you.

540
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,800
I've been watching you.

541
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,680
Since you know that
I didn't rat you out to Liu Pei,

542
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,320
you should also understand

543
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,680
that I won't ever tell him.

544
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,240
You don't have to put on
this melodramatic show now.

545
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,200
We dated for 100 days.

546
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,240
Within these 100 days,
you treated me well.

547
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,680
I asked to break up with you.

548
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,880
But now, after what you did,

549
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
we're even.

550
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,760
From now on, we are no longer indebted
to each other.

551
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,080
This is where we first met.

552
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,200
But it wasn't four months ago
that I gave you a bandage.

553
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,480
It was six years ago.

554
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,360
Six years ago,

555
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
on my thirtieth birthday,

556
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,040
I was fired again that day.

557
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,280
I'd been in Shanghai
for over three years at that time.

558
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,520
The university I attended
was not known in Shanghai,

559
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,720
so I was not able to find a decent job.

560
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,440
I worked so hard every day,
but I didn't have much savings.

561
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,720
That day, I was turned down again
at a job interview.

562
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
I was really depressed.

563
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,240
While waiting for the subway,
I was harassed by a woman.

564
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,920
Hey.

565
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,800
- Are you done touching me?
- What are you doing?

566
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,000
Why are you so fierce?

567
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,960
Who touched you?

568
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,480
You were standing close to me
in the elevator.

569
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,880
You're still too close now.

570
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,000
Everyone, be my judge.

571
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,880
An out-of-towner who can
only afford to ride the subway

572
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,760
claims that I touched him.

573
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
Okay, I won't argue with you.
Let's go to the police.

574
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,280
Sure.

575
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
Call the police.

576
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,680
At the police station,

577
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,640
let's see whether they believe you

578
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
or me.

579
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,000
I saw it.

580
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

581
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,280
You closed in and touched him.

582
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
He evaded you, but you went closer again.

583
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,040
Are you out of your mind?

584
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,560
- It's none of your business.
- Of course it is.

585
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,360
You've brought shame on the Shanghainese.

586
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
You're the one fawning over him,

587
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,880
yet you called him names.

588
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,640
The police station? I'll go with you.
I'll testify for you.

589
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,640
You two?

590
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,720
You're in this together.
They are partners!

591
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm not taking the subway!

592
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,000
What's wrong with that woman?

593
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

594
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,040
Do you remember
what you told me after that?

595
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,560
You said Shanghai is an immigrant city.

596
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,480
All rivers run into the sea.

597
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,720
Anyone with dreams,

598
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,320
anyone with goals and competence

599
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,120
can surely find their place in Shanghai.

600
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:00,000
You said that your grandfather
fled to Shanghai.

601
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,160
So you told me not to take
that woman's words to heart.

602
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,400
Then you arrived at your stop.

603
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,160
I followed you and saw you enter
the Zenpro Automotive building.

604
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,400
So, two years ago,
when the company was recruiting new staff,

605
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,360
I job-hopped without hesitating.

606
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,400
I took the subway every day,

607
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,920
hoping to see you in the subway again.

608
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,440
In the past,

609
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,880
you never told me that.

610
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,760
I planned to tell you about this

611
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,080
after proposing to you
and showing you our house.

612
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,600
Relax. I'm not asking
to get back together.

613
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,960
I won't pester you either.

614
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,400
I just want to tell you that
it's over between us now,

615
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
and it's all my fault.

616
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,120
Like you said,

617
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,000
I might have been too eager
in wanting to stay in Shanghai.

618
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,920
I wanted to be with you so badly.

619
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,000
I was too anxious.

620
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,920
I just hope that

621
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,560
you won't despise me too much,

622
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,200
although I despise myself right now.

623
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,920
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

624
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Are you

625
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,760
okay?

626
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,800
Why wouldn't I be?

627
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,360
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

628
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,200
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

629
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,400
The villain had it his way.

630
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,560
After three months,

631
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,440
he finally got a chance to get rid of me.

632
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,200
But my career path is still long.

633
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
We'll meet again.

634
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,160
Ruoxin.

635
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,400
What's wrong, Sijia? Why are you here?

636
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,840
Mr. Ruan…

637
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,920
- Mr. Ruan told me
- Here.

638
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,280
to get his letter of appointment.

639
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,760
Is it that urgent?

640
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,120
Whose side are you on, Sijia?

641
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,120
I have no other choice.

642
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Mr. Ruan's secretary sent me.

643
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,320
Sijia.

644
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,200
For the past few days,

645
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
how were you in the Legal Department?

646
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,400
They refused to give me any work.

647
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,480
I'm afraid when I finish
what you assigned me,

648
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,880
I'll be completely idle.

649
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,320
- When that happens--
- They'll say you can't deliver.

650
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,720
You're not good at your job.

651
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
You contribute nothing to the company.

652
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,720
You won't get a job.

653
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
Ruoxin.

654
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,800
What should I do?

655
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,800
Sijia, look for it.

656
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,800
Last year, there was a contract
with Kelai Enterprise.

657
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,400
There was a loophole somewhere.

658
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,040
If you're competent enough to spot it,

659
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,960
go to Ruan Ye and take credit for it.

660
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,640
Tell him I didn't do well.

661
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,640
- I--
- I'm no longer with the Legal Department.

662
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
They can't make it difficult for me.

663
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,280
This will do you good.

664
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,360
- Ruoxin--
- All right.

665
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,480
Think about it.

666
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Sijia.

667
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,160
Learn to grow up.

668
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,760
Let's get back to work.

669
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,200
Ruoxin.

670
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,400
The idea you gave You Sijia today…

671
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,680
Did you really mean it?

672
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,680
Yes.

673
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,440
That contract was a bit rushed.

674
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,680
There was a loophole.

675
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,320
The client didn't notice.

676
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
If I tried to correct it,
it will just alert them.

677
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,920
I've done the math.

678
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,120
It's about time to renew the contract.

679
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,040
Let Sijia remind Ruan Ye about it
to prevent any trouble.

680
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,680
Seriously?

681
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,120
I don't know what to say.

682
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,840
Anyway, if I were Sijia,

683
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,480
I wouldn't snitch on you.

684
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,920
How are you the same as her?

685
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,760
You get to live off your parents
so you're this carefree

686
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,160
to be inattentive at work.

687
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,280
No…

688
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,960
Who said I'm living off my parents?

689
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,920
After my dad passed away,
I've been taking care of my mom, okay?

690
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,120
Your dad passed away?

691
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,120
Yes.

692
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
Years ago.

693
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,520
I have to visit my mom today after work.

694
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,400
She's old now.

695
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,680
We use mobile apps for everything.

696
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,440
She gets baffled by those sometimes.

697
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,480
Now, every week,

698
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,560
I have to visit her once or twice.

699
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,960
You're a good son.

700
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
That's true.

701
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,240
My mom had a hard time
raising me by herself.

702
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,480
I'm her only son.

703
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,640
If I don't care about her, who will?

704
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,680
I'm not driving you home today.

705
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
That's fine.

706
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,320
A while ago,
I lent my motorcycle to Su Yang.

707
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,280
It's easier for him to go to interviews.

708
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,080
Now that his interviews are over,
I got my motorcycle back.

709
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,360
I'll take you out for a ride tomorrow.

710
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,280
It's okay.

711
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,240
At my age,

712
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,480
I don't take any risky transportations.

713
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
Motorcycles aren't risky.

714
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,680
I'll keep you safe.

715
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,720
It's okay.

716
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,040
A woman in her thirties

717
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,680
won't entrust herself
to someone's promise.

718
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,960
That's the rule.

719
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,760
You made cowardice sound so cool.

720
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm impressed.

721
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,040
Get back to work.

722
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm impressed.

723
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,680
Mom, I'm at the supermarket
buying you something.

724
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,880
I'll pick you up
at the community school later.

725
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,120
Let me know if you need anything, okay?

726
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll buy it for you.

727
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,080
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

728
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,040
Last time,

729
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,720
when you visited me at my office,
I behaved badly.

730
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,280
I've been busy at work recently

731
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,040
and there's a lot to handle.

732
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,720
I'll catch up with you later, okay?

733
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,320
Ms. Wu.

734
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,120
Ruoxin.

735
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,840
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

736
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
Your mom is in the cafeteria.

737
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm telling you.

738
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
Your mom can't be prouder today.

739
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Is that so?

740
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,440
Her calligraphy class for next term
is signed up in ten minutes.

741
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,040
She's thrilled.

742
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,960
Really?

743
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,560
But she said it's nothing.

744
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,760
She's most pleased
about you getting married soon.

745
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,080
Is that true?

746
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,320
Don't forget to send me wedding candies.

747
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,800
Okay, I'll let you know.

748
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,760
I'll be waiting.

749
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Go on.

750
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,480
- Bye.
- Bye. See you.

751
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
Mom.

752
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,360
Your meal is too simple.

753
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,320
It's all watery and bland.

754
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,880
When you came to my office that day,

755
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,120
- you asked me…
- Let's talk in the car.

756
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,320
Mom.

757
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,280
You didn't even say a word
on the way here.

758
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,520
Are you still mad at me?

759
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,360
I can't figure it out.

760
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,480
If you're 23 years old right now…

761
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,760
If you've just graduated from college,

762
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,280
you can choose one today

763
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,680
and pick another tomorrow.

764
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,680
That goes without saying.

765
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,760
But you're 33 years old.

766
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,880
Who are you to act so willfully?

767
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,320
Mom.

768
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,000
Cui Lixin and I are incompatible.

769
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,640
"Incompatible"?

770
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,320
Are you doing this out of pride?

771
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,160
Isn't it simply because

772
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,200
Lixin isn't from Shanghai?

773
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,440
He doesn't make

774
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,960
as much money as you do.

775
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,120
Other than yourself,

776
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,920
who else do you admire?

777
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,000
What is it that you want?

778
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,040
Mom.

779
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,000
