1
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
Mr. Xu,

2
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,320
this matter is mostly my fault.

3
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
I should've reviewed the contract myself.

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,840
Then Ruan Ye wouldn't be able
to lead me by the nose now.

5
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
New energy vehicles are

6
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,240
a potential threat to them.

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
I guess they're panicking.

8
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,720
Now you see where the problem is.

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,960
Next, you'll have to think

10
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
about how to fix it.

11
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,840
<i>Since the New Energy Department's budget</i>

12
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>can't make up for the losses from this ad,</i>

13
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
then you should think about

14
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,560
how you can pull off a better promotion

15
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,800
with a limited budget.

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
Okay, I understand.

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,880
Here.

18
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
Thank you.

19
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,720
I took a closer look
at each store's sales figures.

20
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,920
The stores with low sales

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
put out quite a lot of advertisements.

22
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,360
One of them
is even in an area with many ads.

23
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,520
Maybe we should consider other reasons.

24
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,360
Could there be a problem
with the sales process?

25
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,720
I have an idea of how to test that.

26
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
When you're in this suit,
you're Mr. Su Sicong.

27
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Why would I buy a car then?

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll just get a private jet.

29
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Do you need a personal assistant too?

30
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,640
Okay, enough joking.

31
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,440
Let's get down to business.

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
<i>What model would you like to see?</i>

34
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,440
<i>What do you recommend?</i>

35
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,800
That would depend on what your needs are.

36
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Do you need a car for home, business,

37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,240
or some other use?

38
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,200
That test-drive event a while ago

39
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
for your new energy car

40
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,520
was pretty nice.

41
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
How about the new energy car?

42
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
The new energy car?

43
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,600
It's currently our company's main focus.

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,000
<i>But if it's for personal use,</i>

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,960
I suggest going with a traditional model.

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,120
Why is that?

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,720
Aren't new energy cars
good for the environment?

48
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
That's true.

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
But it's a new product.

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
Its performance
still has room for improvement.

51
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,320
Although the battery life is good,

52
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,600
charging it still won't be
as convenient as refilling gas.

53
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,640
Don't you agree?

54
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
That makes sense.

55
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,480
But these days,

56
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,760
the new energy vehicles policy
offers an incentive.

57
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,040
The license plates are also not
subjected to limitations.

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,240
For personal use, convenience is key.

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,840
If you choose it solely for the incentive,

60
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
there will be no refunds

61
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
if you find it inconvenient later.

62
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,880
<i>As for the license plate…</i>

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
If you order our traditional car model,

64
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,040
I'll figure something out

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,640
and get you an out-of-state license plate.

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,560
Just slap it on.

67
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,640
<i>Really?</i>

68
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,480
<i>- Is that possible?
- Yes.</i>

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,640
<i>How much will it cost?</i>

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
<i>If you're really interested in buying,</i>

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
<i>the rest</i>

72
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
can be discussed later.

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

74
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,520
Thank you.

75
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
Of course.

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,440
SU YANG

77
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,080
This must be the main reason
why sales are so low.

78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,120
Check this store's sales commission rate.

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
Okay.

80
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
But Ruoxin,

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,760
shouldn't we report this to Mr. Xu?

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,920
Don't let the blame land on us again.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
It's okay.

84
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,080
I have to handle this.

85
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,720
Why else would Mr. Xu keep me here?

86
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,040
<i>If you order our traditional car model,</i>

87
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,640
<i>I'll figure something out</i>

88
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
<i>and get you an out-of-state license plate.</i>

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,240
<i>Just slap it on.</i>

90
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
<i>Really?</i>

91
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,040
<i>- Is that possible?
- Yes.</i>

92
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
<i>How much will it cost?</i>

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,080
<i>If you're really interested in buying,</i>

94
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
<i>the rest</i>

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,360
<i>can be discussed later.</i>

96
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
<i>I guarantee you'll be satisfied.</i>

97
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
Mr. Liu.

98
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,440
Our salespeople are
professionally trained,

99
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,080
not to mention he's a manager.

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,240
You must speak the truth
when selling cars.

101
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,160
The client has the right to know.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
I understand how you feel.

103
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,320
Even if the salesman didn't say it,

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,080
I believe most customers
would figure it out themselves.

105
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,880
If we only sing praises,

106
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,360
then the consumer
will question our product.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,920
They'll think we ignore
those facts just to gain sales.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,240
Why not put the issues out in the open?

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Let the customer choose.

110
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Won't our company seem more honest?

111
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,400
What do you think?

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Stealing a foreign license plate
is illegal.

113
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,320
How can a dealer do this in secret

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,880
just for internal gain?

115
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
That's undermining
the company's product and image.

116
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,760
The salesperson said so himself.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,800
He's acting on his own.

118
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,080
Now that we've discovered
his illegal activities,

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,800
we'll punish him accordingly.

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,960
But Ms. Shen,

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,680
new energy cars' poor sales

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,560
certainly aren't
attributed to this reason alone.

123
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,800
You're right, Mr. Liu.

124
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,960
We should be developing our market.

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,520
We'll keep at it.
Thank you for the reminder.

126
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
<i>Are you busy with work?</i>

127
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
<i>The webtoon has been updated.</i>

128
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,000
<i>Have you read it?</i>

129
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,160
I have some bad news.

130
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,480
This month's sales aren't as expected.

131
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,600
And now,

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
competition is fierce
in the new energy market.

133
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,080
We need to be innovative with technology

134
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,400
as well as marketing

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
to match our brand philosophy
of innovation and progress.

136
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,960
In the previous phase,

137
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,880
our new car had just come out,

138
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,720
and its reputation
in the industry was the best.

139
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,000
But what was the consensus?

140
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,200
It's too exclusive.

141
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
So we need to choose

142
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
a more effective form
of in-person marketing

143
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
to break this sense of exclusivity

144
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,960
and increase our brand awareness
and popularity.

145
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
Let's brainstorm.

146
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,840
What kind of in-person marketing

147
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
can be effective?

148
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,080
From a reduced-cost perspective,

149
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,840
promoting at colleges is an option.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,160
From a questionnaire,

151
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,560
I realized that college professors

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,760
are relatively interested
in buying new energy vehicles.

153
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,760
Word of mouth also spreads quickly

154
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
among college students.

155
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
They have a lot of influence
over car purchases at home.

156
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,800
That's a good idea.

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,400
However,

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,760
a college event requires qualifications.

159
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,360
We can work with school clubs.

160
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,920
For example, sponsoring their events.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,560
They can come and connect with us.

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
In the automotive industry,

163
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,080
aside from showrooms,

164
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,880
we would also
do in-person marketing at large malls.

165
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,880
This allows the public

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,040
to gain awareness and acceptance.

167
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,000
The mall.

168
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
That's not a bad idea.

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
We can break through

170
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,360
to our middle-class
and upper-class consumer groups.

171
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
We'll go to the mall first.

172
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,360
Then, school campuses.

173
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
<i>I'm outside your office.</i>

174
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
<i>Can we meet?</i>

175
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,840
Little kid, can you move over?

176
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

177
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Over there.

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,600
I want this one.

179
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
Then how about this?

180
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
Zou Cheng.

181
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
There you are.

182
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,240
You're the deputy manager,

183
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,160
but you can't escape working on the floor.

184
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,960
It's for this family event.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,760
It's all-hands-on-deck here,

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,560
yet the kids still aren't happy.

187
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,800
It's okay. Leave the kids to me.

188
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
- Thank you.
- Sure, Zou Cheng.

189
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,200
Let's go.

190
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
Little girl, why don't I make you a puppy?

191
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,600
Come with me.

192
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
Here.

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,280
I'll show you.

194
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,520
Look, this is the head.

195
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,520
Now we'll make two puppy legs.

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,880
Your milk tea is ready.

197
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,840
Thank you.

198
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,800
No problem.

199
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,200
I can connect you to the Marketing Team.

200
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,800
As for the fee,

201
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
I must consider the mall's bottom line.

202
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Of course, I understand.

203
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
But if we promote our event at the mall,

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,960
it'll also bring customers to the mall.

205
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,280
It's a potential value-added event.

206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,120
So I hope you can help me
request a venue discount.

207
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,960
Do you have a complete

208
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,000
or novel promotional activity?

209
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,640
Ziyan joined a band recently.

210
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,840
Did you know that?

211
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,720
- A band?
- Yes.

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
You will laugh at this.

213
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,040
She won't tell me anything now.

214
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,160
At home, we stay in different rooms.

215
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,440
She even paid
half of the mortgage last month.

216
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
She said I was right.

217
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,440
Now she's trying her best

218
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
to see if she can live on her own.

219
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,160
She's pursuing

220
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,480
the freedom she always wanted.

221
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Zou Cheng, I've always known

222
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
you and Ziyan love each other very much.

223
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,400
It's just that marriage and life

224
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
have worn down your passion.

225
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
I think the two of you should sit down

226
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
and have a nice chat.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm busy with work.

228
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,520
She's busy now too.

229
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,560
There's no chance.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
Right.

231
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,160
What was it you said?

232
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,600
What band is she in?

233
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,360
It's at the bar she works at.

234
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,760
There's a new up-and-coming band,

235
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,040
but the drummer has to leave,

236
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
so Ziyan filled in the spot.

237
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,640
They've been practicing.

238
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,560
Zou Cheng,

239
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,960
I think

240
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,120
you should be more understanding.

241
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,880
What Ziyan needs to find

242
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,680
is a new direction in life and passion.

243
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,600
You should be more understanding.

244
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
To be honest, Ziyan just wants to show you

245
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,200
a different side of her.

246
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
To be precise, who she used to be.

247
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,840
So for our promotional event,

248
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,320
I want to invite Ziyan and her band.

249
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,720
Thank you, Ruoxin.

250
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,240
I know Ziyan and I need some time.

251
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,800
Life goes on.

252
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,120
Have you discussed this with her?

253
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,040
I have to talk to you first.

254
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
I need this deal before I talk to her.

255
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,160
Don't worry.

256
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
As for the event discount,

257
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
I'll get it for you.

258
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
Thank you.

259
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
Thank you, Ruoxin.

260
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,640
I should be the one thanking you
for getting us a discount.

261
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
You should get going. You must be busy.

262
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
Okay.

263
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,920
- Bye, Zou Cheng.
- Bye.

264
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,920
- Here.
- What are you doing?

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,280
Don't treat me like a kid.

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,800
No, I think it looks nice.

267
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,320
- Does it?
- It's pretty.

268
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,720
You scared me, Qi Xiao!

269
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,760
Are you still a kid?

270
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,800
Here come two very busy people.

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,120
You've been dropping by quite frequently.

272
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,320
Judging by your tone,

273
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,360
you don't sound very welcoming.

274
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,760
She must want us to come by more often.

275
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
Hey, kid.

276
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,000
Of all her qualities to imitate,
why choose her witticism?

277
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't lecture my people.

278
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,960
Where's Ting?

279
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
Ruoxin, did you miss me?

280
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,480
I missed you, buddy.

281
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,760
Okay, that's enough.

282
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,640
We're here to invite your band

283
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,920
to do a small performance

284
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,160
at our promotional event.

285
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,520
Help us bring in a crowd

286
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
and spread the word about new energy cars.

287
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,000
Where?

288
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,040
Your husband's mall.

289
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm not going.

290
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,480
Can I interpret your overreaction

291
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,760
as stage fright?

292
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,560
Who's the one that said, "Live life"?

293
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
Just be yourself.

294
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
- I--
- Exactly.

295
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,920
Also, if Ruoxin is inviting us,

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,640
she must've discussed it
with your husband.

297
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,520
Since your husband agreed to have us,

298
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
I'm sure he wants the opportunity

299
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,720
to watch you perform.

300
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,520
Ziyan, show some rock spirit.

301
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Ziyan,

302
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,320
we're just waiting for your answer.

303
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
Fine, I'll go.

304
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,160
Bring it on.

305
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,960
<i>I'm coming.</i>

306
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,680
- Mom?
- Qi Xiao!

307
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,360
Why are you here?

308
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,920
I came to see you.

309
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,880
That took you a while.

310
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,280
Not bad.

311
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,160
It's quite tidy here.

312
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,520
Of course.

313
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
I bought this for you.

314
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,440
Vegetables and fruits.

315
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Please accept it.

316
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,120
Is there something you need help with?

317
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,640
You're smart.

318
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,680
I bought two outfits online the other day.

319
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,480
One makes me look gorgeous.

320
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,000
But the other one

321
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,280
turned out quite horrible.

322
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,320
So you want to know

323
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,160
how to return just one item, right?

324
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
That's right, my dear.

325
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,080
Is that it?

326
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
You should've just called

327
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,040
instead of coming here.

328
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,560
Come on, my dear.

329
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Of course, I know how to make returns.

330
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,080
Did I come here just for that?

331
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,880
I missed you. I came to see you.

332
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,520
While I'm here,
I want to eat my son's cooking.

333
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
I see.

334
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
Beautiful lady,

335
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,480
please wait for a moment.

336
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,200
I am at your service today.

337
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,079
It's delicious.

338
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,160
Eat more then.

339
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,319
Qi Xiao, are you dating anyone?

340
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,480
If you fall in love,

341
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,760
you have to tell me first thing.

342
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,440
Okay.

343
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,160
Mom, if I make any progress,

344
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,600
you'll be the first to know.

345
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,000
Progress?

346
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,960
So you do have someone you like.

347
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,800
Why is there no progress?

348
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
You're so handsome.

349
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,280
How could any girl not fall for you?

350
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
What's wrong?

351
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,360
The thing is

352
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,920
my rival is too strong.

353
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
My dear.

354
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you know how many people
pursued me back then?

355
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,920
How did your dad overcome all obstacles

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,360
to win me over?

357
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,320
Have faith.

358
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,960
Don't back down.

359
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,280
Understand?

360
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,280
Yes.

361
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,320
Don't worry, Mom.

362
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,840
I won't look down on myself.

363
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

364
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,440
Our tours

365
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,960
are customized for senior citizens.

366
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,320
It's cheap.

367
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
The routes are simple.

368
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,960
You can have a leisurely time

369
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,960
while enjoying the views.

370
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Ma'am.

371
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,680
Come and look at our ancient town tour.

372
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,040
It's cheaper to sign up now.

373
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,640
- It's a great deal.
- Is that so?

374
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,960
Here, have a gift.

375
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,080
- Which one do you want?
- This one.

376
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,720
Please have a seat here.

377
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,880
Take a look.

378
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,960
Here, take a look at this.

379
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,320
Ma'am!

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,720
Would you like a small gift?

381
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,320
It's okay. We don't have kids.

382
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,720
- Thank you.
- It's okay, ma'am.

383
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,680
Come and look at our tour packages.

384
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,160
I'll help you with that, ma'am.
Come and take a look.

385
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,720
You should travel while

386
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,040
- you're still young.
- It's okay.

387
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
It's okay, ma'am.

388
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,960
Our low prices also cover
meals, lodging, and admission.

389
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,360
You can just ask her.

390
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,360
Have a seat.

391
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,600
Take a look.

392
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,480
I just looked it over.

393
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,480
I think this route
has quite a reasonable arrangement.

394
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,400
Take a look.

395
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,840
The kids are busy with work,

396
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
but we can still travel on our own.

397
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Ma'am, let me tell you a secret.

398
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,680
There's a temple for marriage

399
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,520
on this tour that is very effective.

400
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,720
There's a tree of marriage
that really works.

401
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,520
- Is it that powerful?
- Yes.

402
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,840
I'll have to sign up then.

403
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,280
My son has a crush.

404
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,600
I'll pray for him.

405
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Du Liting.

406
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,760
Ruoxin, we bought so much coffee.

407
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,760
Can it be reimbursed?

408
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,240
We have to buy it either way.

409
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
Sales are down.

410
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,920
It all has to do with the dealerships.

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,040
Our job this week

412
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,080
is to visit all 20-plus dealerships

413
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,240
to gauge the situation

414
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,040
and connect with the managers.

415
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,280
I hope last time's incident
will never happen again.

416
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,440
It's the company's strategy
to promote new energy cars.

417
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
They're supposed to do it.

418
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,760
They're failing at that.
Why should we buy coffee for them?

419
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
I don't think it's right.

420
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,640
You really are a fan of the law.

421
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,280
Keep this in mind.

422
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,040
The rules are firm,

423
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,040
but they're implemented by people.

424
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,480
And people are flexible.

425
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,600
Even when you go to court,
you must find a way

426
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,480
to make the judge like you.

427
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,880
Okay.

428
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,000
Welcome.

429
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,680
Which vehicle are you interested in?

430
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,920
We're employees.

431
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm here to see Mr. Huang.

432
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,080
Okay.

433
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,960
We bought coffee for everyone.

434
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,200
- Thank you.
- Good work.

435
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
One moment, please.

436
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,640
What's wrong?

437
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,320
Why doesn't this store
have our new energy car?

438
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,600
You're right. Not even one.

439
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,080
Ms. Shen, welcome.

440
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,400
- Hello, Mr. Huang.
- Welcome.

441
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Why doesn't your store display
our new energy car?

442
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,280
Well, we received a new notice
from the company yesterday,

443
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
so I made adjustments today.

444
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
Adjustments?

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Why wasn't I informed?

446
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Ms. Shen,

447
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,000
Mr. Liu is playing a game of chess.

448
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,760
Revitalizing storefronts
and reorganizing resources.

449
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,800
So store displays

450
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,040
have to match
the sales volumes of the vehicle.

451
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,960
Our store consistently has the top sales.

452
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,440
So our showroom

453
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,840
is reserved for top-selling cars.

454
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,240
You're aware of the sales
of new energy cars last month.

455
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,240
I can't help it.

456
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,640
We had to relocate it
to other dealerships.

457
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,840
Which stores
have they been transferred to?

458
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,320
I have it right here.

459
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Have a look.

460
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,360
This is outrageous.

461
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,480
You purposely transferred them
to the remotest stores.

462
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
Didn't I just tell you?

463
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,160
It's all for revitalizing the storefront
and reorganizing resources.

464
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,800
The new energy cars aren't selling well.

465
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
Mr. Huang, if sales are poor,

466
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
moving it to such a remote store

467
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,440
will just make sales drop even further.

468
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,840
Lower sales mean
moving it even farther away.

469
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
It's a vicious cycle.

470
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,920
This contradicts the headquarters'
new energy vehicle strategy.

471
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,360
There's no point in telling us.

472
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
We're just following orders.

473
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,600
We don't make the rules.

474
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
So please don't make it hard for me.

475
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,360
You have great foresight.

476
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
Wisdom comes with age.

477
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,480
Ms. Shen?

478
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,480
Mr. Ruan,

479
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,200
it seems like you know Mr. Liu well.

480
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,760
I guess waiting here for so long

481
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,280
isn't as effective as
catching him in the elevator.

482
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
Ms. Shen, I heard

483
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,600
you were out on business.

484
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,840
Why are you back so soon?

485
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,840
Ms. Shen, what's the matter?

486
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,040
Mr. Liu, since you're busy,
I won't disturb you.

487
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I'll let you two talk.

488
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,600
Mr. Liu.

489
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,400
I came to talk to you

490
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,920
about storefronts and displays.

491
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,360
You can't move all the new energy cars

492
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,280
to remote stores that bring in low sales.

493
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,800
Recently, the company
has been integrating resources.

494
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Displays at stores

495
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,000
are decided based on sales.

496
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,560
Old rules, old traditions.

497
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,040
What's wrong?
Did it affect your new energy cars?

498
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Yes, Mr. Liu.

499
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,440
Strategic promotion of new energy cars

500
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,560
is the company's top priority this year.

501
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm sure you understand

502
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,360
and support it.

503
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,800
The current arrangement of displays

504
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,000
is disadvantageous for the promotion.

505
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,840
That's why I want to ask you

506
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,280
to return the new energy cars
to their previous showrooms.

507
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,560
Ms. Shen,

508
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,880
you were a legal consultant.

509
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,160
Am I right, Ms. Shen?

510
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,360
You should understand.

511
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,280
Rules are rules.

512
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,520
They don't single out your department.

513
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,160
I want to make an exception,

514
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,400
but once I do,

515
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,760
everyone will come asking for one.

516
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,800
Then who will respect the company policy?

517
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Ms. Shen,
you should consider the bigger picture.

518
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Mr. Liu.

519
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,040
Our new energy car just launched.

520
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,880
The core promotion period isn't over.

521
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,320
If I remember correctly,

522
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,560
all of the new model releases in the past

523
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,240
got a two-month core promotion period.

524
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,280
Why is it only our new energy car
that is treated differently?

525
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
The New Energy Department is new

526
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
and the company's top priority.

527
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,240
Of course, we support it.

528
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
This is the team

529
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,000
that Mr. Xu personally came here
from the headquarters to put together.

530
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,280
It's in your hands now.

531
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,000
You must treasure it.

532
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Don't let him down.

533
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,160
So if you have the time
to come look for me,

534
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,360
you should find a way

535
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,040
to boost your sales.

536
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,000
Besides, we're doing
the best we can to align

537
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
with the company's growth and planning.

538
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
Think about it.

539
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
How many green lights

540
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,080
has the company given your department?

541
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,000
But you can't always be an exception.

542
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,360
Otherwise, morale
in other departments will drop.

543
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,320
Besides, many colleagues have already

544
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,160
privately expressed their displeasure.

545
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,800
Mr. Liu.

546
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,800
I can imagine my colleagues' displeasure.

547
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,760
After all, we hold different positions.

548
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
The reason why I keep coming to you

549
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,840
is that I'm searching for a more compliant

550
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,440
and effective way of working.

551
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,200
But I'm very grateful to you

552
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,880
for advising me time and again.

553
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,880
I'll be more careful from now on.

554
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,720
Ms. Shen,

555
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,640
I really like
straightforward people like you.

556
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,760
To be in my position

557
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,320
is to be at everyone's service.

558
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,960
Remember the problematic salesman?

559
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,720
The company has strictly punished him

560
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,680
with a three-month salary deduction.

561
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,640
But if you are still dissatisfied
with how I handled this,

562
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,480
I really don't know what to do.

563
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,160
The same old line.

564
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
We're doing business.

565
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,440
Our competence speaks for us.

566
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,680
That's right.

567
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,640
If there's nothing else,
I'll leave you to it.

568
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,880
I'll get going, Mr. Liu.

569
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Shen Ruoxin.

570
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,640
I always thought you were rational.

571
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,760
You're a grown woman.

572
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,920
After your transfer,

573
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,160
why have you become so moody?

574
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,720
As your superior,
let me give you a piece of advice.

575
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,400
Don't bring
a woman's emotional impulses to work.

576
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,840
Mr. Xu's preferential treatment

577
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,080
flooded the whole company with gossip.

578
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,760
But when it comes to me,

579
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,520
whatever games you play,

580
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,880
no amount of tears will work on me.

581
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,920
What do you mean
by "a woman's emotional impulses"?

582
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,440
"Preferential treatment
flooded the whole company with gossip"?

583
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
That cunning old fox is just a bully.

584
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,640
I've been patient enough!

585
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
Do you think my patience is a weakness?

586
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
I admit that I'm old.

587
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,320
But at least I don't make power plays!

588
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
But for him?

589
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,400
He's two-faced!

590
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,360
Are you here for business
or power struggles?

591
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,960
Infuriating.

592
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,680
Why isn't the elevator moving?

593
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,640
Is it old too?

594
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,160
I see.

595
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Let me take a sip.

596
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
Open it for me.

597
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,760
I'm so mad.

598
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
Am I irrational?

599
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,600
You're very rational. Ms. Rational.

600
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
I can't believe it.

601
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,880
Quite rational.

602
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,440
I know you've all been hit hard
because of the sales figures.

603
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,360
But now is not the time to be discouraged.

604
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,600
Next, we're going to carry out
many in-person marketing events

605
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,040
so the press and consumers

606
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,000
can have more exposure to our cars.

607
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,160
It'll be hard at first.

608
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,440
Due to previous mistakes,

609
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,440
we're on a very tight budget.

610
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,080
But luckily,

611
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,800
we still have a lot of friends

612
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
willing to help us.

613
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,120
<i>We're a young team</i>

614
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,560
<i>and we're a small team.</i>

615
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,520
<i>But I know.</i>

616
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,440
<i>Every one of us is capable.</i>

617
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,480
Sir, four more signs.

618
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Can you make the date and theme removable

619
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,920
so we can reuse them for the next event?

620
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,080
For this event,

621
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,560
I need you
to personally arrange each step.

622
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
When buying materials,

623
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,360
save as much as you can.

624
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,760
Sir, do you remember me?

625
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,280
I'm a regular here.
I came by three times this month.

626
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
Yes.

627
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,200
You bought
two illuminated signs last time.

628
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,640
You made me give you three lightbulbs!

629
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,200
When I got home and calculated it,

630
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,880
it was a 0.2 yuan loss!

631
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,640
- How much is this?
<i>- We can't help it.</i>

632
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Rumors will keep spreading.

633
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,440
But we can do our job
to the best of our abilities.

634
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,360
And not let ourselves down.

635
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,880
Ziyan.

636
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,720
Can I be of any help?

637
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,000
Since you've been busy,

638
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
I did a little cleaning at home.

639
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,320
I used to think
you had a lot of free time,

640
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,920
but housework is time-consuming.

641
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,640
I admit that I was a bit chauvinistic.

642
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,040
I thought I was supporting the family.

643
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,200
But now, I must admit.

644
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,600
Half the credit goes to you.

645
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,960
That's so lame.

646
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,320
After the event,

647
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
move back into our bedroom.

648
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,200
If you're still mad at me,
I'll take the guest room.

649
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,520
Everyone, let's eat.

650
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,120
Let's eat.

651
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
Zou Cheng and Ziyan, let's eat.

652
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,720
You don't eat chili peppers?

653
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,400
I do.

654
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,560
So you must be doing that
for your Ms. Shen.

655
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,160
Then you must not know.

656
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,440
Ruoxin loves spicy food.

657
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,080
I know.

658
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,080
But work has been busy lately.

659
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,720
She's angry every day.

660
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,040
It's best to be careful.

661
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,800
Let's eat first.

662
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
What's good today?

663
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Ruoxin,

664
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,880
you made the event sound so simple.

665
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,320
But there's so much
to prepare behind the scenes.

666
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,000
Sweetie, it's too late to regret it.

667
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
No exceptions once the contract is signed.

668
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,280
That's just like you.

669
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,320
We're working together
towards a common goal.

670
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,520
Don't you forget

671
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,440
my kindness.

672
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,160
Then please refund my deposit.

673
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,400
Qi Xiao.

674
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,040
You're Shen Ruoxin's assistant.

675
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,960
I'm so sorry.

676
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,480
Not at all.

677
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,880
Life sucks.

678
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
Being Ruoxin's assistant

679
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
is a gift from God.

680
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,080
I must've been lucky in my past life.

681
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm unbelievably happy every single day.

682
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
Props to you.

683
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,560
I can't eat spicy food either.

684
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,360
Work has been so busy.

685
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,760
I shouldn't eat spicy food.

686
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm sorry.

687
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,880
I left a note to leave out the chilies.

688
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,080
Maybe they missed it.

689
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,560
Let's make do with it.

690
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,480
It's okay.

691
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,040
Eat your food!

692
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,000
Ting!

693
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,480
Stop fooling around.
You shouldn't eat spicy food either.

694
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,440
Don't go on stage
and suddenly you can't sing.

695
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,760
You'll ruin our reputation.

696
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
Ruoxin.

697
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Have you been busy? You've lost weight.

698
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,560
Is that so?

699
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,120
She might've lost weight,
but she has plenty of energy.

700
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,720
Not just energy,

701
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,920
but strength too.

702
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,720
I can punch you anytime.

703
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,480
With that hand
that couldn't even open a bottle?

704
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,800
Maybe I've been too busy.

705
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,080
You have the delusion
that you can wreak havoc.

706
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,240
It may not wreak havoc,

707
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,520
but temper tantrums, yes.

708
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,280
- In the elevator--
- Have an egg.

709
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,520
What are you doing?

710
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,040
DRAGON FACE DESIGN LANGUAGE

711
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,440
DIPILOT SELF-DRIVING SYSTEM

712
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,159
Your assistant is quite capable.

713
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,719
He's handsome and reliable.

714
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,040
He's also hardworking.

715
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,639
I just don't know
why he's always a sweet talker.

716
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,840
Why is Gen Zers like that?

717
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,760
He's only a sweet talker to you.

718
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,239
Is he interested in you?

719
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,840
What are you saying?

720
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,440
Working hard doesn't mean
he's interested in me.

721
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,480
Maybe he's just ambitious in his career.

722
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't assume all young people

723
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,600
are indifferent and have no ambition.

724
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,920
Those young kids are not bad.
They're bright and creative.

725
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,639
If they approve of something,

726
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,719
they'll handle everything
even without you telling them to do so.

727
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,159
Why are you laughing?

728
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,080
What about you and Zou Cheng?

729
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,800
Did my little push take you two

730
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,800
out of the silent treatment
to a happy reunion?

731
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,160
Thank you.

732
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,880
Not only did you worry about my marriage,
you even got me to do charity work.

733
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,840
It's a waste of time.

734
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,360
Enough. I'm going to rehearse.

735
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,360
What do you want?

736
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,640
How about 100 million yuan
to complete your goal?

737
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,520
Give it to me.

738
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,520
No.

739
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,760
Ziyan.

740
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,320
Let's go home together.

741
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,920
My ride is here.

742
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,400
Honey,

743
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,320
your dedicated driver is already here.

744
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,160
Come on.

745
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's go.

746
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Ziyan.

747
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,120
I've thought it through.

748
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,720
I can't leave you.

749
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,960
I'm tired today.

750
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,640
Let's talk another day.

751
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,560
Will you let me finish?

752
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,040
Go on.

753
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,200
I've been thinking.

754
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,920
When did our relationship
start to go wrong?

755
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,240
What is the problem?

756
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,160
Did you find the answer?

757
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,480
You said that

758
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,080
we have nothing in common at the moment.

759
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
That we want different things.

760
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,000
That the woman who is Zou Cheng's wife

761
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,280
doesn't have to be you.

762
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
I think that's wrong.

763
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,560
For two people
to spend a lifetime together,

764
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,120
they don't always have
to be at the same pace.

765
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,200
Isn't marriage about waiting

766
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,200
for each other?

767
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,640
I know.

768
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,600
We have a lot of problems.

769
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,280
It's probably because of my job.

770
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,040
Maybe it's because
of whether we want kids.

771
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,880
Or whether you get a job.

772
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,320
But I think it comes down

773
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,320
to whether I'll stop and wait for you

774
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,080
or whether you'll stop and wait for me.

775
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,760
My answer is I will.

776
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,160
Will you?

777
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,880
Ziyan.

778
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,440
You gave the drums another try.

779
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,400
Why can't you give us another chance?

780
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,760
Let's be honest with each other.

781
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,080
If there's a problem,
we can solve it together.

782
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,040
I know.

783
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,760
I've let you down many times.

784
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,600
I don't blame you entirely.

785
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm reflecting on myself.

786
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,880
During that time,

787
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
I was growing to dislike myself as well.

788
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,520
It was getting harder to find myself.

789
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,920
Sometimes, I wonder

790
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,080
whether it was the unlikable Song Ziyan

791
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,280
who brought out the unlikable Zou Cheng.

792
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,560
Let's work hard together.

793
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
Let's kick out

794
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,200
that unlikable Song Ziyan and Zou Cheng.

795
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,560
Okay?

796
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,440
You startled me.

797
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Why didn't you sleep inside?

798
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,040
Why are you back so late?

799
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,240
Sleep inside. It's uncomfortable here.

800
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,360
How could I sleep when you weren't back?

801
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Go to sleep.

802
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,320
You have a trip in the morning.

803
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
You're so busy.

804
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
I don't want to go.

805
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,080
Don't say that out of anger.

806
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,240
What will you do here?

807
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,760
You'll just cook a few meals.

808
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,840
I won't starve without you, right?

809
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,040
Go out and enjoy the view.

810
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,680
It's good to make more friends.

811
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,720
I'll prepare the things you need tomorrow.

812
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,320
It's cool in the morning
and hot in the evening.

813
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,640
The temperature fluctuates.

814
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Take this hat

815
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,800
and these sunglasses.

816
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
Take them with you.

817
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,120
Bring two more shirts.

818
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,240
It gets cold at night.

819
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,960
And pack two pretty dresses

820
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,880
for pictures.

821
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,840
It's only for a few days.

822
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,760
Why would I bring so many things?

823
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,720
I've already packed.

824
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,840
You're going on a trip.
Just bring them along.

825
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,080
Better safe than sorry.

826
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,360
Go.

827
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,880
Sleep early.

828
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,160
I look like Zorro.

829
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
You look cool.

830
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,360
Bring two more facial masks.

831
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't need a mask.

832
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,360
Look at my wrinkles.

833
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,400
What's the point in caring for them?

834
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,040
Take them.

835
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,200
After using a facial mask,

836
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,680
your photos will look nice.

837
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,360
Take your time.

838
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,680
I'm going to take a shower.

839
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
<i>I'll be on-site early tomorrow.</i>

840
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>Sleep in a bit.</i>

841
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,240
<i>Don't say no.</i>

842
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
<i>Get your rest.</i>

843
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,440
<i>We'll need you once the event starts.</i>

844
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,640
<i>Okay.</i>

845
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,520
