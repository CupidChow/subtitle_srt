1
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,440
I have to thank my best friend,

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
who has been with me since we were kids.

3
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,160
If it weren't for her,

4
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,480
I wouldn't be playing the drums again.

5
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
Ruoxin.

6
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,480
Thank you.

7
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
Lastly,

8
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
I have to thank my husband.

9
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
FAIRY

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
Zou Cheng.

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,560
At our wedding

12
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
five years ago,

13
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,520
you said something

14
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
that still moves me even to this day.

15
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
After holding your hand for five years,

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,360
I just want to say,

17
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
"Let's hold hands

18
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,200
until we're old.

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Even death

20
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,440
won't separate us."

21
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
The most beautiful love poem

22
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
for my life-long comrade.

23
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,960
I hope we can be

24
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,080
the closest comrades in the years to come.

25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,320
Let's face life's ups and downs,

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,280
and the fragility in humanity together.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Let's get through conflicts,

28
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,320
temptations,

29
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
frustrations,

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
and challenges.

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,000
For the latter half of our lives,

32
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,000
maybe we'll get plenty of chances

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
to let go of each other's hands

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
and survive alone.

35
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,120
But hopefully, in the end, we won't.

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,080
Love runs deep,

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,760
but loyalty

38
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,360
runs deeper.

39
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
And this song

40
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
is for you.

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,040
My comrade.

42
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,400
I LOVE YOU

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,240
ZIYAN

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,480
You're the best, Song Ziyan!

45
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
Fairy!

46
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,200
I love you, honey!

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>I went through the crowds</i>

48
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,280
<i>Through streets and alleys</i>

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,840
<i>My preferred dream keeps echoing</i>

50
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>Still carrying my backpack</i>

51
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,560
<i>Still holding a smile</i>

52
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,120
<i>Feeling every moment</i>

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,640
<i>It's worthwhile</i>

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,040
<i>This is all my life</i>

55
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,680
<i>It passes by too quickly</i>

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,040
<i>Life is so beautiful</i>

57
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,320
<i>With you</i>

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,200
<i>Don't get engrossed too soon</i>

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,480
<i>Feel</i>

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,800
<i>You were once my everything</i>

61
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,240
ZIYAN

62
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,320
FAIRY

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,640
<i>Go ahead, us</i>

64
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,520
<i>Let's go</i>

65
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,440
SONG ZIYAN, WE LOVE YOU

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm back.

67
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,440
- Ruoxin.
- Ruoxin.

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,000
- Has Ziyan left?
- Yes, she left.

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
She's off to spend time with Zou Cheng.

70
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,920
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not telling you.

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
Ruoxin, look.

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,840
Su Yang.

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
You started a company?

74
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,000
Then what about your job?

75
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
I quit.

76
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Sijia's right.

77
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
This is a great opportunity.

78
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,640
If I don't take the initiative,

79
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm afraid I'll never be ready.

80
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,400
I told him not to worry.

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,680
I have a job.

82
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,000
My salary is about enough
for the two of us to live in Shanghai.

83
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,960
I got it.

84
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
Sijia means that

85
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,080
you should give her a raise.

86
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
I see. I'll consider it.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
I love you.

88
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Ruoxin.

89
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,960
I've been going to district governments
and asked around.

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
Support is actually offered
in many policies.

91
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,200
Some districts offer low-rental housing
for talented workers.

92
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
I can rent a nice one-bedroom apartment
for 2,000 yuan.

93
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
That's right.

94
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,400
There are also lots of shared
office spaces in Shanghai.

95
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,840
Renting an office is not expensive at all.

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
We've rented a shared office

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
in Caohejing this time.

98
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,360
This sounds like

99
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,040
we won't be roommates for long, buddy.

100
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,960
You have Ruoxin now, don't you?

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
Do you want to live with me forever?

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
That's right, Qi Xiao.

103
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,560
If you win this competition,

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,800
you'll be on the path to success.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
Do you still want to share a room?

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's make a toast.

107
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
For all of us,

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,520
who are on the path to success.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
Here, let's do this!

110
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

111
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,800
Who's calling?

112
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,520
I don't know. It's a strange number.

113
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,440
It must be some advertising spam call.

114
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,440
Don't answer it.

115
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,760
Answer it.

116
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
What if it's important?

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,600
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

118
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,120
<i>This is the jewelry design competition's
judging committee calling.</i>

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
<i>Are you Mr. Qi Xiao?</i>

120
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, I am.

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,800
The competition's judging committee.

122
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
Did you win?

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,960
Put it on speaker.

124
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,960
Let's hear it.

125
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,320
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
Yes, I am.

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,720
<i>The thing is, after verification,</i>

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,520
<i>you're suspected of plagiarism.</i>

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,960
<i>I'm sorry to tell you this.</i>

130
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,000
<i>You're disqualified.</i>

131
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,160
No, you must be mistaken.

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,400
I would never plagiarize.

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,040
<i>Is the Stars Bracelet your design?</i>

134
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,840
- Yes.
<i>- That's right.</i>

135
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,440
<i>Number 1803, Stars Bracelet,</i>

136
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,080
<i>and Number 152, Fusion, are too similar.</i>

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,400
<i>The designer of Fusion is Mr. Li Wei.</i>

138
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,280
<i>He's a very famous designer
in our industry.</i>

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
<i>- And he submitted it before you.</i>
- Hold on.

140
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,720
I don't know any designers named Li Wei.

141
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,880
It's even more impossible
that I've seen Fusion.

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
Stars Bracelet really is
my original design.

143
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,039
Can you look into this?

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,480
<i>Mr. Qi Xiao.</i>

145
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,919
<i>It doesn't matter
that you're not admitting to plagiarism.</i>

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,240
<i>But given that your design
was submitted later</i>

147
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,280
<i>and Li Wei's design was submitted earlier,</i>

148
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,280
<i>this is how we've processed this matter.</i>

149
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
<i>I'm really sorry. Bye.</i>

150
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,040
I didn't plagiarize.

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,520
I know. I believe you.

152
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
- Both of us too.
- Both of us too.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Have some warm milk.

154
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,520
No, thank you.

155
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,160
I never thought

156
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,160
the design I've racked my brains
for the past few months

157
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
would be similar to
another designer's design.

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
They even accused me of plagiarism.

159
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,960
I don't believe
you would do something like this.

160
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,520
You would never do that.

161
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,760
You never formally introduced
your design to me.

162
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,160
Stars Bracelet.

163
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,760
That's a pretty name.

164
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,960
It's so pretty.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,960
You like stars.

166
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
I wanted to surprise you.

167
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,680
Tell me about your design concept.

168
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,480
What does it mean?

169
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,320
The undulation on the bracelet

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,240
represents the pansies.

171
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,760
Pansies represent love.

172
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,400
Shakespeare wrote in
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream,</i>

173
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,000
"The wild pansy's juice is a potion.

174
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,560
Whoever gets this potion on them

175
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
will fall madly in love

176
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
with the first person they see."

177
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
At the ends of the bracelet,

178
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,640
there is Venus

179
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
and Mars.

180
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,880
Mars is a man.

181
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,920
Venus is a woman.

182
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,960
Venus means beauty and love.

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
It represents a woman's gentleness.

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Mars

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,680
represents masculine energy and action.

186
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,080
It's a man's power.

187
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,960
Here, at the two ends,

188
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,000
you can open them to buckle them together.

189
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,600
It represents love

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,400
can make two planets
that move along their own orbits meet.

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,280
This design concept is really beautiful.

192
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
I don't believe

193
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,360
that your project would
resemble someone else's.

194
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,400
I really want to see

195
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,080
what Li Wei's design is like.

196
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,680
But the committee won't even give me
a chance to confront him.

197
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,200
Right.

198
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
He is, after all, a famous designer.

199
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,280
I'm just a newbie.

200
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,440
He also submitted it before I did.

201
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,840
No one will believe me.

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
I do.

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
You can do it.

204
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
You will succeed.

205
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,640
I've reported the number of employees
we needed to headquarters last week.

206
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,160
The budget and other aspects
are still in discussion.

207
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
Xiaofan.

208
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,080
Keep an eye on the HR Department.

209
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,080
Okay.

210
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,120
If a craftsman wants to do good work,
he must first sharpen his tools.

211
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,080
I'm sure once the budgets are approved,

212
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,120
the New Energy Department
will surely do great.

213
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,280
That's right.

214
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,640
If there are no more questions,
that's all for today.

215
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,800
It's a new week,

216
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,800
so let's all work hard.

217
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
Okay.

218
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,400
<i>Yutao, when is good for you?</i>

219
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
<i>I need five or six minutes of your time
to ask for advice.</i>

220
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,040
<i>Please reply once you've read this.</i>

221
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
CALL

222
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,880
GU YUTAO
CALLING

223
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,400
Hello?

224
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Hello, Yutao?

225
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm Shen Ruoxin.

226
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,520
Are you busy?

227
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
<i>I'm sorry, old friend.</i>

228
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
I already saw your messages.

229
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,280
But I've been too busy
and I forgot to reply.

230
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
I know you're busy.

231
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,280
You just returned from abroad
so you must be busy.

232
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,840
<i>Let me be honest with you.</i>

233
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>I've been busy lately
with a personal matter.</i>

234
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,040
Well, I just got myself a girlfriend.

235
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,000
She's so clingy.

236
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,120
Is that so?

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,880
Congratulations. That's great.

238
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,520
<i>You're the one who inspired me.</i>

239
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,600
<i>It's nice that she's young.</i>

240
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,760
She's full of energy.

241
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm telling you.
She's broken many of my prejudices.

242
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,640
She's really beautiful and smart.

243
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,760
She's also diligent.

244
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,160
We also have a lot in common.

245
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,160
What a coincidence.

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,400
<i>What do you call that?</i>

247
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
- Soul mate?
- Fair, rich, and beautiful.

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,840
Yes, right. "Fair, rich, and beautiful."

249
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,960
<i>Okay.</i>

250
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,240
Let's talk about Qi Xiao.

251
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Regarding his issue,
I already looked into it.

252
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,800
How about this?

253
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
I have a meeting this afternoon,
so I'll be busy.

254
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,080
<i>Let's have dinner together.</i>

255
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,520
<i>Let's talk then. What do you think?</i>

256
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,080
Sure, that's good. Text me the address.

257
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,200
I'll be there later.

258
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,480
Sure, no problem.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,800
See you tonight.

260
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,800
Bye.

261
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
Here, look at me.

262
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,240
One, two, three.

263
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,520
Great.

264
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,200
One, two, three.

265
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,240
Check if it's okay.

266
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,760
You have to squat lower.

267
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,040
Make my legs look longer.

268
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,240
Here, let's take a picture
of your long legs.

269
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,200
Come, lean closer.

270
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,200
Okay.

271
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,080
One, two, three.

272
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,200
One, two, three.

273
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Okay, let's change the angle.

274
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,240
Here, walk forward.

275
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,360
Look here.

276
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
Okay. One, two, three.

277
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,800
- Look at what you took.
- Isn't it nice?

278
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,680
- This lighting…
- This isn't pretty?

279
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I think it's beautiful.
It's so pretty. Look.

280
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,160
- So ugly.
- Look at this one.

281
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
That's fine, right?

282
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,880
That's not bad.

283
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
- Your figure looks good.
- Yutao.

284
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,520
You're here, Ruoxin. Please have a seat.

285
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,520
Okay.

286
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,560
Let me introduce you.

287
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,760
My girlfriend.

288
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,400
This is the one I told you about.

289
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,920
My university classmate,
who sold me my car, Shen Ruoxin.

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,320
Hello, I'm Shen Ruoxin.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Hi, I'm Elizabeth.

292
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,160
You can also call me Feifei.

293
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,120
Elizabeth.

294
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
Such a foreign-sounding name.

295
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,000
You speak English well too.

296
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,640
Thank you.

297
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,880
I just returned from my studies in the UK.

298
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,960
You and Yutao are a perfect match.

299
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,000
Yutao has worked abroad for so many years.

300
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,320
I bet you two have a lot in common
to talk about.

301
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Yes.

302
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,400
Actually, I wasn't interested
in older men.

303
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
But I never thought he could be so funny.

304
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,400
You have a good eye.

305
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,800
Among our classmates,
Yutao has the best career.

306
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,400
He's also the most profitable
foreign law firm partner.

307
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
He knows a lot of people.

308
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
He just got back

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,040
and he's already mapped out
his social networks. Right, Yutao?

310
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,520
Don't say that.

311
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,040
In front of Feifei, I don't dare to boast.

312
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,200
I heard from Yutao

313
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
that his car is from your company?

314
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,160
Yes. What do you think?

315
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,640
How should I put it?

316
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,120
I'm definitely not one of those
materialistic people.

317
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,480
But it's my first time in
a car that's not Benz, BMW, or Audi.

318
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
To me,

319
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,520
you could say that
it's been a unique experience.

320
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm going to the restroom.
I'll let you two talk.

321
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
Go on, dear.

322
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
She sure is fair, rich, and beautiful.

323
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,520
Her father owns
a garment company in Zhejiang.

324
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,200
She's a well-off young lady. The heiress.

325
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,240
You get it.

326
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,200
You can't blame me.

327
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,319
It's because you didn't give me a chance.

328
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
You have such high standards.

329
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
How can I be compared
to such a rich and beautiful girl?

330
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,359
- Am I right?
- That's enough.

331
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
Enough about me.

332
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,079
Tell me about Qi Xiao.

333
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,760
Why is he so careless?

334
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,800
Why did he plagiarize the design
of a designer in the same competition?

335
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
I am certain that he didn't plagiarize.

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,760
That's why I'm here today
to figure out the truth.

337
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,040
Qi Xiao's design, Stars Bracelet,

338
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,640
has been ruled out
as plagiarizing Li Wei's design, Fusion.

339
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,240
And now he's disqualified
from the competition.

340
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I can assure you

341
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
that Qi Xiao definitely
did not plagiarize.

342
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,520
That's why now,

343
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,240
I would like to appeal

344
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,800
to take a look
at Mr. Li Wei's original design.

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
We want to confront Mr. Li

346
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,280
face-to-face in front of the committee.

347
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,840
Do you trust him that much?

348
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
That's how much I trust him.

349
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,760
Okay.

350
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,920
I'll make a call.

351
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
Hello, Mr. Ma.

352
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,160
It's me, Yutao.

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
How are you doing lately?

354
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
Do you still play basketball?

355
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,520
Sure. Let's meet up.

356
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,760
Who says we can't?

357
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,920
This weekend.

358
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,840
Okay.

359
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
Let me tell you something.

360
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,600
Isn't your company holding
a design competition?

361
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
Yes. I know.

362
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,840
The thing is,
I have a friend who's a designer.

363
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
His name is Qi Xiao.

364
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
He took part in your competition.

365
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,040
And now, after he submitted his design,

366
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,280
you said he plagiarized.

367
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,240
He's now disqualified
from the competition.

368
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,000
You said you knew about it.

369
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,160
He knows.

370
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Mr. Ma, here's what.

371
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,320
Qi Xiao is a very close friend.

372
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
He's definitely trustworthy.
He can't possibly plagiarize.

373
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,280
No, he definitely wouldn't.

374
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,400
Yes. It's impossible.

375
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,920
As of now, he's going to appeal.

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,480
This is the normal procedure.

377
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
That will do, right?

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,560
Okay, fine.

379
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Regarding this matter,
please handle it for me.

380
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,880
All right, it's a deal.

381
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,720
See you in the field this weekend.

382
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,400
Bye.

383
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,520
It's done.

384
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,240
Thank you.

385
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,520
I don't know what you're after.

386
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,960
Xiaoqi.

387
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,720
Look for the earliest date and time
this image was created.

388
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,320
Take a screenshot as evidence.

389
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,560
- And check the website for me.
- Okay.

390
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,800
What is Xiaoqi looking for?

391
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,600
I thought about it a lot last night.

392
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,160
The committee said that

393
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,040
I submitted it in the afternoon.

394
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
That morning, Li Wei submitted his design.

395
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,640
He was earlier than me.

396
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,120
But I actually already completed my design
a few days before I submitted it.

397
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,360
I was worried that Ruoxin might make
an under-the-counter deal.

398
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,360
That's why I was hesitating
to take part in the competition.

399
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,040
Based on the time I finished the design,

400
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,160
I'm definitely earlier
than Li Wei's submission date.

401
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,280
I'm now trying to put together
the process of my design

402
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,520
to appeal to the committee.

403
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,440
Right.

404
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,720
Good thing you reminded me
to register for copyright.

405
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
I found a website called Time-Stamp.

406
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,560
It has the date and time of my submission
to serve as evidence.

407
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,280
There seems
to be a problem with this link.

408
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
This isn't Time-Stamp's official link.

409
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
Look at this URL.

410
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,280
I searched for Time-Stamp online.

411
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,480
When I saw this page,
I clicked and entered it.

412
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,800
And when it was uploaded,

413
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,360
it did send me a confirmation
of the Time-Stamp website.

414
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,560
It can't be a fake website.

415
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,360
Look at this website I clicked on.

416
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,520
Look at this URL.

417
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,280
It flashed a few times.

418
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
Look, in the end,

419
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,960
it did get me into
Time-Stamp's official website.

420
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,760
But those few flashes,

421
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,320
something's wrong with that.

422
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,320
What's wrong with it?

423
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
That's what I'm investigating.

424
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,960
Give me some time.

425
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,080
What's wrong?

426
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,800
Xiaoqi said there's a problem
with the website link

427
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,840
- where I registered my copyright.
- What is it?

428
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,000
Here.

429
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,360
Ruoxin.

430
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
Xiaoqi's still looking into it.

431
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,360
But he just said
the website I found is a fake one.

432
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,320
But after logging in,
it automatically guides me

433
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,640
to the official website.

434
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,000
What's the purpose of this fake website?

435
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,800
It's too obvious.

436
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,840
This fake website carries
Trojan horse malware.

437
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,960
It will gain access to
your user ID and password on Time-Stamp.

438
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,280
So he'll also get

439
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,680
the original design
that I uploaded to Time-Stamp?

440
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,600
That means,

441
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,280
it is indeed plagiarism.

442
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
- However…
- I didn't plagiarize his design.

443
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
He plagiarized yours.

444
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,040
Take a look.

445
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,200
I have Li Wei's entry, Number 152,

446
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,120
Fusion.

447
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,120
It's indeed similar.

448
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,760
It's exactly the same.

449
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,880
Sir, can we track down

450
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,920
the person who set up this fake website?

451
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,880
Pretty lady.

452
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
Just call me Xiaoqi.

453
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,240
At the moment,

454
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,480
I can't find anything.

455
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,320
This person's computer isn't running.

456
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,880
I can't track it.

457
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,880
Don't worry.

458
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,760
The evidence we have now

459
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,920
is enough to justify
your appeal to the committee.

460
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,840
Don't worry.

461
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm going to appeal.

462
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,640
I can't let them accuse me.

463
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,760
I've made an appointment for you.

464
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Tomorrow at 10 a.m. at Shangli Group.

465
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,120
We'll appeal.

466
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,680
Members of the committee,
the judging panel,

467
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,280
and Li Wei will be there.

468
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,800
In front of them,

469
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
you will clear your name

470
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,760
and prove your innocence.

471
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
You already
contacted the committee for me?

472
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,400
No matter what,

473
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
I'll be by your side.

474
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400
Don't worry.

475
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,520
You'll win the appeal tomorrow.

476
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm not worried.

477
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,400
What's mine is mine.

478
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,960
No one can take it away from me.

479
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm fine
if they don't approve of my design.

480
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,720
But I can't accept them accusing me
of plagiarism and taking a shortcut.

481
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,720
I know.

482
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,400
I believe you.

483
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,400
I'll go with you tomorrow.

484
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,360
It's okay. Don't worry.

485
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,800
I can take care of it myself.

486
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,120
I know you can handle it.

487
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,520
But I hope that

488
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
I'll always be by your side
at each of your crucial times.

489
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,840
I already took a day off.

490
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,040
Come to think of it,

491
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,600
there's something I have to tell you.

492
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,920
Appealing to the committee

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,040
and getting a copy of Li Wei's design,

494
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,640
I asked Gu Yutao for help.

495
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
I figured.

496
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,840
You did?

497
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,680
You're so calm even when you knew?

498
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,680
I used to feel insecure.

499
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,320
But now,

500
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm sure about a lot of things.

501
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,320
So I'm not panicking.

502
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,440
You shouldn't feel insecure.

503
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
I'm telling you.

504
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Gu Yutao has a girlfriend now.

505
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,480
A 24-year-old rich and pretty girl.

506
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,520
Really?

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,360
It's true. I've met her.

508
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,720
She has a great background.

509
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,960
The heiress to a garment company.

510
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,560
Twenty-four years old.

511
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
She studied abroad in the UK.

512
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,040
She's fair, pretty, and she has long legs

513
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,560
with an hourglass figure.

514
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,840
Then he has poor taste.

515
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,120
He was quick in giving up on you.

516
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Why do I feel like
you're a bit disappointed?

517
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm not.

518
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,840
I really don't think he has good taste.

519
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Unlike me.

520
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,360
I'll never let you go.

521
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Why can't I tell
if that's complimenting me or yourself?

522
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,640
Complimenting me is complimenting you.

523
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,480
Complimenting you is complimenting me.
There's no difference.

524
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,680
Okay, it's about time.

525
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,800
You may begin.

526
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
Let me introduce the members
of the grievance procedure.

527
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,760
Me, Mr. Liu,

528
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,440
and the designer, Mr. Yu Xiaoyan.

529
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,400
They are all on the judging panel
for this competition.

530
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,760
They are authorized to give a ruling

531
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
on the outcome of this appeal.

532
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,440
The one sitting on my right is Mr. Li Wei

533
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,600
and his assistant.

534
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,240
Across from them is Mr. Qi Xiao and--

535
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,960
I am Mr. Qi Xiao's assistant
and his legal consultant.

536
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,240
Okay. Let me explain
the following procedure.

537
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
First, Mr. Li Wei will introduce

538
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
the concept
and the creative process of his design.

539
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Then, it's Mr. Qi Xiao's turn.

540
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
Based on your introductions,

541
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,520
we'll raise questions.

542
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,520
Then, we'll make a ruling.

543
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
I'm sure you understand.

544
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,320
No problem.

545
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,720
Let's get started.

546
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,600
Interesting.

547
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
Li Wei said the undulation

548
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,040
on the bracelet represents
waves of exploration.

549
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
Like the Age of Discovery.

550
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,480
Qi Xiao said that it's the pansies.

551
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,880
It's a symbol of love.

552
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,000
Qi Xiao said the yellow and red

553
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,800
on the Stars Bracelet
represent Venus and Mars.

554
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Li Wei said the blue and red

555
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,640
in Fusion represent

556
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,000
Western Civilization
and Eastern Civilization.

557
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,480
Both make sense.

558
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,640
That's interesting.

559
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,840
I've read one of Mr. Yu's books.

560
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,680
It was about how you wish to become
a jewelry designer that connects

561
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,840
Eastern Civilization
and Western Civilization.

562
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,440
After reading that,
it really enlightened me.

563
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,640
I've learned a lot.

564
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,400
When you ruled out Qi Xiao
because of plagiarism,

565
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,120
what was the basis?

566
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,440
Li Wei submitted his design
earlier than Qi Xiao did

567
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,160
and the similarity of their designs

568
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,800
is above 80%.

569
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,720
So we disqualified
Stars Bracelet from the competition.

570
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
Since one is later than the other,

571
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,200
it's very obvious.

572
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,000
Even if it's a coincidence,

573
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Qi Xiao,

574
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,640
I'm sorry.

575
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,640
Mr. Yu.

576
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,400
Although I submitted my design later,

577
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,240
I have already completed it
a few days before my submission.

578
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,760
I've uploaded my design
to a website called Time-Stamp.

579
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,960
There's a screenshot of it.

580
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,000
I already handed it to
the staff of the committee.

581
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,560
Yes, here's the screenshot.

582
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,840
I know of Time-Stamp.

583
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
It's a very famous website in the industry

584
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,040
for designers to register copyrights.

585
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
Mr. Li Wei.

586
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,040
It was way before your submission date.

587
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,560
Mr. Yu.

588
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,920
I'm just like you.

589
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,960
Old school.

590
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,400
I've always drawn by hand.

591
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,160
I don't know how to use computers.

592
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,720
Today, I've brought

593
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,280
my hand-sketched draft.

594
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,440
Please take a look.

595
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,080
I have signed the time on it.

596
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,160
Based on the date,

597
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,400
Li Wei was indeed earlier.

598
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,120
It's not fair.

599
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,400
Mr. Yu.

600
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,160
It's very unfair.

601
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
Even if he drew it just now,

602
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,800
he can sign off any date.

603
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Compared to Time-Stamp's verification,

604
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,560
it's not admissible as evidence.

605
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,480
Mr. Qi Xiao and this

606
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
assistant.

607
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,640
Designers,

608
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,480
we're all about branding and credibility.

609
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,000
Compared to you both,

610
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,760
I'm quite a well-known designer.

611
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,040
I think my credibility

612
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
should be a bit higher than yours.

613
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
Don't you think so?

614
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
Who just now asked for evidence?

615
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,560
Now that I have it,

616
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,960
you suspect the authenticity of it
on no basis.

617
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,600
You really don't have

618
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,920
any respect for Shangli Group

619
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,040
and Mr. Yu Xiaoyan.

620
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
Plus, the members of the committee

621
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,000
are all experienced experts

622
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,200
in the design industry.

623
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,800
Do you also believe

624
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,280
that an inexperienced rookie

625
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
can design something like this?

626
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm not an inexperienced rookie.

627
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
Even though I didn't major in design,

628
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,000
I've been doing jewelry design
for three years.

629
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,760
I run an online original jewelry shop.

630
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,160
An online shop?

631
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,200
Very good.

632
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,760
That's even more ridiculous.

633
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,360
An online shop owner's design
is actually similar to mine.

634
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,560
I'm someone that has won

635
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,880
national design awards
for three years in a row.

636
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,320
Is that a coincidence?

637
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,840
Are you shooting a drama?

638
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,040
It's not a coincidence.

639
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,400
It's plagiarism.

640
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,160
But Qi Xiao didn't plagiarize your design.

641
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,960
It's you who plagiarized Qi Xiao's design.

642
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,560
Miss, can you prove that?
Shut your mouth if you can't!

643
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm a famous designer,
graduated from a prestigious school.

644
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,240
Why would I plagiarize
an online shop owner's design?

645
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,480
Qi Xiao.

646
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,800
Show them the evidence.

647
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
Everyone.

648
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,400
Here is the proof.

649
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,480
I think

650
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,200
this phishing website
must be related to Li Wei.

651
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,800
But we don't have any evidence.

652
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,240
- Unless…
- Unless what?

653
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,600
This person's computer
isn't running at the moment

654
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,040
so I can't track him.

655
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,240
But once his computer is on,

656
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
I'm 70% positive

657
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
that I can track down his IP address.

658
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,880
So you mean that

659
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,240
we'll also go phishing?

660
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,200
Smart.

661
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,120
How?

662
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,440
Gentlemen.

663
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,560
Two nights ago, my roommate Su Yang,

664
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,240
searched for Time-Stamp online.

665
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,600
<i>Time-Stamp's official site
wasn't on the search engine.</i>

666
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,520
<i>It's a phishing website.</i>

667
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,480
Just like what happened to me then.

668
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,640
You can look at it.

669
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,880
Although this webpage

670
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,080
is identical to
Time-Stamp's official website,

671
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
you can see in the URL address

672
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
that it's a fake website.

673
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,440
It's also a fake website
with Trojan horse malware.

674
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,960
Su Yang logged into this website
with his Time-Stamp

675
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,520
user ID and password.

676
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,320
He uploaded a design.

677
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,760
And then, five minutes later,

678
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,040
another computer logged into his account

679
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,680
and downloaded his picture.

680
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
This is my roommate's IP address.

681
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
This is the other computer's IP address.

682
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,760
The two subscribers' IP addresses
are 30 km apart.

683
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,360
<i>Now tell me, how did my roommate</i>

684
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
<i>manage to teleport himself</i>

685
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
to a place 30 km away in just 5 minutes

686
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
and logged into his account again?

687
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
And coincidentally,

688
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,560
the other computer's IP address

689
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,120
happens to be the IP address

690
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,520
of Mr. Li Wei's studio.

691
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,400
You're lying!

692
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,120
Everyone.

693
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,240
Defamation, explicit defamation!

694
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,720
Mr. Li Wei,
raise your words, not your voice.

695
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,760
Calm down.

696
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,480
Could it be that Su Yang's picture
is now on your computer?

697
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,240
Are you still going to do it "old school"

698
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,640
and draw that design on paper?

699
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,840
Of course,
it may not be on his computer now.

700
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,720
But you probably didn't expect this.

701
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,680
Su Yang's picture
also carries Trojan horse malware.

702
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,040
It helps my hacker friend
to hack into the computer

703
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,240
that downloaded
this picture from a distance.

704
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,640
Therefore, on that computer,
we found a document.

705
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,000
There are different designs
signed off by various designers.

706
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,200
Coincidentally, we also discovered
many similar designs

707
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,040
in your portfolio.

708
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
All right, you sure are something.

709
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,159
You even hired a hacker?

710
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,480
Listen, this is illegal evidence.

711
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm going to sue you.

712
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,639
I'll sue both of you!

713
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,440
Mr. Li, this is not a court of law.

714
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,440
Your claim of insufficient evidence
to appear in court doesn't exist.

715
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,320
Secondly, you're so agitated.

716
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,080
Are you trying to tell us

717
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,480
that the computer is yours?

718
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,960
The phishing website is also your work?

719
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,920
- I--
- Mr. Li Wei.

720
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,719
If you have nothing to hide,

721
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,400
will you bring your laptop over
so we can examine it

722
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
and prove your innocence?

723
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,920
That's not necessary, right?

724
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,400
All right, then.

725
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,760
I'll announce

726
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
that Li Wei's Fusion is disqualified

727
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,680
from this competition.

728
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
Qi Xiao.

729
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,840
Stars Bracelet is qualified.

730
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,800
Thank you.

731
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,080
But for someone
who has the habit of plagiarism,

732
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,120
can we call it even
by disqualifying him once?

733
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Of course not.

734
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,640
I'll hand over the information
you submitted today

735
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,000
to the National Designer Ethics Committee
to investigate.

736
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,960
Li Wei.

737
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,880
In the next few months,
your membership will be suspended.

738
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,000
Wait for the final results.

739
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
Mr. Li Wei.

740
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,360
We have recorded

741
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,080
the entire process of this appeal.

742
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,520
This will also be the evidence

743
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,200
we submit to the Ethics Committee.

744
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
This way, please.

745
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,320
Prepare for the competition.

746
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,320
Thank you, sir.

747
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,560
Qi Xiao.

748
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,840
Mr. Yu.

749
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,880
Your design is unique. I love it.

750
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
For the next round,

751
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,480
you need to create your own design.

752
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,280
In the final round,
you'll compete with the final product.

753
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,400
How's that? Do you feel pressured?

754
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,040
I can introduce you to a very good
pattern-making factory.

755
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,240
As for the raw materials,

756
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,120
I can offer you
some melee diamonds and rubies.

757
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,240
As for the yellow gems, let me think
about what's best to replace them.

758
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,680
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

759
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,440
But I haven't thought about
using real diamonds and jewels

760
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
for this bracelet.

761
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,480
Tell me what you think.

762
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,440
I want to create a young brand.

763
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,200
So young people can enjoy
fashion and beauty.

764
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,320
As for realizing that in production,

765
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,640
I already have an idea.

766
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,840
Okay.

767
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,800
I really admire young people
with their own ideas.

768
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,280
- Keep it up.
- Thank you.

769
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,120
Right. Can I take a look
at your other designs?

770
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,120
Of course.

771
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,680
The theme "A Love Confession"
sounds interesting.

772
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,680
Let me see.

773
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,400
No. This isn't--

774
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,840
SHEN RUOXIN

775
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,000
Who is Shen Ruoxin?

776
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,200
Stop laughing.

777
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,280
I told you everything.
You promised me you wouldn't laugh.

778
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,480
I'm sorry. It just popped into my head.

779
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,720
That night, someone on the sofa

780
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,360
acted like he had a stomachache.

781
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,480
Pretend it never happened, okay?

782
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
I know. It never happened.

783
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,120
There was someone

784
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,400
who didn't eat dinner.

785
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,560
He was on the sofa.

786
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,960
"My stomach hurts too much.

787
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,480
I feel like I have gas in my stomach.

788
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,280
It comes and goes.

789
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,480
It must be stomach flu."

790
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,920
I'm ignoring you.

791
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,480
All right, I'll stop.

792
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,200
I'll buy you something delicious later
to celebrate.

793
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,560
You finally proved your innocence.

794
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,920
Most importantly,
you made it to the second round.

795
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,480
You also won Yu Xiaoyan's admiration.

796
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,240
I think we should be celebrating
that justice will always prevail.

797
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,040
The good defeated the evil.

798
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
Tonight,

799
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,520
I want Korean barbecue.

800
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,560
Barbecue?

801
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,880
No problem.

802
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,960
On one condition.

803
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,240
What is it?

804
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,160
The love confession picture

805
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,480
said, "Shen Ruoxin."

806
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,840
What does it say after that?

807
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,840
I didn't catch it.

808
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,120
I remember it said,

809
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,600
"Shen Ruoxin."

810
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,400
After that, it said…

811
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,960
"All the stars of the universe will vouch

812
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,000
that I, Qi Xiao, like you."

813
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,120
Watch out for cars.

814
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,000
Xiaoxin.

815
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,760
You don't have muscles in your arm.

816
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,640
You can't play the drums for sure.

817
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,120
Who said I don't have muscles?

818
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,920
I have muscles. Touch it.

819
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,240
Okay, I'll touch it.

820
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Look at your muscles.

821
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,680
It's not strong enough.

822
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,040
So you have to eat a lot of meat,
vegetables, and rice. Okay?

823
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,200
Look.

824
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,360
Your uncle's muscles.

825
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,520
It's different.

826
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,080
It's very sturdy.

827
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,800
Do you understand?

828
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,200
If you could be like your uncle,

829
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,960
you'll play drums really well.

830
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,320
Uncle, I want to see your muscles.

831
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
Show us.

832
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,440
Sure, Xiaoxin.

833
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,480
My muscles

834
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,040
are awesome like Popeye's.

835
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,080
Count to three.

836
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,880
- Here.
- One,

837
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,680
two, three.

838
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
That's amazing!

839
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,240
Mom.

840
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,360
What is it?

841
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,320
My uncle is like Popeye.

842
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,360
He's amazing.

843
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,960
Is he that amazing?

844
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,720
Ask your uncle if he can teach you?

845
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,760
Okay.

846
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,280
Mom, you're thinking
about having a grandchild?

847
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
Of course.

848
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,920
In my opinion,
your sister-in-law has changed.

849
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,160
She is empathetic now.

850
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,400
She doesn't wander off.

851
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,040
The key is, she has a good job.

852
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,160
She teaches children.

853
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,880
She's at the same mall as your brother.

854
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,040
That's not bad.

855
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,320
I don't think they need anything else now

856
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,600
apart from a kid.

857
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,080
Here's my advice.

858
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,080
Don't urge them.
They have their own plans.

859
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,080
I know what to do.

860
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,920
Here, Ziyan.

861
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
The shrimp is peeled.

862
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,920
Thank you, Mother. I'll do it myself.

863
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,520
Grandma, Aunt Ziyan is an adult.

864
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,440
You're peeling shrimp for her?

865
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,320
Ziyan is an adult.

866
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,640
But the little baby inside Ziyan

867
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,760
isn't an adult.

868
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,840
Mother, I'm not pregnant.

869
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,040
You're not pregnant yet.

870
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,040
Who knows if you'll suddenly get pregnant?

871
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,960
Aren't you both preparing for it?

872
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,200
What's going on?

873
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,400
Mom, we're not preparing for it.

874
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,440
Don't talk nonsense.

875
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,800
What do you mean you're not?

876
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,040
Didn't you go to the hospital
to get examined?

877
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,240
The folic acid and those vitamins
I gave you,

878
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,480
didn't you take them?

879
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,480
Mother.

880
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,280
Zou Cheng and I
don't really want to have kids.

881
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,600
If you don't give birth now,
it'll be too late.

882
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,280
Mom.

883
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,840
Ziyan and I both decided
we don't want kids.

884
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,000
We want to start

885
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,680
with living our lives
by knowing what we want.

886
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,080
Then, we'll bring a life into this world.

887
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,920
Listen to him.

888
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He's almost 40 years old.

889
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,280
You don't know what you want in your life.

890
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,560
Do you know why?

891
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,480
It's because you don't have kids.

892
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,120
Without kids,
you have no sense of responsibility.

893
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,160
You also don't know
the importance of family.

894
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,560
You're a teacher now, right?

895
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,280
Isn't that great?

896
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,560
Your father-in-law and I thought
you had changed.

897
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,280
Mother.

898
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,400
I do like to teach children.

899
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,640
And, gradually, I think that kids

900
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,360
are actually kind of cute.

901
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,320
But the more I spend time with them,

902
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,640
the more I think that

903
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,840
every kid is an individual.

904
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,640
If one day,

905
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,400
when both Zou Cheng and I want kids,

906
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,880
it won't be because we feel lonely.

907
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,440
Nor will it be

908
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,880
because we want a child

909
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,200
to inherit the family business
or bring glory to the family.

910
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,080
We also won't have a kid

911
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
so he can support us.

912
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,960
I think we must be ready

913
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,520
to become parents.

914
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,440
To embrace him,

915
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,200
to look after him,

916
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,840
to accompany him, and educate him.

917
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,360
I think once everything's in place,

918
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,240
it's only then that it's right
to have a kid.

919
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,000
Since ancient times,
everyone raises children

920
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,640
without having any clue.

921
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,000
If everyone thinks like you,

922
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,200
no one in the world
will want to have kids.

923
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,120
A family is complete when there's a child.

924
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
Mom.

925
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,920
That's the problem.

926
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,560
If a couple gives birth
to a child without having any clue at all,

927
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,800
they don't know what they are facing.

928
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,560
They don't know what to prepare.

929
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,040
Isn't that scary?

930
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,640
And you're raising a child.

931
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,080
It'll probably take 18 years.

932
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,840
But it's your spouse
who stays by you, not your kid.

933
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,240
To me,

934
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,600
Ziyan is the one
who will stay by me for life.

935
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,440
So her condition and opinions

936
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,280
are what matters the most to me.

937
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,480
I married her.

938
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,080
Not some baby-making machine.

939
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,720
Of course, having kids and raising kids,

940
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,040
I'm sure I'll do my best

941
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400
in carrying out my responsibilities.

942
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,080
But don't you think that in the process,

943
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
a mother sacrifices the most?

944
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,080
So…

945
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,120
I respect Ziyan's decision completely.

946
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,720
