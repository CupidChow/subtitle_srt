1
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
Take a look.

2
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,960
It's our new energy car.

3
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,440
Come on in.

4
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Zenpro's new energy car.

5
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,880
- Take a look.
- Come inside.

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
Hold this for me.

7
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
<i>We got on the bus.</i>

8
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
<i>There aren't many people.</i>

9
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>I'm with the lady whom I met last time.</i>

10
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,240
<i>Don't worry.</i>

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
- New energy car. Check it out.
<i>- Okay.</i>

12
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
<i>Have fun, Mom.</i>

13
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,080
<i>Don't try to save money.</i>

14
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,120
<i>You're on a trip.
You can spend some money.</i>

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
Come in. Take a look.

16
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
Look at Ziyan.

17
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,600
There aren't many female drummers.

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,600
She looks cool.

19
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,720
Dad, I want to be like her

20
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
and play the drums.

21
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
Zou Cheng,

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,480
where did you find this band?

23
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
That drummer's amazing.

24
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
So stylish.

25
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
She's my wife.

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,360
You hid her so well.

27
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,800
The wife who cooks you
a different dish for every meal?

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Good looking and good at cooking.

29
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,720
I should've brought
my wife here to see her.

30
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
Look at my banner!

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,360
Follow along. Don't get lost.

32
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,600
Watch your step.

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Here.

34
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,200
It's beautiful here.

35
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,560
It's actually pretty good.

36
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
My goodness.

37
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,560
It's cold in the morning,

38
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
but it's so sunny now.

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,240
This hat looks really bad.

40
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
Your hat is so pretty.

41
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,040
You're so stylish.

42
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,200
Yes.

43
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
My daughter prepared it for me.

44
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
I don't want to dress like this.

45
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,160
I mean, I'm going on a trip.

46
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,720
A dress will be inconvenient.

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
She didn't care.

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,240
She told me that

49
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,680
if I'm dressed like this,
I'll look prettier in the photo.

50
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,160
Yes, you do look good in a skirt.

51
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
A daughter is different from a son.

52
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
She's so sweet.

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Guess what my son asked me to bring?

54
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,520
He made me bring so many pills.

55
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,960
- You have a son?
- Yes.

56
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Then do you live with your son?

57
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,360
No, I live on Shaanxi Road.

58
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
The day I signed up for this,

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,760
I was there to see my son.

60
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
This means that your son and my daughter

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
live in the same neighborhood.

62
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,280
What does your son do?

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
My son studied law.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
He's in the Legal Department of a company.

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,720
My daughter is too.

66
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
What a coincidence.

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,720
Is he married?

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,360
Does he live with his family?

69
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,520
No.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,160
He's a tenant.

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,040
The place is close to the office.

72
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,120
My son is still single.

73
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,840
He has no girlfriend.

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
I told him, "Son,

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,840
you should find a girlfriend soon."

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,200
Guess what he said to me?

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
He told me, "Mom, don't rush me.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm so busy with work right now.
I don't have time."

79
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,360
It's his own business after all.

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,080
I don't think we should rush things.

81
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,280
That's a coincidence.

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,920
My daughter is single too.

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,520
What's his zodiac?

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,080
It's the Year of the Tiger.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
What a coincidence.

86
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,160
My daughter was born
in the Year of the Tiger.

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
What a coincidence.

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,880
When we get back,

89
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,960
we have to find a chance for them to meet.

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
Promise me.

91
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,480
They have the same background.

92
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,600
Their working environment is the same.

93
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,480
They will hit it off.

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,120
My daughter is really pretty.

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
She's competent too.

96
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,840
I can see that.

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
You're so fashionable.

98
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
You're so pretty.

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,160
Your daughter won't be far off.

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,080
I'm old already.

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,600
This is fate.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,160
A tiger meeting another tiger.

103
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Maybe the two tigers belong to each other.

104
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
Yes, like a tiger couple…

105
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,360
That's not right.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,720
I think people say

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,360
that two tigers can be together…

108
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,240
Unless they're male and female.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's introduce them first.

110
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,600
- It's fate.
- Of course!

111
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,600
Of course!

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,320
Did you see me holding a cup?

113
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,640
My cup is on the bus!

114
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,760
Don't.

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,720
It's too far.

116
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
I brought some money. Look.

117
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
There's a beverage shop, isn't there?

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,360
I'll buy you a drink.

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,960
How can I let you pay?

120
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,720
No! Don't!

121
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,240
No, how can I let you pay?

122
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm so sorry.

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
I'll give it back to you later.

124
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Hey, miss.

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't mention it.

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
Kids these days

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,840
are stressed out by work.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,000
They don't have time to make friends.

129
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,880
We'll be friends first.

130
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,000
Also,

131
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,680
as for the agencies,

132
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,000
I've been to many of them.

133
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,000
None of them are reliable.

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,400
They have to be like us

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
and come out themselves

136
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,280
to meet other people.

137
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,000
It's the best way.

138
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,920
I didn't expect

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,520
the world to be this small.

140
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,520
All of a sudden,

141
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,919
we met each other.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,799
Now, for us, the two mothers,

143
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,320
all we have to do

144
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
is to push them gently.

145
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,000
Who knows?

146
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,280
Maybe it'll really work.

147
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,160
I really hope my daughter

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,440
can find someone soon.

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,360
They're already close to each other.

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
It's fate.

151
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
You're absolutely right,

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,920
but I don't have to hurry my son.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I got married late when I was young.

154
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,040
I gave birth to him when I was 30.

155
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,200
What did you say?

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,640
- You had your son when you were 30?
- That's right.

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
How old are you?

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm 53.

159
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,240
Does that mean your son

160
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,440
is 12 years younger than my daughter?

161
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
He's 12 years younger.

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
You didn't ask me either.

164
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,960
My courtesy was a waste.

165
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Sir.

166
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,240
It's too cold. I can't have this.

167
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,600
Refund. I'm sorry.

168
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,080
INSPIRATION DRIVES INNOVATION

169
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
Hello.

170
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,480
Excuse me.

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you guys

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
busy performing every day?

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
It's okay.

174
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,720
You are…

175
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,880
I own a music classroom

176
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
upstairs in this mall.

177
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,960
This is my business card.

178
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,600
Thank you.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
Hello.

180
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,360
Just saw your performance.

181
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,360
I think it's great.

182
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
I was just wondering

183
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
if you're interested

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
in teaching children to play the drums.

185
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
- Children?
- Yes.

186
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,360
I can't.

187
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,040
I can't handle children.

188
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,840
While some of them are naughty,

189
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,760
most of them are well-behaved.

190
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Can you reconsider?

191
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,960
We pay decent money to the teachers.

192
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,680
Our place is nice too.

193
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,200
You can take a look upstairs.

194
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,600
No, thank you.

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,280
It's okay. Just try it.

196
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,920
Check it out when you're free.

197
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
Yes.

198
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,560
Please reconsider.

199
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,080
You're always welcome

200
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
to visit my classroom.

201
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,640
- I'll let you work.
- Okay.

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Bye.

203
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,080
After the last test-drive event,

204
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,520
today was so much better.

205
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,560
Ziyan's band complemented

206
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
our event too.

207
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
A lot of those people

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,360
were attracted by them.

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,560
We handed out a lot of brochures too.

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,040
But not many of them left their number.

211
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,520
It's less than I expected.

212
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
You can't expect instant success.

213
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
Are you okay?

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm fine.

215
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
I need some air.

216
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,440
These campaigns cost a lot of money.

217
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,320
No matter how we try, we still overspent.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
Ruoxin.

219
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,080
This is the proposal and budget
for the event on campus.

220
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Okay.

221
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,840
The cost for the schools

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,120
isn't low either.

223
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,080
We don't have enough budget left.

224
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,160
Well, ladies and gentlemen!

225
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Please be quiet, everyone.

226
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Listen.

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,640
The rooms that we've arranged for you

228
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
are all the same.

229
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
They're all twin bedrooms.

230
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
If anyone wants to room together, tell me.

231
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,200
- I'll room with her.
- I'll room with her.

232
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
- Both of us.
- Both of us.

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,760
Here.

234
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,440
Okay.

235
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,880
- Well…
- Two people in a room.

236
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,880
That's how it usually is.

237
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
- We'll room with each other.
- Okay.

238
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,560
- Do you want my help?
- No.

239
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,680
- Which room?
- Room 166.

240
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,320
166. Good number.

241
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
COLLEGE CAMPAIGN'S MOST POPULAR GIFT

242
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
Hello?

243
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
Hello, Ruoxin.

244
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,480
I think we can replace

245
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120
the items we've already ordered

246
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,840
with these.

247
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,800
They're more popular and cheaper.

248
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,160
<i>It's one way to cut expenses.</i>

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,160
There's no other choice.

250
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,440
We can't count on the company either.

251
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
I've been looking at the proposal
all night.

252
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,960
We can't do anything else

253
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,680
with that budget.

254
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,320
All right, don't be anxious.

255
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,160
Let's just be sincere

256
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,160
at our events.

257
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,480
<i>They say traditional industries
are profitable.</i>

258
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,800
<i>But over the years,</i>

259
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
business has been bad,

260
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,880
especially in the automotive industry.

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,720
It's cheap even for a school event.

262
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,840
We'll have to make do with it.

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,960
Don't be discouraged.

264
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,520
Maybe at the event,

265
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,280
something good will happen, right?

266
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
Hey, kid.

267
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
Let go of your delusion.

268
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,720
Please, my dear boss,

269
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,960
we rookies have unrealistic dreams.

270
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,520
You're working late.

271
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
It's not to be encouraged,

272
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
but it's respectable.

273
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll give you a point.

274
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,360
Thank you, ma'am,

275
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
but I don't mind if you add more.

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Minus two points
for being a smooth talker.

277
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,200
<i>Hello, your AI assistant is online.</i>

278
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,960
Putting it blankly,
this is my advice to you.

279
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,680
Go to bed early.

280
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
Take care of yourself.

281
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,400
AI assistant,

282
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,400
don't forget to charge yourself.

283
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,200
Okay, bye.

284
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,960
QI XIAO

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
Take my car to the office.

286
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,640
Did you not get enough sleep?

287
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,160
Why don't you take a day off?

288
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Don't worry. I can still beat you.

289
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Press the button.

290
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
You're so stubborn.

291
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,600
I didn't have coffee.

292
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,960
Why do I feel uncomfortable?

293
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,840
Did you have breakfast?

294
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I didn't.

295
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,720
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

296
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,960
Let me check your pulse.

297
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,720
Can you read pulses?

298
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,680
Are you an old Chinese doctor?

299
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,240
It's beating kind of fast.

300
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll buy you some milk later.

301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,760
It'll calm you down.

302
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,920
Okay.

303
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Don't push.

304
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,320
<i>It's time for us to work as a team.</i>

305
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,760
XINXIN SUPPORTERS TEAM

306
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,160
<i>Did my group chat finally come in handy?</i>

307
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,120
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

308
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,000
<i>As for the school campaign,</i>

309
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,960
<i>hold on.</i>

310
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,520
<i>- I'll bring someone else in.
- You guys have been busy lately.</i>

311
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,880
<i>Is Ruoxin exhausted?</i>

312
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,680
<i>Let me know if you need any help.</i>

313
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,480
SU YANG

314
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,680
ADD

315
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,160
<i>What do you mean?</i>

316
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,200
<i>I used to work at a social service.</i>

317
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,920
<i>I'm familiar with holding events
in schools.</i>

318
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
<i>Okay, I'll assign you the tasks.</i>

319
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,240
<i>Su Yang and I will take care
of the school's clubs.</i>

320
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,640
<i>You Sijia,
go through the procedures for me.</i>

321
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,680
<i>But Su Yang,
we have a special mission tonight.</i>

322
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,840
Stop by the pharmacy.

323
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
Get me a box of melatonin.

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,880
You look drowsy during the day.

325
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,160
You can't sleep?

326
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm getting anxious recently.

327
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,120
I get more excited at night.

328
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
When you're free,

329
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,280
you can think about me.

330
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,880
What? Afraid that you'll get too excited?

331
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,480
I'll hit you.

332
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,680
Stop it. I'm driving.

333
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,160
- It's dangerous.
- Let go.

334
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,120
That's a strong jab.

335
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
Please.

336
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,360
Why did you bring me here?

337
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,520
<i>The newly-built theme park is now open.
I heard that it's fun.</i>

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,640
<i>So I think that I should go</i>

339
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,600
<i>and start this journey
of exploring the universe.</i>

340
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,040
<i>- Yes! I can't wait.</i>
- Come on, sit down.

341
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,880
<i>There is a roller coaster in the park.
It's extremely exciting.</i>

342
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,720
<i>It takes visitors into the Solar System
to see the planets.</i>

343
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,320
This place is closing soon.

344
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,120
It stays open until later today.

345
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,120
Don't worry.

346
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,320
Why isn't anyone here?

347
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,080
A friend of mine works here.

348
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,600
We're entering early. Cool, right?

349
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,520
<i>I hope you enjoy it.</i>

350
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
<i>If you feel afraid, just close your eyes.</i>

351
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
<i>But remember not to fall asleep.</i>

352
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,560
<i>Let's start with…</i>

353
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
It's so pretty.

354
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,480
Does it feel

355
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,320
like you're in space?

356
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,720
Like the world has gone quiet.

357
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
Let's forget about everything for a while.

358
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,840
Just be with the stars for now.

359
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,320
You know what?

360
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,640
In the 1990s,

361
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
a space probe took a picture

362
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,200
four billion miles away

363
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
from Earth in space.

364
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,840
The Earth in that picture

365
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
was like

366
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,880
a tiny

367
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,720
blue spot

368
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
in the dark.

369
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,440
Later on, an astronomer, Sagan,

370
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,880
talked about how he felt about it.

371
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,600
In short, he said that

372
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,560
all the happiness

373
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,760
and sadness,

374
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,480
all beliefs and knowledge…

375
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
All of it

376
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
only exists

377
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,160
on a speck of tiny dust

378
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
floating in the sunlight.

379
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,360
So compared to this bright starry sky,

380
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
all of our troubles

381
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
are insignificant.

382
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,080
I'm telling you,

383
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,760
you're the only person

384
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,160
who can think of this idea.

385
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,360
Drawing their new showroom

386
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
for a free one-night entrance
at the theater.

387
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,000
It's a great deal.

388
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Is this a deal?

389
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,320
It's the power of love.

390
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,520
Weren't you always telling me
to confess my love?

391
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,040
Why can't you do it yourself?

392
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,840
It's not that I'm afraid to confess.

393
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,520
Ruoxin is a very defensive person.

394
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
She doesn't like to be pushed too hard.

395
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,880
She has her own rhythm.

396
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,520
I hope that one day,

397
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,200
she'll open her heart to me.

398
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,960
I can wait.

399
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,680
From now on,

400
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,280
we aren't brothers anymore.

401
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,120
Because brotherhood pales

402
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,560
in comparison with love.

403
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,280
- I'm--
- What are you doing?

404
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Try me.

405
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,640
Good job, my man.

406
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,200
Let's do it,

407
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,160
you brat.

408
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,760
Su Yang.

409
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,840
Ruoxin.

410
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,040
Did you stay up all night drawing?

411
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,160
He did most of it.

412
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Qi Xiao said that you're stressed out,

413
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,160
so you can't sleep.

414
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,760
He thought that

415
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,360
this is the best place for you to rest.

416
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,840
So he went to talk to the director.

417
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,040
In exchange,

418
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,760
we need to finish
this painting in one night.

419
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
But he really did it.

420
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Thank you, Su Yang.

421
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,480
Save your thanks for him.

422
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,960
I'll go get changed first.

423
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,240
I have to go to work.

424
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,600
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

425
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,920
Do I look that good?

426
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,480
Who's looking at you?

427
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,040
I haven't seen the sunrise
in the city for a while.

428
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,520
In a city like Shanghai,

429
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,520
early morning before sunrise

430
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,240
is the quietest time.

431
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
I remember that

432
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,800
when the science center was opened,

433
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,840
our school took us here to visit.

434
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,280
But at that time,

435
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,280
I didn't do well on the mock exam

436
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,280
so my mom punished me.

437
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
I couldn't come.

438
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,760
The next day at school,

439
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,200
everyone was talking about it.

440
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,000
They talked about how cool

441
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,240
the science center was.

442
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,840
I was so upset.

443
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,040
Later on, my dad took me here secretly

444
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,320
when my mom was working.

445
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,520
I was so happy.

446
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,600
I still remember

447
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,040
just how happy I was.

448
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
It's totally different

449
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,480
from before, right?

450
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,960
Since my parents' divorce,

451
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,400
I've never been here.

452
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,000
If you want to,

453
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,360
I can come with you.

454
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,000
Thank you.

455
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,280
Last night,

456
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,520
I slept well.

457
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,480
Isn't it better than melatonin?

458
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
You barely slept last night.

459
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,320
Can your body take it?

460
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm young.

461
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,840
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

462
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,960
Your pulse is better now.

463
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,320
What did you think I was doing?

464
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Qi Xiao, stop right there!

465
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,880
- Come and get me.
- Don't run!

466
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,920
- Where are you going?
- Stop right there.

467
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,320
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

468
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,320
I'll catch you.

469
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,000
- Don't run!
- Come get me!

470
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,480
You can't hit me.

471
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,720
- Don't run!
- Come and get me!

472
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
You're too short.

473
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,680
You…

474
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,280
Stop right there.

475
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Come back here.

476
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,960
Stop right there.

477
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,680
Are you okay, Ruoxin?

478
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,640
I'm fine.

479
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,640
- You look pretty.
- Why are you so vengeful?

480
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,920
Forget it. I almost forgot.

481
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,520
You shouldn't be running.

482
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,000
It's good to run in the morning.

483
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,400
The air is so fresh.

484
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,360
It's so refreshing.

485
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,440
Let's go to the school after breakfast.

486
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,760
All right, let's go

487
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,480
and have breakfast near the school.

488
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,600
Relive school life.

489
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,000
Come on.

490
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,760
There you are.

491
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,360
I'll take it for you. Why do it yourself?

492
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,120
Here.

493
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
Come here.

494
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,159
Come here.

495
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
That's right. I'll start counting.

496
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,920
One, two, three.

497
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,320
My goodness, look.

498
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,760
Stylish. Don't you look like a movie star?

499
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,920
I think

500
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,520
you're seeing things.

501
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,880
- You look great.
- Your turn.

502
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,800
Okay.

503
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,040
Give me a shout too.

504
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,600
- Is the filter on?
- It is.

505
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,800
Three, two, three.

506
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,120
Look.

507
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,360
An 18-year-old girl.

508
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,120
That's nice.

509
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,159
Not as good as you.

510
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,639
How about a selfie?

511
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,160
Come on.

512
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,360
On three.

513
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,600
One, two, three.

514
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,960
Mr. and Mrs. Tong, watch your step.

515
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,920
Well,

516
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
you know what they say,

517
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,280
"A good piece of jade
will better your life."

518
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,120
Jade is always said to keep you safe.

519
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
Feel free to look around.

520
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,160
Ma'am, you're light-skinned.

521
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
This one suits you.

522
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Good.

523
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
It's nice,

524
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,560
but I've already bought one.

525
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,520
Ma'am, look.

526
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,520
It brings good luck.

527
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,240
They're all different.

528
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,200
You can buy more to match your outfit.

529
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,240
Don't be too trendy.

530
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,200
By the way,

531
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,640
you can buy a few more

532
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,040
for relatives and friends.

533
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,240
You didn't come to Jiangnan for nothing.

534
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,640
What?

535
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
Is it for nothing

536
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
if we don't buy anything?

537
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,280
We got some fresh air

538
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,640
and enjoyed the view.

539
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,560
I don't think we wasted our time here.

540
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,240
So what did you mean?

541
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,840
Ma'am, look.

542
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Our package covers

543
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
three days of meals and hotels,

544
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
but we only charged you a little.

545
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
It's obvious, isn't it?

546
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Shopping is essential for a tour group.

547
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,920
You should understand.

548
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,920
Why should I?

549
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,720
When you were selling it to us,

550
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,080
you told us it was for the tour.

551
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,240
Nowadays,

552
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
people record everything with cell phones.

553
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,160
Aren't you afraid that we'll sue you?

554
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,640
All right.

555
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,840
If you don't want to buy it,
just leave it.

556
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,240
Why are you so serious?

557
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,880
There's no need to be so serious.

558
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,040
How about this, ma'am?

559
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,160
If you don't like it,

560
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,960
you can go back to the bus.

561
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,200
I want to sit on the bus,

562
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,600
but the AC is off.

563
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,600
Won't I look like a fool?

564
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,360
Then I am

565
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,880
really sorry, ma'am.

566
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
I can't turn on the AC for one person.

567
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
How about this?

568
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,280
I'll wait with you on the bus.

569
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,000
Is it enough to turn on the AC?

570
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,520
Excuse me, ladies.

571
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,120
Let me make myself clear.

572
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,440
If you don't like shopping,

573
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,680
you can wait on the bus,

574
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,520
but don't talk to me about the AC.

575
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,000
If you don't like the bus,

576
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,560
then be quiet here.

577
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,920
Take a look inside.

578
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,840
Hello, everyone.

579
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
If you like something, just buy it.

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,440
Get a cheap one.

581
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,080
It's a trip after all.

582
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,400
Don't be stingy like a miser.

583
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
It's not fun at all.

584
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,600
Who's a miser?

585
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,440
I can bring charges against you now.

586
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,600
Let me tell you, don't bully old people.

587
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,640
One day, you'll grow old too.

588
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,040
You have parents too, right?

589
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,440
Did I bully you?

590
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,600
I didn't bully you!

591
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,520
Did I ask you to buy anything?

592
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
Haven't I already told you?

593
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
If you don't want it,
you can sit on the bus.

594
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
When did I force you to buy things?

595
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,360
You called me a bully

596
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,040
and even threatened to sue me!

597
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,040
Don't be unreasonable, young lady!

598
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,520
You are bullying her!

599
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,480
You said that
the AC will be turned on all the way

600
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,480
and now, you said you can't turn it on?

601
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,440
Right, guys?

602
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,360
- You made us buy so many things.
- That's right.

603
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,960
Fine! Is it fun
to talk about this right now?

604
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,960
Enough!

605
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
If you want to go, just wait on the bus.

606
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,440
I'll ask the driver
to turn on the AC, okay?

607
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,640
That's more like it!

608
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,120
Call the driver right now!

609
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,160
Let's go.

610
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,720
Hello, everyone.

611
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,720
<i>Yilan.</i>

612
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,960
You were amazing today.

613
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,920
What you said really shut the guide up.

614
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I would've spent a lot of money otherwise.

615
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
Try this.

616
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,760
Thank you.

617
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,320
It's not about money.

618
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,880
If she told us this was a shopping tour,

619
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,320
then I have nothing to say.

620
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
We had a deal.

621
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,160
We're supposed to be on a tour.

622
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,600
Look where she took us.

623
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,040
We'll have to complain.

624
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,240
I teach calligraphy
at a University for Seniors.

625
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
My students,

626
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,680
they've traveled all over the world.

627
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,280
I was told that actually,

628
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,240
it's the same everywhere.

629
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,520
You have to learn

630
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,760
to argue with the tour guides.

631
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,160
Yilan, you teach calligraphy
at a University for Seniors?

632
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,400
Before I retired,

633
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
I taught English in high school.

634
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
Teaching English?

635
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,360
You're talented.

636
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
I admire you.

637
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,200
- Admire me?
- Yes.

638
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,440
I'm old.

639
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,400
People don't like me.

640
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,840
At home,

641
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,760
my child doesn't listen to me.

642
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,160
So I have to get out.

643
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
Why?

644
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,640
I don't think you bother me.

645
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,760
Why?

646
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,120
It's because
my daughter isn't getting married.

647
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm worried for her.

648
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,040
Because of that?

649
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,040
Kids are stressed out
about work these days.

650
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,680
Let's not pressure them

651
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,200
about their personal lives anymore.

652
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,640
But there are some things you have to say.

653
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
One wrong thing leads to another.

654
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
If they're wrong now,

655
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,400
after they realize it,

656
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,200
they'll still blame you.

657
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,120
Take me for an example.

658
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,560
When I was young,

659
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,160
I went to the countryside.

660
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,360
I met my first love.

661
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,360
We were so close.

662
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I would die for him.

663
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,720
But my family didn't approve.

664
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,120
They're afraid that if we get married,

665
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,000
I won't come back to Shanghai.

666
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,120
I listened to my family

667
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,680
and I broke up with him.

668
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,920
Now that I think about it…

669
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,000
I did the right thing.

670
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,080
Otherwise, I really don't know

671
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,760
where I would end up in.

672
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,320
The truth is, when I was young,

673
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,560
I fought with my family too

674
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,760
because of marriage.

675
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm from Sichuan…

676
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,400
I'm from Sichuan.

677
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,840
I was at home

678
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
and I met a boy from Shanghai.

679
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,360
He came to my hometown from Shanghai.

680
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,600
He later became my husband.

681
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,760
He told my parents

682
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,880
that he would marry me
and he would take me to Shanghai.

683
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,720
How would they allow it?

684
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,200
I'm their only child.

685
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,120
They said no. They told me,

686
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,360
"Don't go to Shanghai.

687
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,520
It's too far from home.

688
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,240
What if you get conned?

689
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,000
What if you don't like it?

690
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
You'll be all by yourself.

691
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,040
Don't go."

692
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,520
They just wouldn't allow it.

693
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,640
They were worried.

694
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,760
But I…

695
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,680
I don't…

696
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,360
I knew my husband was the one.

697
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,520
I had to go with him.

698
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,520
So I married my husband

699
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,040
and went to Shanghai with him.

700
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
You know what?

701
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,720
My husband was a really good person.

702
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,360
You know what?

703
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,280
He didn't think I was an outsider,

704
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,840
just because I grew up

705
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,240
far away from Shanghai.

706
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
He treated me well.

707
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,240
No.

708
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,360
On the contrary,
he's especially nice to me.

709
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,080
Do you know?

710
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,720
He did all the housework.

711
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,160
He did all
the grocery shopping and cooking.

712
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,880
He never let me do it.

713
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,880
Although we're not that well-off,

714
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,000
even now, I still feel

715
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,000
that marrying him

716
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,880
was the right choice.

717
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,720
I knew it from your accent.

718
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,720
You're not from Shanghai.

719
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,960
I am just too stupid.

720
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,560
I still can't learn your Shanghai dialect.

721
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,080
But I did speak the Shanghai dialect once.

722
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,240
It was when my husband

723
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,920
was dying of a heart attack.

724
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,760
I spoke to him in the Shanghai dialect.

725
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,320
"I…"

726
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,760
"I like you…"

727
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,000
"I like you very much."

728
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,600
Shanghai men love that expression.

729
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,520
Yes, I told him,

730
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,800
"I like you very much."

731
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,080
He was so happy.

732
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,800
So happy.

733
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,240
You two must be very close.

734
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,200
So that's why

735
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,120
I want my son

736
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,080
to find someone he likes.

737
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,240
That way, he'll be happy, right?

738
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,640
As parents,

739
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,480
we all want
our children to be well, don't we?

740
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,520
But their happiness,

741
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,000
their well-being.

742
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,840
It's their own life.

743
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,240
They know best, right?

744
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,600
You're pretty open-minded as a mom.

745
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,200
Not really.

746
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,440
I'm just optimistic

747
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,640
about this one thing.

748
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,040
I've thought it through.

749
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,680
The thing is, about happiness,

750
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,960
it's more like,

751
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,560
it's called,

752
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,960
"When drinking water, everyone feels
different about the temperature."

753
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,640
Your own feelings

754
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,560
are what matters the most.
