1
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,840
Mr. Xu.

2
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,160
For our new energy vehicle,

3
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,120
as soon as the news got out,

4
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
we've been getting so many calls
from advertisement companies.

5
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,320
Some of them have worked with us
for many years.

6
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
And there are some new companies.

7
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,600
They all want to tender for it.

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
I've expected that.

9
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,520
The dinner that we are going to now

10
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,240
will be held by an advertising agency.

11
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,880
I've turned them down a few times.

12
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,440
They didn't give up.

13
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,240
They knew that I'm now in Shanghai

14
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,360
and wanted to talk and catch up.

15
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
I couldn't say no.

16
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,240
But I'm afraid they're up to something.

17
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,720
We can't let them make the first move.

18
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
I got it.

19
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,880
Let me introduce you, Mr. Luo.

20
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,520
This is Ms. Shen Ruoxin.

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,160
She's in charge of the tender.

22
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,920
- Hello, Ms. Shen.
- Hello.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
It's nice to meet you.

24
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,560
You too.

25
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Mr. Sun, look.

26
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
Isn't Ms. Shen very beautiful?

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,280
- She's very beautiful.
- She looks familiar.

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Doesn't she look like a celebrity?

29
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,880
If so, we don't need to hire anyone

30
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
for our advertisement.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Ms. Shen is already perfect.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,120
That's convenient.

33
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
- Mr. Xu.
- Yes?

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Ms. Shen.

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
I would like to make a toast.

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,720
I'm so happy today. I really am.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm flattered.

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,480
How many years has it been?

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,440
You came over with just one call.

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
Ms. Shen.

41
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
You have no idea.

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,240
We used to be on the same team.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,400
While many people
have gotten condescending,

44
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,240
Mr. Xu is still the same.

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,640
He's so nice and kind.

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,080
I have no idea

47
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,680
that he appreciates
our old friendship so much.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

49
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,320
You and I go way back.

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,920
I won't forget that.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,480
I'll be there whenever you call.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,120
- Yes.
- However,

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,640
friendship is friendship.

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
Business is business.

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
I understand.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,680
It's the rule, right?

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,160
We are only talking
about friendship today.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,920
Let's not talk business. Cheers.

59
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,320
Mr. Xu.

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,480
Ms. Shen.

61
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,680
I hope I won't make a fool of myself

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
by telling you my opinion.

63
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,960
I believe that in the future,

64
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,160
new energy cars will own the market.

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,200
In terms of performance,
a lot of new energy cars

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
have already surpassed gasoline cars.

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
You guys are experts.
You should know, right?

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,760
There are many old-fashioned

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,080
European companies.

70
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,240
They used to say

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,480
that they'll never make
new energy vehicles.

72
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,240
They wanted to keep up the tradition.

73
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,320
And now?

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
They are all doing it.

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,720
They are developing
new energy cars, right?

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
That's the trend.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,040
You guys are far ahead.

78
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Your success is coming. Congratulations.

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
Here.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
Hello.

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,280
May I know who is the owner of the car
with license plate D17910?

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,200
That's our car. What's the matter?

83
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,720
You are blocking the exit.
Please move your car.

84
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
Okay, I'll call the driver.

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Is everything okay?

86
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,760
Yes.

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,920
Mr. Luo, I'm sorry.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,880
I need to go to the bathroom.

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,920
Take your time.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Go ahead.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,800
Mr. Xu.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,480
Open up. My arms are getting tired.

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Sir, please don't make it hard for me.

94
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,000
Without Mr. Xu's permission,

95
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,920
I really can't let you put them
in the car.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Didn't Mr. Xu just call you?

97
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,080
He did call me

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,400
to move the car.

99
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,920
But he didn't mention this.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,280
Hey, sir.

101
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
This is Mr. Xu's arrangement.

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,920
He asked me to put these in the car.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,160
- Come on.
- What did Mr. Xu ask you to do?

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
These are from Mr. Luo.

105
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,600
Just some gifts for Mr. Xu.

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,960
That's all.

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
We really appreciate it,

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,120
but we can't accept them.

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,440
I've already brought it.

111
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,880
I can't just carry them back.

112
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,320
Just tell Mr. Luo.

113
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
This was what Mr. Xu wanted.

114
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,360
Mr. Luo will know what it means.

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,480
Mr. Xu.

117
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,800
It's done. Don't worry.

118
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,880
Mr. Xu.

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,880
The gifts were too expensive.

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
It's not appropriate,

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,440
so I turned him down for you.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Good job.

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,120
You handled it well.

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,560
Because of what happened tonight,

125
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm more determined to hold a tender.

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,680
Many of our old partners

127
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,960
never focus on

128
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
their professional skills.

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,000
Instead,

130
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,440
all they care about

131
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,080
is how to build relationships.

132
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
We are in a new industry.

133
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
It's tough to start things up.

134
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,120
That's why we need strong allies.

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,800
That's right.

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,000
Hey, Ruoxin.

137
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,160
Do you have plans for tomorrow night?

138
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
Is there anything, Mr. Xu?

139
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,880
There's a private party tomorrow night.

140
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
It's a very important one.

141
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,520
The invitation says you must bring a date.

142
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,200
But I just arrived in Shanghai.

143
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know anyone

144
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,640
who can come with me.

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,840
But I have to attend it.

146
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,320
This is a personal favor.

147
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,840
It's not about work.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,120
You can say no,

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,120
but I hope you can

150
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,920
come with me.

151
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,080
Mr. Xu.

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,320
This is…

153
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,080
I don't think
it's appropriate for me to go.

154
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,920
Relax.

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,040
This private party

156
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,600
is not completely unrelated to work.

157
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,680
It's because there will be
technology experts at the party.

158
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
Our department is relatively new.

159
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,960
We still need to find some experts.

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
Please reconsider.

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,440
Okay then.

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Thank you.

163
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
You are too kind.

164
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,600
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

166
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,480
Ruoxin.

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
What's the occasion?

168
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,480
What do you mean?

169
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,680
It's not a special day.

170
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,280
Why are you so dressed up?

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,080
Keep it down.

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,360
Mr. Xu asked me to go to a party

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
with him tonight.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
Dinner last night

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,080
and a party today?

176
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
No, I'm coming too.

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,840
I would like to see
if he's up to something.

178
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,640
Don't cause trouble.

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,320
We met with an advertiser last night.

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
At tonight's party,

181
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,560
we are meeting
potential new energy partners.

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
It's business.

183
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,360
And I'm your assistant.

184
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
If I go, it's also for work.

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,840
I've only heard of bringing a female date.

186
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,560
I've never heard of male dates.

187
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
If you really want to go,

188
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll ask Mr. Xu

189
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,040
that I'm not going.

190
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,880
You'll take my place.

191
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,040
Never mind.

192
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,600
If you tell him that,

193
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,040
I don't think I'll ever pass
the probation period.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
Take my car.

195
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
I'll take Mr. Xu's car today.

196
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,880
Tomorrow morning,

197
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,240
I'll drive you to work.

198
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,160
Ziyan.

199
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
You are here.

200
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,680
Xiaoxin.

201
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,960
Mom!

202
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,920
My baby!

203
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,240
You're different when you see your mom.

204
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,720
Did you miss me?

205
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,680
Yes.

206
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,880
You did?

207
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
Good boy, pack up your things.

208
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
- Okay.
- Let's go home.

209
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,840
Go.

210
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,520
Did you just wake up?

211
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm really tired.

212
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,840
Your son is incredible.

213
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
He's indeed quite a troublemaker.

214
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,080
But it's because you are inexperienced.

215
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,120
You are just not ready to do this.

216
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,760
When you have a baby,

217
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
you'll get used to it.

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,280
I really can't imagine

219
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
what your everyday life is like.

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,120
Just go with it.

221
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,320
I go to work

222
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
and take care of him.

223
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm not like you.

224
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,120
My brother treats you so well.

225
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Tell me.

226
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
Are you happy having a child?

227
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,000
Miserable and happy.

228
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,920
It can be tough.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
But every time Xiaoxin kisses me

230
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,200
or gets clingy,

231
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,360
I will think that it's all worth it.

232
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Ziyan.

233
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,320
I know you and my brother
decided not to have kids.

234
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,000
But once a woman gets to a certain age,

235
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,400
maternity becomes a natural instinct.

236
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,200
If you have a child,

237
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,760
you'll think differently.

238
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Okay, I'll think about it.

239
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
Are you done packing?

240
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,480
Yes, I am.

241
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
Give your aunt a hug and a kiss.

242
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,760
That's better.

243
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,080
You have me in your eyes.

244
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,400
I have you in my eyes?

245
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,440
That's right.

246
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,360
Do you have me in your eyes, Mom?

247
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
In my eyes,

248
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,880
you are always there.

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
Not just in my eyes,

250
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,560
also in here,

251
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,480
you are everywhere.

252
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,800
Mr. Xu.

253
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,520
Let's go to the store
I visited previously.

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
Okay.

255
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
It's a limited edition.

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,040
There's only one in each size.

257
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,240
I think this is your size.

258
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
- Let her try it on.
- Okay.

259
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,080
- And give her a belt.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
This way, miss.

261
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,000
Miss, the gentleman outside
has already paid for this dress.

262
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,440
Does it fit you?

263
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,160
Do you want to try another size?

264
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,600
There's no need.

265
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,640
Did you just leave it on?

266
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,960
There's a pair of scissors in there.

267
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,840
You can cut the tag.

268
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Thank you.

269
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,160
Mr. Xu.

270
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,640
It looks good on you.

271
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll wrap up your clothes.
Please wait a moment.

272
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,280
It looks good on you.

273
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,720
It's like it's custom-made.

274
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,120
I picked well.

275
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
But Mr. Xu,

276
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,960
this is too expensive.

277
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,320
Do me a favor.

278
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,640
There's no jewelry.

279
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,840
So you actually saved me the money.

280
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,640
Miss, here are your clothes.

281
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,360
- Give it to me.
- Yes, sir.

282
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,040
My baby.

283
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,480
Let's eat out this evening.

284
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,119
I want to have Japanese food.

285
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Okay.

286
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll pick you up later.

287
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
- Bye.
- You have a son?

288
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,040
How old is your child?

289
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,079
Eight years old.

290
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm almost 40 years old.

291
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,760
My goodness.

292
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,680
I can't tell.

293
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,560
You had a baby at 32?

294
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,440
I was a little too old.

295
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,200
But it went really well.

296
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,520
Look at me.

297
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
I recovered pretty well.

298
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,640
Just keep exercising regularly.

299
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,240
Do you take care of him yourself?

300
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,120
I'll do it when I'm home.

301
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,280
I'll get a babysitter if I can't.

302
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,040
After all, men won't help.

303
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,200
People always say,

304
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
"A reliable husband
makes the child a diamond.

305
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,120
An unreliable husband

306
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
makes the child a burden."

307
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,120
That's nonsense.

308
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,720
The husband has nothing to do
with the child.

309
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,920
Our husbands could be someone else's too.

310
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,640
But the child is ours.

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,880
I raise my own child.

312
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
No one can take him away.

313
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,960
Yes, let's do one more set.

314
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,320
- Okay.
- Hurry up.

315
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
Okay.

316
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,080
Mr. Xu, you are late.

317
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,160
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,840
I was held up at work.

319
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,360
It has been a while, Robin.

320
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,040
Are Michael and the others here?

321
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,040
They are all over there.

322
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
They're waiting for you.
Don't you want to talk to them?

323
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,560
Okay, I'll be right there.

324
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
Okay.

325
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,440
Thank you.

326
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,920
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

327
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,920
I'll go over and say hello.

328
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,920
Have some champagne.

329
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,440
Relax.

330
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
Michael, it has been so long.

331
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,640
Leo.

332
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,480
- Hello.
- We have been waiting for you.

333
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,760
That's quite fast.

334
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,320
It has only been a week.

335
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,760
Do you have a new girlfriend?

336
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,920
This one is quite classy.

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,800
She's a lot better than those
who have had plastic surgeries.

338
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,160
I've never dated anyone

339
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,960
who had plastic surgeries.

340
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,600
She's my subordinate.

341
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,880
- Hi, Minjie.
- Hi, it has been a while.

342
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,240
You are finally in Shanghai.

343
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,680
We are just talking about it.

344
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,920
Wherever he goes,

345
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,200
he can always find a pretty and competent

346
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,240
female subordinate.

347
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Did you bring Lisa?

348
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,640
It's not Lisa.

349
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Over there.

350
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
Not bad.

351
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,160
She might be better than Lisa.

352
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
Aren't you going to ask Lisa

353
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
to come to Shanghai?

354
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm considering it.

355
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
Cheers.

356
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,920
Hello.

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,040
Hello.

358
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm Mandy.

359
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
Did Minjie bring you here?

360
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
Are you his girlfriend?

361
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,080
No, he's my boss.

362
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
You look nice.

363
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
What's your expertise?

364
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,360
I studied law.

365
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Which school did you go to?

366
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Peking University, China University
of Political Science and Law,

367
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,080
Fudan University, or East China University
of Political Science and Law?

368
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,280
None of those.

369
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,200
Mandy went to Princeton University.

370
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,240
She has a master's degree in literature.

371
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,560
Look over there.

372
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,840
The one in the champagne-colored dress.

373
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,720
She went to the University of Melbourne.

374
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,760
She studied art and music.

375
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,320
She's really good at playing the cello.

376
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,600
In our social circle,

377
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,080
one's background is important.

378
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,680
I remember Xu Minjie studied MBA
at Columbia University.

379
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,160
I'm not part of this circle.

380
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,760
Isn't that a limited-edition Hermes?

381
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,760
I didn't get one in France last time.

382
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,600
Whose date is that?

383
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,640
Do you know how expensive this dress is?

386
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,400
Where's your manager? Go and get him.

387
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
No, go and get the manager.

389
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,760
I…

390
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,320
Hello, what's going on?

391
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,000
- You are the manager, right?
- Yes.

392
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,600
Look what your waitress did.

393
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,600
She spilled wine on me!

394
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,240
Do you know my dress is custom-made?

395
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
What should we do about this?

396
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,560
That's not it, sir.

397
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,800
She bumped into me and it fell on her.

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,600
What did you say?

399
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,560
Don't push the blame on me!

400
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,600
What a waitress.

401
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,800
How can she even work here?

402
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
- Sir, I really didn't--
- That's enough. Stop it.

403
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,840
Miss.

404
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,200
I'm really sorry
about what happened earlier.

405
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,760
How about this?

406
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,400
We'll pay for the dry cleaning.

407
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,400
Is that okay?

408
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,040
The dry-cleaning bill?

409
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,640
Can you dry-clean this?

410
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,520
This is imported material!

411
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Mandy, come.

412
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,280
What?

413
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,320
Wine stains are very common.

414
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,360
The dry cleaners can take care of it.

415
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
If you keep doing this,

416
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,240
you'll make the situation more awkward.

417
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,200
I happen to have a scarf here.

418
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,080
I'll wrap this around you.

419
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,040
Look, it's covered.

420
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,800
Isn't that good?

421
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,320
Enjoy the evening.

422
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,560
You haven't said a word all evening.

423
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,000
Are you tired?

424
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,840
It's okay.

425
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,240
But I kept smiling earlier.

426
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,400
My cheeks are tired.

427
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,400
It's my first time hearing
such honest feelings.

428
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,200
Actually, these kinds of events

429
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
can't be avoided.

430
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
But don't take them too seriously.

431
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,480
Just relax.

432
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
Let's go.

433
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,440
You're taking out the trash?

434
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,760
Yes.

435
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,720
Wait.

436
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,440
Why did you change clothes?

437
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,680
He didn't like the one I wore.

438
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
So I changed.

439
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,560
What are you doing? Go now.

440
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,680
I'll wait.

441
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm on it.

442
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,920
Ruoxin.

443
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,720
What kind of party did you go to?

444
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,320
You are all dressed up.

445
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,600
It was so boring.

446
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
They spent so much money,

447
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,560
went to nice universities,

448
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
got high degrees and diplomas,

449
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,840
just to be a pretty face at a party.

450
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,280
They talked about bags

451
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
and people's clothes.

452
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,760
I don't understand them.

453
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,760
What are you doing? This is your floor.

454
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,480
Get some rest.

455
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,720
You too.

456
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,680
Good night.

457
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Why did that take you an hour?

458
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,240
Wait.

459
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,280
Were you taking out the trash
or waiting for someone?

460
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,600
Do you want some?

461
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,360
It was fine this morning.

462
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,520
She had to go to this party

463
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,440
and was purposely given a dress for it.

464
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Are you serious?

465
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,080
Do you mean Ruoxin?

466
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,720
I think

467
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,680
that must be from Mr. Xu.

468
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,480
The party was an excuse
to give her a dress.

469
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,280
Isn't this common in dramas?

470
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,760
Why do you think he bought her that dress?

471
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
Why do you think?

472
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
He's pursuing Ruoxin.

473
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,160
He's not her type.

474
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,320
How do you know?

475
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,520
What type is he?

476
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,480
It's just impossible.

477
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,600
Do you like her too?

478
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,160
What are you saying?

479
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,520
Ruoxin is my boss.

480
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,360
And she's nice to me.

481
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,160
She taught me a lot.

482
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,880
Can't I be concerned about her?

483
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,480
That's the best.

484
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
She's much older than you.

485
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,000
You are not a good match.

486
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,280
Why do you always make it weird?

487
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,040
You are the weird one.

488
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,480
<i>You look great.</i>

489
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>You look really great.</i>

490
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,160
<i>But you will be upset</i>

491
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,600
<i>if I keep you in my closet.</i>

492
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,320
<i>But if I hang you here,</i>

493
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,960
<i>you'll be in my way.</i>

494
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,920
TOTAL LUNAR ELLIPSE

495
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

496
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,840
You look better like this.

497
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,960
What?

498
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
Do I not look good in better clothes?

499
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,080
You are still pretty,
but a little too pretty.

500
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,360
It looks too unreal.

501
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Yes.

502
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,880
Wearing them was tiring.

503
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,280
SHEN RUOXIN

504
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,200
<i>Mr. Xu.</i>

505
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,160
<i>I returned that dress.</i>

506
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,480
<i>The money will be returned
to your credit card.</i>

507
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,760
<i>Please check.</i>

508
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
PRECAUTIONS FOR PREGNANT WOMEN
OF ADVANCED AGE

509
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
Honey.

510
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
Let me make a copy.

511
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,920
Sure.

512
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,800
WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO
IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES

513
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,760
Honey.

514
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,320
What?

515
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,000
Are you tempted?

516
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,960
Tempted?

517
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,280
To have children!

518
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm still thinking about it.

519
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,040
I heard that

520
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,320
a reliable husband

521
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,720
makes the baby a diamond.

522
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
An unreliable husband

523
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,000
makes the baby a burden.

524
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,920
Look at you.

525
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,960
You didn't help when Xiaoxin was here.

526
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,880
Why should I bother having a child?

527
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,080
If it was my own child,

528
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,520
I'd help you at all costs.

529
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
I'll do whatever you ask.

530
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,880
Honey.

531
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,440
I've been doing some research
about having children.

532
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,440
It's better to do a full prenatal checkup.

533
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,200
It's safer for you.

534
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,800
As for the hospital,

535
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,760
it would be better
to visit a maternity hospital.

536
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,520
You've planned this long ago, haven't you?

537
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,760
Look at you.

538
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,560
You are always up to something.

539
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
That's too much of an accusation.

540
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,640
Before this,

541
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,160
I didn't say a word about it.

542
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,520
I just saw

543
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,280
that you were looking into it today.

544
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
That's why I'm telling you this.

545
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,920
I've looked it up in advance,

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,320
so you don't have to worry.

547
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,280
HONORABLE AUTHORS,
COME AND HAVE A LOOK

548
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,280
Sijia, let's eat.

549
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,480
Ms. Qiao, I'll eat here.

550
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,440
SU YANG

551
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
<i>These are some good positions.</i>

552
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,800
<i>You should try to contact them.</i>

553
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
<i>I got it. Thank you.</i>

554
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,320
Ms. Shen.

555
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,160
Tomorrow is the monthly inventory.

556
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,920
It's your turn and Qi Xiao's.

557
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
Here's the inventory list.

558
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
Okay. Thank you.

559
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,720
A day off?

560
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,560
I was just informed by Mr. Xu.

561
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,960
I was wondering,
for this month's inventory,

562
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,640
can I switch it with someone else?

563
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,040
I'll do it in the next round.

564
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,120
As it's Mr. Xu's directive,

565
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,560
I dare not refuse.

566
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
Otherwise,

567
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,840
I'll be deemed disobedient.

568
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,640
I can't let that happen, can I?

569
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
But about the shift change,

570
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,160
I can't help you.

571
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,880
You are on your own.

572
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,480
If someone is willing to switch with you,

573
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm okay with it.

574
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,840
Ms. Shen, I said no.

575
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,280
My kid is sick.

576
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,040
I can't work overtime.

577
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,760
Okay.

578
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
Xiaoxuan, are you busy?

579
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,760
Can you swap shifts with me?

580
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,239
Ms. Shen.

581
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,199
I'm actually sick now.

582
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,800
Look at the medicine I just took.

583
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,040
I want to go home early and rest.

584
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,960
Okay.

585
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,280
Ruoxin.

586
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,800
Why are you changing shifts?

587
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,000
Are you busy tomorrow?

588
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,400
I have to book a flight

589
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
and go on a business trip with Mr. Xu.

590
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,320
You can't do it without me.

591
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,640
It's too much work.

592
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,960
A business trip?

593
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,960
Why would he take you with him?

594
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,480
You are not even his secretary.

595
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,600
That's the issue. He has no secretary.

596
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,440
He's still looking for one.

597
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,920
I think he needs me

598
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,560
to handle some contracts for him

599
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,840
on this trip.

600
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,560
Why didn't he ask
for a legal officer then?

601
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,560
Are you stupid?

602
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,080
Aren't I a legal officer?

603
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,120
Do you want to stay here,

604
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,160
at the Administration Department forever?

605
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,240
Did you tell him you want to go back?

606
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,520
Now is not the time.

607
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,400
When is the right time then?

608
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,440
It's useless to rush things.

609
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,120
We have to get things done first

610
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,880
before we negotiate.

611
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,840
Do you understand?

612
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
All right.

613
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,480
If they don't want to switch,
don't bother asking them.

614
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,000
I can do it alone.

615
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,360
Will you be able to finish?

616
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,560
What else can I do?

617
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I'll have to try.

618
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,560
I'll leave it to you then.

619
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,960
Honey, stop it.

620
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,760
The line at the hospital will be long.

621
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Are you afraid you'll be late for work?

622
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,440
Go and get changed.

623
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
I'll clean this up.

624
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,080
Go on.

625
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,560
Hello?

626
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,360
I'm not at the office.

627
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,520
I took the morning off.

628
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,080
Wasn't it fine yesterday?

629
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,880
How could this happen?

630
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,000
Where's Mr. He?

631
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,720
Okay.

632
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
Keep him there.

633
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,400
I'll be right there.

634
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,400
Don't bother.

635
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,440
I'll join you as soon as I'm done.

636
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,960
"Done"?

637
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,360
Will you ever be done with your business?

638
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,280
My wife has the biggest heart
and is really considerate.

639
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,520
I'll call you a cab.

640
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,960
When you are done,

641
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
text me, okay?

642
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,760
Go.

643
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,000
OUTPATIENT

644
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,440
Why is it so high?

645
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,080
It's your fault.

646
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,760
You wanted me to have children.

647
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,360
I was quite healthy.

648
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,320
Now, out of nowhere, I'm diabetic.

649
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,440
We are married.

650
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,480
We have to have children.

651
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,280
Otherwise, your in-laws

652
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,240
and your husband

653
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,640
will have second thoughts.

654
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,880
Let them think as they like. It's fine.

655
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,480
While they're smiling at my belly,

656
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,840
I have to take this needle

657
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,560
and poke my fingers every day.

658
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
I can't eat what I want.

659
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,080
And the doctor said

660
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,000
that even after giving birth,

661
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,560
this gestational diabetes

662
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,400
might go on for the rest of my life.

663
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,160
I can't even have cakes in the future.

664
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,920
All right, stop crying.

665
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,560
Number 25, Song Ziyan.

666
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,120
BLOOD TEST REPORT

667
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,480
ULTRASONOGRAPHY REPORT

668
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,480
Doctor, is there a problem?

669
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,120
You need two more tests.

670
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,720
And the six hormone tests

671
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,720
have to be taken
on the second day of your period,

672
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
or the third morning
with an empty stomach,

673
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
along with thyroid function tests.

674
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,480
That's a lot.

675
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,280
I saw someone only did a few things.

676
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
It didn't take long.

677
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,840
You are 34 years old.

678
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,440
She's only 27 years old.
She's still young.

679
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,840
You have six more
routine inspections than her.

680
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,840
That's why.

681
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,080
I'm only a few years older.

682
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,440
What's the difference?

683
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,800
As women get older,

684
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,520
the ovaries start to degenerate.

685
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,080
We won't be as able-bodied
as young people are.

686
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,360
It's likely to have high blood pressure

687
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,000
or even diabetes too.

688
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,280
That's why older women

689
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,880
have to do so many tests.

690
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,040
MOM

691
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,400
LIKE

692
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,160
<i>Mom.</i>

693
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,840
<i>I'm on a business trip with my boss
to Chengdu this week.</i>

694
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,960
<i>When I get back next weekend,
I'll come to visit you.</i>

695
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,000
<i>It seems like your calligraphy class
is full again, right?</i>

696
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,680
Hey, what's wrong?

697
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,280
I need to talk to someone.

698
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,240
Do you have time?

699
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
I'm at the airport for a business trip.

700
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,200
I'm waiting for my flight.

701
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,800
I'm at the hospital.

702
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,120
I just did my prenatal tests.

703
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,240
I'm very upset now.

704
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,680
What happened?

705
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,640
Have you really decided to have a baby?

706
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,040
<i>No, not yet.</i>

707
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,520
I was hoping to get a doctor's opinion,

708
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
but she ended up giving me a lesson.

709
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,760
<i>Listen, Ruoxin.</i>

710
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,360
I met so many women
of advanced maternal age.

711
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,160
They have diabetes,

712
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,560
high blood pressure,

713
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,520
miscarriage problems,

714
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
or infertility.

715
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,720
I'm so frustrated.

716
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,200
I have no idea.

717
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
Listen, Song Ziyan. I'll repeat myself.

718
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,160
Don't listen to Zou Cheng

719
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,120
or other people around you.

720
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,880
Having a baby is a big deal.

721
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,440
If you give birth to a child,

722
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,720
you'll be responsible

723
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,080
for the baby and yourself.

724
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,600
Which path do you want to take?

725
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,880
It's your decision.

726
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,400
I know.

727
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,000
Whatever decision you make,

728
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,120
I'll support you.

729
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm sure Zou Cheng will too.

730
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,800
Ruoxin.

731
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,480
Thank you.

732
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,280
That's enough. You can go now.

733
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm hanging up.

734
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,600
Don't think too much. Bye.

735
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

736
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,320
It's my close friend.

737
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,360
It's okay.

738
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,600
Your friend is lucky

739
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,400
to have you as a friend.

740
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,040
Mr. Xu.

741
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,960
Would you like a window seat
or aisle seat?

742
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,920
Anything is fine.

743
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,400
Okay.

744
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,320
Hello.

745
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
One first-class seat.

746
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,880
Arrange a quiet seat for me.

747
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,000
- Yes. Just a second.
- Okay, thank you.

748
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,520
- Here.
- Thank you. Mr. Xu.

749
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,800
Excuse me, I'm in economy class.

750
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,600
Can I check in here? We are together.

751
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,760
Yes. It's fine.

752
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,720
Hello, miss.

753
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,640
It says here

754
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,240
that yours was paid for

755
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,720
and promoted to first-class.

756
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,840
Shall I put your seats next to each other?

757
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,800
Are you sure?

758
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,080
Arrange for us to sit together.

759
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,680
It's a trip.

760
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,440
Treat yourself on a business trip.

761
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,680
I upgraded your seat.

762
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,000
We are having a meeting
as soon as we land.

763
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,320
We have things to discuss.

764
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,760
It's easier if we sit together.

765
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,640
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

766
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,440
Here's the boarding pass.

767
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,440
Thank you.

768
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,720
Hello.

769
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,440
This is your assistant who stayed behind.

770
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,400
What is it?

771
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,920
<i>There's a problem with the inventory.</i>

772
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,120
At the Sales Department,

773
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,920
some computers are missing.

774
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,320
Their person in charge
took the monthly inventory.

775
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,720
They don't admit taking them.

776
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
That's common for the Sales Department.

777
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,840
They are busy with work.

778
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,360
They are always getting calls.

779
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,320
<i>Sometimes, they forget to keep a record.</i>

780
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,280
<i>But it's okay.</i>

781
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,640
<i>You can check with the Finance Department.</i>

782
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,360
<i>They must have a record.</i>

783
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,720
<i>If you have evidence,</i>

784
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,160
<i>they will admit it.</i>

785
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,520
And at the Legal Department,

786
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,560
some of the computers are missing as well.

787
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,680
Ruan Ye was not there.

788
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,680
Ms. Qiao doesn't want to be responsible.

789
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,880
She wouldn't sign.

790
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,800
Usually, things will turn up.

791
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,040
If you can't find them,

792
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,280
note them down
and go to the Finance Department.

793
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,000
Let them deal with the damage.

794
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,360
That's what I thought.

795
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,640
<i>After verifying everything,</i>

796
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,240
<i>record all the fixed assets.</i>

797
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,360
<i>Go to each department.</i>

798
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Ask their managers to sign.

799
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,800
Then go to the Finance Department
and recheck the accounts.

800
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,560
Okay.

801
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,280
I…

802
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,280
Is there anything else?

803
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,320
Yes.

804
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,280
I…

805
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,800
couldn't find the stapler.

806
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,560
Which drawer did you put it in?

807
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,920
I can't find it anywhere.

808
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,600
The second drawer.

809
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,240
Look deeper.

810
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,360
Okay.

811
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,240
Ruoxin.

812
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,040
Can't you make it back today?

813
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,440
I'm so busy.

814
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,800
It's a lot.

815
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm exhausted.

816
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,440
Are you out of your mind?

817
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,400
I haven't left. How can I be back today?

818
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,000
Tomorrow at the earliest.

819
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,320
Fine. I'll just tire myself to death.

820
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,280
<i>You will definitely be tired,</i>

821
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,000
<i>but there's no way you will die.</i>

822
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,120
Do it with aims for a permanent position.

823
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,960
Is there anything else?
I'm at the security check.

824
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
Text me if you need anything, okay?

825
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm hanging up.

826
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,480
I…

827
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,680
Is everything okay?

828
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,200
Why do they need you back?

829
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,360
It's okay.

830
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,240
It's just some work issues. That's all.

831
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,120
