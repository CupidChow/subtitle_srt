1
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,560
Ting.

2
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,400
Have a drink.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Drink less. We have practice tomorrow.

4
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
Tomorrow's practice…

5
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,040
I can't come.

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
What's wrong?

7
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,720
Are you sick?
Let's practice the day after.

8
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,880
Ting.

9
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360
Actually, I…

10
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,160
I came to say goodbye.

11
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,520
You see,

12
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,320
something urgent came up in my family.

13
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
So…

14
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,040
I have to go home.

15
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,720
I got it.

16
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,400
There's trouble at home. It's important.

17
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Ting.

18
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,640
You actually know

19
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,680
that I…

20
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,080
You need money. I'll get you some.

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,120
Don't worry about the band.

22
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,840
Whenever you wish to return,

23
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
you're always welcome.

24
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Actually, he told me
that his family asked him to come home.

25
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
It's an excuse.

26
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,720
But you didn't expose him.

27
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,440
Actually, it has been hard on him

28
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,640
and he's stressed out.

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,560
It has been years. It hasn't been easy.

30
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
But he still gave up.

31
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,480
He's actually very passionate about music

32
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,080
and we're both crazy about music.

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,560
In elementary school,
we played instruments together.

34
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
We were really happy.

35
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
You know,

36
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,840
one day, I told him,

37
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,520
"Why don't we go out and explore?"

38
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,320
He didn't even hesitate.

39
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,400
But all these years,

40
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,640
we've suffered so much
and had such a hard time.

41
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,280
As for our dream,
we got further away from it

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,840
and reality weighs on us so much
that we can't breathe.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,400
Everyone has the right
to choose their own path.

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
I have no right to interfere
and I won't blame him.

45
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
One day,

46
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
will you also give up?

47
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Me?

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes.

49
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,200
I won't.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
My dream is yet to be fulfilled.

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Music…

52
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,320
is what I'll pursue in life.

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
I don't want to have any regrets.

54
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
<i>Mr. Xu.</i>

55
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,560
<i>You did a great job</i>

56
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,120
<i>for the test-drive event.</i>

57
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,280
<i>In the last few days,</i>

58
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,560
<i>every headline on all automotive media</i>

59
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,440
<i>is about our new energy cars.</i>

60
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,680
<i>It's really nice.</i>

61
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
<i>The family concept</i>

62
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,160
<i>has attracted a lot of families.</i>

63
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
We're kicking off
in the East China region.

64
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,240
It must go well
for future campaigns to develop.

65
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,360
<i>Yes.</i>

66
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>Who knows that, in Shanghai,</i>

67
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
<i>you would straighten them out so soon?</i>

68
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,480
<i>There are many other projects
at the headquarters</i>

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,200
<i>waiting for you to follow up.</i>

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,400
<i>My 15-year-old collection is waiting
for you to open it up.</i>

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
<i>It's to celebrate your success.</i>

72
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,320
All right, it's a deal then.

73
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll be back next week.

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,240
By the way,

75
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,680
I want to tell you something.

76
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,280
I want to assign someone
to the Shenzhen headquarters.

77
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
She'll be of great help.

78
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,480
We'll need more talented people
in the company

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,280
to develop the New Energy Department.

80
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,160
<i>I'm okay with that,</i>

81
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,360
<i>as long as you find her competent.</i>

82
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,280
<i>Well,</i>

83
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,280
<i>just go through the HR Department process.</i>

84
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
Thank you, gentlemen.

85
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
See you next week.

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,400
<i>Okay.</i>

87
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Please tell Ms. Shen
to come to my office. Thank you.

88
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,240
<i>Yes, Mr. Xu.</i>

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Come in.

90
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
Did you ask for me, Mr. Xu?

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,160
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

92
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,920
The test-drive event was a success.

93
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,240
From planning to execution,

94
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,200
you did such a great job.

95
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,240
Although there was a little incident,

96
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,960
I think that you should still
take the credit for it.

97
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,720
It's all thanks to your trust in me.

98
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,280
First of all,
I'm interested in new energy.

99
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
You need to be interested to be motivated.

100
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,200
I'll keep up the good work.

101
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,640
Good.

102
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
Let me ask you something.

103
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
In your mind,

104
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,640
what role do I hold exactly?

105
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,360
Your boss?

106
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
Your superior?

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,000
Your guide?

108
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,360
You are not just my guide.

109
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,600
You're my benefactor.

110
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,320
The company's development
of the new energy

111
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,240
does not only broaden my horizons,

112
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,440
but it also showed me
a more meaningful job.

113
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,760
Are you willing to follow your guide

114
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
to go even further?

115
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,160
To see more meaningful jobs?

116
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,440
What do you mean, sir?

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,160
The event in the East China region
is going much easier than I had expected.

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm heading to the Shenzhen headquarters

119
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,080
to share our experience
and open up a new prospect quickly.

120
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
Ruoxin.

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,200
The new energy will surely be
the company's future focus.

122
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,840
I'm sure

123
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,200
there will be more opportunities for you.

124
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,160
I plan

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,120
to assign you
to the Shenzhen headquarters.

126
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Promotion, raise,

127
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,320
residence, and designated car.

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,920
All of this comes with the job.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,240
Most importantly,

130
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,040
you can get to a higher platform.

131
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,440
You'll broaden your horizons quickly.

132
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,600
You can go higher and further.

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
It's such a tempting opportunity.

134
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
Mr. Xu.

135
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,480
Can I have two days

136
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,880
to think it over seriously?

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,200
That's your style.

138
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,600
Three days.

139
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll return
to the Shenzhen headquarters next week.

140
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
I have many projects to follow up on.

141
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,440
I understand.

142
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
Send it to me by this weekend.

143
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay, no problem.

144
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm telling you, once this is done,

145
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,680
- I think I can get a raise.
- Really?

146
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
- Did you get paid?
- Not yet.

147
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,400
- Not yet?
- Keep going for a few days.

148
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,720
Get this done later.

149
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,880
- Give it to me when you're done.
- Okay.

150
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,520
Scroll down. Let me check.

151
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,600
Well done.

152
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,320
Good job.

153
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,800
Here you go.

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,960
Weekend inventory.

155
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,440
I'll leave it to you.

156
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,320
Ruoxin, what's up?

157
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,880
Why are you looking for me?

158
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,720
Sit down.

159
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,880
What is it?

160
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,280
Qi Xiao,

161
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,600
do you have any career plans
for your future?

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,960
I remember that you once told me,

163
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,280
you won't be here for long.

164
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Then would you like
to stay as my assistant?

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,360
I can do it for life.

166
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,560
What a smooth talker.

167
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm asking you seriously.

168
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,680
If you give me a raise,
I'll follow you no matter what you do,

169
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,240
let alone being your assistant.

170
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,880
What if I go to the Shenzhen headquarters?

171
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
Will you come with me?

172
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,120
You're going to Shenzhen?

173
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,680
Mr. Xu told me that

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,400
he wants to assign
the Shenzhen headquarters to me.

175
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,480
I'll get a promotion and a raise.

176
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,840
As for my career,

177
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,680
I'm sure it's way better than this.

178
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,840
Come to think of it,

179
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,640
there's no reason to turn him down.

180
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,600
I can ask Mr. Xu

181
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,480
to bring my assistant along.

182
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,600
If I get a promotion and a raise,

183
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,640
I'm sure that you can take
your career to the next level.

184
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,240
Well…

185
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,680
I have to think about it.

186
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,240
You don't want to?

187
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,640
Why not?

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,280
You're worried
about living alone away from home?

189
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,960
Look at Su Yang and Sijia.

190
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,560
They came from other cities
to work in Shanghai as well.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,480
- Why are you scared when they aren't?
- That's not it.

192
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,720
My mom is getting old.

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,640
She can't take good care of herself.

194
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,080
I can take care of her in Shanghai.

195
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
I'll be worried if she's alone.

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,080
I understand,

197
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,640
but that's okay.

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
Keep up the good work
in the New Energy Department.

199
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,920
Once I get to the Shenzhen headquarters,

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,160
I'll watch over you at work in the future.

201
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
I'll get you promoted
and give you a raise soon.

202
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,400
Make more money
to make your dream come true sooner.

203
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
So…

204
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,480
you've decided to go to Shenzhen?

205
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
When are you leaving?

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,880
I have to make arrangements for my mom.

207
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,760
I also have to handle my apartment.

208
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,920
The soonest, next week.

209
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
That soon?

210
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,000
Hello?

211
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,040
Mom.

212
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,200
I'll be home for dinner tonight.

213
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,200
You'll be home for dinner tonight?

214
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

215
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,200
I have to thaw the chicken and ribs
in the freezer.

216
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,840
It's okay.
Let's just eat what we have at home.

217
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,240
Okay, I got it.

218
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,080
I'll hurry up then.

219
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,360
Drive slower. Okay?

220
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
Let's eat, young master.

221
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
Go ahead.

222
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,800
I don't have an appetite.

223
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
What's wrong?

224
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,120
Did that Mr. Xu come on strong
in pursuing Ruoxin again?

225
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,640
It's a whole typhoon gale this time.

226
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,880
What happened?

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,360
Did he use his ultimate move?

228
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,200
He's sending Ruoxin
to the Shenzhen headquarters.

229
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,160
The problem is Ruoxin wants to go there.

230
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,640
Damn it.

231
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,760
That sure is powerful.

232
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,080
If Ruoxin really goes to Shenzhen,

233
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,080
you won't even have a chance.

234
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,680
What's the point
of that tiny flame of love

235
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,800
burning in your heart?

236
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't think Ruoxin will ever find out.

237
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
How can I not know what you just said?

238
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,720
No way.

239
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
Even if she's leaving,

240
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
before she leaves,

241
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,840
I need to let her know that I like her.

242
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,400
I seriously like her.

243
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,680
Then you'd better be ready for rejection.

244
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,960
As far as I know,

245
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,280
if you confess to her and she rejects you
and goes somewhere else,

246
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,320
I don't think you guys
will even be friends anymore.

247
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,280
So what?

248
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,000
Think about it.

249
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,880
If she never knows

250
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,440
that I like her so much,

251
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
how sad will I be?

252
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,440
So no matter what…

253
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,360
No matter what the result is,

254
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
even if she blocks me,

255
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,480
I need her to know how I feel.

256
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
Even if she likes you back,

257
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,080
she'll be in Shenzhen
and you'll be in Shanghai.

258
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
That's okay.

259
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,160
From now on,

260
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,600
I can visit her in Shenzhen.

261
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
She can also visit me back in Shanghai.

262
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,359
Maybe in a few years,

263
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,079
we might be in the same city again?

264
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,440
It doesn't matter.

265
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,599
What matters is that

266
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,720
I know how she feels.

267
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,119
She also knows how I feel about her.

268
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,079
The time when our two hearts beat as one,

269
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,760
even if it's just for a few days
or a few minutes,

270
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,720
is worth it.

271
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,200
Right?

272
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,800
You're all so brave.

273
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,040
We?

274
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,920
You mean, You Sijia?

275
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,760
How about you two?

276
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,720
No contact?

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,800
Don't you regret it?

278
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,840
You pushed the girl who likes you away.

279
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,560
You also like her.

280
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,800
Did you tell her why you got fined?

281
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,160
Have you shown her

282
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,280
the kitty webtoon you drew for her?

283
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,960
Don't assume that

284
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,320
you're doing You Sijia a favor
by hiding your feelings from her.

285
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm telling you, it doesn't.

286
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,360
I disagree.

287
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,720
Eat up.

288
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Can you tell me what you're doing?

289
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
Hold on.

290
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
Song Ziyan.

291
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,480
What are you doing?

292
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,240
I've thought it through these days.

293
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
You're right.

294
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,760
I can't feed off you

295
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,160
and spend your money

296
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,760
while saying that I want to live my life.

297
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,280
The mortgage is 24,000 yuan a month.

298
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
We'll each pay half.

299
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Are you having fun?

300
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,880
Listen to me first.

301
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,600
As for me,

302
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,280
I can't afford 12,000 yuan a month.

303
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Here's 7,000 yuan.

304
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
I did some research.

305
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,600
The market price

306
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,160
for a housekeeper
to do housework without minding a kid

307
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,680
is about 4,000 or 5,000 yuan.

308
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
As for that,
let's deduct that as the service fee.

309
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,400
What do you want, Song Ziyan?

310
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll sleep in the guest room

311
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,240
from now on.

312
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,760
Are we separating?

313
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,680
Is this necessary?

314
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,160
Just because I won't let you
wait tables at the bar?

315
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
I didn't turn down the job at the bar.

316
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,200
But I think the issue between us

317
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,080
isn't just about my job.

318
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Then why?

319
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,360
Kids?

320
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm turning 40 years old soon.
Is it wrong for me to want a child?

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No.

322
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
Although we agreed to be DINK
before we got married,

323
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,800
you have the right to regret it.

324
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,920
It's just that we're not on the same page.

325
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,640
Getting a time-out to think this through…

326
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,480
I think it's pretty good.

327
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,880
I understand.

328
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,040
You would rather break up with me

329
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,720
than have a kid.

330
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
Song Ziyan,

331
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,920
don't end up regretting it.

332
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,880
Zou Cheng.

333
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,280
Do you really think

334
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,160
that once I have a child,

335
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,960
the issue between us will be resolved?

336
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,320
Yes, being married all these years,

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you've done so much for this family.

338
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,040
But…

339
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,680
But I feel like you can't see
my existence anymore.

340
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,120
Do you remember

341
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,880
why we started dating back then?

342
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
Do you remember what you said?
That you liked me?

343
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,440
Sometimes I would think,

344
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,640
"What do I mean to you?"

345
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
A tool to continue your bloodline?

346
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,800
A housekeeper to cook
and do chores for you?

347
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,840
If that is the case,

348
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,440
the woman who is Zou Cheng's wife…

349
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,200
Why does it have to be me?

350
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,160
I can't see your existence?

351
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,840
Did you see my existence?

352
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,720
I go on business trips all the time.

353
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,760
I work overtime and stay up late.

354
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,480
What for?

355
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,160
Do you even feel
a little bit sorry and grateful to me?

356
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,120
Our marriage has ended up like this.

357
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,600
Are you not at fault as well?

358
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,840
I am.

359
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,960
I am indeed at fault.

360
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,440
I lost myself.

361
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,560
I can't blame you for not noticing me.

362
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,440
So I'm thinking,

363
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,480
let's calm down.

364
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Let's see what we both really want.

365
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,920
Let's see if we should go on.

366
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,280
Mom, I don't eat these.

367
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm full.

368
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,160
It's plenty.

369
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,360
Look at how pale you look.

370
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,000
Didn't you sleep well last night?

371
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,680
Mom.

372
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,200
I have something to tell you.

373
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
It's quite serious.

374
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,000
What is it?

375
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,400
Did someone bully you again?

376
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
No.

377
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,800
It's work.

378
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,120
I want to go to our Shenzhen headquarters.

379
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,000
I think I can challenge myself
at the headquarters.

380
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,000
And it's not just at work,

381
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
but also in other aspects.

382
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,640
It will do me some good.

383
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,560
I think the new energy cars
will be a big trend in the future.

384
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,600
So I don't want to miss this opportunity.

385
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,400
Is it decided?

386
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
I told Mr. Xu

387
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,520
that I'll think about it.

388
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,920
Mr. Xu wants you there?

389
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,520
Mr. Xu thinks that the event

390
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
in the East China region
is quite successful.

391
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,440
That's why he would like
to promote it nationwide.

392
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,480
He wants me to go there with him.

393
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,640
It seems that Mr. Xu

394
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,760
still likes you.

395
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
Mom, if you say that,

396
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,440
you're denying my competence.

397
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
I worked hard

398
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,440
for every promotion and raise I got.

399
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,000
Mr. Xu thinks so highly of me

400
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,000
because he has seen
my performance at work.

401
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
And I asked myself.

402
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,600
I do deserve it.

403
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,560
Since you said so

404
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
and you don't want
to lose this opportunity too…

405
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
You should go.

406
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,480
But you must be careful.

407
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,720
When it comes to work--

408
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,760
I know. Work is work.

409
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,240
Life is life.

410
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,560
Besides, when an eligible bachelor
like Mr. Xu

411
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,720
goes back to his old dominion in Shenzhen,

412
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,760
he won't have time
to think about me, right?

413
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,160
It's fine as long as you're clearheaded.

414
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,080
When are you leaving?

415
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,000
As early as next week.

416
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,920
Then tomorrow…

417
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,880
Should I go shopping for you tomorrow?

418
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
It's okay.

419
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,320
When I'm not in Shanghai,
what will you do?

420
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm in Shanghai.

421
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
What are you worried about?

422
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
I still have my arms and legs.

423
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,600
I'm still breathing.

424
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm alert and healthy.

425
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
Don't worry about me.

426
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,080
If I were in Shanghai,

427
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,320
I could still eat with you every day.

428
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,520
When you get into an accident,

429
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,880
I can still take care of you.

430
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,200
My dear,

431
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,840
how often
does your mom get into accidents?

432
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm old.

433
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,440
I'll also be as helpless as a child.

434
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,080
But don't worry,

435
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,720
I'll get back to teaching
at the University for Seniors.

436
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll eat at the cafeteria
every day with my students.

437
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
Don't be too cool.

438
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,200
Without having you by my side,

439
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
maybe my days…

440
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,360
might also be a bit easier.

441
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,800
Out of sight,

442
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,480
out of mind.

443
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,560
The soup is ready. I'll get the soup.

444
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
Mom!

445
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Mr. Xu.

446
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
I've decided.

447
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,880
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.

448
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,160
RUOXIN LIKES ASTRONOMY,
SHE DOESN'T LIKE NOISY PLACES

449
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,880
PLAN A: PROFESS OVER HOT POT
PLAN B: TAKE HER STAR-GAZE

450
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,320
HAPPENING IN THE GALAXY,
AN EYE-OPENING EXPERIENCE!

451
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,520
Book my flight for next Friday.

452
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
Ms. Shen will have the weekend,

453
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
a total of two days

454
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,440
to pack her belongings with ease.

455
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Ms. Shen didn't mention
any exact requests for the residence.

456
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,560
The Administration Department
found a few listings.

457
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,200
I'll show them to Ms. Shen later.

458
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Show me first.

459
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
Leave the first listing out.

460
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,520
Leave out the third one.

461
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,800
Let Ms. Shen pick from the rest.

462
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,800
Okay.

463
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,000
- I'll proceed with it then.
- Go.

464
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,360
I've emailed it to you. Check it out.

465
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,360
If it's okay, print it out
and get the accountants to sign it.

466
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,280
Okay.

467
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
By the way, Ruoxin,

468
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,080
I've sent you this month's KPI.

469
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,160
I'll give you a high score.

470
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,680
This will be

471
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,560
the last time you grade me, right?

472
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,800
You're making me sad.

473
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,040
I'm off.

474
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,000
<i>If you come home early,</i>

475
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,280
<i>heat this up and eat it.</i>

476
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
<i>I'm off to work.</i>

477
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,960
What does she mean?

478
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,760
Hello?

479
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,360
I'm not feeling well today.

480
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm not going to Mr. Wang's dinner.

481
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,720
<i>Okay, Mr. Zou.</i>

482
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
<i>The reimbursement for your business trips</i>

483
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,880
<i>last month on
the 3rd, 8th, 16th, and 19th,</i>

484
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
<i>has been issued.</i>

485
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
<i>Shall I wire it tomorrow?</i>

486
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Okay, thank you.

487
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,120
Was I away that often?

488
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,960
Are the triangles for days
when I worked overtime?

489
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,960
You're on a business trip again?

490
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

491
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,280
I've been making duck soup all afternoon.

492
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,240
All right.

493
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,720
<i>It smells so good.</i>

494
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,280
<i>Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

495
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,880
<i>I can't celebrate
your birthday with you again.</i>

496
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,200
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

497
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,280
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

498
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,640
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

499
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,560
<i>Happy birthday to me</i>

500
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,480
<i>Honey.</i>

501
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,840
<i>Are you sure you can't take time off?</i>

502
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,960
<i>Haven't you always wanted to go to Egypt?</i>

503
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,480
<i>I really can't take the day off this time.</i>

504
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,880
<i>I'm not going either then.</i>

505
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,960
<i>That won't do.</i>

506
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,239
<i>We made a deal before we got married.</i>

507
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
<i>We're going to travel around the world.</i>

508
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,199
<i>Although I can't make it this time,</i>

509
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,400
<i>you can see the world on my behalf.</i>

510
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,040
How about this?

511
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
Send me a postcard.

512
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,639
When I see the postcards,
it's like I went there with you.

513
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,000
Hello!

514
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,160
Mrs. Zou is back!

515
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,120
You're home?

516
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,480
Honey.

517
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,120
Why didn't you check the mailbox?

518
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,080
Look at these.

519
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,520
I sent you so many postcards.

520
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,760
I forgot to check the mailbox.

521
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,880
Hey.

522
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,520
I've been away for days.

523
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,640
Did you miss me at all?

524
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,000
That's right.

525
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,880
Do you want to see some Mayan heritage?

526
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,640
I took a lot of photos.

527
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,040
Didn't you post them
on your social media every day?

528
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,400
I clicked "like."

529
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,800
Nice shot!

530
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,840
Good job!

531
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
Honey.

532
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,480
Why don't you go and unpack?

533
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm going to finish watching the game.

534
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,600
Okay.

535
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,080
<i>Do you remember</i>

536
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,840
<i>why we started dating back then?</i>

537
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,760
<i>Do you remember what you said?
That you liked me?</i>

538
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,960
<i>I am indeed at fault.</i>

539
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
<i>I lost myself.</i>

540
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,600
<i>I can't blame you for not noticing me.</i>

541
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,840
Ms. Zhou,

542
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,160
let me carry them for you.

543
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,160
Bubble snails?

544
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,200
You bought so many things.
Are you treating us tonight?

545
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
No.

546
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,960
Xinxin is going away
to work in Shenzhen soon.

547
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm worried that she'll be too busy,

548
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,680
so I'm trying to make sure
that she is well-supplied.

549
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,240
Otherwise,

550
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,560
she won't have the time to buy them.

551
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,120
Shenzhen is a big city.
They have everything.

552
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
She doesn't have
to bring these from Shanghai.

553
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,040
Hey, kid.

554
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,280
You're too young.

555
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,960
Bubble snails are a specialty of Shanghai.

556
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,400
You're right.

557
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,960
They might have these
in Shenzhen and other cities.

558
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,160
But can they be as fresh
as the ones produced locally?

559
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,120
Besides,

560
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,080
Xinxin's favorite food of all time

561
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,560
is bubble snail.

562
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,360
She always said it reminds her of her mom.

563
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,680
You're right.

564
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,880
As her mom,
you're still the thoughtful one.

565
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,200
By the way,

566
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,200
is there a secret recipe
for your sweet and sour pork ribs?

567
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,160
Xinxin really loved it.

568
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,000
Tell me and I'll write it down.

569
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,720
When she gets to Shenzhen,

570
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,680
she can make it herself.

571
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,200
Don't worry.

572
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
I already told her the recipe.

573
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
Yes.

574
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,320
I forgot.

575
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,800
I don't know what's with me these days.

576
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,440
I can't think straight.

577
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,680
Ms. Zhou,

578
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,360
can you really bear to let
Ruoxin go to Shenzhen?

579
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
How can I?

580
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,160
She seems to respect and fear me,

581
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,240
but deep down, she won't obey me.

582
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,000
She has grown up.

583
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,160
She's all grown up.

584
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,040
There are many matters

585
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,960
that she has never discussed with me.

586
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,680
This time, I can tell.

587
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,840
She…

588
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,400
She really wants to go.

589
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
So what's the point of stopping her?

590
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,560
Don't think like that, Ms. Zhou.

591
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,680
Ruoxin must know that you care about her

592
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,840
and feel bad for her.

593
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,400
Ruoxin must care about you too.

594
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,560
That's why

595
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,040
she cares so much that,

596
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,240
in other words,

597
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,720
she's too embarrassed to tell you.

598
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,960
Frankly, I'm the same.

599
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
If I'm in any trouble,

600
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,240
I definitely won't tell my mom.

601
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,560
I don't want her to worry.

602
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,680
Perhaps, as her mom,

603
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm not strong enough?

604
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,320
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

605
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,680
I'm just dropping you off.

606
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,720
By the way,

607
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,480
before you go to Shenzhen,
check the power inside the car

608
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,440
after your car gets its maintenance.

609
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,960
Take out the charger and everything.

610
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,360
Otherwise, when you return,
the car won't start without any battery.

611
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,840
Okay, Mr. Xu. I got it.

612
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,360
Let me know if you're displeased
with the residence.

613
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,840
I'll make them look for others.

614
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,000
For the remaining two days,

615
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,800
if there's anything to handle,
you can take some time off.

616
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,360
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't mention it.

617
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,440
You're leaving Shanghai for the first time

618
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,000
to assist me in Shenzhen.

619
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,280
It's my duty to take care of you.

620
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,240
I'm going upstairs.

621
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,200
Go.

622
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Mr. Xu.

623
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,320
Ms. Zhou?

624
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
What a coincidence.

625
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,480
Is your hand okay now?

626
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,760
Thanks to you,

627
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,320
it's more or less…

628
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,840
recovered.

629
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,840
Qi Xiao.

630
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,080
It's heavy.
Can you take these upstairs for me?

631
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,320
I have something to say to Mr. Xu.

632
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,120
Mr. Xu, please take your time.

633
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,800
- Mr. Xu.
- Ms. Zhou.

634
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,320
I told you.

635
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,840
Please call me "Xiaoxu."

636
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,480
Okay.

637
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,800
Mr. Xiaoxu.

638
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,480
In two days,

639
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,880
my daughter is going to Shenzhen with you.

640
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,600
Thank you.

641
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,840
Please take good care of her.

642
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,760
Ms. Zhou, you're so kind.

643
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,040
I know.

644
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,200
Ruoxin is leaving home for the first time.

645
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,520
You can't bear to see her go,

646
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,040
but don't worry.

647
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,080
I'll take good care of Ruoxin.

648
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,080
I'm not worried.

649
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,840
Why would I be?

650
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,120
But I still have a few things
that I want to remind you.

651
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,160
Please tell me.

652
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,160
Since Ruoxin was a child,

653
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,200
I raised her myself.

654
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,520
That's why she's not like other girls.

655
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,360
When other girls are deceived or wronged,

656
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
they just cry it out.

657
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,240
Then they let it go.

658
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,480
But not Ruoxin.

659
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,680
She can't stand to be wronged.

660
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,640
She's stubborn.

661
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,360
She would rather break than bend.

662
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,880
If…

663
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,840
Of course, I hope it won't happen.

664
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,040
If she's being fooled,

665
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,400
I'll fight that person to death.

666
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,160
Do you understand

667
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,200
what I am saying?

668
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Ms. Zhou,

669
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
don't worry.

670
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,040
I admire Ruoxin.

671
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,520
She is my right-hand woman in Shanghai.

672
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,000
I promise you.

673
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,400
When we get to Shenzhen,

674
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,680
her career will take off.

675
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,200
Okay.

676
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,440
I just can't seem to say…

677
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,840
sentimental words of gratitude.

678
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,880
Anyway,

679
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,000
please take care of her.

680
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:39,040
