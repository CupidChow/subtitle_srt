1
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,000
Ms. Zhou.

2
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,160
Thank you for today.

3
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,400
Without you, I wouldn't be able to do it.

4
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,360
It's a coincidence that I met you today.

5
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,320
Are you always this busy with work?

6
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,720
This is normal.

7
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
Mom, why are you here?

8
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,720
What happened?
You didn't even text me back.

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm busy with work.

10
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Yilan.

11
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
Who is he?

12
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,160
My son.

13
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,080
He's the "tiger"?

14
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,280
That's right.

15
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,440
<i>Two tigers</i>

16
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>Two tigers</i>

17
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
<i>They are handsome</i>

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
<i>They are handsome</i>

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,080
You two know each other?

20
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,600
Wait. How do you know each other?

21
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
We met while traveling.

22
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,800
What a coincidence.

23
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,080
It happened so suddenly.

24
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Now, someone wants
to invite us over for dinner.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
If we eat there,

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,440
we can't go empty-handed.

27
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,280
We need to bring a gift.

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,200
What should we bring? My goodness.

29
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,880
Mom, didn't you just go
to the supermarket?

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,920
Look for something.

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,720
Mom.

32
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,120
Was the ancient town fun?

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,040
It was.

34
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,920
It has an air of antiquity
with flowing water, small bridges,

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,120
and natural oxygen.

36
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,000
If there's a chance,

37
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,720
go there to relax and have some fun.

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,960
It's so worth it.

39
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,920
Okay.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,680
Is it a gift for me?

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,080
No.

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes.

43
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
Do you like it?

44
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,280
I know this one.

45
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
It's very popular these days.
My colleagues were talking about it.

46
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,520
I wanted to buy one.

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
It heats fast and keeps warm, right?

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,960
On the last day of the trip,
Qi Xiao's mom insisted on going shopping.

49
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
She insisted on buying souvenirs.

50
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,880
I chose this for you.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,519
Do you like it?

52
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,440
It's so pretty, Mom.

53
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,079
It's my favorite macaron green.

54
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,240
The weather will get cold soon.
You can use it.

55
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,640
Thank you, Mom.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
You're welcome.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,680
Being with her

58
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,840
not only made me learn to buy things,

59
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,200
but I also learned

60
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
to seek blessings

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,440
for my child's marriage.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,600
Hey.

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,720
She's really quite an interesting person.

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,200
The water's boiling. Lower the heat!

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,720
Come on, I'll help you.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,040
Mom.

67
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Your mission today
is to just wait and eat.

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
That won't do.

69
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,320
There are many of us today.
I'm afraid you can't handle it yourself.

70
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Mom.

71
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
You're overthinking it.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
You're banned from the kitchen today.

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,480
I don't want Ruoxin to eat

74
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
bad food.

75
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,360
- Do you want to get beaten up?
- All right.

76
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,680
All right, go and watch the television.
Watch television.

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,960
By the way, my son,

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,200
Ruoxin's mom said
that Ruoxin loves spicy food.

79
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,880
When you're sautéing the meat,
add extra chili.

80
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,200
I got it.

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
Be good. Go and watch television.

82
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,800
Chili?

83
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,040
I don't need another scary night.

84
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>I'm coming!</i>

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,360
Please come in, Yilan!

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,520
I could smell the food
as soon as you opened the door.

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
- Come in.
- Hello, Mrs. Qi.

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm Shen Ruoxin, sorry to bother you.

89
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.

90
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,480
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
Why are you being polite? We're neighbors.

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,240
You're welcome.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,520
I'm really sorry.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
The house is too small.

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,680
Please have a seat.

96
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
- Have a seat.
- No.

97
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,920
I'll take a look around first.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
- Look, that's so interesting.
- You…

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
There are so many toys.

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
- Feel free to look around.
- Okay.

101
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,200
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

102
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,160
Okay, Mrs. Qi.

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,640
You're so pretty,
even prettier than your mom.

104
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,920
That's for sure.

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Thank you, Mrs. Qi.

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,560
I heard a lot about you from my son.

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,160
He said you're his boss

108
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
and that you're very capable.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,040
It's much better to see you
than just hear about you.

110
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,960
Just by looking at you today,
I can tell that you're great.

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,440
Thank you, Mrs. Qi.

112
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
You look young and elegant.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
- And you have such good taste.
- Thank you.

114
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,760
Look at how exquisite your accessory is.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,360
This one?

116
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,040
My son made this for me.

117
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
Qi Xiao may be a boy,

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,240
but he's good with his hands.

119
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,160
He made

120
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,320
the necklaces, earrings, and bracelets

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
that I usually wear.

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,280
My friends are so jealous of me.

123
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
They said they are unique.

124
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,840
They mentioned a very trendy word, it's…

125
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
It's "customized."

126
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,440
You're his boss.

127
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
I'll ask him to make you one too.

128
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,280
- Qi--
- It's okay, Mrs. Qi.

129
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,280
He has made me one.

130
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
He made this necklace for me.

131
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,320
It's so pretty and it goes well
with a lot of clothes.

132
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,920
No, it's because you're beautiful.

133
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Yilan, try these spareribs.

134
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,280
It's his specialty too.

135
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
By the way,

136
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,320
while you were traveling together,

137
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,080
you really didn't know
that I'm her assistant?

138
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
Of course.

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,040
I thought you two were the same age.

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,320
I even wanted to introduce you two.

141
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,800
I never thought

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,160
you're a dozen years younger than her.

143
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Yilan, try this. It's good too.

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,640
Ruoxin.

145
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
Thank you for your guidance
for all this time.

146
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,080
Eat more meat to nourish yourself.

147
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,280
Ms. Zhou, try my stir-fried pork.

148
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,360
Mom.

149
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,280
Have some meat.

150
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,560
Here, have some meat.

151
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,760
You have a good son.

152
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,280
Look, he does things quickly.

153
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,000
And this food

154
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
is really delicious.

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,480
You're lucky.

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
This sautéed meat is so flavorful.

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,160
Qi Xiao is mature

158
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,800
and ambitious.

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,360
And he's so clever.

160
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,919
Don't even get me started.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
When he was younger,

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,039
he was so silly.

163
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,799
If I told you about it,

164
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,480
you'll be laughing so much,
you won't be able to finish your meal.

165
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,400
How could it be?

166
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,040
Let me tell you.

167
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,640
Once, when he was a child,
he came home and said,

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,040
"Mom. You must buy me a broom."

169
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
I asked him, "Why do you need a broom?"

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
He said,
"We're going to sweep the tomb tomorrow.

171
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
For tomb-sweeping,

172
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,640
how can you not buy a broom?"

173
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
And on the next day, I asked him,

174
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,800
"Hey, how did the tomb-sweeping go?"

175
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,320
He was so down

176
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,080
and pouted while saying,

177
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,040
"People brought snacks for tomb-sweeping

178
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,760
and ate and drank so much there.

179
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,480
I brought a broom

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,960
and watched everyone eating."

181
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,840
Wasn't he silly?

182
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
Mom.

183
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,640
That was years ago!

184
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,840
Why are you bringing it up?

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
Right. This only means that
Qi Xiao is serious in what he does.

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
When Xinxin was young,

187
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,440
she was cute and silly.

188
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
Mom, why are you dragging me into this?

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
Have you forgotten?

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
When you were little, I brought you
to the Natural History Museum.

191
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,520
When we went in,
she saw that huge dinosaur skeleton

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,480
and kept pestering the guide and asking,

193
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,600
"How many people did you hire

194
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
to eat it so cleanly?"

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
We can only say that Ruoxin is determined.

196
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,920
That's why she has accomplished
so much at work.

197
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,240
She's not like Qi Xiao.

198
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,280
He's always doing stupid things.

199
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,320
Mrs. Qi, what stupid thing did Qi Xiao do?

200
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,240
- I--
- Well,

201
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
I must tell you about it.

202
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,840
As you know,

203
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,120
we had a couch in our house back then
which is foldable.

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
It's usually a sofa.

205
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,080
If you unfold it, it becomes a bed.

206
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
That sofa armrest…

207
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
- Let's sit for a while.
- Let's sit for a while.

208
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,800
My son.

209
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,480
A while ago, you told me

210
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,400
that you like someone.

211
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
Today, you have to be honest with me.

212
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
Is that person

213
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,760
Shen Ruoxin?

214
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,120
No.

215
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,040
Ruoxin is my boss.

216
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
How is that possible?

217
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Is it really not her?

218
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,080
Ruoxin is so incredible anyway.

219
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,720
She might not like me.

220
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
What's the matter?

221
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,960
My son isn't so bad either.

222
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,920
My son.

223
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,640
If you really like her,

224
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,840
go after her.

225
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,200
I support you.

226
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,560
Mom.

227
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,200
You're not against it?

228
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,040
Why would I be against it?

229
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,480
Do you want to live with me forever?

230
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
I thought you would be against it.

231
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,480
Ruoxin is a lot older than me.

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,360
A dozen years.

233
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,800
So I thought you would be against it.

234
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,440
My son.

235
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,520
Other moms might be against this.

236
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,280
They would think that their son

237
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
isn't thinking clearly

238
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,080
and being impulsive.

239
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,000
They are afraid that their son
will get tricked and deceived.

240
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,560
But I won't act that way.

241
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,920
Because my son

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,520
has never done anything

243
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,240
that disappointed me.

244
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,240
Mom.

245
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,800
You're so open-minded.

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
Do you love me?

247
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
Good boy.

248
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,040
Actually, when you were
eating besides her earlier,

249
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
from the way you looked at her,

250
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I can see

251
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,000
that you really love her.

252
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,840
In my life,

253
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
can you guess what is the best thing

254
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,640
I have ever done?

255
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
I know.

256
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,400
It was meeting a man

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
who came from Shanghai to Sichuan,

258
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,160
following him to Shanghai,

259
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,680
and…

260
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
marrying him.

261
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
Suddenly…

262
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,040
Suddenly,

263
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,080
I miss him so much.

264
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,280
Mom.

265
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
I still remember that back then,

266
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,640
a lot of people didn't think
we would make it,

267
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,680
especially my parents.

268
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,800
They were so against it.

269
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,280
What I did

270
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
was cry to them

271
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,440
and fight with them.

272
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,040
That's why I know that

273
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,920
when you really fall for someone,

274
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
no matter what anyone says,

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
it's useless.

276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
So let me tell you.

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,000
No matter what kind of girlfriend
you'll have in the future,

278
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,960
I won't interfere.

279
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,840
As long as you like her,

280
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,960
I like her.

281
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,920
As long as you're happy,

282
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
I'm happy.

283
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,760
Do you understand?

284
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,320
Mom.

285
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,160
Thank you.

286
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
You're being so courteous to me?

287
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,360
No.

288
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,840
I was struggling before.

289
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
I struggled with how I should tell you.

290
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,000
I knew it.

291
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,440
My son, who doesn't keep secrets
and tells me everything,

292
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,360
suddenly likes someone

293
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,880
and won't tell me about it.

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,720
So it's because

295
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,600
you were afraid that I would object.

296
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't you like watching
those dramas on television?

297
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,040
Usually, in dramas,

298
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,560
the parents will be against it.

299
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,760
Am I that old-fashioned?

300
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm so curious.

301
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,240
Why do you like her?

302
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Tell me about it.

303
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,680
I like

304
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,760
that she's very capable,

305
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,280
rational,

306
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,040
incredible at work,

307
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,240
very experienced,

308
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,240
and dazzling.

309
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay.

310
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,360
My son,

311
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
you've grown up.

312
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,840
You're very confident.

313
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,120
I read an article on social media.

314
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,960
"Only mature and confident men

315
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,000
can appreciate a capable woman."

316
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,480
You're amazing.

317
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Mom.

318
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm talking about Ruoxin.

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why are you praising me?

320
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,040
That's right.

321
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,880
Okay. Keep talking.

322
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,480
Don't think that
she only looks that strong.

323
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
When you actually get close to her,

324
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,440
she's like a little girl.

325
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,640
Her surgery…

326
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
She had surgery?

327
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,640
You can't tell Ruoxin's mom.

328
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,320
I won't tell her.

329
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
Keep talking.

330
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,800
She had surgery
and refused to take her medicines.

331
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Can you guess what I did?

332
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,360
What did you do?

333
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,960
I bought her lollipops.

334
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,920
I still remember

335
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,280
when I was sick back then

336
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,000
and refused to take my medicines,

337
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,400
I used to say,
"The medicine is so bitter."

338
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
Then your dad bought me lollipops.

339
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,160
I didn't expect

340
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
that you learned to do it too.

341
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
I know.

342
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,200
I saw it all.

343
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,960
That's why it's called heritage.

344
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Thank you, Mom.

345
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,160
Let me repeat.

346
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,119
As long as my son is happy,

347
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,119
I'm happy.

348
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,800
You can do it, my son.

349
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,160
Be happy.

350
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,040
Okay.

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,800
<i>You were so funny when you were young.</i>

352
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,720
<i>If I wasn't afraid of tearing my wound,
I would be laughing so hard.</i>

353
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
<i>You're laughing at me?</i>

354
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,920
<i>You're not better off.</i>

355
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,880
<i>A pen name is the pen's name?</i>

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,840
<i>Actually,</i>

357
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,760
<i>I also got my head stuck</i>

358
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
<i>between the railings.</i>

359
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,240
<i>But my mom didn't mention it.</i>

360
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>I guess she doesn't remember.</i>

361
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>Why do moms always like talking</i>

362
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,360
<i>about their kid's embarrassing moments?</i>

363
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,120
<i>Who wasn't stupid when they were kids?</i>

364
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,840
<i>I guess this is how they chat
with each other.</i>

365
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>I feel like
I'm being stripped off my clothes.</i>

366
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,360
<i>It's chilly.</i>

367
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,040
Hello?

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,960
Hello.

369
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,560
If you really like

370
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
the jewelry I designed,

371
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,680
I'll make you a customized set too.

372
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,000
Considering our relationship,

373
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,200
it's free.

374
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,720
There's no need. Stop bragging.

375
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm serious.

376
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,400
If you like designing so much,

377
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,960
have you ever thought

378
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,040
of opening your online shop again someday?

379
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm still planning it.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,280
What are you planning?

381
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,760
Do you need money?

382
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,280
How about I lend you
some starting capital?

383
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,640
It's not about the money.

384
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
I can't bear to part with you.

385
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
You're such a good boss.

386
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,040
Actually, I think

387
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,280
that it's so nice for you
to have something you like to do.

388
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,600
<i>If what you like</i>

389
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,160
<i>happens to be your job,</i>

390
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,600
<i>isn't that great?</i>

391
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
Look at me.

392
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,360
I like astronomy,
but I can only keep it a secret.

393
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,680
No one knows.

394
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm involved in new energy now.

395
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,640
It's somewhat related

396
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,640
to my ambition.

397
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,600
That's why I'm happy every day.

398
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,640
If I leave

399
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
and quit being your assistant,

400
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
who would help you?

401
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,480
Relationships are fluid.

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,320
It's impossible

403
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,440
for a relationship
to remain the same forever, isn't it?

404
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,200
In our lives,

405
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,400
being able to meet
and accompany each other

406
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
for a period of time

407
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
is already such a happy thing.

408
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,680
We should just cherish the present.

409
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,360
I want you to do
the things you want to do.

410
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
I got it.

411
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,400
But I'm not planning
to part ways with you.

412
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,480
<i>Even if I have to go my own path,</i>

413
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,920
I'll drag you along.

414
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,080
All right.

415
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,440
Go to sleep.

416
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,240
Good night.

417
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,280
Good night.

418
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,920
Xinxin.

419
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,080
Mom.

420
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,600
Where are you going?

421
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,400
Do you feel uncomfortable staying with me?

422
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,880
- It's all good.
- Ms. Zhou.

423
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,120
Hey.

424
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,280
But I haven't checked my own house

425
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,720
for a long time.

426
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,680
It's so close.

427
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,440
Go and check whenever you want to,
then come back.

428
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,080
Why did you pack everything?

429
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,240
Are you sad that I'm going home?

430
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
I'm worried about you.

431
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Why are you worried?

432
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,720
We live close to each other.

433
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,480
When I miss you,

434
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,800
I'll come to visit.

435
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
Besides, I should go back to teaching

436
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,400
at the University for Seniors.

437
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,800
Mr. Zhao called and said

438
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,200
that the substitute teacher

439
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,840
is trying hard to get on the good side
of the principal.

440
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,840
If I don't go back,

441
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
I won't be able to keep my job.

442
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,440
You'll be alone.

443
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,160
Stop eating at the cafeteria.

444
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,720
Come by when you're free.

445
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,040
Let's eat together.

446
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,680
Once I'm done with my work,

447
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,160
I'll visit you at home
and spend more time with you.

448
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,680
I'll keep that in mind.

449
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,360
Look at you. It's getting cold.

450
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,040
I've already changed your blankets
into thick ones.

451
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,240
I also cooked two days' worth of food
and placed them in the refrigerator.

452
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,000
Remember.

453
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,640
You have a bad stomach.

454
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,240
Heat them up before eating.

455
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,080
I originally thought

456
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,800
that a lawyer travels around a lot,

457
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,360
but you can hide in an air-conditioned
office by working in the Legal Department.

458
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,560
I can't believe
that you have fieldwork too.

459
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
Don't worry, Ms. Zhou.

460
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,240
I promise I won't let Ruoxin work.
She'll just supervise.

461
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,240
Okay.

462
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,360
I'm relieved to hear that.

463
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,960
Remember.

464
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,160
Please take good care

465
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,080
of my kitty.

466
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,960
Okay.

467
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
Mom, let Qi Xiao see you off.

468
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,600
- Let me take it.
- There's no need.

469
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,800
I'll walk you to the subway station.
Your hand has just recovered.

470
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
You shouldn't lift heavy things, okay?

471
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,960
Mom, it's cold.

472
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Wear extra layers. Don't catch a cold.

473
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,280
Don't work too hard.

474
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,600
Bye.

475
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,400
Text me when you get home.

476
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,520
- Don't worry.
- Go back.

477
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
UNLEASH ITS ENERGY, ENJOY ITS POWER

478
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
DRAGON FACE DESIGN LANGUAGE

479
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
What are you doing?

480
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,360
It's not heavy.

481
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,800
I told you, no heavy lifting. I'll do it.

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Come and get your coffee.
I bought coffee for you guys!

483
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,920
- Come on.
- Hurry.

484
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,440
Pick what you want. This is a latte.

485
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

486
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,560
You're welcome.
Thank you for your hard work.

487
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
Thank you.

488
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,120
Hey.

489
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,640
What's the matter?

490
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,520
The doctor said
that you shouldn't have strong drinks.

491
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm already discharged.

492
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,040
I've almost recovered.

493
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
At least a week.
That's what the doctor said.

494
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,400
Here.

495
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,640
Drink this.

496
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
Here.

497
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,560
I'll get to work.

498
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
Didn't I tell you to stay still?

499
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,160
Sit over there and rest.

500
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Hurry up.

501
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,000
Don't move!

502
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Come with me.

503
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,120
Have a seat.

504
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Can you be more self-aware?

505
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,000
I think I'm almost fine now.

506
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,480
It shouldn't be a problem.

507
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,280
Everyone is so busy.

508
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,400
I'm not doing anything.
Am I really here to supervise?

509
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,880
So what if you supervise us?
You said it yourself.

510
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,120
"You're almost fine."

511
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,360
"Almost" means you're not completely fine.

512
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,000
Endure it a bit, miss.

513
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,480
I just had surgery

514
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,040
and I already became a kid
that had to be told what to do?

515
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,560
You must have forgotten
the pain back then.

516
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,200
Who was in so much pain that night

517
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,960
that she clenched her fists

518
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,640
and kept punching about?

519
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,120
"Qi Xiao, I am in so much pain! Qi Xiao."

520
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,720
You're the typical person who forgets
the pain after recovering.

521
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,960
I have to do something.

522
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,480
Sitting and watching everyone working
doesn't make me feel accomplished.

523
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,080
"It's easy to find 1,000 soldiers,
but it's hard to find a good general."

524
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,360
Know your place.

525
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
If you do all the work,

526
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,400
what should soldier like us do?

527
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,760
It's so hard to be a general now.

528
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
The soldiers now

529
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,720
are so full of principles.

530
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,440
Miss.

531
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,680
Just rest.

532
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,240
If you need anything, tell me.

533
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,480
Stay still.

534
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,720
Everyone, hurry up.

535
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,840
Hurry.

536
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,080
Rest well.

537
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm going to Zhu Lin's place
to help him with something.

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,040
Okay, go.

539
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,240
I'm going to Zhu Lin's place.

540
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,560
Why are you so happy?

541
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Zhu Lin helped us so much before.

542
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,880
If you help him,
isn't that like I'm helping him?

543
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,200
Friends should help each other out, right?

544
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,000
Go and come back soon.

545
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,440
You have to go to work early tomorrow.

546
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,400
Get some rest.

547
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,880
Bye.

548
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,840
Shen Ruoxin, have you left?

549
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,600
I finally understood

550
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,080
that longing feeling when you can't see
someone you're in love with.

551
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,240
Every minute of every day is torture.

552
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,200
In love?

553
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,040
Who are you in love with?

554
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,560
Hot pot, skewers,

555
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,920
seafood, and grilled meat

556
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,920
are all my lovers.

557
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,280
<i>My longing for them now</i>

558
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,960
<i>is like the wildly growing weeds,</i>

559
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,400
rolling tides,

560
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,320
and raging wind.

561
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,000
Shen Ruoxin.

562
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,480
<i>- Cut the crap, Song Ziyan.</i>
- I--

563
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,880
Order the skewers and wait for me.
I'll be right there.

564
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
What a foodie.

565
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,800
Don't push your luck.

566
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,080
I let you eat so many skewers.
I'm so nervous.

567
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,280
You might end up in the hospital again.

568
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,720
Did you forget
what a patient's meal tastes like?

569
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
It's because I eat
too many patient's meals,

570
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,000
so I have to eat out today.

571
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,320
This is just like when you eat
candied fruits when you were little.

572
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,080
I'm your accomplice for having cavities.
Your mom will scold me later.

573
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,280
You're eating such strongly-flavored food.
What if your wound doesn't heal?

574
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm telling you.

575
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,600
Don't take everything so seriously.

576
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,680
Humans have evolved for millenniums

577
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,640
and finally reached
the top of the food chain.

578
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,760
They make me eat
bland food and vegetables.

579
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,960
Will my wound heal
if I don't eat or drink?

580
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,400
Besides, it has already been so long.

581
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
I can't eat spicy food

582
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,480
or even drink coffee.

583
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,080
I've lost my motivation to work.

584
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
This is when I feel

585
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,720
that the world is so nice.

586
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,040
Life is great.

587
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,760
Who is it?

588
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,120
Who won't let you eat spicy food
or drink coffee?

589
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,680
Who can tell you what to do?

590
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
Who can it be?

591
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,960
Qi Xiao.

592
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,000
All he says is,

593
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,240
"The doctor said…"

594
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
He's using the doctor's words as commands.

595
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,680
He's nagging me daily.

596
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,600
If I'm unhappy, you're happy?

597
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
I can't see that you're unhappy,

598
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,080
but I can see
that you're being coquettish.

599
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,120
Qi Xiao is quite interesting.

600
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,240
He can make you obey him.

601
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,880
He's really good.

602
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,680
One thing really conquers another.

603
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,680
Everyone has their match.

604
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,360
Shen Ruoxin.

605
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
I can finally see

606
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,920
some femininity on your face.

607
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,720
What are you talking about?

608
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,040
I'm his boss.
Of course he's concerned about me.

609
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,520
Yes, that's right.

610
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
You're his boss.
How dare he tell you what to do?

611
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,280
Yet you're so docile and obedient to him.

612
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,520
What does that mean?

613
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,880
It means you care about him.

614
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,800
I thought it was strange

615
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,680
that you two pretended
to be a couple at the hospital.

616
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,120
What's the matter?

617
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,240
Is it for real now?

618
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,200
You're unbelievable, Song Ziyan.
You're still laughing?

619
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm sorry.

620
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,360
My eyebrows are gone now.

621
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
How is that possible?

622
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,400
First of all,

623
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,120
to me,

624
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
Qi Xiao is like a little brother.

625
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,640
Why are you laughing?

626
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
Also,

627
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,880
Qi Xiao cares a lot
about everyone around him.

628
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,760
Like Su Yang and his mom.

629
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,960
It's because he's afraid of losing them.

630
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,040
He cares a lot

631
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,760
about his friends and family, right?

632
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,880
Also, I'm his boss.
It's only natural that he treats me well.

633
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,560
If I die one day,

634
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,320
who's going to help with his career?

635
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,080
In terms of our working relationship,

636
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,760
we're definitely
getting along well, right?

637
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,200
We get along well.

638
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,080
Save it.

639
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,040
You keep saying
that you see Qi Xiao as a brother.

640
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,920
From what I know about you,

641
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,440
you

642
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,840
like Qi Xiao.

643
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,840
Look.

644
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,640
Cui Lixin was nice to you too.

645
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,680
He took care of you.

646
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,920
Why weren't you this obedient?

647
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
You even thought he was annoying.

648
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,120
You have double standards.

649
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,160
Liking someone and having feelings
are different, you know?

650
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes.

651
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,040
I like Qi Xiao.

652
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,520
- Hey--
- That's because Qi Xiao

653
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
is competent, hardworking, and smart.

654
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,360
He's bright too.

655
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,760
He solved many problems for me
in the office, right?

656
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,280
It's not the kind of relationship
you're referring to.

657
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Besides, we have a huge age gap.

658
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,920
Twelve years.

659
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,240
So what?

660
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,600
An 82-year-old
can even be with a 28-year-old.

661
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,920
When it comes to true love,

662
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
why does age matter?

663
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,200
Don't set limitations
to wiggle away from this.

664
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,200
Listen up.

665
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Let me analyze you.

666
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,000
Shen Ruoxin.

667
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,200
You're like a hedgehog.

668
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
You have spines all over you.

669
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,440
You're in defensive mode all year round.

670
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,240
You look tough,

671
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,280
but deep down,

672
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,160
you're very soft and cowardly.

673
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,480
When love comes,

674
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
you roll up!

675
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
Roll up?

676
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,280
You're the one who's rolled up.

677
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,160
What's wrong with hedgehogs?
I think they're cute.

678
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,080
Cute?

679
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
Be careful not to poke yourself.

680
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,400
I'll poke you.

681
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,320
Stop eating.

682
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,880
Why not?

683
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
Hey, Zou Cheng! Have a seat.

684
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,440
Don't sit down.

685
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,360
Pay the bill.

686
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,240
Listen, she has been eating like a pig.

687
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,680
- Hurry, go!
- Let's eat together. Wait!

688
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,480
- Eat? Go!
- Wait!

689
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,120
Stop.

690
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,640
One,

691
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,400
two, three.

692
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,160
Wait. I'll have one last bite.

693
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,720
- You witch.
- It's so good.

694
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,000
Grab your bag. Let's go.

695
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Come on.

696
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,520
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

697
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,960
By the way, Zhu Lin,

698
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,520
back then,
I remember when you opened this studio,

699
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,280
you got an interest-free loan, right?

700
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
Yes.

701
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
I was still in college back then.

702
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,520
There was a policy that supported
college students' start-ups.

703
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
You can check out the latest rules.

704
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,200
See if you fit the requirements.

705
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
I'm a citizen.

706
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
I buy train tickets.

707
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
I pay for my meals.

708
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
I don't have a bad credit record.

709
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm sure it'll be fine.

710
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,280
Hey. Are you sure you want
to start your own business?

711
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,720
You won't be Ruoxin's assistant
anymore, right?

712
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,360
I feel a bit reluctant to leave.

713
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,320
I'm happy again.

714
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,720
You have satisfied your craving,

715
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,040
but I'm scared.

716
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,680
Don't let your little brother
yell at me later.

717
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,120
Would he dare?

718
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
He doesn't know.

719
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,600
I'll go to bed happy when I get home.

720
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,920
I thought you girls
were all about dieting.

721
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,040
You had supper so late at night.
How many calories are in that?

722
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Still, we can't miss good food
just because of calories.

723
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,240
Yes.

724
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,480
If I can't even eat,

725
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,200
then what

726
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,640
should I live for?

727
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,680
Okay.

728
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,000
You're both right.

729
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,880
I'll get going.

730
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
Drive slowly, Zou Cheng.

731
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

732
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
Honey.

733
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Don't pick me up anymore.

734
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,200
Why?

735
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,440
Because I think Ruoxin is very lonely.

736
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,040
It would be good
if someone could take care of Ruoxin.

737
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,120
She looks quite strong and independent.

738
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,400
But I still think that in front of her,

739
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,320
it's not appropriate for us
to be too sweet.

740
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,239
You're so sentimental.

741
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,360
How do you know
that she would think that way?

742
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,840
Perhaps she doesn't feel lonely.

743
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,080
She also has you, her best friend.

744
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,520
You even abandoned your husband at night

745
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,800
to have supper with her.

746
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
I think she's quite lucky.

747
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Hey.

748
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,360
How dare you get jealous of Ruoxin?

749
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
I can't do that.

750
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
I even have to compete with your students.

751
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,960
You're the boss. You call the shots.

752
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,680
<i>You're his boss.
How dare he tell you what to do?</i>

753
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Yet you're so docile and obedient to him.

754
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,960
What does that mean?

755
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,640
It means you care about him.

756
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,960
<i>From what I know about you,</i>

757
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,400
you

758
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,280
like Qi Xiao.

759
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
<i>This is the latest news.</i>

760
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,840
<i>Typhoon Hagupit will hit the city
at around 11 p.m. tonight.</i>

761
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,240
<i>Its landfall intensity
is of tropical storm level.</i>

762
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,600
<i>The city's western and southern sides</i>

763
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
<i>will experience heavy rain and downpours.</i>

764
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,080
<i>Please pay attention to this.</i>

765
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,680
<i>Close all doors and windows
and avoid going outdoors.</i>

766
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,000
What about the materials then?

767
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Hello, is this the moving company?

768
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I would like to call a few movers.

769
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,160
I have something very important to move.

770
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,600
Just some event materials.

771
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,520
Can you send more people?

772
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,040
I would like everything moved
before the typhoon hits.

773
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,000
A typhoon warning.

774
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,000
It will hit around 11 p.m.

775
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,280
It's already 10:30 p.m.

776
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey, don't go home tonight.

777
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,800
Just sleep here.
It's not safe on the road.

778
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,640
Put all that stuff in there.

779
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,240
Be careful!

780
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,360
Put them in.

781
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,600
Is your phone ringing?

782
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
- Take a look at it.
- Thank you, sir.

783
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
Don't worry about it.

784
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,680
Hello?

785
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Hello, Ruoxin.

786
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
Where are you?

787
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm at the venue now. I'm busy.

788
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,520
I'll get back to you later.

789
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,880
Go home now.

790
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
I'll go there, okay?

791
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
There's no need. I'm almost done.

792
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
I have to go. I'm hanging up.

793
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,640
Okay.

794
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,400
Hello?

795
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,400
Zhu Lin, I'm leaving now.

796
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,640
Hey!

797
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
You shouldn't ride a motorcycle
in a typhoon!

798
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,640
Miss.

799
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
Why did you keep so much stuff here?

800
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,040
Didn't you see the typhoon warning?

801
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,640
We have a three-day event.

802
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,560
The typhoon forecast said
it won't be intense.

803
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,280
So we didn't pack up anything.

804
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
Okay.

805
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay. We'll do it.

806
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,760
- Get in the car.
- Help me move them all then.

807
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,720
Okay, no problem.

808
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't worry about it.

809
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,600
- Help me move them all.
- Hurry.

810
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,720
All right.

Where are you, Ruoxin?

815
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,600
Hello?

816
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
Sir, do you have a power bank?

817
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,520
I don't have a power bank.

818
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,880
Sir, do you have a power bank?

819
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,880
I don't have one either.

820
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,320
Su Yang, go upstairs
and check if Ruoxin is back.

821
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,880
Call me right away when she's back.

822
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,640
Hurry up.

823
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,600
Okay.

824
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,440
Hello.

825
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,800
Did a cargo truck come tonight?
Do you know which company it is?

826
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
Hold on.

827
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,480
- I'll show you the car registration.
- Thank you.

828
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
I think they just left.

829
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,960
Only one cargo truck came tonight.

830
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,920
It's Xiaoma Movers.

831
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,080

833
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
I can move these two myself.

834
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,320
- Hurry up and leave.
- Okay.

835
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,960
The typhoon is bad out there.

836
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,760
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

837
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,720

- There's someone inside.
- No way.

845
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,440
We just finished the rounds.

846
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
There's a typhoon.

847
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
There is no one here.

848
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Did you see a cargo truck
unload materials earlier?

849
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,160
