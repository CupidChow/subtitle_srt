1
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
Thank you.

2
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Here. Have some juice.

3
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,480
Thank you.

4
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,080
I should be the one thanking you.

5
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm not surprised

6
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,280
that you can cook.

7
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,200
I didn't expect you to know how to sew.

8
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,360
Let me tell you.

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,560
My mom used to love buying

10
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,600
those so-called surplus clothes.

11
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,360
She thinks she got them cheap.

12
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,720
Since they are surplus,
they are bound to not fit.

13
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,840
So I must always get my clothes altered.

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,800
I remember one time when I was in school,

15
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,160
I had to wear a costume
for Children's Day.

16
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,840
My mom even bought that in surplus.

17
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,040
And at that time,

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,680
the seamstress nearby
went back to her hometown.

19
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,960
No one can alter it for me,
so I can only do it myself.

20
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,240
But it's not that hard.

21
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,840
I learned after doing it a few times.

22
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,680
Did you learn how to cook
because your mom can't too?

23
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
That's right.

24
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,240
My dad did all the cooking
when he was alive.

25
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
After my dad was gone,

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,720
I had to do it.

27
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,320
Otherwise, what will happen to my mom?

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
I really didn't expect

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,640
that you took such good care of your mom.

30
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,040
Unlike me.

31
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,720
I can't cook, just like my mom.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
After I went to college,

33
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,560
I couldn't go home daily.

34
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,560
She's learning how to cook now.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,440
But the taste…

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,880
Ruoxin, wait for me.

37
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
It's almost done.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,680
I'll make sure you look pretty later.

39
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,280
Don't rush. Take your time.

40
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,400
This way.

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,960
ETCS HOUSE

42
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,880
The owner of this gallery
is a good friend of my mom.

43
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,560
He's a talented architect.

44
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
He designed this gallery himself.

45
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:27,079
The architecture
of this gallery is really unique.

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,320
If you didn't lead the way,

47
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,040
I might have gotten lost.

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,000
By the way,

49
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,960
I'm meeting some capitalist friends today.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
I'll talk to them later first.

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,640
Do you need me to accompany you?

52
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Capital operation

53
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,040
sounds very boring.

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,080
Once men

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,680
talk business,

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,880
it's easy for them to forget
the women around them at times.

57
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Just walk around
and look at the paintings.

58
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,480
Looking at paintings
gives one peace of mind.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
If you like a painting,

60
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,200
tell me later.

61
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,280
I think the artist
needs to be packaged well.

62
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,200
This way,
it will promote capital operations.

63
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Am I right?

64
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,960
What do you think?

65
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,600
Is she your date?

66
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,240
Yes.

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,800
Let's go say hi.

68
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

69
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,200
- I'll let you two talk.
- I'll let you two talk.

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,360
You both can go ahead.

71
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Let the women chat.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,240
Let's discuss our business.

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

75
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
Minjie said that you studied law?

76
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Yes.

77
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,280
No wonder. I knew it.

78
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,720
Compared to his previous girlfriends,
you're much more elegant.

79
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,920
Mr. Xu is my boss,

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,080
not my boyfriend.

81
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
He's your boss now.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,360
Try harder.
He can be your husband in the future.

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,680
You're in your thirties, right?

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
You've taken good care of yourself.

85
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
But women

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
can't afford to get old.

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,520
As the old saying goes,
"Time is ruthless."

88
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,040
Make sure you seize this opportunity.

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,000
Women have to think clearly.

90
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,360
Nowadays,

91
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,520
if you want to find an eligible bachelor,

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,080
it's really not easy.

93
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
Especially at your age.

94
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,880
I didn't mean to offend you,

95
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
but you'll have to work hard.

96
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Please sit down. I need to return a call.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,600
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

98
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600
Have a seat.

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,280
Qi Xiao, I ran into Mrs. He two days ago.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,360
You like to eat
the glutinous rice she makes.

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Do you know?

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
She told me

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,680
that her daughter took her annual leave
two days ago and went with her to Hainan.

104
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,480
She said that it's so beautiful there
this time of the year.

105
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,840
Qi Xiao, when will you take
your annual leave?

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,240
When will you bring me there?

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't know when will it be done yet.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,800
One or two hours should be enough, right?

109
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,280
One or two hours?

110
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,800
Mom.

111
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
What did you just say?

112
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Qi Xiao.

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,880
Something's wrong with you.

114
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,520
Do you have a crush on someone?

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,680
No. How is that possible?

116
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,720
Are you sure?

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,240
No, Mrs. Qi. He doesn't.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,400
Why are you two acting strange today?

119
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
I'm telling the truth.

120
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,600
I was thinking about work earlier.

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,640
I'm working hard.

122
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,080
You're overthinking.

123
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,840
I was conceptualizing my webtoon, Mrs. Qi.

124
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,240
Are these the vegetables you prepared?

125
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
When can we eat then?

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,520
Hurry up.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
And don't waste them.

128
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,040
You're acting strange.

129
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
What are you thinking about, Snail Boy?

130
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Who are you calling "Snail Boy"?

131
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,640
You sew clothes and cook for her daily.

132
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,200
Aren't you Snail Boy?

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,920
Why are you so nosy?

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,640
It was nothing.

135
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
Anyway, I suggest

136
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,800
you give up.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,159
You and Ruoxin aren't a good match.

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,159
What are you talking about?

139
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
You're so complicated.

140
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
You're dense.

141
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,039
Sijia likes you

142
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,080
and you ignore her.

143
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,360
You want to hit me where it hurts?

144
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
What's the matter?

145
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Qi Xiao.

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,760
The vegetables.

147
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,480
We'll get this done right away.

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,440
Hurry.

149
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,800
PERSONAL INFORMATION, NAME: SONG ZIYAN

150
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,040
Drinking your sorrows away?

151
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,840
Is it because you can't get a job?

152
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,760
I feel like I'm good for nothing.

153
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Zou Cheng might be right.

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,520
What have I contributed to this family?

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,680
I just spent his money.

156
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,320
And I think I'm entitled to it.

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,480
You're his wife.

158
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,520
Even if he's the breadwinner,

159
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
that's what he should do.

160
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,840
No, he shouldn't.

161
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,560
I used to think

162
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
that when two people get married,
they should do everything for each other.

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,520
But that's not true.

164
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
Marriage is

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
a kind of governance.

166
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
If you don't contribute,
you don't get a say.

167
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Ruoxin.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Should I just stay home, have kids,

169
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,400
have a high-risk pregnancy,
and be a full-time mom?

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,280
Can you stop overthinking?

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,440
Zou Cheng is not that kind of man.

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,800
It's up to you whether you want
to have kids or not.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,200
It has nothing to do
with whether you can find a job or not.

174
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,960
How can you plan your life that much?

175
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,880
Look at me.

176
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
I worked in the Legal Department
for seven years.

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
Now, didn't I leave it too?

178
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm working in a new department now.

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,560
There's a lot to learn.

180
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
You are not in legal affairs anymore?

181
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,200
I like the new department.

182
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,080
I can start over.

183
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,960
I really envy you.

184
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
You're brave in whatever you do
and you always succeed.

185
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
Why do you always say that?

186
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,080
You never give yourself any credit.

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,680
What happened to the confident
Song Ziyan I used to know?

188
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,480
How was the Song Ziyan you knew back then?

189
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,560
She was super cool.

190
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
She got married when she wanted to.

191
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
She wanted to quit

192
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
and travel the world,

193
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,680
so she did it.

194
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
But that's not what I remember the most.

195
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,400
Do you know what it is?

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,720
Once the NCEE was over,

197
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,160
the two of us went to a rock concert.

198
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
You were jumping up and down next to me.

199
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,560
Once it was over, you told me

200
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,440
that you were going
to learn to play the drums.

201
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,320
I didn't take it to heart back then.

202
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
But a year later,

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,120
you took me to see your band.

204
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,960
While I was watching you on stage,

205
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
I thought, "My goodness,

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,840
Song Ziyan!"

207
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,160
You were glowing back then.

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,680
I thought,
"Who is this girl? She's so cool.

209
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
Do I know her?"

210
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,880
I was very diligent in learning

211
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,680
how to play the drums in college.

212
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,040
And I was completely full of zeal.

213
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

214
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,800
- May I sit down?
- Sure.

215
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,640
Hello, I really love your songs.

216
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,520
Is that so?

217
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,840
Actually, our songs aren't that popular.

218
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
We're just friends who hang out.

219
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,720
We sing what we want to express.

220
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,920
It doesn't matter
whether people like it or not.

221
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
A friend opened this bar.

222
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,320
We've only been performing here
for half a year.

223
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,520
I didn't expect people
to like our songs so soon.

224
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,400
The two of us used
to frequent this bar together.

225
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,600
Your songs are quite unique.

226
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,080
We really like your songs.

227
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,560
And when I first came here,

228
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,960
I thought it was great.

229
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
Every time I hear it
when I'm feeling down,

230
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
I feel differently about it.

231
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,680
I really think
you should release an album.

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,800
That way,
more people can listen to your songs.

233
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,120
Thank you for your encouragement.

234
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,160
Thank you.

235
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,320
RESUME

236
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,160
Are you looking for a job?

237
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Yes, but I can't find one.

238
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
Because I'm a housewife now.

239
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,840
Aside from cooking, I don't know anything.

240
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
So no one wants me.

241
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,280
You can cook?

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,520
That's great.

243
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,560
This bar's owner is my friend.

244
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,720
The bar doesn't serve good food these days
after the chef quit.

245
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,120
Do you want to give it a try?
We're short on people.

246
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,920
Me?

247
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,640
Do you think I can do it?

248
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,240
Try it. I'll talk to my friend.

249
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,520
Then you can decide.

250
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,280
Thank you.

251
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,640
Okay, all right then.

252
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
I'll talk to my friend.

253
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,160
Do you really want to be a chef?

254
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
What's wrong with that?

255
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,760
I think it's good to be a chef.

256
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,520
I just want to find a place that wants me.

257
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,040
I'd be happy to wait tables for free.

258
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,640
At least I can prove

259
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
that aside from having an aging uterus,

260
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
I have value.

261
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,680
You've always been valuable.

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,880
To me, you'll always be
the Song Ziyan who glows.

263
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,240
You're sweet. Come on, bottoms up for you.

264
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,200
Bottoms up for you.

265
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,200
When I'm with you,
my waistline always expands.

266
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Why isn't she back yet?

267
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,240
How long does it take
to attend an art gallery opening?

268
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
MESSAGE FROM SU YANG

269
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
WHO ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

270
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
Who are you waiting for?

271
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,080
Why are you so lame?

272
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,120
Just send her a WeChat message.

273
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,320
You're Ruoxin's assistant.

274
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,160
Shouldn't you contact her
if you need anything?

275
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,320
That makes sense.

276
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,480
<i>Ruoxin, is the event over?</i>

277
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
<i>Ruoxin.</i>

278
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,160
<i>I'll take out the stitches on the dress.</i>

279
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
<i>I have professional scissors.</i>

280
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,160
<i>Otherwise, it's easy to ruin the dress.</i>

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
<i>Bring the scissors over then.</i>

282
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,960
Ruoxin.

283
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,520
If you wear branded clothes,

284
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,840
is it easy to wear
the same outfit as others?

285
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes.

286
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
It's unavoidable to wear

287
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,400
the same outfit as others
for this kind of brand.

288
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,800
We can only blame our luck.

289
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,680
When I used to run an online shop,

290
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,320
I joined a lot of design groups

291
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,280
and met some fashion designers.

292
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,040
There's a designer
who specializes in evening wear.

293
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,960
It's not that expensive either.

294
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,920
It's more elegant.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Most importantly,
he only makes one outfit per design.

296
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Are you interested
in checking out their studio?

297
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,920
Do you have any photos? Let me see.

298
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,840
Let me check.

299
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,760
Here.

300
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Not bad. It's quite nice.

301
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,160
He designed these himself?

302
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
It's beautiful.

303
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,680
I can check out his shop sometime.

304
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,240
No problem.

305
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,400
Ruoxin.

306
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,000
I've done so much extra work
as an assistant.

307
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,280
Don't I get a bonus?

308
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,520
You know how to claim the credit now?

309
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,800
Where would I get the motivation
if there's no reward?

310
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,840
At most,
I'll reward you with a hot pot meal.

311
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,720
No. Having hot pot is not fun.

312
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
Can you do an activity with me?

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,680
What is it?

314
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,320
It's a legitimate game
of a legitimate business.

315
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,320
I promise it'll be more fun
than the amusement park.

316
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,960
What do you think? Do you dare to do it?

317
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
I'll deduct your pay if it's not fun.

318
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,079
It's a deal.

319
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,839
You tried to fool me.

320
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,920
They are all nice.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,560
Let's go to his shop tomorrow.

322
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,800
Sure, I'll tell him.

323
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
Okay.

324
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,880
This one is very beautiful.

325
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,160
This is nice too.

326
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,360
He just started his business, right?

327
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,720
Yes.

328
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,120
In the current situation,

329
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,960
either sell luxury brands at a premium

330
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,840
or have an online shop
that sells things cheaply.

331
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,760
Now it's hard for minor designers' brands
to survive indeed.

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,360
And the rent in the city
is very expensive.

333
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
My friend is only able to afford to rent

334
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,200
because he does part-time jobs for others

335
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,840
from time to time.

336
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,960
Luckily, he has repeat customers.

337
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,440
Also, friends like us
refer friends to him too.

338
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,200
So he doesn't care much
about the location.

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,160
Starting a business isn't easy.

340
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,720
How many people's dreams are hindered by
high real estate prices in the big city?

341
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,160
Yes.

342
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,520
It's here.

343
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.

344
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,640
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

345
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
What do you think? It's nice, right?

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,080
Zhu Lin.

347
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,200
This is Ruoxin.

348
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,240
This is the owner, Zhu Lin.

349
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,600
- Hello, Ruoxin.
- Hello.

350
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,920
Qi Xiao said you want
to see evening attires.

351
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,040
Feel free to look around.

352
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,200
Pick anything you like.

353
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,400
If it doesn't fit,
I'll fix it on the spot.

354
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,560
Thank you.

355
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,680
By the way, Qi Xiao,
I sold two outfits yesterday.

356
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,640
The buyer bought your bracelets too.

357
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
I'll transfer the money to you later.

358
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,440
And for the clothes outside,
can you check and make some designs too?

359
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,400
No problem.

360
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Take your time then.

361
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,160
Your side business is going well.

362
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
I sort of hit it off with Zhu Lin.

363
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,120
His design concept

364
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,320
is quite in sync with mine.

365
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,920
It's hard to survive in a big city.

366
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
That's why we must help each other

367
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,320
and collaborate.

368
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,280
Of course, Mr. Zhu Lin is the focus.

369
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,520
- This one--
- This is nice.

370
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,720
The fitting room is over there.

371
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,720
- Try it on.
- Okay.

372
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,840
How do I look?

373
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,520
I think it's okay.

374
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,000
Is it nice?

375
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,960
Yes.

376
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,480
Is something missing?

377
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
Wait for me.

378
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,120
What are you doing?
You're cutting his clothes?

379
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,120
You'll see. Stay still.

380
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,640
How is it? Is it more unique this way?

381
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,560
I think it's really more unique this way.

382
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
How is it, Zhu Lin?

383
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,160
I think it looks better.

384
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,320
I'll alter it that way then.

385
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,160
- I'll take it off then.
- Okay.

386
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,160
You're good.

387
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,160
Why don't you just quit and work with me?

388
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,880
I don't want to.

389
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,320
Why?

390
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,440
You're a local and you can pay the rent.

391
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,040
You're under less stress
than migrants like us.

392
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,600
You don't even dare to give it a try.

393
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm telling you.

394
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,360
After working at a big company
for a long time

395
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,720
and getting used to a comfortable,
but restrictive vibe,

396
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,160
you'll become systematic.

397
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,120
It's only a matter of time
before your inspirations disappear.

398
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't worry.

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,640
I'm not after the comfort
of a big company.

400
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,840
It has nothing to do with it.

401
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,240
What's the reason then?

402
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,680
It's mainly because my boss
is more capable than you.

403
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,680
She's more good-looking too.

404
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,040
So girls over friends?

405
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,040
I'm telling you.

406
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
I have a lot of female customers.

407
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,880
Having a handsome guy like you
will be useful.

408
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,120
So you're not after my talent,

409
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,120
but my good looks.

410
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,040
- Is it heavy?
- It's okay.

411
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,040
You don't have to worry about attending
events with Mr. Xu anymore, right?

412
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,920
The point is I bought so many of them,

413
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,320
and they cost less than
a branded clothing on sale.

414
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,880
And every one of them is nice.

415
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,680
Before your friend becomes famous,

416
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
I must buy more.

417
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,720
After he becomes famous,
I won't be able to afford it.

418
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,400
Since you're done shopping now,

419
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,960
it's your turn to keep me company.

420
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,960
Do you remember?

421
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,360
You promised to play with me,

422
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,400
miss.

423
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,240
Based on your facial expression,

424
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm not going.

425
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I'm kidding.

426
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,280
Let's go kart racing.

427
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,840
Kart racing is fine.

428
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,000
Do you know how to do it?

429
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
Are you kidding me?

430
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,480
I have a driver's license.

431
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,000
I can drive cars, let alone go-karts.

432
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
You're quite arrogant.

433
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,840
ZHU LIN'S FASHION DESIGN STUDIO

434
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,640
<i>This track is 480 m long.</i>

435
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,120
<i>There are 13 turns.</i>

436
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,840
<i>The feeling of speed on it is great.</i>

437
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,400
<i>You can experience it later.</i>

438
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
Ruoxin.

439
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
It's your first time, right?

440
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,640
Let's go.

441
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,960
Drive slowly later.

442
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,000
I've had my driver's license
for six years.

443
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,840
Isn't the brake on the left

444
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,320
and the gas on the right?

445
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,120
Ruoxin, are you okay? Are you hurt?

446
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,840
How's your neck?

447
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
- Did you twist it?
- I'm fine.

448
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Come on.

449
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,480
Why don't we forget about it?

450
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,000
Let's have hot pot, okay?

451
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
We're already here. Don't be a killjoy.

452
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,200
Let's continue.

453
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,600
Can you help me lift this?

454
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,160
You are good, Ruoxin.

455
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,080
You are even good at drifting.

456
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,120
My boss is the best.

457
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
You've learned to suck up to your boss.

458
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,800
Don't try to be slick.

459
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,840
I was just teasing you.
Why are you so serious?

460
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,160
Competition is like a war.

461
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
Since we've decided to do it,

462
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,960
we must do our best.

463
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Let's compete with our abilities.

464
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,040
I hate it when people go easy on me.

465
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,040
In that case, let's compete.

466
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,320
The one who loses

467
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,720
will buy the hot pot.

468
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,440
It's a deal. Let's begin now.

469
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,240
Hi, Su Yang.

470
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,240
What's the rush? I won't run away.

471
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,360
If you dare to run, I'll…

472
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,320
catch you.

473
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,960
By the way, did they sign the contract?

474
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,720
They paid the deposit too.
It went smoothly.

475
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,800
That's great.

476
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
After this one,

477
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,920
you'll keep getting more work
in the future.

478
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,960
I hope what you said comes true.
Thank you for finding me a job.

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
What do you want to eat today? It's on me.

480
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,080
I want to go to the night market
next to our school.

481
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,360
Erguang Wontons,

482
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,480
Changjiao Noodles,

483
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,080
grilled squid,
and buttered clams with garlic.

484
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,120
My mouth is watering
just thinking about them.

485
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,880
Let's go to the night market then.

486
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,760
- Come on.
- Come on.

487
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,720
ERGUANG WONTONS

488
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,680
It's so sweet. It's delicious.

489
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,320
The Changjiao Noodles is over there.

490
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I really want to buy it.

491
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,480
- Sure.
- It's delicious.

492
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,160
YANG'S DUMPLING

493
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,720
Su Yang.

494
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,160
I know.

495
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,280
You have a lot of worries

496
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,720
and concerns
to take responsibility for me.

497
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,600
Maybe in the future,

498
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,760
you might not stay in Shanghai.

499
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,800
But perhaps

500
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,360
I'll leave this city too.

501
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,720
But you might possibly stay in Shanghai.

502
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,920
I'll stay in Shanghai too.
Let's work hard together.

503
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,040
We can afford

504
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,880
to live here forever.

505
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,920
The future has so many possibilities.
Who knows what will happen?

506
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,880
Su Yang.

507
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,280
I like you.

508
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
When I'm with you,

509
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
I feel so happy.

510
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,040
I don't want to miss out
on this kind of happiness.

511
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
If I miss out on it,
I'll surely regret it.

512
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,360
What about you?

513
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,280
Aren't you afraid

514
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,320
that your future self will regret it?

515
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,600
I don't want to have any regrets.

516
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,320
That's why I keep working hard.

517
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,640
I can't make any promises right now.

518
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,840
However,

519
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,920
I want to stay.

520
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,280
I want to stay in Shanghai.

521
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,440
Let's work hard together.

522
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,880
Maybe you'll get more and more work.

523
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,040
You'll make more than finding
a regular salaried job.

524
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,280
I'm not as optimistic as you.

525
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
I'll keep looking for work.

526
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,000
I won't give up.

527
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,000
It's so cold.

528
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,680
- Let's have milk tea.
- Okay.

529
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,840
Taro Boba Milk Tea.

530
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,280
- Okay.
- Let's go.

531
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,120
Thank you.

532
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Su Yang, have some.

533
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm sorry.

534
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
- Is it gone?
- Yes, it is.

535
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,560
- Let's go.
- Come on.

536
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,560
Thank you.

537
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,400
It smells so good.

538
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,400
Here.

539
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,840
Come on.

540
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,400
Did you eat something bad?

541
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,160
Get me some medicine.

542
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
Here, drink some hot water.

543
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,680
What exactly did you eat?

544
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,160
I'm guessing

545
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,640
it's the night market's food
that caused it.

546
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,680
My limbs feel wobbly.

547
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,000
I feel weak all over.

548
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,360
Where's the medicine?

549
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,560
We don't have any.

550
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,760
I'll go and buy some for you.

551
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,320
Just sit on the toilet and don't come out.

552
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,880
You won't have to run back and forth.

553
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,440
I'll be right back.

554
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay.

555
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,840
Here's the activity budget.

556
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,760
Okay.

557
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,640
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Xu's driver suddenly quit.

558
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,760
I was just informed

559
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,920
to interview a suitable driver quickly.

560
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,040
The new energy car business
has just started.

561
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,520
There's a lot of work outside the office.
We need a driver.

562
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,280
I asked the HR Department
to compile driver profiles for me.

563
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,480
I'll narrow it down first.

564
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,600
Any suitable ones?

565
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
They are always a bit lacking.

566
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,880
Either they are too old,

567
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,360
not experienced enough,

568
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,800
or have a bad driving record.

569
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,200
I'll have to ask HR
for another batch of people.

570
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,240
Mr. Xu needs to go out
of the office a lot lately.

571
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,920
He needs the car often.
This is so annoying.

572
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
Ruoxin, what do you think of me?

573
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,640
Should I fill in for him first?

574
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Are you sick?

575
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,560
Are you crazy?

576
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,520
You're even interested
in working as a driver?

577
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,040
Doesn't Mr. Xu need the car urgently?

578
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
We can't delay important things
because we don't have a driver.

579
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,000
Mr. Xu said

580
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
the New Energy Department
is an in-house venture.

581
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,640
We have to be like a startup company.

582
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,880
We can't be specialists.
We must be all-rounders.

583
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,040
Why are you so concerned
about Mr. Xu lately?

584
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,760
Are you going past my head
to be close with the boss?

585
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,960
I swear to you, Ruoxin.

586
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm trying to solve your problem.

587
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Fine.

588
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,960
It's not wrong to get close to the boss.

589
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,360
I'll grant your wish then.

590
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,520
- Hello, Sijia?
<i>- Will you send the information or not?</i>

591
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,560
<i>- I've been waiting for so long.</i>
- I'm coming.

592
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,120
I'll bring it now. Don't panic.

593
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm rushing
to deliver a document to Sijia.

594
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,200
It's decided then.

595
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
I'll start today.

596
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,640
I'll get familiar with the car
this afternoon.

597
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
I'm sorry.

598
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,840
What are you doing?
I brought the document for you.

599
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,320
Just leave it on my desk. Thank you.

600
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,360
You have an upset stomach too?

601
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,800
Don't get me started.

602
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,480
I've just been going
to the bathroom all morning.

603
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,440
You ate at the night market
with Su Yang last night, right?

604
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,239
My stomach hurts.

605
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
Something's up.

606
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,960
Hello, Ruoxin?

607
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,719
I'm taking Mr. Xu home now.

608
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
I taught you how to drive go-karts.

609
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,400
Don't worry. He'll be safe and sound.

610
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,960
I'm hanging up.

611
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,280
Qi Xiao.

612
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,639
Did you teach Ms. Shen
how to drive go-karts?

613
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,480
Yes, Mr. Xu.

614
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,480
We just went to relax

615
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,440
and relieve stress from work.

616
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,800
Did Ms. Shen say that she's stressed?

617
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,920
No, she didn't.

618
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,080
But I know.

619
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,120
Ms. Shen is very serious
about what she does.

620
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
And she's very demanding of herself.

621
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,960
She always strives to improve at work.

622
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,640
With her personality,
she'd be stressed no matter where she is.

623
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,000
Besides, we are new
to the New Energy Department.

624
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,960
There's still so much to learn.

625
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,720
I heard that you willingly followed her

626
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,360
from the Legal
to the Administration Department.

627
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,480
We can't hide anything from you.

628
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,280
Didn't Ms. Shen offend
Ruan Ye and Mr. Liu before?

629
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,960
They seized the opportunity

630
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,280
to drag Ms. Shen down.

631
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,120
Ms. Shen hired me.

632
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,720
Of course I should go with her.

633
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
I didn't expect

634
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,360
that at a young age,

635
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,720
you understand

636
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,360
what loyalty means at work.

637
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,320
Ms. Shen has good taste.

638
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,520
She was right about you.

639
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,200
Mr. Xu.

640
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,560
Can I ask you a question?

641
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,400
Go ahead.

642
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,640
Do you

643
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,000
admire Ms. Shen too?

644
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,160
Of course.

645
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,680
Why do you think I transferred you both
to the New Energy Department?

646
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,120
What do you admire about her?

647
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
Like you said,

648
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
she's capable,

649
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,920
responsible,

650
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,320
and a fast learner.

651
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,040
Most importantly,
she has a good character.

652
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,520
So you just admire
Ms. Shen's capability as a boss?

653
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,200
Of course.

654
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,840
What else can it be then?

655
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Forget it.
I'm just randomly saying things.

656
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,960
Your guess

657
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,480
might not be wrong either.

658
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
Mr. Xu.

659
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,680
What do you mean?

660
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,040
Nothing.

661
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm just saying

662
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,560
that Ms. Shen

663
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,600
is pretty, smart, proper,

664
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
generous, and kind.

665
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,720
She has so many good points
that a woman should have.

666
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,880
Even if a man admires her,

667
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
it's only natural.

668
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,480
Don't you agree?

669
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,600
Yes.

670
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,000
Mr. Xu.

671
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,000
It's almost time to eat.

672
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,680
Why don't I bring you
food before going home?

673
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,600
There's a hot pot place nearby
that Ms. Shen loves.

674
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,960
She said that it's on par
with the authentic hot pot place

675
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,320
you went to in Chengdu.

676
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,560
We didn't eat hot pot in Chengdu.

677
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,160
She said that she wasn't full
after eating with you.

678
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,520
I know she loves hot pot,

679
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,960
so I found her a place.

680
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,640
Then she went to eat by herself.

681
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,360
She wasn't full?

682
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,480
Interesting.

683
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,800
Mr. Xu.

684
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,280
The place that Ms. Shen likes is up ahead.

685
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,440
She treated me
to a meal for the first time there too.

686
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,080
How about we…

687
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Let's go there.

688
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,800
Let's go to the hot pot place
you both like.

689
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,880
Let me see how good it is.

690
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,280
Okay, I got it.

691
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,200
HONGJIE HOT POT

692
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,200
Mr. Xu, let's sit over there.

693
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,160
Thank you.

694
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,320
Mr. Xu.

695
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,040
The ambiance isn't that good,
but it's delicious.

696
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,600
Since we're already here, try it.

697
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,200
Okay.

698
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,280
Waiter, take our order.

699
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,240
Mr. Xu, can I have one?

700
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,360
BEWARE OF HOT POT

701
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

702
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,960
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

703
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,960
- Here, Mr. Xu.
- Thank you.

704
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
Nice.

705
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,560
Mr. Xu, please eat.

706
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,640
Are you and Ms. Shen both from Shanghai?

707
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,600
I didn't expect that you could
eat such spicy food.

708
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,400
Actually, I couldn't eat
spicy food before.

709
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,080
But to welcome me on my first day of work,

710
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,200
Ms. Shen brought me here for hot pot.

711
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,960
At that time, she even said,

712
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,240
"If you can't eat spicy food, learn.

713
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,840
If you can't eat spicy food,
how can you be my assistant?"

714
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,320
So I started learning it.

715
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,440
In the process,

716
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
I got addicted to it.

717
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,880
Mr. Xu.

718
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
For the tripe,

719
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,920
dip it eight times.

720
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Ms. Shen taught me that.

721
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,000
Try it.

722
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,920
You eat it.

723
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,840
Spicy food isn't good for my stomach.

724
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,560
Tapas?

725
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,560
<i>Hello, Mr. Xu.</i>

726
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,600
Hello.

727
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Do you have any fresh scallops today?

728
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,320
<i>Yes, they just flew in today.</i>

729
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,720
Okay. I'll have the paella then.

730
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,840
<i>Okay.</i>

731
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,240
Did you get a delivery for ham too?

732
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
<i>Yes, we did.</i>

733
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
Okay. I'll take one too.

734
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,320
Pair it with the freshest honeydew melon.

735
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,720
Ask Roger to make a salad dressing for me.

736
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,680
<i>What kind do you want?</i>

737
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,720
- Vinaigrette, please.
<i>- Okay.</i>

738
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,440
Please deliver it to my place in an hour.

739
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,840
- Thank you.
<i>- Yes, Mr. Xu.</i>

740
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,920
Mr. Xu.

741
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,000
You're really not going to eat anymore?

742
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,800
You can practice eating spicy food.

743
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,280
Look, you often work with Ms. Shen.

744
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,640
When you're working, you must eat.

745
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,040
- So you--
- Spiciness

746
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,000
is a fierce taste.

747
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,560
But sometimes, it can confuse

748
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,480
the basic taste buds of humans.

749
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,600
I've always believed

750
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,080
that when one's taste buds
are truly opened,

751
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,360
tasting more exquisite

752
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,800
and complex flavors

753
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,760
would be more interesting.

754
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,520
Ms. Shen is smart.

755
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,680
I believe that in working with me,
she'll get used to it soon,

756
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,360
including life outside of work.

757
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,840
Then she'll understand

758
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,480
what she really needs.

759
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,520
After all,

760
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,080
in such a practical world,

761
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,280
no one will refuse
a more elegant way of living.

762
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,280
What do you think?

763
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,720
Okay.

764
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Hurry up and eat.

765
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,840
I need to continue working at home.

766
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,640
Okay.

767
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,480
