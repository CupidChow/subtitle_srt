1
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,680
Ruoxin.

2
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,880
It has been a while since we last chatted.

3
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
How are you?

4
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,680
- How's work at the department?
- It's not bad.

5
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
With the New Energy Department,

6
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,320
it must be tough to manage both ends.

7
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
I can still manage.

8
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,520
It's such a rare opportunity for me

9
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,560
to learn and expand my knowledge.

10
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,160
I'm grateful.

11
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Good.

12
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
I was right about you.

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,960
Your ability and attitude

14
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,520
have always been top-notch.

15
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,120
I'm sorry about the previous
self-ignition case.

16
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Now that everything is cleared
and the case is over,

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,800
you're overqualified
to be in the Administration Department.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Ruan Ye is new to the Legal Department
so he's not familiar with many things.

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
He requires assistance.

20
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,760
Why don't we have
an internal restructure next week

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
and transfer you back in?

22
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,200
What do you think?

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
You don't want to?

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,440
Tell me your thoughts

25
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,840
or if you have any requests.

26
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
Mr. Liu.

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Thank you for the offer.

28
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,440
I heard Mr. Ruan is doing well

29
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,800
and has a firm grasp of the department.

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,160
He too has his working habits,

31
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
so I don't think
I'll be of any use to him.

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,360
You're worried about that?

33
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,960
I've talked to him.

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,080
The little hiccups before

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
was because of work.

36
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,240
You will not be mistreated if you return.

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Of course, I know you and Mr. Ruan

38
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,720
are generous people.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
But this time,

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
I've also reflected on myself when I was
in the Administration Department.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,400
Although I've been working here
for a long time,

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,600
I've only worked in the legal field

43
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,920
and I'm unfamiliar
with business and operations.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,320
I lack a holistic view.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,400
When I was dealing
with the self-ignition case,

46
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,440
I made several mistakes.

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,160
So I think

48
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,080
it would be best for me to learn more

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,080
while being in other departments.

50
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,360
This way, it's better for me

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,040
and my career development.

52
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,560
So I think, Mr. Liu,

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,360
I've decided

54
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,600
not to go to the Legal Department for now.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
So you would rather stay
in the Administration Department

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
than return to the Legal Department?

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,480
I want to learn more.

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,600
Well, I can't force you either.

59
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,600
After all, it is your career plan

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,880
and everything depends on you.

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Ruoxin.

62
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,560
What did Mr. Liu want?

63
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
Let's get some coffee.

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
I guess you must have rejected
Mr. Liu's offer.

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,000
The Legal Department
is currently managed by Ruan Ye.

66
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,800
Will we have a good life if we return?

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,520
I can tell that you're interested
in the New Energy Department.

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,000
So if there's a choice
between the two departments,

69
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,480
you'll definitely choose the latter.

70
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,640
I know why you like
the New Energy Department.

71
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,640
Why?

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,480
Because you like looking at the stars.

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,360
Now, the city is so polluted

74
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
and haze is everywhere.

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,240
If new energy vehicles
were to substitute fossil-fueled vehicles,

76
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,840
pollution will be under control

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,120
and more people

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,480
will be able to see the stars at night.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Isn't that great?

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
True.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Correct.

82
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,320
That's one of the reasons.

83
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
But

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,440
I have another reason.

85
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,320
What is it?

86
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
My dad used to be a surgeon.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,280
When I was 17 years old,

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
he decided to leave town.

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
But my mom strongly opposed it.

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,120
Back then, our family was fighting all day

91
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,680
and I couldn't understand
why he chose to do what he did.

92
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,000
On the day he left,

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,760
he told me something.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,160
He said,

95
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,200
"We should live a meaningful life."

96
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Maybe it's because I'm at this age,

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,360
but I would often ask myself

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,880
what's the meaning of life.

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Although the new energy vehicle industry
is still emerging

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,200
and this is just the beginning,

101
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,200
there are bound to be obstacles ahead.

102
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,120
But I think it's something interesting

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
and meaningful.

104
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,600
So let's do it.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,680
I want to try.

106
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,160
That's why I'm here.

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
Since you've made up your mind,

108
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,600
you should tell Mr. Xu.

109
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm your assistant after all.

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Wherever you go,

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800
I will go too.

112
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
Let's do our best.

113
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,360
Let's do our best!

114
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,800
You're amazing.

115
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,640
Why work as a receptionist
when you have a degree?

116
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
Nowadays, in this situation,

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,080
it's hard to get a job.

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,640
I studied marketing

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,920
and wanted a job in sales,

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,800
but companies aren't hiring newbies.

121
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
They want experienced workers,

122
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,320
especially those with resources.

123
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,320
Someone as ordinary as me

124
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,480
with normal looks

125
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,040
and plain family background

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
can only be a receptionist.

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
On our recruitment notice, we stated that

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,280
we're looking for young ladies
from age 25 to 28 years old.

129
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,760
I know.

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,200
But I'm a loyal customer of your brand.

131
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,559
I know all the products very well.

132
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,559
Also,

133
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
I studied economics in college

134
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,320
and when I worked at the bank,

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
I have customer reception experiences.

136
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,840
I believe I'm competent for this position

137
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,800
and can sell to the right customers.

138
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
Firstly,

139
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,880
at all of our stores,

140
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,680
we emphasize appearance.

141
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,080
Secondly, your experience in banking

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
doesn't apply in sales at all.

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,720
Furthermore, those were years ago.

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,560
Could you please give me a chance?

146
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm not afraid of hardship

147
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
and I'm a fast learner.

148
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Tenacity

149
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,320
is not a unique advantage.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
Those young ladies out there

151
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,480
can take hardship too.

152
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
When it comes to working late

153
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,960
and staying radiant the next day

154
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,440
to welcome customers,

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,040
can you do it?

156
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
Can you really beat the young?

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,960
- Ruoxin.
- Yes?

158
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,760
Leaders from all regions branch
will gather for the coming training

159
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,640
of the New Energy Department.

160
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
Mr. Liu and Mr. Xu request
for a get-together.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,520
So do a headcount and book a restaurant.

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,120
Yes. I'll get to it.

163
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,280
Right in front, Mr. Liu.

164
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,680
This team is built…

165
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Turn left, in room six.

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,160
Mr. Liu, right in the middle.

167
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,280
Mr. He, right here, please.

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,880
Mr. Xu.

169
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,360
- Mr. Liu.
- Please serve us premium oolong tea.

170
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,360
We brought our wine.

171
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
Can you give us a discount?

172
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,520
About this…

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
I'll have to ask my manager--

174
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,600
Please let me talk to him too.

175
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
- Let me get him.
- Thank you.

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,560
Ruoxin, the drivers are seated
at the lobby outside.

177
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,480
Well done.

178
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

179
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,800
Thank you.

180
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,800
Waiter.

181
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,120
Please remove these two chairs

182
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,080
so that there's more space.

183
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,080
Ruoxin, it's a bit crowded in here.

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,360
Can you sit outside with the others?

185
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,160
Everyone is old-timers,
so please take good care of them.

186
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
If we need anything, we'll call you.

187
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
We are having a reunion today,

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,080
so we won't leave sober.

189
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,920
- Cheers.
- Toast to that.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,880
Mr. Liu,

191
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,120
it is a bit crowded here.

192
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,680
Why not I remove my chair
and entertain the others?

193
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,000
Ms. Shen can take care of everyone here.

194
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,160
I already said

195
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,320
that this is our reunion.

196
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
Didn't you hear me?

197
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
Right, we'll head out.

198
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Have a good meal.

199
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,800
If anything, please let us know.

200
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,400
Let's go.

201
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
Right.

202
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,440
Please start serving the dishes.

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,040
Mr. Xu.

204
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,600
How should we drink the first glass?

205
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,880
Up to you.

206
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,720
You're the host.

207
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,200
It's all up to you.

208
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,480
All right.

209
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,600
I'll be the first to toast.

210
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,960
You can do whatever you want, Mr. Xu.

211
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,400
The rest can do it yourselves.

212
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,840
I have to follow suit.

213
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,800
I should do a one-shot too.

214
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,960
I want to thank Mr. Liu for his care.

215
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
But if we do a one-shot,

216
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,080
Mr. Liu should drink more.

217
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
I'll drink three shots.

218
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,760
Come.

219
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
- First shot.
- Slowly, Mr. Liu.

220
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
Mr. Liu is quite the drinker.

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,520
I am very certain of this.

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
The last time we had a drink,

223
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,480
he totally knocked me out flat.

224
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
So for this second shot,

225
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,880
Mr. Liu has to drink from this glass.

226
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,480
Is this revenge?

227
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,080
- There's no such thing.
- One for the mood.

228
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,320
I will finish this glass.

229
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
Come on.

230
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,640
Go on.

231
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,800
Good.

232
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
Mr Liu is quite good.

233
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,040
Come on.

234
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,160
It's full.

235
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,040
More orange juice coming.
Does anyone want some?

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,320
- Here, I'll pour it for you.
- Right. Thank you.

237
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,320
There's more.

238
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,720
- Right.
- I'll leave it here.

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,520
- Please enjoy your drink.
- Thank you.

240
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
- Let's eat.
- This is tasty.

241
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,440
Eat more.

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,160
Please go ahead.

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,920
- Eat some.
- Okay, thank you.

244
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,840
Mr. Wu, one shot!

245
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,120
What happened to Wang Lei?
He has been with me for three years.

246
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,600
- Then he moved.
- Not bad.

247
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,120
He's exceptional.
Thank you for training such talents.

248
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Next is me.

249
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
Come.

250
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
Mr. Liu,

251
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
hold on to your glass.

252
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,400
Hold on to your glass.

253
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,240
Right, okay.

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,640
Since I came to East China,

255
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,480
you have taken great care of me.

256
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
I'd like to toast to that.

257
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Okay.

258
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
One-shot.

259
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Come.

260
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,240
There's one more thing.

261
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,480
Before I came,

262
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
the chairman specifically asked me
to learn from you, Mr. Liu.

263
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,560
I've learned so much from you.

264
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,960
So this next toast

265
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,040
is from the chairman.

266
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,960
Cheers.

267
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Mr. Liu.

268
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,600
Mr. Xu represents the chairman,

269
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
so you can't just drink one glass.

270
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
- Come, use this glass.
- Here.

271
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
- Here.
- Here.

272
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
- This one.
- Here.

273
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
- Pour.
- Pour.

274
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,400
- Come, Mr. Liu.
- Cheers.

275
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Let's cheers.

276
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,160
- Let's toast.
- Cheers.

277
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
I'll finish this one glass then.

278
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I hope you put in good words for me
in front of the chairman.

279
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,640
Sure, Mr. Liu.

280
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
Cheers.

281
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,760
Cheers.

282
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Cheers.

283
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,400
Come on, Mr. Liu!

284
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,200
Great!

285
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,560
- Great!
- Great!

286
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,840
- One-shot.
- Thank you, Mr. Liu.

287
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,520
Mr. He.

288
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,840
Mr. He, your ride is here.

289
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,200
- Okay, thank you.
- Be safe.

290
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,160
Goodbye.

291
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,360
Mr. Xu, your ride is there.

292
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Thank you.

293
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,800
Slowly, Mr. Liu.

294
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,400
Mr. Liu, the door.

295
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
The door is right here.

296
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
Mr. Liu.

297
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
Go away.

298
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,440
You're just acting high and mighty.

299
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are you okay?

300
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,760
Mr. Liu.

301
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,600
The car is here. Be careful.

302
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,880
Watch your head.

303
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,800
Slowly.

304
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,880
You can leave now.

305
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,360
Don't mind it.

306
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,400
He's drunk.

307
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,400
And you kicked him?

308
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,680
Let's go.

309
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,040
Ruoxin.

310
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Liu Pei was a big bully tonight.

311
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,400
He wants to get back at you for refusing
to return to the Legal Department.

312
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,080
He cast you aside
to sit with the other drivers

313
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,160
and scolded you while he is drunk.

314
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,160
I don't understand.

315
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,680
Since we will be under Mr. Xu,
why do you still tolerate him?

316
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,640
Then what do you want me to do?

317
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Go against him in public?

318
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,640
But if you go to Mr. Xu,
he will definitely help you.

319
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,680
Qi Xiao.

320
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,080
To you, I'm a manager.

321
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,440
A person in a high position.

322
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,840
But in that room,

323
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,320
in front of the bosses

324
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,720
and in their eyes,

325
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm just like you.

326
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm just a small fry.

327
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,640
Do you think Mr. Xu would go
against Mr. Liu because of me?

328
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,760
We haven't even moved
to the New Energy Department.

329
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Even if we did,

330
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,440
we still have to tolerate him.

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
But he's really too much.

332
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,079
It's a big slap to you.

333
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,200
I can't tolerate that.

334
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Face is the most important thing
at a workplace.

335
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
A man must learn to be flexible.

336
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,560
No one is forever glorious.

337
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,880
And no one is forever unlucky.

338
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
Are you a man?

339
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,040
You're a young lady.

340
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,120
Are you sharing my empathy?

341
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,920
I am a manly woman.

342
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,840
I'm not that weak.

343
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,440
Let's go.

344
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,280
Let's go home.

345
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
ELEVATOR

346
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,040
<i>Waiter.</i>

347
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Please remove these two chairs

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,720
so that there's more space.

349
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,800
Ruoxin, it's a bit crowded in here.

350
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,360
Can you sit outside with the others?

351
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,200
Go away.

352
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,760
You're just acting high and mighty.

353
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,720
<i>Today has been depressing.</i>

354
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,120
Hello, my dear.

355
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,040
What's up?

356
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,520
I was job hunting the entire day

357
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
and realized Zou Cheng was right.

358
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,720
Aside from having babies,

359
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
what else can I do?

360
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,240
Don't feel so frustrated.

361
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
The economy is not good,
so jobs are not easy to find.

362
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,520
Keep trying.

363
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
I'm asking others

364
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,680
to help you look for a job.

365
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,520
I really regret

366
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,120
those days working at the bank.

367
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,480
It feels like a prison.

368
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,840
<i>I thought if I get married,</i>

369
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
I'll have my freedom.

370
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,480
I didn't expect that this day would come.

371
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,960
<i>Ruoxin,</i>

372
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
<i>I really admire you.</i>

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
You relied on nobody

374
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,200
and kept going.

375
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,040
Now, you're a senior manager.

376
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,800
<i>But look at me.</i>

377
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
<i>You know,</i>

378
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
even the subway shops are only looking

379
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,400
for those below 30 years old.

380
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,440
What should I do?

381
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,600
All right, don't feel bad.

382
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,880
Look at you.

383
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,240
You admire me, but I admire you.

384
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,040
<i>Look at how lucky you are.</i>

385
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,200
<i>If something were to happen,
you are still a housewife.</i>

386
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,640
But me?

387
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,240
I can only move forward

388
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
and there's no turning back.

389
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,600
Isn't that right?

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,360
<i>The title "senior manager" sounds nice,</i>

391
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>but in reality,</i>

392
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,960
who knows our bitterness at work?

393
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,880
Only you.

394
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Who else would listen to you?

395
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,960
<i>As they say,
we are all but little ducks swimming.</i>

396
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,600
Others only see what's above the water.

397
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,000
Peacefulness and the leisure of living.

398
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,640
But no one knows
what happens beneath the water.

399
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
How our feet desperately

400
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
struggling to paddle.

401
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,520
<i>No matter the difficulty,</i>

402
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,280
we can always overcome it

403
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,480
because everything will pass.

404
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,640
So let's just continue to paddle, okay?

405
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,600
Ruoxin, thank you.

406
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,680
You're the only one who encourages me.

407
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,280
<i>That's why I said,</i>

408
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,760
rather than men,

409
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I'd rather have a best friend.

410
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,200
All right, my best friend,

411
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
stop feeling down.

412
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,480
Nothing is impossible.

413
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,800
Go to bed early.

414
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay. Good night.

415
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,000
SONG ZIYAN

416
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,800
SONG ZIYAN

417
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,560
Honey, what are you cooking?

418
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,240
I'd like a bowl of it.

419
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,240
I'm doing nothing of great importance.

420
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,680
It's not worthy of your taste.

421
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,640
Honey,

422
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,480
I wasn't thinking straight the other day.

424
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,600
I admit it.

425
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,880
I want to eat whatever my wife prepares.

426
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Right.

427
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Why? You haven't had dinner yet?

428
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,520
Home-cooked food is still the best.

429
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,560
Go wash your hands. It's almost ready.

430
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,640
I thought you had a job.

431
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Why are you gaming?

432
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,280
We're finalizing the contract

433
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
and I'm looking for inspiration.

434
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,040
While gaming?

435
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,000
Hey, I want to ask you something.

436
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
Do you think Ruoxin is a manly woman?

437
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,320
I don't think so.

438
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,760
I think she's fairly feminine.

439
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,240
I think so too.

440
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,600
Something is wrong.

441
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,600
Nothing is wrong. Go away.

442
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,040
MR. XU, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

443
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,240
MR. XU, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT. I'D LIKE
TO JOIN THE NEW ENERGY DEPARTMENT…

444
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,440
<i>Mr. Xu, I've thought about it.</i>

445
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,840
<i>I'd like to join the New Energy Department</i>

446
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,960
<i>and I understand the overall planning.</i>

447
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,280
<i>I hope you can give me a chance.</i>

448
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,960
<i>Okay.</i>

449
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
It's me.

450
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Don't come to Shanghai yet.

451
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,360
I've thought about it

452
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,440
and it's best for you to stay home
and look after the headquarters.

453
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,240
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

454
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,440
- Good morning, Ms. Shen.
- Good morning.

455
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,680
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

456
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,400
- Good morning, everyone.
- How do you do?

457
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

458
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,840
- Good morning, Mr. Xu.
- Welcome.

459
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
New environment.

460
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,640
- Do you like it?
- Yes, absolutely.

461
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,080
It's not complete yet

462
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,920
because we still lack manpower.

463
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
But I believe

464
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,960
more are going to join us soon.

465
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,720
I think this is great.

466
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,440
We are a new team that'll grow bigger.

467
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,480
Plus, such an open space environment
is particularly good

468
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,360
for colleagues to get along

469
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,800
and communicate.

470
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,760
We must continue being this confident.
Get familiar with everything.

471
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,960
Today,

473
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,280
we have new colleagues joining us.

474
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,440
I believe we'll move forward stronger.

475
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,480
Today after work,

476
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
let's have a get-together.

477
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Choose a restaurant.

478
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,480
Anything is fine.

479
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
It's my treat.

480
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
- Okay.
- Great.

481
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
What's the matter?

482
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,080
Nothing.

483
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I just think dinner is a waste of time.

484
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,640
We can get acquainted with the others
through a get-together

485
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,800
and build rapport in the future.

486
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,040
That's true.

487
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,640
A new environment is good.

488
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,680
At least, there are no more rumors.

489
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
Well said.

490
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,680
SINCERELY INVITES YOU TO JOIN
FLOWERS, HONEST

491
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,320
Understood.

492
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,480
- Lunchtime.
- Thank you.

493
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,400
- Ruoxin.
- Yes?

494
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,040
Does changing your department
require you to change your closet?

495
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,440
These clothes are so expensive.

496
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,640
Mr. Xu needs to attend functions
and request my company.

497
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,280
I need to prepare a few decent outfits.

498
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,480
Branded ones are expensive.

499
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,160
I'm not buying it
since I'll only wear it once.

500
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm renting them.

501
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,000
Fortunately, there's this rental site.

502
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,120
Why do you have to accompany him
to attend such events?

503
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
You're not his secretary.

504
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Is attending functions part of our KPI?

505
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
This is for work.

506
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,240
The New Energy Department is expanding

507
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,080
and we need more partners.

508
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Those industry elites

509
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,240
including venture capitalists,
often attend these events.

510
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,960
It's good to socialize

511
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
and explore opportunities.

512
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,800
I should engage and learn more

513
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,720
to better understand our business.

514
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,680
Right.

515
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,200
Our lovely colleagues
from the New Energy Department,

516
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,720
you're all carefully selected elites.

517
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,080
Some of you

518
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,280
have been with me since the beginning,

519
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,200
some are old trustees from East China

520
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,960
and I don't mean age.

521
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,600
Plus, our newcomers.

522
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,880
So I hope

523
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,680
no matter what your background is,

524
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,960
from now on, we are one as a team,

525
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,200
bound together

526
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
to reach a common goal.

527
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,920
To work together

528
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,200
unanimously to accomplish results

529
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,040
and expand our New Energy Department.

530
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

531
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

532
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,920
Ms. Shen, come on.

533
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,920
We are a team now.

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,280
Everyone is drinking except you.

535
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,800
That's not what unity is.

536
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm driving today.

537
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Ms. Shen,

538
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,320
you can get a valet.

539
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,600
- Right?
- That's true.

540
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
- True.
- Get a valet.

541
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,920
Sir, Ruoxin doesn't drink.

542
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,760
Ms. Shen.

543
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
I just transferred here.

544
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,400
Mr. Xu told me you're a senior manager.

545
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,760
So this is a toast to you.

546
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
Ms. Shen is a lady.

547
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160
Be considerate.

548
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
I'm all about equality.

549
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,280
Be it a woman or man,

550
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,520
we are all in this together.

551
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,000
We are comrades in arms.

552
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,120
Aren't we, Ms. Shen?

553
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,360
That's true.

554
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,960
If I don't drink, I'll be a killjoy.
Come on.

555
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,920
Sir.

556
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
Everyone,

557
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,960
Ruoxin and I are a team.

558
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,400
So I'll drink on her behalf.

559
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,600
Sir, cheers.

560
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,080
All right.

561
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Good.

562
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
Ms. Shen.

563
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,720
Me too.

564
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,440
I'd like to toast to us.

565
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's toast.

566
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,400
Sir.

567
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,600
Good.

568
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,360
- Great.
- What about us?

569
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,800
- Yes.
- We want to toast too.

570
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,240
Calm down, everyone.

571
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,160
He's still young. Don't force him.

572
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Let's drink responsibly.

573
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,640
Come.

574
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,760
- Come.
- Qi…

575
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,720
Qi Xiao!

576
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,160
Everyone,

577
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,080
I'll drink on behalf of her.

578
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,760
Please be kind to us.

579
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,680
- Good.
- Together.

580
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,240
- Come.
- Please be kind to us.

581
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,000
- Drink some soup.
- Okay.

582
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,720
Don't overdo it.

583
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm fine.

584
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,640
Ms. Shen,

585
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,200
this assistant of yours

586
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,000
is not bad, right?

587
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,160
Don't overdo yourself.

588
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,680
I'm fine.

589
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,600
Come, Ms. Shen.

590
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,920
Just now, the glass was for unity.

591
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,960
This glass

592
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,560
is to our beginning.

593
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
Let's all prosper!

594
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
What say you, kid?

595
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,040
Will you take this glass?

596
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,760
- Sure, I'll drink--
- It's all right.

597
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,680
Just take care of yourself.

598
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,040
I must take this one.

599
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,080
If not, I'll be a killjoy.

600
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,040
Cheers.

601
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
Ms. Shen, you can't drink.

602
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,000
- Stop.
- Sit down.

603
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,520
Come.

604
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,880
I'll drink on behalf of Qi Xiao.

605
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,040
Anyone else wants another round?

606
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,600
- No.
- No more?

607
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,560
No more.

608
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,640
Then let's dine and drink.

609
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,680
Order whatever you want.

610
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,600
Come on.

611
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,400
Let's all prosper!

612
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,520
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

613
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,920
Ruoxin.

614
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,280
Slowly.

615
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,920
Take care.

616
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,760
Careful.

617
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,720
Okay.

618
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
Watch your head.

619
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,480
Watch your head.

620
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,640
Sit properly.

621
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,800
Right.

622
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
In you go.

623
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,640
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

624
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
Can you handle him alone?

625
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,440
Should I send him home?

626
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,400
It's fine, Mr. Xu. He's my neighbor.

627
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,200
I'll call his housemate when I arrive.

628
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,920
He will be able to deal with it.

629
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
Okay.

630
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
Drive slowly.

631
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,920
I will, Mr. Xu. Rest well.

632
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,320
Text me after you've arrived.

633
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
Yes.

634
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Are you all right?

635
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,080
Why did you drink so much?

636
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Put on your seat belt.

637
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,400
Slowly. Raise your hand.

638
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,560
This hand…

639
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,000
HIRING

640
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,920
HIRING

641
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Qi Xiao, here.

642
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,560
Drink some water.

643
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,120
Open up.

644
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Slowly.

645
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Drink more.

646
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,720
Wait.

647
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,160
Your head.

648
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,520
Move over a bit.

649
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,280
Right, open your mouth.

650
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,400
Take this.

651
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,280
Drink more.

652
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Could you

653
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,560
open your mouth?

654
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,800
Quick, open it.

655
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,160
That's a good boy.

656
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Another mouthful.

657
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,840
How do you feel?

658
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
Rest well.

659
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,920
Do you feel better?

660
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,640
Here's some medicine.

661
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,520
Drink this later.

662
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
Ruoxin.

663
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,240
Do you like this kind of life?

664
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
What sort of life?

665
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
Carry branded bags,

666
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,960
wear branded clothes,

667
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,960
and adorned themselves with jewelry.

668
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,920
Drive luxury cars, live in mansions,

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,240
and go to high-end places every day.

670
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,760
Be around society's elites

671
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,480
and negotiate million-dollar contracts.

672
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,440
Kid, are you drunk?

673
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,600
You've been with me for so long
and you still don't understand me?

674
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,360
What are you laughing at?

675
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,680
I just like to laugh when I'm drunk.

676
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,800
Let's go home.

677
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,120
Home!

678
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Sit tight.

679
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Slowly, Su Yang.

680
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,080
- Why is he so drunk?
- Slowly.

681
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,760
He drank on my behalf
during our department's get-together.

682
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,800
His bag. Take this medicine tomorrow.

683
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,080
- Okay.
- Rest well.

684
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
- All right, thank you.
- I'm going.

685
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,200
Don't go.

686
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,440
What are you doing?

687
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,720
This is how you treat a drunk?

688
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
I know how much you can drink.

689
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,400
You even had medicine.

690
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,120
Why are you lying to her?

691
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Liar.

692
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,440
You're the liar.

693
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,960
I got your parcel.

694
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,960
Thank you.

695
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
The clothes are here.

696
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Are you going to an event?

697
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,560
An opening event for an art exhibition.

698
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,000
It looks good.

699
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,040
Let's see.

700
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
Oh my. The size is too big.

701
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,200
What's wrong? Not a good fit?

702
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,360
These are rental clothes.
I can't be picky.

703
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,120
I'll only use it once.

704
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,760
That's not right.

705
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,440
It won't be good if it's too big
and you'll look awkward.

706
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,440
Why don't I help you adjust it?

707
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,120
You're not just a jewelry-maker,
but also a tailor?

708
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,400
How talented.

709
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,080
What a relief.

710
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,600
- Hi, Ruoxin.
- Come in.

711
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,240
Are you eating cup noodles?

712
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,480
Sometimes, when I'm lazy.

713
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,560
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I have.

714
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,840
- Do you have eggs?
- In the refrigerator.

715
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,160
Wait a minute.

716
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,440
How do you live like this?

717
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,400
Wait a minute.

718
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,520
Done.

719
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,840
It smells so good.

720
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
Here.

721
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,080
Chopsticks.

722
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
You made this cup noodles

723
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,520
look so classy.

724
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,520
If I knew you were having noodles,
you should have joined us.

725
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,480
We had fish and meat today.

726
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Enough for you.

727
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,400
You and Su Yang can cook?

728
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,240
It's cheaper to cook.

729
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,600
Let me try.

730
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,360
Tasty.

731
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Make yourself at home.

732
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,560
Okay.

733
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,480
How tasty.

734
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
Ruoxin.

735
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
Did you take all these pictures?

736
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
They are good.

737
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,720
Are you interested?

738
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,280
Thank you for the compliment,

739
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
but these are pictures from NASA.

740
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,000
I bought some on professional sites.

741
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,800
If you like, I can share it with you.

742
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,760
Hold on.

743
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,080
Here.

744
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,400
Look.

745
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,200
Log in to this website.

746
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,120
Log in and you'll see

747
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,880
five remote observatories.

748
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,040
See?

749
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,960
Here.

750
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,360
Choose a telescope.

751
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,640
A different telescope

752
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,280
takes different kinds of pictures.

753
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,600
Click here.

754
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,560
Select a date.

755
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,720
They will help you take pictures
at the selected time.

756
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,440
Click here to pay.

757
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,320
Of course, the price varies
depending on the choice of the telescope.

758
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,240
And click here to complete the payment.

759
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,920
Your appointment is successful.

760
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,360
After the booking,

761
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,800
they'll take the pictures

762
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,200
and send them to your email.

763
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,360
But the pictures are not colored.

764
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,560
They are in greyscale.

765
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,000
To get these colors,

766
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
you need to render it.

767
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,440
Ruoxin,

768
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,080
I realize that when you talk
about astronomy and stars,

769
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,240
your eyes lit up.

770
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,640
It's a totally different side of you.

771
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Really?

772
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
How pretty.

773
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,720
Go and finish your noodles.
It's getting soggy.

774
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,320
All right, here.

775
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,160
- Okay.
- Download from this site.

776
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,880
There are a lot of good pictures.

777
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
Qi Xiao, I'm ready.

778
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,760
Okay.

779
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,480
It's a little big.

780
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,440
Qi Xiao.

781
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,200
The shoulder.

782
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,040
- Wait for a moment.
- Okay.

783
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
All right.

784
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,680
