00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm not Zhe Qian's servant.

77
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,740
If it weren't for you, I would be so scared.

78
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,740
You have to complete the mission first.

79

Hurry and pack up and go see him.

85
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,140
You must make him so confused

86
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,340
that he'll take you back to your home.

87
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,460
This time, the Imperial Guards

88
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,700
will be in big trouble.

89
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,060
They're counting on you to steal

90
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,060
the alchemy map in his father's study.

91
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,300

92
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,580

93
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,100
Don't worry.

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,580
I have the anti-anxiety powder.

95
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,700
When he wakes up,

96
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,860
he'll only remember that he's drunk.

97
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,180
Then he'll have a spring dream.

98
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,860
After that,

99
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
he'll never want to be a man again.

100
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,620
Your Highness,

101
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,260

102
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,740
I can't.

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,180
I can't smell it in here.

104
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,380
Is this the place?

105
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,380
I can't stay here.

108
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,380
I don't want to stay in the house of the church anymore.

109
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
After the banquet,

110
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,380
can you take me back to my house?

111
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
Okay.

112
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
After the banquet,

113
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
I'll take you back to your house.

114
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,380
I'll take you back to my house.

115
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380

116
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,380

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
Dance.

118
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,380
The six Taoist priests are here.

119
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
The six Taoist priests are here.

120
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
Magistrate Zhao.

121
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Magistrate Zhao.

122
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

123
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
It's okay.

124
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,380
I've received your birthday gift.

125
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,380
How can I not come?

126
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Please, your highness.

127
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Dance.

128
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,380
Zou Yue.

129
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,380
Dance.

130
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Dance.

131
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
How dare you!

132
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,380
Magistrate, why is this?

133
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
The next sentence is that the general died in a hundred battles.

134
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
I, Shen Zhangzheng, am honored to be the general.

135
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I'm honored to be the general.

136
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,380
I, An Gu, dare to cover up the evil spirit and curse Shen Shang.

137
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,380
I deserve to die.

138
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,380
Please calm down, your highness.

139
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
I dare not do this.

140
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
I dare not do this.

141
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Magistrate Zhao seems to have the seal.

142
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
I was stupid.

143
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
I misjudged it.

144
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,380
I'm afraid that the spies of An Gu have sneaked into the mansion.

145
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Magistrate,

146
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
among the evil spirits,

147
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,380
there are some who are involved in the crime.

148
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Please bring back all the evidence.

149
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
Sit down.

150
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Thank you, your highness.

151
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,380
Your highness,

152
00:12:35,380 --> 00:13:00,000
the

153
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Magistrate,

154
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
in this case,

155
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,380
the suspicion on me has been solved, right?

156
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Only the bribe sent by the spies,

157
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
there is no spy.

158
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
What you said is,

159
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,380
they

160
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
are all fake.

161
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Then take it off and kill it right away.

162
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Take it off for Shiyi.

163
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
As you command.

164
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,380
Guards!

165
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Please spare me, your highness!

177
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
Go!

178
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380

Sir, please forgive me.

I'm innocent.

184
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
Go!

185
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Beauty, I know you're innocent.

186
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
But who told you to meet

187
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
the last time you met Mr. Zhao?

188
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,380
Kneel down!

189
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
No!

190
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Hurry!

191
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
What's wrong?

192
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,380
Don't be afraid.

193
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,380
You'll see what happens later.

194
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
What's wrong?

195
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
Wait!

196
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
There's a pearl on Mount Qingshan

197
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,380
that I'm willing to give you.

198
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,380
I just want a full body.

199
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
I'm innocent.

200
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,380
He's a hunter.

201
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,380
Wait!

202
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
Don't kill him yet.

203
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Judging from his moves,

204
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,380
he looks like

205
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,380
the Zhu Yiwei of the State of An.

206
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Go!

207
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,380
Be careful!

208
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
Ru Yi?

209
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
No! Ru Yi!

210
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,380
No, Ru Yi!

211
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Only the dead can keep their secret.

212
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
When you entered the White Bird Camp,

213
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
the Blood Bird Division didn't teach you.

214
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
But...

215
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,380
We've known each other for a long time.

216
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Who are you?

217
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Why are you so powerful?

218
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Didn't you want freedom?

219
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,380
Now is the perfect opportunity.

220
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,380
The people in the division don't know

221
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
that we're not among the dead.

222
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,380
But we have to take the antidote every half year.

223
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,380
If we run away now...

224
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,380
That's not worth mentioning.

225
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,380
As long as the poison is the weakest

226
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
before the poison is released,

227
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
the poison can be reduced.

228
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,380
Really?

229
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Do you believe that?

230
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
How do you know so much?

231
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,380
With your skills,

232
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
you can even be the Purple Crescent.

233
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
How can you be mixed with me?

234
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,380
I've always

235
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
treated you as a weak woman

236
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,380
who doesn't know anything.

237
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,380
I'm not anyone.

238
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
I'm just a ghost.

239
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Are you coming with me?

240
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
No.

241
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380
Yulang is still here.

242
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
I can't leave alone.

243
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Why are you a Baiquan?

244
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,380
To pay off my debt.

245
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,380
My brother is sick.

246
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
My mother can only sell me.

247
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Why is your brother sick

248
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
and your mother sells you?

249
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Isn't your life a life?

250
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,380
Ten years ago, for a man,

251
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
your family sold you.

252
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
Ten years later, you want to

253
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,380
put your life in another man's hands.

254
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Is it worth it?

255
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
It is.

256
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,380
Yulang and I...

257
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
Ruyi,

258
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
you'll be a little aunt soon.

259
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Go back.

260
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Tell the people in the branch

261
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
that I died in the Six Halls.

262
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
According to the rules,

263
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
after Baique died,

264
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
he was treated as a kind family

265
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,380
and he could be free.

266
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,380
Take it.

267
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
It's for the sake of the family.

268
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,380
Take care.

269
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
Wait.

270
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Tomorrow at 10 o'clock,

271
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,380
I'll bring the food and food to the West Garden.

272
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,380
I've never owed anyone money in my life.

273
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
I'll help you make up for your sins.

274
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,380
You help me ensure that my family

275
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,380
is safe and sound.

276
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
No! Ruyi!

277
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,380
No, Ruyi!

278
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,380
Only the dead can really protect themselves.

279
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,380
When you entered Baique's camp,

280
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,380
the bird's nest didn't teach you anything.

281
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
But...

282
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,380
after all, we know each other.

283
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Louder.

285
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,380
A report from the palace.

286
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,380
Five days ago, our army, the Beiyang Army,

287
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
was defeated at Tianmen Pass.

288
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,380
Look.

289
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,380
Say it again.

290
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,380
Our army was defeated at Tianmen Pass by the Beiyang Army.

291
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,380
Lian Shixu, Cai, Jing, Zancheng.

292
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,380
Your Majesty.

293
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
Your Majesty is still in a dilemma.

294
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
Nonsense.

295
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,380
Jingyang has finally fallen.

296
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,380
This is the King of the Danian Kingdom.

297
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
He's calling for the White House to attend the meeting.

298
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,380
Go to the Prime Minister's mansion.

299
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
Go.

300
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Go.

301
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,380
Is there anyone alive?

302
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Is there anyone?

303
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,380
Don't make a sound.

304
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Don't bring the people from the Anguo Dazao battlefield here.

305
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,380
Nuanzhou?

306
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
Longqiangqi's Fire Army?

307
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
You're still alive?

308
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,380
General Xiao, you have a good memory.

309
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,380
I have a good memory.

310
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,380
Nuanzhou, you were just pretending to be dead.

311
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,380
Stop it.

312
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
There seems to be something out there.

313
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,380
I really heard someone talking just now.

314
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,380
There must be something out there.

315
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Check it out!

316
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Check if there are any survivors out there!

317
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Yes!

318
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,380
Run!

319
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Run!

320
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,380
I wanted to hide in Junzhou and get out of the capital.

321
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,380
But I still can't wake up.

322
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,380
Nuanzhou,

323
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
you're so good at fighting.

324
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Why are you a Fire Army?

325
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
I'm lazy.

326
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm leaving.

327
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,380
Where are you going?

328
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm already dead.

329
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,380
Nuanzhou, you can't leave!

330
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,380
The soldiers of the Great Wu Army

331
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,380
can't be the escapees!

332
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
Go back with me now.

333
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,380
We'll gather our forces and work together.

334
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,380
What for?

335
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,380
His Majesty is already captured.

336
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,380
How dare you!

337
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Go!

338
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Okay.

339
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,380
Come.

340
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,380
Look here.

341
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,380
This arrow was shot from behind.

342
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,380
Do you understand?

343
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,380
I was planning to kill us.

344
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
But His Majesty listened to the message

345
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,380
and gave us a clear answer.

346
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,380
The war is in full swing,

347
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
there's no movement.

348
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,380
And he's also killing us.

349
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,380
General Xiao.

350
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,380
You have to serve

351
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Your Majesty's orders.

352
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,380
You have to be loyal.

353
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,380
That's your choice.

354
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,380
But I don't want to play anymore.

355
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,880
I don't owe you anything.

356
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,880
Ning Wenzhou, listen to me.

357
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,380
Wait for me.

358
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,380
See you later.

359
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,380
After the war,

360
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
the people are in deep sorrow.

361
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
The war has been broken.

362
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,380
The people are in deep sorrow.

363
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
The war has been broken.

364
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,380
The war has been broken.

365
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
The late emperor died.

366
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,380
Anguo asked the army to suppress the enemy.

367
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,380
The army is out to fight.

368
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,380
The country cannot be left without a leader.

369
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,380
The country cannot be left without a leader.

370
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,380
Before the late emperor died,

371
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
he personally ordered the king of Dan Yang to take over the country.

372
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
he personally ordered the king of Dan Yang to take over the country.

373
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
So, the king of Dan Yang should immediately take over the country

374
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,380
and the world will be at peace.

375
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I agree.

376
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,380
It's about the position.

377
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
How can you be hasty?

378
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,380
His Majesty died because of rumors.

379
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,380
There is no solid evidence.

380
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,380
How can you...

381
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,380
Your Highness, what do you think?

382
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Your Highness, what do you think?

383
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,380
Your Highness, what do you think?

384
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,380
The late emperor died because of rumors.

385
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,380
His Majesty died because of rumors.

386
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Who dares to call out the late emperor?

387
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,380
Your Highness.

388
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Your Highness, what do you think?

389
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Your Highness, you are a thousand years old.

390
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
My cousin Xiao Ming

391
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,380
also went on a expedition with His Majesty.

392
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,380
I just received a secret letter.

393
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,380
The letter said that even though His Majesty lost,

394
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,380
he still had a chance to win.

395
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
He still had a chance to win.

396
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
He still had a chance to win.

397
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
The letter said that even though His Majesty lost,

398
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380
he still had a chance to win.

399
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
He is currently staying in the An State's military camp.

400
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,380
He is currently staying in the An State's military camp.

401
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Not only that, I have a deep desire.

402
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
Not only that, I have a deep desire.

403
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
The Imperial Hospital has decided to make it difficult for me.

404
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,380
The Imperial Hospital has decided to make it difficult for me.

405
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,380
King of Dan Yang,

406
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,380
when you and His Majesty were studying in the study room,

407
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
the late emperor personally said that

408
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,380
the late emperor personally said that

409
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,380
the people of the mortal realm are like brothers.

410
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,380
the people of the mortal realm are like brothers.

411
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,380
You probably haven't forgotten it.

412
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
Now that His Majesty is in trouble,

413
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,380
I wonder if Emperor Dan Yang, as the leader of the imperial clan,

414
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,380
I wonder if Emperor Dan Yang, as the leader of the imperial clan,

415
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
can you take care of this dragon coat

416
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
for His Majesty and the prince in my arms?

417
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,380
for His Majesty and the prince in my arms?

418
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
I will surely beChildren,

419
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,380
I will surely beChildren,

420
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,380
and not fail to obey

421
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,380
the request of His Majesty back then.

422
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
and not fail to obey the request of His Majesty back then.

423
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
But...

424
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,380
But...

425
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Your Highness, how do you determine

426
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,380
Your Highness, how do you determine

427
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,380
You must have a prince in your belly.

428
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Since the Empress is pregnant,

429
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,380
it's a great misfortune for us.

430
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,380
I think we should keep the situation

431
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,380
and let Lord Dan Ya suffer.

432
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,380
After the Empress is pregnant,

433
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
we can decide the country by the man and woman.

434
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Please, Empress,

435
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,380
for the people,

436
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
for the people.

437
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
We will not agree.

438
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
I have heard

439
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
what happened at the meeting.

440
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
Lord Dan Ya is now in control

441
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,380
and it's hard to control him.

442
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
Fortunately, the Empress is pregnant.

443
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,380
Even if we can't have a prince,

444
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,380
as long as you give the order,

445
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,380
I can get one.

446
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Lord Dan Ya will not be

447
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,380
more obedient than a little yellow cat.

448
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,380
No.

449
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,380
The Emperor's death

450
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,380
is the news from General Xiao.

451
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,380
You six Daotang are responsible

452
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,380
for protecting the Emperor's heavenly path,

453
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
but there is no news.

454
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,380
This is the first time

455
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
that I have heard about the difference

456
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,380
between the two paths.

457
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,380
I haven't heard from them for days.

458
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,380
I think it's because I'm lazy.

459
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,380
You haven't heard from them?

460
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,380
The news of the heavenly path

461
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,380
was reported every two days.

462
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,380
You have been in charge of the six Daotang for so long

463
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,380
and you still haven't figured it out.

464
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
I am incompetent.

465
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,380
No wonder

466
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,380
you are always complaining about the six Daotang.

467
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,380
I was really confused

468
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
and I used Ning Yuan Zhou to promote you.

469
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Go to the six Daotang.

470
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,380
I have been sick for so long.

471
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,380
I have to see it with my own eyes.

472
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,380
What have you done to my six Daotang?

473
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

474
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

475
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

476
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

477
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

478
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

479
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

480
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

481
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

482
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

483
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

484
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

485
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

486
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
I will go to the six Daotang.

487
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,380
The six Daotang.

488
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
Tell me.

489
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Where does the six Daotang

490
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
live in our Da Wu court?

491
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Yes.

492
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
The six Daotang

493
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
was created by the Tai tribe.

494
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
The Tai tribe.

495
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,380
It is the tribe that

496
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
is known for its silk and silk silk.

497
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,380
There are six Dao in the Tang.

498
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,380
The Tian Dao.

499
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,380
It is the protected by the Qing Gui clan.

500
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,380
The Ren Dao.

501
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,380
It is the surveillance of all the officials.

502
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,380
The Asura Dao.

503
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
It is the handling of the goods and the buying of the goods.

504
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,380
The San Shan Dao.

505
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,380
The Dao Zhong Chen.

506
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
The San Er Dao.

507
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,380
The Dao Zhong Chen.

508
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
The evil Dao is the one that creates the traps.

509
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,380
The Chushen Dao is the one that

510
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,380
is the one that is known for its silk and silk silk.

511
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
The hell Dao is the one that is known for its secret killing.

512
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
The hell Dao has been

513
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
created by Ning Yuan Zhou.

514
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
They will always dig up all kinds of information.

515
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
Why are you still talking about secret killing?

516
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
I know.

517
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
The people that

518
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
the Tang leaders

519
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
are all from the three

520
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,380
high-ranking Dao.

521
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,380
And you are from the Ren Dao.

522
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
You have been

523
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
the leader of the family for generations.

524
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
I thought that

525
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,380
after the death of Master Song,

526
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
you would have a chance to be the leader.

527
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
But you didn't think that

528
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,380
he would only use the three evil Dao

529
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
to create the hell Dao.

530
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Ning Yuan Zhou.

531
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,380
You are of course hating him.

532
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Right?

533
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
No.

534
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
I remember that Ning Yuan Zhou

535
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
had the Chushen Dao

536
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
sent to all the other countries.

537
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
He set up 108 secret

538
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,380
killing sites.

539
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
But now,

540
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
why are there so few pigeons?

541
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
They all flew out.

542
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Really?

543
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,380
Ning Yuan Zhou

544
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
also set up the hell Dao.

545
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
He sent the Dao

546
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,380
that the Ying Shang had originally rejected

547
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,380
to Sen Luo Hall.

548
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,380
He gave the secret report to the Ministry of Defense

549
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,380
after it was changed to a trap.

550
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
But now,

551
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
where is the secret report?

552
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,380
Where is the key?

553
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,380
I...

554
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,380
I...

555
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
After you found it,

556
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
you destroyed them all.

557
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
You destroyed them all!

558
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
You destroyed them all!

559
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
You destroyed them all!

560
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,380
No wonder you were so miserable

561
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,380
when you were married!

562
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
I am sorry, Uncle.

563
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
Shut up!

564
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
I am just a lowly concubine.

565
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380
You can't call me that!

566
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Listen to me.

567
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
If it wasn't for your aunt,

568
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
I would have killed you!

569
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Now,

570
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,380
go to the prison

571
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,380
and bring Ning Yuan Zhou out.

572
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
I want to send her to the Dark State.

573
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
To the Dark State.

574
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
The Dark State?

575
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,380
I want her to see

576
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,380
if she is really alive.

577
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,380
Didn't Ning Yuan Zhou

578
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
lurk in the Dark State?

579
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,380
I want her to think before the Dan Ya King

580
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,380
and get the hand-picked

581
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
hand-picked imperial edict

582
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
from the Dan Ya King.

583
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,380
But Ning Yuan Zhou

584
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,380
is with the Dan Ya King.

585
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,380
I am afraid that

586
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,380
she won't find Ning Yuan Zhou.

587
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,380
What?

588
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,380
She won't find Ning Yuan Zhou!

589
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,380
You are not even

590
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
a soldier!

591
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,380
You must bring Ning Yuan Zhou

592
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
to see me in seven days.

593
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Otherwise, I will let your aunt

594
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,380
see you in seven days.

595
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Yes.

596
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,380
Sir,

597
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,380
what should we do?

598
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,380
In seven days,

599
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,380
we must find Ning Yuan Zhou.

600
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,380
But

601
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,380
isn't she already dead?

602
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,380
What if she isn't?

603
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,380
She will definitely come back

604
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
if she is alive.

605
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Let Xu Jun go find her.

606
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,380
Of course, Xu Jun

607
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,380
is dead.

608
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
What?

609
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,380
Xu Jun's body

610
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,380
was found in the backyard of the 11th house.

611
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,380
It should be that

612
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,380
something went wrong

613
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,380
during the dance.

614
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,380
I have checked.

615
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:02,380
Among those dancers,

616
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
it should be Zhu Yi Wei.

617
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
The only one who can be a dancer

618
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
in Zhu Yi Wei

619
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
is Bai Que.

620
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
When did Bai Que

621
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,380
have such a master?

622
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,380
Let Mr. Yue act in advance.

623
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,380
If you can't find Ning Yuan Zhou

624
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,380
now,

625
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,380
we can only use this big bow

626
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,380
to kill Ding Yi Er Lang.

627
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Yes.

628
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
Why hasn't Ling Long come yet?

629
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,380
Could it be that

630
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,380
something went wrong in the branch?

631
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,380
I have to go back to the branch.

632
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,380
The wolf is still there.

633
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,380
I can't leave alone.

634
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,380
I can't leave alone.

635
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,380
I can't leave alone.

636
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
Don't look at him.

637
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
Be careful.

638
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
Yes.

639
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,380
You go over there.

640
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,380
Go.

641
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Search carefully.

642
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,380
Don't worry, sir.

643
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,380
It's just a fight.

644
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,380
Mr. Yue,

645
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
everyone in the branch

646
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,380
of Zhu Yi Wei

647
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,380
is here?

648
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Everyone is here.

649
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Yesterday, the branch

650
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,380
received the news of Bai Que

651
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,380
being exposed.

652
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,380
Everyone here

653
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
has been transferred to the branch.

654
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
None of them has been found.

655
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
None of them has been found.

656
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,380
There are 47 lives in total.

657
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,380
Only 3,000 gold.

658
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,380
It's cheap.

659
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
None of them has been found.

660
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
None of them has been found.

661
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,380
But I don't believe

662
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,380
that you,

663
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,380
a Bai Que who only cares about

664
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
searching and searching,

665
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
can kill my four capable men.

666
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,380
Are you questioning me,

667
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
Mr. Zhao?

668
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,380
I just want to vent my anger

669
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,380
on my brother.

670
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,380
A swordsman's poem

671
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,380
never goes wrong.

672
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,380
That's true,

673
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
but my brother

674
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,380
can't die

675
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,380
without a reason.

676
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,380
Mr. Yue,

677
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,380
please give me a clear picture.

678
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,380
Except for the people in the branch,

679
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,380
have Zhu Yi Wei's headquarters

680
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,380
sent other masters

681
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,380
here?

682
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,380
No.

683
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,380
I've already finished

684
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,380
the deal with you.

685
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,380
Where's the money?

686
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,380
In Zhu Yi Wei,

687
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,380
which way is Mr. Yue

688
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,380
going?

689
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,380
He's a cruel man.

690
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,380
47 comrades

691
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,380
died on the spot.

692
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,380
I can't find it.

693
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
It's just some low-class

694
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,380
Bai Que Zhu Yi Wei.

695
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,380
If he dies,

696
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,380
someone will reward him.

697
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,380
That Bai Que called Ling Long,

698
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,380
did you interrogate him?

699
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,380
Yes.

700
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,380
I broke his

701
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,380
whole body.

702
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,380
He dared to admit it.

703
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,380
That good-natured man

704
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,380
Ling Long

705
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,380
died with him?

706
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,380
How could it be?

707
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,380
That's Mr. Yue's family name.

708
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,380
Mr. Yue only took him away.

709
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,380
But I still think

710
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,380
he can't do such a big thing alone.

711
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,380
Search this place again.

712
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,380
These days,

713
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380
we're investigating the city.

714
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,380
If there's really a missing Zhu Yi Wei,

715
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,380
I'll do my best to get rid of him.

716
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,380
You must stop him.

717
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Yes.

718
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,380
Burn it.

719
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,380
Go.

720
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Go.

721
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Get everyone busy.

722
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
Yes.

723
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:42,380
Hurry.

724
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,380
Go.

725
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Don't move.

726
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,380
Let's go.

727
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,380
Go.

728
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,380
Go.

729
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,380
Go.

730
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,380
Go.

731
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,380
Go.

732
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,380
Go.

733
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,380
Go.

734
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,380
Go.
