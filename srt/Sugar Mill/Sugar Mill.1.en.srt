1
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,749
So, how is it?

2
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,207
Hang on. The radiator is still too hot.

3
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,665
Hurry up. We're late already.

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,082
I'll get scolded by the factory people!

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,833
- Come on, hurry up! Fix it quickly!
- Yes, sir.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,457
Come on!

7
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:50,707
Get on!

8
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:51,875
Chop-chop!

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,249
Come on, hurry! We're late! Come on!

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,665
Wait!

11
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,082
How could you leave the leader behind?

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,499
Come on.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,791
Wait, sir.

14
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,540
- Thank you.
- Fadhil, come here.

15
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,708
Okay.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,458
Just stand here.

17
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,666
Naning, I'm standing next to you, okay?

18
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,249
If you feel sleepy,

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,041
you can rest your head
on my strong shoulder.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,541
Okay?

21
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,541
My shoulder was made just for you.

22
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:28,125
Naning, don't turn down his offer.

23
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,625
This is your chance
to lean on an ancient statue.

24
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,875
- What did you say?
- I'm helping you.

25
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,832
- Wati!
- Come on!

26
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:41,499
Wait for me! Wait, sir!

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,874
Wait for me.

28
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,290
Hendra, help me.

29
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,499
- You're coming?
- I am.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,874
- In God's name.
- Your mother gave her blessing?

31
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,999
She finally did.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,375
I convinced Mother
that I wanted to help you out.

33
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:58,416
We're the ones getting married.
I want to contribute to the cost.

34
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:01,499
Okay, then. Give that to me.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,708
Honey!

36
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,624
Your hand.

37
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,915
What?

38
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,249
I know that smile.

39
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,875
Now that your fiancée is coming.

40
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,458
You must have dirty plans.

41
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,457
I suspect you two are going to--

42
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,790
- Do some cowboy camping.
- What the...

43
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,499
Shut your mouth!

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,499
You don't get it. Don't butt in.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,915
Going to sleep around?

46
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,290
Watch your mouth!

47
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,750
- Honey, stop it.
- I'll put you to sleep!

48
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:31,665
Naning...

49
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,832
Stop it.

50
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,582
Be careful, Naning.

51
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,040
Not me!

52
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,875
- Let's pray.
- It was Endah.

53
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,791
Pray first.

54
00:02:53,166 --> 00:03:00,166
EAST JAVA, 2003

55
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,582
Damn it!

56
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,124
You're drooling!

57
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,582
Your drool smells rancid.

58
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,290
Why are you wiping it on me? Hey!

59
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,749
Calm down, will you?

60
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,874
Calm down? He's drooling all over me
and it smells like a corpse.

61
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,957
Just ignore it.

62
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,207
Don't overreact, Franky.

63
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,916
I'll have to burn this shirt.

64
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,166
Is that the factory?

65
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,166
Yes, that's the factory.

66
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,916
It's unlike the ones on TV.

67
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,207
Don't believe TV commercials.

68
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,916
This is the real thing.

69
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,499
Those who have received
their lodge numbers,

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,125
go straight to your assigned rooms.

71
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,332
Dinner's ready.

72
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,583
Finally!

73
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,874
Hey, miss. Come, join us.

74
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,957
- It's okay.
- Sit.

75
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,499
It's fine. There's plenty of food.
I'll get another plate.

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,624
Thanks.

77
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,290
Don't mention it.

78
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,707
We haven't been introduced.

79
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,041
- I'm Endah.
- I'm Rani.

80
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,124
Nice to meet you, Rani.

81
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,207
Rani.

82
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,582
I'm Naning. Please don't be shy around us.

83
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:17,874
That's right.

84
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,624
I'm Wati.

85
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,208
The three of us
come from the same village.

86
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,583
What is that sound?

87
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,916
I think it's the alarm to go to bed.
It was explained earlier.

88
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,666
Endah, what are you looking at?

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,166
Let's eat.

90
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,875
Come on.

91
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,082
Let's eat, Endah.

92
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,375
Fine, I'm coming.

93
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,833
Oh, my God.

94
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,083
Wati?

95
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,875
Naning?

96
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,166
Rani?

97
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,249
I'm leaving, Wati.

98
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,332
- Okay.
- See you.

99
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,541
Take care.

100
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,874
Wati, where's Naning?

101
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,082
That's the thing.

102
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,332
Naning!

103
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,332
Naning, don't take too long!

104
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,166
Or else we'll be late!

105
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,624
Yes. Coming.

106
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,665
How pretty.

107
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,040
But of course.

108
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,415
Who knows? Might meet the one here.

109
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,832
Only you can think like that.

110
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,250
Come on, then.

111
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,124
Cover up.

112
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:30,332
Naning, Wati,
either of you went out last night?

113
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,540
No.

114
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,957
Nope. Slept like a baby.

115
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,999
Why do you ask?

116
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,250
Nothing.

117
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,499
I heard someone opening the door.

118
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,582
I thought someone left our lodge.

119
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,208
I must have heard wrong.

120
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,790
Peace be upon you.

121
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,707
Naning.

122
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,874
You look so cute this morning.

123
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,624
Just like me when I was a baby.

124
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,665
For those who arrived late yesterday,
I'm Marni.

125
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:02,833
I'm in charge of the seasonal workers
at this factory.

126
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,125
This is Mr. Samin.

127
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,790
We also have Rano and Karno,
the security guards here.

128
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:17,000
And the foremen
who will oversee your work.

129
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,500
I must tell you about the curfew.

130
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,208
You must've heard it last night.

131
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,875
The sound of the slit drum after dusk

132
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,541
signifies the beginning
of the yellow hours.

133
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,750
During the yellow hours,

134
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:41,333
all workers have to be within
the vicinity of their respective lodges.

135
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:47,750
And the sound of the steam whistle
at 9:00 p.m.

136
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,083
signifies the beginning of the red hours.

137
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,332
During the red hours,

138
00:18:55,333 --> 00:19:00,333
you are not allowed
to leave your lodges at all.

139
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,416
Keep this rule without any exception.

140
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:12,625
In three days, the milling will start.

141
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:19,416
Now, please go with the foremen
as they call your name.

142
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,041
The explanation about your tasks
will be given at each post.

143
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,291
Understand?

144
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,749
- Let's start.
- Yes, ma'am.

145
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,749
Listen carefully, all of you.

146
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,208
Listen for your name.

147
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,708
Andi Bintaro.

148
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,624
Sarwendah!

149
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,707
Reno!

150
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,333
Where's Sarwendah?

151
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,458
Mulyono Suparji.

152
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,540
Are you Mulyono?

153
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,124
He's Mulyono Suparji,
son of an anchovy farmer.

154
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,665
- Mackerel.
- Son of a mackerel farmer, sir.

155
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,916
Come here.

156
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,040
Dwi Adrianto.

157
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,415
- Me, sir.
- Sir...

158
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,958
Just call me Franky.

159
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,166
Mul-yo-no.

160
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,666
Come with me to the office.

161
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,791
Angga.

162
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,790
Hendra.

163
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,916
Noval.

164
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,583
Muhammad Fadhil.

165
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,624
You will work in my office.

166
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,374
I'll explain your tasks to you. Okay?

167
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,458
Okay.

168
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,541
- Go on.
- Forward!

169
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,791
Good deeds

170
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,625
will bring you good rewards.

171
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Oh, my God!

172
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,916
Oh, my God!

173
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,375
Do you know, Dil?

174
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,458
This factory

175
00:23:58,458 --> 00:23:59,916
caught on fire once.

176
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,249
Where did you hear that?

177
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,791
Franky told me.

178
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,124
Really?

179
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,957
Hang on.

180
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,750
You all don't believe me?

181
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,375
It happened...

182
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,583
Seven years ago.

183
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,916
A big fire at the warehouse.

184
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,499
Everyone who was trapped...

185
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,083
Died. Perished.

186
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,290
They were all seasonal workers?

187
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,750
That's right, Eko.

188
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:32,750
It was because

189
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,041
they wandered outside at night.

190
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:41,790
They were drunk.

191
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:42,958
Intoxicated.

192
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,083
How do you know they were drunk?

193
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,333
That's what the rumors say.

194
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,374
The warehouse was suddenly locked.

195
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,625
And there was a big explosion. Boom!

196
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,457
Bang!

197
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,541
Boom!

198
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:02,583
Everyone tried to escape,
but they couldn't.

199
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,166
The fire started to spread.

200
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:11,125
Those inside were burned alive.

201
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,790
They screamed.

202
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:17,583
"It's hot!"

203
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,625
After the incident,

204
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,916
the yellow and red hour rules
were implemented.

205
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,750
Rumor has it,

206
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:33,833
every night

207
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,208
their spirits wander around the factory.

208
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,958
"Hot."

209
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,791
"Hot."

210
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,166
"Hot."

211
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,249
Nonsense!

212
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,374
Wait.

213
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:51,624
Why are you mad?

214
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,082
Hey, where are you going?

215
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,458
Why are you running away? Boo! Coward!

216
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,208
Hendra!

217
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,166
- Damn you!
- Scared, huh?

218
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,375
Rani?

219
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,958
Rani?

220
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,791
Rani?

221
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,000
Rani, what are you doing here?

222
00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,833
Rani, I have a question.

223
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,875
What do you want to ask?

224
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:08,583
Last night,

225
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:11,083
did you slip out of the lodge?

226
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:49,291
Go back to your lodge and get some rest.

227
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,083
Endah? What's going on?

228
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,040
What happened?

229
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:00,333
Endah?

230
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,625
Let's go back.

231
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,083
Rani, just come with us.

232
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,666
Who wouldn't want to work at this factory?

233
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,708
Big salary.

234
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,250
And we get a place to stay.

235
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,499
Right.

236
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,083
But the locals
don't want to work here anymore.

237
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:32,999
That's why the factory
hires people from other cities.

238
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,625
Like you guys.

239
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,125
Because of the ghost sightings?

240
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:47,750
Yes.

241
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,958
The spirits of the fire victims.

242
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:58,000
But there's something even scarier.

243
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,666
Back in colonial times,
this factory had everything.

244
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:06,207
Tennis court, they had it.

245
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:07,957
- School.
- They had it.

246
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,040
- Barbershop?
- They had it.

247
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,082
- Beggars that walked backwards?
- Sure.

248
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,874
It's common at a sugar factory.
What else, Franky?

249
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,583
I was just asking.

250
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,207
Mental hospital? They had it.

251
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,458
- What for?
- For your friend here.

252
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,291
Go on.

253
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,416
But rumor has it,

254
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,958
at this hour,

255
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,000
a spirit wanders around.

256
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,291
A mental hospital patient.

257
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,833
She always appears

258
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,333
with her back to us.

259
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,666
If we turn our back and run away,

260
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,833
she will reappear in front of us.

261
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,375
If we run away again, she will reappear.

262
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,832
If we run away again...

263
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,290
She will reappear.

264
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:06,541
Hang on.

265
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:08,666
She will reappear.

266
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,375
What should we do then?

267
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,000
You have to politely say...

268
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,957
"Excuse me."

269
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,583
Only then will she leave.

270
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:25,540
Hear that?
Even a ghost appreciates courtesy.

271
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:26,832
Enough!

272
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,249
Go back to your lodge.

273
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,875
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

274
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Red hour.

275
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,041
Time for the spirits to wander about.

276
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,208
Don't forget.

277
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,083
"Excuse me."

278
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,125
"Excuse me."

279
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,541
Excuse me.

280
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,875
I'm not the ghost!

281
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:56,125
Dwi!

282
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,291
Dwi!

283
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,625
What's the hurry?

284
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,416
Come on!

285
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:17,208
You must've been circumcised by a jinn
when you were little.

286
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,583
Coward!

287
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't be so slow.

288
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,125
Look at me.

289
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,666
Calm and relaxed.

290
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,291
In control of any situation.

291
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,291
Hurry up, Franky!

292
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,625
Mulyono, wait!

293
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,208
Franky!

294
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:59,166
Don't leave me, Franky!

295
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,791
Mulyono! Franky! Open!

296
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,833
What are you thinking about, Wati?

297
00:33:26,666 --> 00:33:27,833
Hendra.

298
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,583
Is he burdened by my mother's request?

299
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,750
I feel bad.

300
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,916
Maybe I should postpone the wedding.

301
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,375
I wouldn't feel good

302
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,833
if he paid for everything.

303
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,415
What would you do if you were me, Naning?

304
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:54,624
If it was me,

305
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,833
if I wasn't financially ready,
I wouldn't get married.

306
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,374
But that's me.

307
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,540
- Where are you going?
- The bathroom.

308
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,707
- Wanna come?
- No.

309
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,833
"No."

310
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,625
What would you do if you were me, Endah?

311
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,041
Endah?

312
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,708
Endah?

313
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,291
Endah?

314
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,250
You've been daydreaming.

315
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,457
What did you say, Wati?

316
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,541
Are you okay?

317
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:43,874
Endah, if something happened,
don't keep it to yourself.

318
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,166
Naning and I are here. Tell us. Okay?

319
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm okay.

320
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:55,500
What were you saying about your wedding?

321
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,750
What's going on?

322
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:47,916
It's dark.

323
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,541
The light went out.

324
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:52,750
It did?

325
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:56,416
It's fine.

326
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,750
In the name of Allah.

327
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:13,791
Help.

328
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,625
Last night I heard Hendra...

329
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:37,707
Did you ask him?

330
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,874
- Should I?
- Ask him.

331
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,165
Hendra.

332
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,540
- What?
- Were you dreaming last night?

333
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,749
I heard you talking in your sleep.

334
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,540
You heard it?

335
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:49,875
I had a nightmare.

336
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,790
Couldn't go back to sleep?

337
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,250
I couldn't.

338
00:39:56,375 --> 00:39:57,875
What did you dream about?

339
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:00,958
It was unclear.

340
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,625
Tell me about it.

341
00:40:06,291 --> 00:40:09,707
- Answer me, what did you dream about?
- Forget about it!

342
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,958
I'm fine.

343
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,333
Stop nagging.

344
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,500
It's embarrassing.

345
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,000
We are here to work. That's it!

346
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,041
Don't listen to him.

347
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,750
It's fine, Wati.

348
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:33,665
Wati, it was just a dream.

349
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,458
Don't make too much of it.

350
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,458
You're wrong.

351
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,416
I can't stop thinking about my dream.

352
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,791
Because it was a beautiful dream.

353
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,625
I dreamed about marrying Naning.

354
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:51,540
It was beautiful for you.

355
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,249
For me, it's...

356
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,749
- What?
- Happy?

357
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,000
Horrible!

358
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:04,707
Franky, from now on, don't sleep again.

359
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:05,958
I feel for Naning.

360
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,999
Do you want me to die quickly, Dwi?

361
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,624
Not too quickly.

362
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,957
Do it slowly.

363
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:13,749
So we can be prepared.

364
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,249
Prepared, huh?

365
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,583
Let me check.

366
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,125
This one.

367
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,582
Bring it to the weigh station.

368
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:28,915
Yes, sir.

369
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,541
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

370
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,582
Endah.

371
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,082
Hey, Rani.

372
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,374
Where are you going?

373
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:42,165
To deliver documents to the crane station
and the weigh station.

374
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,499
Let me help you.

375
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,790
I'm on my way to the weigh station.

376
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:47,749
It's okay, Rani, I can do it myself.

377
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,000
It's okay. I'm heading there anyway.

378
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,083
Okay, then.

379
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,207
- Thanks.
- Yes.

380
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,708
- See you.
- Take care.

381
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,291
Rani!

382
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,458
Rani!

383
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:40,166
Rani!

384
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,708
Rani!

385
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,250
Rani!

386
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:49,333
Rani!

387
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,541
Rani!

388
00:43:01,375 --> 00:43:03,666
Rani!

389
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:16,124
Why didn't you bring
the document yourself?

390
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,583
That was your job!

391
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm sorry, ma'am.

392
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:23,957
Rani offered to help.

393
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,833
What's wrong with you?

394
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,665
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's my fault.

395
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,416
Forgive me, ma'am.

396
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,583
Now what?

397
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,665
What is it?

398
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,874
Ma'am.

399
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,541
Shouldn't we postpone the milling?

400
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:50,874
We can't.

401
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,332
I just reported to the higher-ups
that everything is on track.

402
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,457
How can I ask for a postponement?

403
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:59,165
I need a little bit of time.

404
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:03,915
Jinah and I need to make sure
this is a normal work accident.

405
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,582
The next Legi day is not until next week.

406
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:09,250
If we postpone, the loss will be too big.

407
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,333
I'm sorry. It's out of the question.

408
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,041
This is too risky.

409
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,541
I think my hunch was right.

410
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,708
It wasn't a normal accident.

411
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,750
Calm yourself.

412
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,625
This afternoon,
we have to prepare the offering ceremony.

413
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:26,625
What do you think made them angry?

414
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,375
I have no idea.

415
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,166
All I know is

416
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:38,500
we need to be calm in handling this.

417
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,666
Endah.

418
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,291
Are you okay, Endah?

419
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,208
I heard about the accident.

420
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:08,666
I'm scared.

421
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,375
I'm afraid that
it wasn't a normal accident.

422
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,083
What do you mean?

423
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,666
To be honest,

424
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:22,041
I've been experiencing
strange things here.

425
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,916
On our first night here,

426
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,125
I went out of the lodge
during the red hours.

427
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:31,708
Oh, dear. Does Mrs. Marni know?

428
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,625
No one knows except you.
I don't want to get fired.

429
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,458
Endah...

430
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:44,666
that night, who were you with?

431
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,208
I followed someone

432
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,750
who went out of the lodge to the factory.

433
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,416
But I lost track of that person.

434
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,708
That night...

435
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,583
I saw a wayang performance.

436
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:05,875
In the factory?

437
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,541
Are you sure?

438
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,916
I feel like something is off.

439
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:24,208
The accident had nothing to do
with what I saw, right?

440
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:25,750
Endah.

441
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,291
Calm down.

442
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,041
Right now, you need to calm yourself.

443
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,208
Be alert.

444
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,916
Don't forget to pray.

445
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,250
Let's hope our offerings are accepted

446
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:43,041
and there'll be no more accidents.

447
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:44,916
Yes.

448
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,500
Rani?

449
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:40,625
Rani?

450
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,291
Rani?

451
00:49:56,708 --> 00:49:57,958
Excuse me.

452
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,208
Rani, I want to apologize.

453
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,958
I'm sorry.

454
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:13,083
It was my mistake.

455
00:50:15,958 --> 00:50:17,708
How are you feeling?

456
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,499
Endah!

457
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,916
Oh, my God!

458
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Endah.

459
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,958
What happened?

460
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,458
Ask forgiveness from Allah.

461
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,000
Are you feeling guilty, Endah?

462
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,291
Rani is fine.

463
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,333
They've sent her home.

464
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,957
Wati.

465
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,500
Weren't you going to take this to Hendra?

466
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,665
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

467
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:02,040
I haven't put on my hijab.

468
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,874
Let me do it.

469
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,749
- Do you mind?
- No.

470
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:06,666
Thank you.

471
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,041
Who is it?

472
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,000
Naning.

473
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,791
Is this a dream?

474
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:35,000
Dwi!

475
00:52:37,541 --> 00:52:38,750
Dwi!

476
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,708
- What is it, Franky?
- Hit me, bro.

477
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,458
Hey! What have you done?

478
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:53,791
Damn you!

479
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,499
Without any warning?

480
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,458
Again?

481
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,499
But it's okay.

482
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,333
This isn't a dream, then.

483
00:53:06,916 --> 00:53:08,415
Look, Dwi.

484
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:11,124
My effort is fruitful.

485
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,875
Naning came to see me.

486
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,582
Naning,

487
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:20,875
I didn't expect you to come to me.

488
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,416
I also didn't expect Naning
to be far-sighted.

489
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:30,707
- I'll poke your eyes out!
- What's going on here?

490
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,415
Here, Wati asked me to bring this to you.

491
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:35,125
- Thanks, Naning.
- Okay.

492
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:41,041
Hendra, what do I have to do
to be loved that much?

493
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,915
I lack nothing.

494
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:45,582
You lack a shower, Franky.

495
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,208
Dirty from head to toe.

496
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:56,332
Naning, the red hour alarm
will go off soon.

497
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,082
You're not allowed
to be out of your lodge.

498
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,583
Yes. Okay, then.

499
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:01,707
Hey, Naning.

500
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:03,208
How is Endah?

501
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,125
She's fine.

502
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,708
- Good night, boys.
- Naning.

503
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,750
Let me walk you back.

504
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,000
Take care of that nosebleed,
why don't you?

505
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,790
Hey!

506
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,749
This is not a nosebleed.

507
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:21,624
This is the snort of a fool in love.

508
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,833
Naning!

509
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,916
Wow, she walks so fast.

510
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,333
Wait...

511
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,583
Wait...

512
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:04,916
What's going on here?
Why didn't they take the offerings?

513
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,291
Looks like we have a ritual to perform.

514
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:14,666
I have a bad feeling about this.

515
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,582
Aren't you scared, Rano?

516
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:28,540
Samin and Jinah's offerings
weren't accepted.

517
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:32,625
Maybe the spirits don't like beef.

518
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,624
They should try the trotters,
it's the best part.

519
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:40,707
Stop joking about it.
It can bring us bad luck.

520
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,333
A security guard
shouldn't be superstitious.

521
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,958
Who's drawing water this late at night?

522
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,375
Maybe it's Jinah?

523
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,000
Jinah!

524
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,457
It must be a ghost.

525
00:58:04,458 --> 00:58:06,083
Damn it!

526
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,375
Your baton!

527
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,375
I'll get it tomorrow!

528
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,165
Oh, my God!

529
01:00:26,166 --> 01:00:27,500
I'm late!

530
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,916
- Rano!
- Let's go.

531
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,207
- Ma'am.
- Where?

532
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,958
Jinah. Samin.

533
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,333
Postpone the milling, ma'am.
Don't do it today.

534
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,540
Rano, Karno, come with me.

535
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,124
Yes, ma'am.

536
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,375
Sir.

537
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,458
Oh, my God!

538
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:56,958
Sir.

539
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:02,291
He's from your village?

540
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,583
No, sir.

541
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:10,166
I think his name is Eko.

542
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:13,500
Do not cause panic.

543
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,333
Sorry, sir.

544
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,708
I don't mean to be impudent,

545
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,125
but how could this happen?

546
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:38,291
Is this your first time here
as a seasonal worker?

547
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:52,750
You're not an ordinary guy.

548
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,708
What have you experienced here?

549
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,208
Don't hide what you know.

550
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:06,916
It won't help with the situation.

551
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:14,208
Your hand, child.

552
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,250
Give her your hand.

553
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,958
What did you see that night?

554
01:04:04,791 --> 01:04:06,500
What's going on here, ma'am?

555
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,500
Be honest.

556
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,416
So it won't be painful.

557
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,625
It's okay, Endah.

558
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,041
They know.

559
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:31,166
A wayang show, ma'am.

560
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,041
Why did you go there?

561
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,750
That night...

562
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,666
I saw someone leave the lodge.

563
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,583
I tried to follow the person.

564
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,916
I thought it was one of my friends.

565
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:53,583
But I lost them.

566
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,291
And then,

567
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,041
I saw a crowd.

568
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,083
Who was it?

569
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,583
I don't know, ma'am.

570
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,499
I'm sorry, all of you.

571
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,624
Maybe it was Rani?

572
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,833
The worker who met with an accident.

573
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:30,041
I met Rani after the accident.

574
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:35,333
She's just another victim
of the spirit's anger.

575
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:43,583
Actually, the curfew was implemented

576
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:47,416
so the workers don't see them.

577
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,083
The inhabitants of this sugar factory.

578
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:56,166
Just like what you saw
at that wayang show.

579
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,458
But

580
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,541
the reason the workers were harmed...

581
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:08,416
is not because you saw them.

582
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:13,791
There's a bigger violation
that we don't know about yet.

583
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,999
You said something about a dream.

584
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,583
What did you see?

585
01:06:41,291 --> 01:06:43,750
Someone with your ability...

586
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,250
their dreams usually reveal something.

587
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:51,000
Your dream might be a clue.

588
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,541
What did you dream about?

589
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,041
On the first night,

590
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,500
I dreamed...

591
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:20,375
When Endah said that she left her lodge,

592
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:25,000
I thought it was her in my dream.

593
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:30,916
Did you go to the west warehouse?

594
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:34,666
No, ma'am.

595
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,166
I saw the wayang show

596
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:42,458
in the warehouse
next to the main building.

597
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:48,666
That means there were two other people
who went to the west warehouse.

598
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:56,875
Maybe it was them
who made the bigger violation.

599
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,875
Jinah.

600
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:07,291
Are you sure this has something to do
with the forbidden warehouse?

601
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:10,916
Forbidden warehouse?

602
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:21,583
This west warehouse
is where the big fire happened.

603
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:28,083
It is forbidden
for anyone to enter the warehouse.

604
01:10:26,458 --> 01:10:32,208
Humans and jinn
live together on this land.

605
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:37,208
We have promised to live harmoniously.

606
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:42,166
Whoever breaks the promise will die.

607
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,666
Die!

608
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,500
Die!

609
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,458
Die!

610
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,291
Die!

611
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,458
Die!

612
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,457
Ma'am.

613
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,958
What is this place?

614
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:44,750
In the past, during the colonial era,
accidents often happened here.

615
01:13:47,083 --> 01:13:50,666
They finally made a pact with Maharatu,

616
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:53,083
Queen of the Spirit Kingdom,

617
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,291
to not bother each other.

618
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,250
Since then,

619
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:02,541
this warehouse has become a sacred place.

620
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:04,916
Seven years ago,

621
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,625
a group of seasonal workers

622
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,791
did something reckless here.

623
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:17,583
That mistake angered the spirits

624
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:21,041
and a big fire broke out.

625
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,333
After that,

626
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,916
this warehouse was closed completely.

627
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:32,291
I didn't expect someone would trespass...

628
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:40,250
and break this supernatural barrier.

629
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,041
Not only that,

630
01:14:43,791 --> 01:14:47,583
someone has stolen Maharatu's belongings.

631
01:14:49,041 --> 01:14:50,500
What belongings?

632
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,000
I don't see anything.

633
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,666
Only people with special abilities
can see it.

634
01:14:58,375 --> 01:14:59,541
What do you see?

635
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:03,415
The thing is, I also don't see anything.

636
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:04,500
I knew it.

637
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,040
There was gold jewelry,
invisible to the common eye,

638
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:19,041
belonging to Maharatu.

639
01:15:19,916 --> 01:15:25,208
But somehow,
someone was able to see it and took it.

640
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,708
We're in serious danger now.

641
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,750
- We--
- Jinah.

642
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,750
- Mrs. Marni.
- Ma'am?

643
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,750
Mrs. Marni.

644
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,957
Mrs. Marni.

645
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:05,125
Ma'am.

646
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:19,208
Rano, Karno,

647
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,499
take her home.

648
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,791
Yes, ma'am.

649
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:34,750
The missing gold

650
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:39,166
was probably taken
by the two people in your dream.

651
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:43,125
Please help me

652
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,541
find out who they are.

653
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:48,458
Yes, ma'am.

654
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:50,625
Let's go.

655
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,833
The door! Where is it?

656
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,249
Endah?

657
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:44,166
Endah!

658
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:49,041
Wati!

659
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:58,541
No!

660
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,000
Forgive me!

661
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,207
Hey, Naning!

662
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:38,249
Naning! It's me, Hendra.

663
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,375
Hey!

664
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,166
What happened?

665
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:47,249
Hey! Naning!

666
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:50,333
It's all because of this!

667
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:00,040
God damn you!

668
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:02,125
Why is this here? Huh?

669
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:04,999
I told you not to take it!

670
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,416
I couldn't resist!

671
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,415
Damn it.

672
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,791
We must return it.

673
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,957
If the others find out,
we will be screwed!

674
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,125
Let's go!

675
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:39,083
Stop it. Come on!

676
01:19:58,875 --> 01:20:00,416
What? You're scared?

677
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,915
This is all your fault.

678
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,833
And now you're scared?

679
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:12,083
Naning!

680
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:16,457
Naning, snap out of it.

681
01:20:16,458 --> 01:20:18,708
Let's go. Come on!

682
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,666
Let's go.

683
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:30,957
What were Endah and Fadhil doing
in Mrs. Marni's house?

684
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,375
I don't know.

685
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:38,040
Maybe it has something to do with Eko,
the missing guy.

686
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:41,290
- Your workmate at the crane station?
- Yep.

687
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:45,541
His roommate said he was in his room
long before the red hours.

688
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,665
Why is Hendra not back yet?
He was getting Naning.

689
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,541
The food is getting cold.

690
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:11,250
- Franky, Dwi!
- That's Fadhil and Endah.

691
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,125
Fadhil.

692
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:21,750
Endah?

693
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:27,000
Endah! Fadhil!

694
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:31,457
What's going on? Where's Hendra?

695
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:32,874
- Naning?
- Hendra?

696
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:38,583
- Hendra!
- Naning!

697
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,291
Naning!

698
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:50,665
Are you sure Hendra and Naning
aren't at the lodge?

699
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,832
They aren't there.

700
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:53,291
We were just there.

701
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:59,541
The two people in your dream,
were they a man and a woman?

702
01:22:02,458 --> 01:22:05,582
Maybe Hendra and Naning did it.

703
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:06,999
Hang on.

704
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,750
Did what?

705
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,583
What is happening?

706
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:22,333
Whose gold is this?

707
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:26,082
And why did you get called
to Mrs. Marni's house?

708
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:27,333
It's a long story.

709
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:29,957
One thing's for sure,

710
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:33,750
all the strange happenings here
are because someone stole this.

711
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:36,375
This is sacred, it belongs to the spirits.

712
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:38,041
Spirits?

713
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,874
- You mean ghosts?
- Hang on.

714
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,749
What are you talking about?

715
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,875
Stole what?

716
01:22:46,083 --> 01:22:48,583
Are you accusing
Hendra and Naning of stealing?

717
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,333
Based on your dream?

718
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,750
Hendra would never steal anything.

719
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,208
Let's go find them.

720
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,208
We still have time before the red hours.

721
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:04,583
Dwi, Franky.

722
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:08,583
Find Rano and Karno. Ask them to help us.

723
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:10,415
Okay?

724
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:11,499
Endah.

725
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,790
Please go back to the west warehouse.

726
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:17,666
Bring that gold and tell Jinah
that our two friends are missing.

727
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:21,040
And where are you going to go?

728
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,625
I'll search the lodges.

729
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:27,125
Maybe someone saw Hendra and Naning.

730
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:30,665
Fadhil, I'm going with you.

731
01:23:30,666 --> 01:23:31,790
Wait. Dwi?

732
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:34,374
- Fadhil! Can I? Please?
- What's wrong?

733
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:35,707
Let's go.

734
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,249
I should go with Fadhil.

735
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:40,666
Forget him. You're safer with me.
I know this area best.

736
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:56,999
Help. My friend is inside.

737
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,082
Your friend?

738
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,541
- Help.
- What's going on?

739
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:05,375
Help. In here.

740
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,833
In there. In that room.

741
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:11,874
Help.

742
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,166
Just go in.

743
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,416
Peace be upon you.

744
01:24:31,708 --> 01:24:33,583
Sir?

745
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:36,249
The one outside?

746
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,125
The one outside isn't human.

747
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:33,916
I seek refuge in Allah
from the outcast Satan.

748
01:26:01,916 --> 01:26:03,124
Oh, my God.

749
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,625
Sir?

750
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,207
Naning?

751
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:11,541
Hendra?

752
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,165
Naning?

753
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,416
Hendra?

754
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,040
Naning!

755
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:20,458
Hendra!

756
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:24,832
Why are you mimicking me?
Your tone is exactly the same as mine.

757
01:26:24,833 --> 01:26:27,165
Well, all you do is call for Naning.

758
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:28,624
So what?

759
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:30,832
Judging from past experience,

760
01:26:30,833 --> 01:26:33,832
the more you call her,
the more she will run away.

761
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,499
Not always!

762
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,040
But, okay.

763
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:41,500
- Hendra!
- Naning!

764
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,374
Hendra!

765
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:45,625
Naning!

766
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:18,499
Damn it!

767
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:20,041
He's got a hole in his face!

768
01:27:22,375 --> 01:27:24,625
Mulyono, wait for me!

769
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:31,166
There's no way. Hendra is not a thief.

770
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:33,958
Endah!

771
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:37,833
This place is not right.

772
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:48,208
Let's go. Don't look back.

773
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:05,416
Wait here, okay?

774
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,625
Franky, wait for me!

775
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:03,708
Franky!

776
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:08,041
What now?

777
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:13,708
I'll count to 17.

778
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,874
And then we run, okay?

779
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:20,332
Not 17. I'll wet myself before then.

780
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,582
One, two...

781
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,916
Seventeen!

782
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:38,708
Franky.

783
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,291
remember what Karno said?

784
01:29:42,916 --> 01:29:47,957
He said if we didn't politely
excuse ourselves, she wouldn't go away.

785
01:29:47,958 --> 01:29:49,457
Hurry up and do it then!

786
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:50,665
Why me?

787
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:52,040
You're in front.

788
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:53,374
Wait.

789
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:55,790
Franky!

790
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:57,083
Just do it, Dwi!

791
01:29:58,583 --> 01:29:59,750
Miss...

792
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:02,207
excuse me.

793
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:03,416
My apologies.

794
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:06,541
Good evening.

795
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:10,374
She's not responding. Franky!

796
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:12,999
Not every ghost originates from Java.

797
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,208
Try again!

798
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:16,750
Miss...

799
01:30:17,416 --> 01:30:18,958
peace be upon you.

800
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,875
Franky, you do it.

801
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,540
Dwi!

802
01:30:26,541 --> 01:30:27,625
Miss...

803
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,707
excuse me.

804
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:31,625
It's not that we're arrogant,

805
01:30:32,208 --> 01:30:34,041
or don't want to chat with you,

806
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:37,750
- but we're very busy.
- That's right.

807
01:30:39,041 --> 01:30:40,208
Excuse...

808
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:48,874
Dwi,

809
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,124
did she just wet herself?

810
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:53,708
I think the ghost is scared of you.

811
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:06,957
Hey!

812
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:08,624
Dwi! Franky!

813
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:09,790
Damn you!

814
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:10,916
You startled us!

815
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,957
Have you found Naning and Hendra?

816
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:17,083
Not yet,
but we found a ghost who wet herself.

817
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:21,375
When the ghost saw Franky, she--

818
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:25,750
Where else are you going?

819
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,499
I'm going to the west warehouse.

820
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,499
I'm scared for Endah and Wati.

821
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,707
Okay, then.

822
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:33,416
Let's not split up again.

823
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:36,082
- Come.
- Fadhil, in front.

824
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:37,166
Let's go.

825
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:51,583
Sir.

826
01:31:53,166 --> 01:31:54,708
Where are you going?

827
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,750
It's red hour.

828
01:31:58,041 --> 01:31:59,250
We want to...

829
01:32:02,875 --> 01:32:04,333
return something.

830
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:09,500
All right, go ahead.

831
01:32:11,333 --> 01:32:12,583
Thank you.

832
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,708
Excuse me.

833
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,290
Rano?

834
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,708
Are they the thieves?

835
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:31,208
Jinah has got some serious magic.

836
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:36,916
We haven't even looked for the thieves,
but they're already turning themselves in.

837
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:40,290
Imagine if Ms. Jinah was a cop.

838
01:32:40,291 --> 01:32:42,040
Jails would be full.

839
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:44,541
She would make a super policewoman.

840
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:48,041
But she'd be too old, I think.

841
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,375
This is not everything.

842
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:00,708
Ma'am...

843
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:03,875
I found this at the lodge.

844
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,750
Did you steal this?

845
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,041
Huh?

846
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:25,375
Why did you have to steal?

847
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:28,208
Because of my mother's demands?

848
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,916
Just forget about the wedding reception!

849
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:34,416
Oh, God!

850
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:39,165
What did you do here

851
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:42,916
that gave you the ability
to see Maharatu's belongings?

852
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,875
It's better for you to come clean.

853
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:54,750
This can bring harm to everyone.

854
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,166
Including both of you.

855
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,375
What did you do?

856
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:08,375
On the first night,

857
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:12,208
we came to this factory...

858
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:18,083
We...

859
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:40,499
I hate this.

860
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,707
Why did Wati have to come here?

861
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:46,500
It makes it hard for us.
Have to meet discreetly, late at night.

862
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:50,541
But this is more exciting, right?

863
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:53,041
Don't mind her.

864
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:56,500
Stop making a long face.

865
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,541
You have a pretty face.

866
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:01,625
Come here.

867
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:13,791
Naning?

868
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,375
Naning?

869
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,291
Hey.

870
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:33,166
Hey, Naning!

871
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Naning!

872
01:38:15,416 --> 01:38:16,416
Naning!

873
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,541
Hendra, look.

874
01:38:24,833 --> 01:38:27,291
Hey! Don't take it!

875
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:33,415
I have a bad feeling about this.

876
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:34,916
This place is strange.

877
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,125
Come on, let's just go back.

878
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:45,832
You know! You know she's my best friend!

879
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:49,165
Naning! You know I'm going to marry him!

880
01:38:49,166 --> 01:38:52,165
Oh, God!

881
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,624
How could you?

882
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,583
You piece of shit!

883
01:38:58,125 --> 01:39:01,750
You know how much I like Naning.

884
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:04,249
And you had to have her, too?

885
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,541
You're engaged to be married!

886
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:17,541
You committed a sin in this place.

887
01:39:19,833 --> 01:39:24,166
That gave you the ability
to see Maharatu's gold.

888
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:30,958
That's because adultery
is Satan's favorite sin.

889
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:35,375
And it will open the gate to other sins.

890
01:39:36,416 --> 01:39:40,166
I thought all of this happened
because of me.

891
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,458
It was you all along!

892
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:49,625
Forgive me.

893
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:55,083
I'm sorry.

894
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:00,332
Wati.

895
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:02,625
It's my fault.

896
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:08,083
Don't!

897
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:09,958
Wati!

898
01:41:42,166 --> 01:41:46,041
- Wati!
- Wati!

899
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:53,166
Rano, what's happening to her?

900
01:43:00,958 --> 01:43:02,665
Help me hold them off!

901
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:03,875
Hurry!

902
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,666
Wati...

903
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:26,208
Endah?

904
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:56,415
A long time ago,

905
01:44:56,416 --> 01:45:00,250
this was a sacred place.

906
01:45:01,833 --> 01:45:04,915
A quiet and dense forest.

907
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:07,790
Animals came and died.

908
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:11,124
Men came, and only their names
would leave the place.

909
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:12,457
However,

910
01:45:12,458 --> 01:45:17,083
after greedy humans came,

911
01:45:18,083 --> 01:45:24,165
the beautiful shady trees

912
01:45:24,166 --> 01:45:29,707
And that became a huge problem.

913
01:45:29,708 --> 01:45:31,749
Therefore,

914
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:36,875
don't blame the ancestors for asking
for a human blood sacrifice!

915
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:24,333
The offerings.

916
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:31,291
The bride and groom.

917
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,708
Are you okay?

918
01:47:10,666 --> 01:47:11,666
Endah?

919
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:15,374
Endah! Oh, God!

920
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:16,500
Endah.

921
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,915
We have to prepare them, Jinah.

922
01:47:23,916 --> 01:47:25,915
We have no other choice.

923
01:47:25,916 --> 01:47:29,833
They took advantage of this incident
to demand another human sacrifice.

924
01:47:31,625 --> 01:47:32,750
You're right.

925
01:47:33,333 --> 01:47:36,208
We should comply
with the spirits' demands.

926
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,625
Or everyone's lives will be in danger.

927
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:44,333
They have to be sacrificed.

928
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:48,875
They're the bride and groom
the spirits have chosen.

929
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,291
- What?
- Ma'am.

930
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:55,625
Forgive me, ma'am.

931
01:47:56,458 --> 01:47:58,749
We know we made a mistake.

932
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,790
We will do anything.

933
01:48:01,791 --> 01:48:05,540
But don't make us the sacrifice.

934
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:08,250
I don't want to die, ma'am.

935
01:48:08,916 --> 01:48:10,333
Help us.

936
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:15,749
Forgive me.

937
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:17,874
- Rano.
- Yes, ma'am.

938
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:20,000
Take them to Mrs. Marni's house.

939
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:25,583
Tell Mrs. Marni they have to be prepared
as the sugarcane ritual bride and groom.

940
01:48:26,541 --> 01:48:27,540
Yes, ma'am.

941
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:28,666
Karno.

942
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:32,375
Help me prepare the ritual.

943
01:48:33,125 --> 01:48:34,541
- Okay.
- Let's go.

944
01:48:35,583 --> 01:48:37,249
Wait!

945
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,374
Is there no other way, ma'am?

946
01:48:39,375 --> 01:48:41,249
Wati!

947
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,915
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

948
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:45,875
The sugarcane wedding ritual.

949
01:48:46,958 --> 01:48:49,957
Your two friends
have to become the bride and groom.

950
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:52,749
Why do we have to comply
with the spirits' demand?

951
01:48:52,750 --> 01:48:55,207
Since this sugar factory was built,

952
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:57,332
before every milling started,

953
01:48:57,333 --> 01:49:00,583
the sugarcane wedding ritual
has been conducted.

954
01:49:04,875 --> 01:49:06,249
Wati!

955
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:11,999
Ma'am, forgive me!

956
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Wati!

957
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:26,332
A couple is paraded
to be buried in the sugarcane field

958
01:49:26,333 --> 01:49:29,875
as offerings
to the original inhabitants of this land.

959
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,665
The ruler of the Spirit Kingdom.

960
01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:35,083
Let's pray.

961
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,291
And hope this is for the best.

962
01:49:44,291 --> 01:49:46,624
We tried everything

963
01:49:46,625 --> 01:49:49,708
so we wouldn't
have to sacrifice humans anymore.

964
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:52,332
Until finally,

965
01:49:52,333 --> 01:49:55,457
they accepted a pair of oxen
and other offerings

966
01:49:55,458 --> 01:49:57,041
as a replacement.

967
01:49:57,833 --> 01:49:59,207
Unfortunately,

968
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:01,832
the mistakes that your friends made

969
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:05,707
has resulted in the demand
for the sugarcane wedding ritual again

970
01:50:05,708 --> 01:50:08,083
with human sacrifice.

971
01:51:40,458 --> 01:51:43,916
This is our offering to you.

972
01:53:43,416 --> 01:53:44,416
The offerings.

973
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:54,041
These are the two humans
that have committed the biggest sin.

974
01:53:59,458 --> 01:54:01,750
Forgive us, Maharatu.

975
01:54:07,083 --> 01:54:09,250
Accept our offerings.

976
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:13,333
The bride and groom.

977
01:54:33,458 --> 01:54:34,833
Mr. Samin.

978
01:54:38,541 --> 01:54:39,750
Mr. Samin.

979
01:55:46,583 --> 01:55:52,083
HENDRA
SON OF SUNARYO

980
01:56:42,583 --> 01:56:47,250
They must stay inside the salt circle
during the ritual.

981
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:02,625
I cannot believe

982
01:57:03,791 --> 01:57:05,958
they sacrificed humans back then.

983
01:57:21,625 --> 01:57:24,291
Endah, Dwi, let's go.

984
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:28,291
Let's go.

985
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:40,041
Wati...

986
01:57:43,208 --> 01:57:46,458
If you don't want me anymore,
I understand.

987
01:57:48,583 --> 01:57:49,875
I just hope

988
01:57:51,208 --> 01:57:54,000
that one day you can forgive me.

989
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:01,750
I pray you will always be happy, Wati,

990
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:05,333
with whoever you marry in the future.

991
01:58:07,625 --> 01:58:09,916
I only ask for your forgiveness, Wati.

992
01:58:11,833 --> 01:58:13,915
I hate myself for letting you down.

993
01:58:13,916 --> 01:58:15,540
Wati!

994
01:58:15,541 --> 01:58:17,541
- Wati!
- Forgive us, Wati!

995
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,250
Wati!

996
01:58:24,458 --> 01:58:26,583
Wati.

997
01:58:42,916 --> 01:58:46,458
Have they completed the ritual?

998
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,041
This is our first time.

999
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:22,625
Wati...

1000
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:40,083
Wati?

1001
01:59:44,083 --> 01:59:45,124
What's going on?

1002
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:46,207
Hendra!

1003
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:47,415
- Open up!
- What is this?

1004
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:48,375
- Hendra!
- Open!

1005
01:59:52,875 --> 01:59:54,665
Hendra!

1006
01:59:54,666 --> 01:59:56,374
Why is the door closed?

1007
01:59:56,375 --> 01:59:58,458
Help! Just break down the door!

1008
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:02,375
- Naning!
- Hendra!

1009
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,374
Open! Break down the door!

1010
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:13,000
Come on, push the door harder!

1011
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:16,582
Wati!

1012
02:00:16,583 --> 02:00:17,666
What's going on?

1013
02:00:18,291 --> 02:00:19,749
What's going on?

1014
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:23,916
- Hendra!
- Naning!

1015
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:28,332
Move!

1016
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:29,500
Come on, Rano!

1017
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,333
The field.

1018
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,165
Let's go!

1019
02:00:58,166 --> 02:01:00,957
- What's going on?
- Let's go, Wati!

1020
02:01:00,958 --> 02:01:03,874
Stop the ritual!

1021
02:01:03,875 --> 02:01:05,625
Stop, Ms. Jinah!

1022
02:01:07,166 --> 02:01:10,791
Move! Ms. Jinah!

1023
02:01:14,166 --> 02:01:15,624
Move!

1024
02:01:15,625 --> 02:01:17,249
What's going on here?

1025
02:01:17,250 --> 02:01:19,000
What's going on?

1026
02:01:20,125 --> 02:01:25,458
- Naning!
- Hendra!

1027
02:01:28,125 --> 02:01:30,708
Naning!

1028
02:02:06,916 --> 02:02:10,290
Human's dirty trickery

1029
02:02:10,291 --> 02:02:14,416
cannot deceive Maharatu!

1030
02:02:29,916 --> 02:02:33,125
Naning!

1031
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:40,291
- Naning!
- Hendra!

1032
02:02:50,166 --> 02:02:52,999
Get them out!

1033
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,583
Naning!

1034
02:03:45,041 --> 02:03:48,083
We came here full of hope,

1035
02:03:49,583 --> 02:03:51,666
only to return full of grief.

1036
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:56,125
Our two best friends lost their lives.

1037
02:03:57,541 --> 02:04:01,374
In the end, there was nothing I could do,

1038
02:04:01,375 --> 02:04:05,750
but to take this as a lesson.

1039
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:10,375
Those who sow will reap.

1040
02:04:11,166 --> 02:04:14,750
Those who do wrong
will have to pay the price.

1041
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,291
We are sorry

1042
02:04:18,333 --> 02:04:20,875
that we were unable to save your friends.

1043
02:04:22,625 --> 02:04:25,958
Just like good deeds
will bring you good rewards,

1044
02:04:26,958 --> 02:04:31,375
bad deeds result in punishment.

1045
02:04:32,458 --> 02:04:35,333
Let's hope they're at peace
on the other side.

1046
02:12:27,916 --> 02:12:29,916
