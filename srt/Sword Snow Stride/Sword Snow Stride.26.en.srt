1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 26=

7
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:37,980
What?

8
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,460
His Highness is in a bad mood.

9
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,575
He's got many maids,

10
00:01:45,775 --> 00:01:47,450
but in his heart, there's no one,

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,900
but Jiang Ni.

12
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,020
What about you?

13
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:55,900
Me?

14
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm a mere maid.

15
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,725
His Highness doesn't
treat me differently.

16
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,700
What's your feeling for him?

17
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:09,220
Are you worried

18
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,580
that I'll fight for him with Jiang Ni?

19
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,075
I used to be a death guard.

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,525
Now,

21
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,460
I'm a maid for His Highness.

22
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,500
That's all.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Have you

24
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,850
ever loved him?

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,550
A death guard can't love anyone.

26
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:36,375
Do you know Cao Changqing?

27
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,250
Over the past twenty years,

28
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,725
he has been
among the top three martial artists.

29
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,075
Who doesn't know him?

30
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,900
Cao Changqing is talented
in martial arts and chess.

31
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:48,450
He used to be a celebrity of West Chu.

32
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:49,700
After West Chu was destroyed

33
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,740
and Liyang ruled the world,

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,580
he assassinated
more than twenty important officials

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,580
of Liyang.

36
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:54,940
He went to the capital three times

37
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,980
and broke
into the imperial palace twice,

38
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,380
having confronted emperors
of two generations.

39
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:59,100
In the best case,

40
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,275
he was only fifty steps away
from the emperor.

41
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,175
He failed to kill the emperor, anyway.

42
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,620
If Cruel Cat Han Diaosi
hadn't protected the emperor,

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,460
Cao Changqing might be able

44
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,300
to kill the emperor.

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,180
Even without Han Diaosi,

46
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,540
there would be other masters around.

47
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,625
The distance of fifty steps
was like a natural moat.

48
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,275
After being hunted
for more than twenty years,

49
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:17,515
Cao Changqing has been alive

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,820
and among the top three.

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,700
He's quite strong.

52
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,125
What's the point of bringing him up?

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,575
Why did Cao Changqing
try to kill the emperor?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,940
Maybe

55
00:03:30,675 --> 00:03:32,475
his family members or friends

56
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,100
were killed in the Battle
against West Chu.

57
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,060
Or maybe he misses his old nation

58
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,600
and wants to avenge his old friends.

59
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,600
So what?

60
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:40,780
Under such circumstances,

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,100
he may keep you safe.

62
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,700
You're going to send me away?

63
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,195
I've thought about it carefully.

64
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,780
For North Liang,

65
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,175
Xu Xiao can use every possible trick.

66
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:54,025
Maybe he'll make use of your identity.

67
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,725
So, you're going to send me away?

68
00:03:58,575 --> 00:03:59,540
It's just a suggestion.

69
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,675
Cao Changqing's whereabouts
are always unknown.

70
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,580
It's not easy to meet him.

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,220
Even if we meet him, I'm not leaving.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,380
Why?

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,100
Who knows what kind of man he is?

74
00:04:15,775 --> 00:04:18,125
Maybe he's a psychopath who only kills.

75
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,125
Cao Changqing is known as Elegant Cao.

76
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,700
He looks elegant in a black robe.

77
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,700
Why would he be a psychopath?

78
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,780
What if he charges for protecting me?

79
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,980
I'm too poor to pay him.

80
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,740
I'm not leaving.

81
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,580
It's dangerous to stay around me.

82
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm not scared.

83
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,860
I have the Divine Token.

84
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,140
You lent it to Senior Li, didn't you?

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,925
I'm not leaving, anyway.

86
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,375
Who knows what trick you're playing?

87
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,900
Even if I have to leave,

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,140
I'll kill you first

89
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,100
so that I'll feel relieved.

90
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,300
All right.

91
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,250
You're not leaving.

92
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,220
No matter what Xu Xiao is up to,

93
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,220
I'll protect you.

94
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:14,940
It's hard to tell
who the protector will be.

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,740
Let's make a deal, then.

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,820
You won't leave

97
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,060
before you kill me.

98
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
Before I kill you,

99
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,700
you mustn't die.

100
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,420
Deal.

101
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,300
Childish.

102
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,775
Put them in the carriage behind.

103
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,175
General Ning.

104
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,275
I'm afraid

105
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:50,750
the female assassin hasn't given up.

106
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:52,700
During the trip,

107
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,125
please pay more attention.

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,500
I get it.

109
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:16,580
Why are you wearing so little?

110
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,275
I don't feel cold today.

111
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,100
Today,

112
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,260
half of the scholars of Jiangnan

113
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,300
are gathering in Baoguo Temple.

114
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,400
Have you thought about
how to argue with them?

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,050
I may not be able to debate with them.

116
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:29,940
But it's easy to make trouble.

117
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,350
Senior.

118
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:35,200
Mm.

119
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:36,820
Would you like some?

120
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,300
Other things in the Lu Family are poor,

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,420
but the porridge tastes good.

122
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:40,500
No, thanks.

123
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,700
Uncle?

124
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,900
You asked to see me, Your Highness?

125
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,900
Yes.

126
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:52,860
For one thing,

127
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,420
I'd like to bid farewell to you.

128
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,980
I must say thank you
for my stay in your mansion.

129
00:06:58,025 --> 00:06:58,980
We're relatives by marriage.

130
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,860
Don't stand on ceremony.

131
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,420
For another,

132
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:03,380
I have something to ask you.

133
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,540
Go ahead.

134
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,340
Are there family rules in your family?

135
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,580
Fengnian.

136
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,660
If there aren't,

137
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,220
I can set some for you.

138
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,460
Did someone in my family

139
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,380
annoy you?

140
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,300
I've heard

141
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
that even your servants

142
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,820
have disrespected my sister these days

143
00:07:23,325 --> 00:07:25,780
and all her living expenses
have been deducted.

144
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:27,700
If you're too poor to raise my sister,

145
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,780
my family

146
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,140
can send money to her every month

147
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,580
to relieve you of economic pressure.

148
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:34,900
Is that true?

149
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes.

150
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,820
Master, you're nice to Her Ladyship.

151
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,140
But servants here

152
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,580
often pull a long face at her.

153
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,460
Who?

154
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,100
Tell me their names.

155
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,010
(Mansion of Lu)

156
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:53,780
I will kowtow and apologize to her.

158
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,300
We don't need
any disrespectful servants.

159
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,425
You're no longer hired!

160
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,180
Xu Zhihu has a bad reputation.

161
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,060
I'm not the only one disrespecting her.

162
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,800
This is your pay.

163
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,620
Off you go.

164
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:15,200
She disrespected Lady Zhihu.

165
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:17,860
Shall I go and kill her?

166
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,300
His Highness

167
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,620
has his plan.

168
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:25,660
Don't act on your own.

169
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,180
Never mind.

170
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,940
No matter what others think of you,

171
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,700
you're the daughter-in-law
of our family.

172
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:33,260
If anyone disrespects you again,

173
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:34,420
don't hesitate to tell me.

174
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,060
You always take good care of me, Uncle.

175
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,100
I know that.

176
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:41,540
Anything else?

177
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,740
Why?

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,260
Over the years,

179
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,140
you've treated my sister
as your family member.

180
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:54,460
I will

181
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,075
never forget this.

182
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,340
We have

183
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,420
our family rules.

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,940
You don't need to thank me.

185
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:04,940
I'll take my leave, then.

186
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,700
I'm going to see him off out of the town

187
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
and come back soon.

188
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:10,940
Wait a second.

189
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,540
Senior, when we first met,

190
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,260
I said

191
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:24,140
that I wanted to experience
your Snakes in Sleeves.

192
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,875
When His Highness stayed in my mansion,

193
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:28,940
if I fought you,

194
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,500
I would be disrespecting him.

195
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,620
Now you're leaving.

196
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,250
Do I

197
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:35,780
have the honor

198
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,180
to fight you?

199
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:00,740
Bring it on.

200
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,220
Now?

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,060
You proposed that, didn't you?

202
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,260
It's my luck

203
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,275
to fight the God of Sword.

204
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,025
Please wait a moment.

205
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,020
I'll take a bath, get changed,

206
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:16,820
and burn incense for my sword.

207
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,060
Only in this way

208
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,275
can I do the best swordsmanship

209
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,180
and have no regret.

210
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:23,460
Go ahead.

211
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,260
I'll be waiting for you.

212
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,825
Wait.

213
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,625
Mm?

214
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,580
What else do you want?

215
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,300
It takes a while for your bath, right?

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,275
Right.

217
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,180
Get me some more porridge.

218
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,800
Ah?

219
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,320
Can I have a salted egg?

220
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,025
Sure.

221
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:49,660
Leave without me.

222
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,060
I'll catch up after I fight him.

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,660
We'll be waiting for you
in Baoguo Temple.

224
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,700
Wait.

225
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,475
You were just assassinated
the other day.

226
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,900
How about leaving together with Senior?

227
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:00,825
Miss Hehe had a sneak attack.

228
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,020
Now we're on guard.

229
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,250
She won't have a chance anymore.

230
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,125
Besides,

231
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,300
Baoguo Temple isn't far from Yangcheng

232
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
and there'll be a gathering of scholars.

233
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,780
She won't assassinate me there.

234
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,380
The debate is starting soon.

235
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,420
Let's go and quarrel with them.

236
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,300
Go, go, go.

237
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:43,620
Where's Senior Li?

238
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,740
We're leaving first.

239
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,820
He'll meet us in Baoguo Temple.

240
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,940
There are two monsters in the carriage.

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,650
Oh.

242
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,075
His Highness's Hukui.

243
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,380
They don't bite people. Get in there.

244
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,620
No, no.

245
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,975
I'd like to sit here.

246
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,820
Get out of town through the north gate

247
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,220
and ride to Baoguo Temple at top speed.

248
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:38,525
(Ancient Pavilion)

249
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,875
(Baoguo Temple, Yangcheng, Yangzhou)

250
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,650
So many people?

251
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,580
Are there always so many people
in a gathering?

252
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,225
The debate is a literary event.

253
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,300
Scholars only take some maids.

254
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,860
Other servants

255
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,300
have to wait here

256
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,540
in case of disturbing the scholars.

257
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,375
They think they can be isolated
by a mere wall?

258
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,775
It's the common practice

259
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:13,980
for debates of scholars.

260
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,540
Let's get in.

261
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:16,700
Wait a minute.

262
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:24,725
Young men here all have literary talent.

263
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,025
I'm sure we'll hear many new viewpoints.

264
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:29,925
Yeah.

265
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,260
Your Highness.

266
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:37,980
Is everything all right?

267
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,820
No one has stalked us.

268
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,900
We're out of the town, at last.

269
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,220
Get into Baoguo Temple with me.

270
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,325
This place is too crowded.

271
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:48,860
No one of the Lu Family
will take part in the debate.

272
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,200
It's safer to stay in the Temple.

273
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:56,975
Go away.

274
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,550
Young Master and ladies,

275
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,340
wish you good luck

276
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,380
and a long life.

277
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,750
I like your blessing.

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,060
Reach out your hand.

279
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,500
Keep it carefully.

280
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,300
Thank you.

281
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:22,980
In the backyard of the Temple,

282
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,020
there are watermelons in the pool.

283
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,780
Watermelons?

284
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,980
Free for scholars
to quench their thirst.

285
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,800
They're sweet.

286
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,940
Go have a taste.

287
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,500
All right. Thank you.

288
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:34,180
Go. Let's get in for the watermelons.

289
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,025
I haven't seen Xu Fengnian yet.

290
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,420
He's outside the Temple.

291
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,020
I rode very fast

292
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,075
and arrived before him.

293
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,432
Look.

294
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,388
That's indeed Mr. Wu.

295
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,540
Let's stick to our plan.

296
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:00,025
If we see dregs of West Chu
around Xu Fengnian,

297
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,580
(Cranes and Clouds)
you'll kill them

298
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,540
and I'll kill Xu Fengnian.

299
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,025
Let's wait and see.

300
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,500
You're using White Fox's blade
to cut the watermelon?

301
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,060
She's not here, anyway.

302
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,060
Come over.

303
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,660
Let's give her some watermelons later.

304
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,475
My Lady, it's too cold.

305
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,460
Don't eat too much.

306
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,420
A piece of melon will be all right.

307
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,300
Do you still need the peels?

308
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,260
What can they be used for?

309
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,460
They can be pickled.

310
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,025
She won't take it.

311
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,125
The watermelons
are prepared for scholars.

312
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,060
If she takes any, she'll be expelled.

313
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,075
She's a poor girl,

314
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,340
begging for a living.

315
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:07,775
Her grandfather is paralyzed in bed.

316
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,375
Without her,

317
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:12,800
he would have died last winter.

318
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,860
Considering her poor life,

319
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,340
monks here acquiesce in her begging
in the Temple.

320
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:20,740
You know her?

321
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,275
I once taught her to read.

322
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,000
In such a poor family,

323
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:26,350
how will reading help her?

324
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,600
She can't be reasonable
unless she reads.

325
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,860
Now that she's in a poor family,
she can't have a chance of survival

326
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,375
unless she saves herself.

327
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,300
Why don't you eat the watermelons?

328
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:37,980
I can't eat them, either.

329
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,220
They're for scholars, aren't they?

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,175
I'm not a scholar.

331
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,475
What are you, then?

332
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,660
A poor man.

333
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,380
If you sit beside me,

334
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,650
you'll be mocked by famous scholars.

335
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,200
I'm a loser.

336
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm used to being mocked.

337
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,425
You're a glamorous loser, then.

338
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,180
It's just a fake appearance.

339
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,975
Are you here for the debate, too?

340
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,375
I'm too poor to take part.

341
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,740
Then why did you come?

342
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,500
I came to read the book.

343
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,060
Read in the Temple?

344
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:31,800
Mm.

345
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:34,820
Scholars often donate money
to the Temple.

346
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,225
Sometimes, they donate books, too.

347
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,420
When I often come,

348
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,525
I can borrow some books from the monks.

349
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,575
Why do they donate money?

350
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:45,620
For fortune, luck, or marriage.

351
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,100
They pray to the Temple,

352
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,625
instead of books?

353
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,860
Look at the pool.

354
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,000
Wisdom and extrication are sought

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,980
in Buddhism.

356
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,925
What does it have to do
with throwing coins in the pool?

357
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,650
They don't care about Buddhism.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,620
All they care about is quick money.

359
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,420
Aren't they bartering the trunk
for the branches?

360
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,350
Now that you think so,

361
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,500
you can't be a loser.

362
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:23,980
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

363
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,180
Master asked me to pick some coins.

364
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:35,900
Go ahead.

365
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,775
Monks here are good.

366
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,140
They're benevolent.

367
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,420
Her Ladyship said
the debate would start momentarily.

368
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,300
We should go.

369
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,875
Mm.

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,850
Are you really not going?

371
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm not going.

372
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,825
Or I'll be kicked out.

373
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,025
Let's go.

374
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:13,929
Ah!

375
00:19:16,775 --> 00:19:17,850
Dirty girl!

376
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,420
Who allowed you to pick the coins?

377
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,300
Monks here said it was all right
to pick several coins.

378
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,825
How dare you talk back!

379
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:24,475
Freeze.

380
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
How dare you talk back!

381
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,580
It's more interesting
than the pitch-pot game.

382
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:32,540
- Yeah.
- Hit her.

383
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,575
I won't pick the coins.

384
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,260
I don't dare to do that anymore.

385
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,620
It's too late to beg for mercy.

386
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,020
She just picked a few coins.

387
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,980
Do you need to hurt her like this?

388
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,980
Who do you think you are, poor man?

389
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,000
Chen,

390
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,860
I'm all right.

391
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,940
It doesn't hurt.

392
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,975
You were hit, right?

393
00:19:59,225 --> 00:20:00,425
Who are you?

394
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,540
I'm from North Liang.

395
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,250
North Liang?

396
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,705
Xu Fengnian?

397
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,350
He hasn't come yet.

398
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,700
He has arrived, I guess.

399
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,540
Then why hasn't he come for the debate?

400
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,820
In Baoguo Temple,

401
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,650
what can be more important
than today's debate?

402
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,220
Everybody saw that.

403
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,260
You tried to hit me with ill intentions.

404
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,980
I had to pull out my blade
and fight back.

405
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,620
I was only trying to hit them.

406
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,740
Stop lying.

407
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,980
This is the debate

408
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,980
where all scholars of Jiangnan
are gathering.

409
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,420
How dare you do violence!

410
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,980
Aren't you scared of national laws?

411
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,975
Do you know

412
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,860
that I killed Liu Liting?

413
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,250
- It's him?
- It's him?

414
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,420
It's been a few days,

415
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,975
but I haven't been arrested yet.

416
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,980
Because of the hospitality, I guess.

417
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,620
It'll be all right
if I kill one more person.

418
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,300
What does it have to do
with hospitality?

419
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,050
Don't!

420
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:07,950
You want to save her?

421
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,420
Can you kill all her family?

422
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,380
You can leave after you kill her.

423
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,940
But this girl can't.

424
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,100
The woman's family doesn't dare
to take revenge on you.

425
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,275
But what about this little girl?

426
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,660
After I leave,

427
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,340
if you dare to give them problems,

428
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,980
I'll come back.

429
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:38,460
Do you get it?

430
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:53,300
What's your name?

431
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,300
I am

432
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,500
Chen Xiliang.

433
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:00,525
Chen Xiliang.

434
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,660
Do you know

435
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,100
the topic of today's debate?

436
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,060
(Scholar Chen Xiliang)
Kings and overlords.

437
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,420
What is a king and what is an overlord?

438
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,100
Kings practice benevolence.

439
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,820
Overlords perform hypocrisy.

440
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,220
Now that you understand,
do you dare to debate with them?

441
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,740
I'll go to the debate with you.

442
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:17,300
If anyone thinks you're not qualified,

443
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,500
I have the blade, anyway.

444
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,900
Go home first.

445
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,000
No. I'll go with you.

446
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,350
Then wait for me at the gate.

447
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,175
Take off your shoes and air them.

448
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,225
Mm.

449
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,525
Go ahead.

450
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:43,020
I'll go with you.

451
00:22:43,725 --> 00:22:44,925
I thought you would reject me.

452
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:46,380
I'm not an idiot.

453
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:48,500
Only when everybody knows

454
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
that I'm your minion

455
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,900
can she and I stay alive.

456
00:22:52,825 --> 00:22:54,075
You know who I am?

457
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,275
Didn't she just say?

458
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,900
You're Xu Fengnian from North Liang.

459
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,475
I'm the most famous playboy

460
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:00,860
and the most domineering loser.

461
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,875
It would be better

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,700
if there were more losers like you.

463
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,700
Kings focus on virtue.

464
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,060
Overlords focus on power.

465
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,260
Overlords can exploit the boundary

466
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,375
and become rich.

467
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,780
(Deliberation)
But they rule by force.

468
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,660
They use severe punishment and laws

469
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,225
to rule the world.

470
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,740
Overloads are superior
while ministers are inferior.

471
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,100
(Deliberation)
Then they can unify the world

472
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,325
and establish a big nation.

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,660
But when they behave like this,

474
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,980
they easily get brutal.

475
00:23:40,425 --> 00:23:41,725
They'll lose their families

476
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,325
and human relations.

477
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,900
Their reign will be overturned.

478
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,260
Their rites will collapse, too.

479
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,525
(Deliberation)
Kings, however,

480
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:51,980
(Deliberation)
rule the world by benevolence.

481
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:54,340
They instruct people with loyalty.

482
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,875
They don't hurt people
and they're virtuous.

483
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:01,820
The world will be at peace
and people will live a happy life.

484
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,620
Nonsense!

485
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,820
Who's he?

486
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,220
He's so rude.

487
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,060
Let me say it again more gently.

488
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,500
What he just said

489
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,420
was rubbish.

490
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,300
What...?

491
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,740
Why did he say that?

492
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,260
Xu Fengnian!

493
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,875
You respect kings
and disrespect overlords.

494
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,260
That's nonsense!

495
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,620
Don't stare at me.

496
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,420
I can't debate.

497
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:32,595
He'll talk on my behalf.

498
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,420
Not everyone is qualified

499
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,485
to talk in the debate.

500
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:49,860
Go make a speech.

501
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,260
If anyone wants to stop you,

502
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,790
I will stop him.

503
00:25:02,725 --> 00:25:03,940
What I'm going to say

504
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:05,580
is very simple.

505
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,020
If a nation can be managed,

506
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,340
virtue will be beneficial.

507
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:10,780
If people can be helped,

508
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,700
the force will be beneficial, too.

509
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,060
Because overlords

510
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,785
reinforce the kings.

511
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,740
Total nonsense!

512
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,900
Kings and overlords together?

513
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,300
Such ambition

514
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,260
will only ruin the foundation
of Confucianism.

515
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,940
If all people only seek
for money and fame,

516
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,140
we'll be crying for five hundred years.

517
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,125
Without benefits for the people,

518
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,500
how would crying help?

519
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,400
Now, people have little food to eat.

520
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,820
Whom can they cry to?

521
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,425
Absurd.

522
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,975
Ridiculous.

523
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,375
What a debate it is!

524
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,450
Yeah.

525
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,740
Debates are often held.

526
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:48,740
But what else have you done,

527
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,700
except cherishing the memory
of the so-called ancient prosperity?

528
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,820
You take quotations from classics

529
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,900
and sound honey-lipped.

530
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:53,500
But will such quotations
provide more food

531
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,580
or more clothes for our people?

532
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,550
You only debate, but never take action.

533
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,850
You do harm rather than good.
Debates ruin the nation.

534
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
It's you who started it!

535
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,660
How dare you!

536
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:02,780
Gross nonsense.

537
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,732
It's recorded in the books.

538
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:04,380
He's so rude.

539
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,325
Be nice.

540
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,420
You...

541
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,380
Who are you?

542
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,980
I'm Xu Fengnian from North Liang.

543
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,928
He's the man
who killed a person on the street.

544
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,470
He killed Liu Liting.

545
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,375
Xu Fengnian? It's him?

546
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,221
Yeah. It's him.

547
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,475
He should pay with his life.
I hear he's a playboy.

548
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,980
You don't understand words.

549
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:25,540
But you're scared of my blade.

550
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,180
You continue.

551
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:31,625
I've found some veterans
that fought the war against West Chu.

552
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
They will check on

553
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,775
the girls behind Xu Fengnian.

554
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,540
Don't bother.

555
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:37,700
You're scared?

556
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,420
Before the war started,

557
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,860
I visited the capital of West Chu

558
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,980
and I saw the Consort of West Chu.

559
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,820
That girl

560
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,420
looks exactly like her.

561
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,940
She's the princess of West Chu?

562
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:54,340
Yes, I guess.

563
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,820
Your cousin was killed
by the royal family of West Chu?

564
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,740
Exactly.

565
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,940
Then what are you waiting for?

566
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,300
Take action.

567
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,220
You go kill the princess of West Chu

568
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,740
and I'll kill Xu Fengnian.

569
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:10,860
Do you think
my family will offend North Liang

570
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,890
for you?

571
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:14,420
You no longer dare to take revenge?

572
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,780
What are you going to do?

573
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,225
If I kill the dregs of West Chu,

574
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,500
I may infuriate Xu Fengnian.

575
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,460
By then, I'll give you to him

576
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,780
to calm down North Liang.

577
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:30,650
My family has been prospering,

578
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,660
not only by taking revenge all the time.

579
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:35,925
We've also learned

580
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:37,975
to keep a low profile.

581
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,400
You're betraying me!

582
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:47,540
Action.

583
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,660
Seeking benefits

584
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:51,675
may not be antithetical.

585
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,540
The pursuit of virtue without laws

586
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,300
will only cause chaos in the world.

587
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,260
You worship the ancient world.

588
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,740
But great changes have taken place.

589
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,820
Human hearts are no longer
what they used to be.

590
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,475
If kings don't make contributions,

591
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,000
incorruptible officials
would be more effective.

592
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:10,780
Is this the way North Liang is ruled?

593
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,050
He made a good point, I think.

594
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,550
Your Highness,

595
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,325
you're going to be the enemy
of scholars in the whole world?

596
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,550
Don't exaggerate it.

597
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,625
Jiangnan isn't the whole world.

598
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,860
You can't represent all scholars, too!

599
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,740
Uncle?

600
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,060
This is Liu Liting's wife.

601
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,425
She has held the debate

602
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,180
to assassinate you, Your Highness.

603
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,980
I've captured her for you.

604
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,020
Should I say thank you?

605
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,575
Everybody,

606
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,675
please wait in the backyard.

607
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,750
We'll apologize to you later.

608
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,275
Let's go.

609
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,725
What a killjoy!

610
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,750
Your Highness, you fell out
with scholars of Jiangnan.

611
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:28,180
I guess

612
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,825
the royal family will let you
take over North Liang without concern.

613
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:32,980
You're done with the big event.

614
00:29:33,925 --> 00:29:35,165
Let's talk about the minor event.

615
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,350
What is a minor event?

616
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,260
The national fortune is a big event.

617
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,975
The family hatred is a minor event.

618
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,175
She...

619
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,375
Who's she?

620
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,500
She's my maid.

621
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,525
Your Highness, you know

622
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,420
the feud between my family
and West Chu, don't you?

623
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,700
She's innocent.

624
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,900
As long as you leave her to me,

625
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,260
we'll support you
in becoming the Lord of North Liang.

626
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,325
If anything happens in the court,

627
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,460
we'll have the message

628
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,025
sent to you.

629
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,025
The maid or the support of a clan?

630
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,350
It's not hard to make the choice, is it?

631
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:30,675
It's not.

632
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:33,140
But I won't give her to you.

633
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:38,980
Don't you persuade him?

634
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,260
Uncle, I've kept in mind

635
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,580
your kindness for me these years.

636
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,580
In other cases,

637
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,340
I would be on your side.

638
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,780
But I never persuade Fengnian

639
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,180
when he has to make a choice.

640
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,100
I just support every choice he makes.

641
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,940
Or what kind of sister would I be?

642
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:12,050
Don't worry, Your Highness.

643
00:31:13,425 --> 00:31:14,460
I won't kill you.

644
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:17,020
After I take her down,

645
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,475
I'll see you off personally.

646
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,780
I don't think I can defeat you.

647
00:31:27,525 --> 00:31:29,100
As long as you give way,

648
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,700
we'll make compensations for you.

649
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,340
A piece of advice for you, too.

650
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,700
If you dare to hurt her,

651
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,300
I'll spend my whole life
ruining your family.

652
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,675
I'm serious.

653
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,400
In the Battle against West Chu,

654
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,980
a lineal son of your family died.

655
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,855
But if you want to ruin your family

656
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:48,200
just for your cousin,

657
00:31:48,725 --> 00:31:49,725
is it worth it?

658
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,050
Without my cousin,

659
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:54,140
I would have been dead.

660
00:31:54,925 --> 00:31:55,900
Oh, I see.

661
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,980
Let's fight, then.

662
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,350
Hey.

663
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:12,380
Go away!

664
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:14,775
What?

665
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,700
Do you also want to get in
for the debate?

666
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:18,900
I'm waiting for someone.

667
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,660
Go away!

668
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,620
I promised Chen to wait for him here.

669
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:29,575
Sir,

670
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,420
the debate is over.

671
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,125
Please leave.

672
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:43,300
Stop him.

673
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:53,975
(Baoguo Temple)

674
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:30,050
(Baoguo Temple)

675
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,220
You haven't learned martial arts
for a long time, have you?

676
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,725
Do you also think I'm a genius?

677
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,225
You're indeed a genius.

678
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,225
Wang Chonglou gave Dahuangting to you.

679
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,100
But he can't teach you
the marrow of blade artistry

680
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,375
or the Heart Arts.

681
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,450
In such a short time,

682
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,260
you can fight like a master.

683
00:34:02,725 --> 00:34:04,100
In the future,

684
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,350
you may be among the top three
martial artists.

685
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,500
I also think you can do great swordplay.

686
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,175
Now that we appreciate each other,

687
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,325
shall we not fight?

688
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,660
Give her to me

689
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:14,980
and I'll let you go.

690
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,625
What can you offer?

691
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,300
Like I said,

692
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,940
my family will support you
in taking over North Liang.

693
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,450
It's not enough.

694
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,100
Tell me what you want, then.

695
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:30,380
Among Xu Xiao's six adopted sons,

696
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,900
who's the most horrible one?

697
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:33,425
You know that, don't you?

698
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:34,980
Chen Zhibao.

699
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,850
Kill him for me

700
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,200
and I'll give her to you.

701
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,290
Chen Zhibao is greatly supported
by North Liang Army.

702
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,450
He has excellent martial arts
and heart arts.

703
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:45,875
It's hard to kill him.

704
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,100
Before Chen Zhibao is dead,

705
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,620
how can I take over North Liang?

706
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:54,780
All right.

707
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,260
I promise you.

708
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,375
You'd better write it down.

709
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,140
Do you have paper and a writing brush?

710
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:03,825
There are some in the Temple.

711
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,540
Leave the Temple

712
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,800
to join Ning Emei and the others.

713
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,600
The Temple is besieged.

714
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,420
You can't go out!

715
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,750
Turning Water into Sword
of Sword Immortal of Tangxi.

716
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:14,260
I thought it referred to sword casting.

717
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,740
It refers to sword casting

718
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,220
as well as swordplay.

719
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

720
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,500
I won't hurt you.

721
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:25,300
Your Highness.

722
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:45,400
Snakes in Sleeves?

723
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:48,220
The God of Sword taught you that?

724
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,375
You just started to learn it?

725
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,200
It's the best you can do, isn't it?

726
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:09,375
Get out of the way!

727
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,650
Who?

728
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,940
It's our family business.

729
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,625
Please don't interfere.

730
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Sir,

731
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,380
what are you doing?

732
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,340
One step to the left.

733
00:38:38,575 --> 00:38:39,860
Horizontal brandish.

734
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,620
Defense with the scabbard.

735
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,340
Two steps back.

736
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,780
Defense again.

737
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:01,580
You can read minds?

738
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,350
Stab.

739
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,575
Withdrawal and horizontal defense.

740
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,050
Three steps back.

741
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,100
I'll take four steps back.

742
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,340
I don't read minds.

743
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,660
I just offered the best solution.

744
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,275
You insisted on taking
one more step back.

745
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,300
When you threw the little stone,

746
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,260
you figured out

747
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,820
that I would lose like this?

748
00:39:58,425 --> 00:39:59,940
When you calculate with human minds,

749
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:01,620
you never lose.

750
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,420
You are...

751
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,620
...Cao Changqing.

752
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,500
(Cao Changqing, Elegant Man in Black)

753
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,900
I remember your cousin.

754
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,060
He was killed by soldiers of West Chu.

755
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:16,220
Now I'm going to be killed by you.

756
00:40:17,725 --> 00:40:19,740
It's like a destined ending.

757
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:26,825
He's dead?

758
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,650
He's just in a coma.

759
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,580
Mr. Cao, thank you for helping us.

760
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,775
I'm Cao Changqing,
a guilty minister of West Chu.

761
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,980
Greetings, Your Grace.

762
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,860
Your Grace, Lu Baijie wanted to kill you

763
00:41:04,625 --> 00:41:05,900
to take revenge.

764
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:07,500
He had the right reason.

765
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,860
So, I stopped him

766
00:41:10,475 --> 00:41:11,580
but didn't kill him.

767
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:13,140
However,

768
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,425
you're the princess.

769
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:17,660
Xu Fengnian takes you as his maid.

770
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,325
You've been humiliated,

771
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:21,100
and I feel as if I were humiliated, too.

772
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:22,575
My heart is burning with grief.

773
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:24,780
I didn't know

774
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,260
that you were stranded
in the hands of our enemy.

775
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I'm guilty.

776
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,820
Luckily, here we meet again.

777
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,500
I'll kill Xu Fengnian to avenge you.

778
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,620
You get the wrong person.

779
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,800
Your Grace, you may not remember.

780
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,650
When I was a Chess Master
in the imperial palace,

781
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:43,925
I met you.

782
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,700
It's been a lot of years.

783
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,420
I may mistake everyone else,

784
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,860
but I'll always recognize you.

785
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,780
Your Grace. Your Grace, be careful.

786
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,620
Your Grace,

787
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,650
be careful.

788
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,975
Mr. Chess Master, come after me.

789
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,620
Don't fall, Your Grace.

790
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,300
Here I am.

791
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:07,325
Mr. Chess Master.

792
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,940
Please wait, Your Grace.

793
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,000
Let me kill him first.

794
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,975
Mr. Chess Master,

795
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,500
he's nice to me.

796
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:20,100
