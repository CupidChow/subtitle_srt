1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 38=

7
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,060
Hold it.

8
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,475
We've got a message?

9
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,050
Guangling Army organized an attack.

10
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,225
Li Chungang walked out of the carriage,

11
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:10,540
and waved the sword across the sky.

12
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,730
And then what?

13
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,000
How many soldiers did Zhao Yi send?

14
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,580
More than two thousand.

15
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,180
Only Li Chungang and his sword?

16
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,000
Only Li Chungang and his sword.

17
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,000
No one ever dared to get in the way.

18
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,550
The carriage advanced to the north.

19
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,420
Amazing.

20
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,175
What about Xu Fengnian?

21
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,255
Did he show himself?

22
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,180
Since Li Chungang was in the carriage,

23
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm sure Xu Fengnian was, too.

24
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,800
And it doesn't matter even if he wasn't.

25
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,650
I'm traveling to the west with you.

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,625
As long as Li Chungang doesn't come,

27
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,225
no one can stop you.

28
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:56,925
Then I feel secure.

29
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,100
I haven't had

30
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:02,200
a good sleep for ages.

31
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,050
Grand Master,

32
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,375
let's set off.

33
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,025
I can't wait

34
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,540
to go to West Shu.

35
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay.

36
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,575
Wake up!

37
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:58,260
Grand Master,

38
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,575
why do we get off the horses?

39
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,650
The horses

40
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:03,800
would draw too much attention.

41
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,125
We'll be traveling

42
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,825
by water.

43
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,125
It's safer.

44
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,750
We'll go on board

45
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,175
over there.

46
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,900
For the rest of the journey,

47
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,150
we'll let the current take us.

48
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,675
We were sometimes slow, sometimes fast,
and we've been changing courses.

49
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:41,775
Grand Master,

50
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,280
I don't think it's necessary
to be so careful.

51
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,425
No one can catch up with us anymore.

52
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,125
Xu Fengnian?

53
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,650
How is it possible?

54
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,300
How is it possible?

55
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,260
Do you remember

56
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,380
what I said to you in Wudi City?

57
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:14,425
Why would you save me?

58
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:16,140
You shouldn't die here.

59
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,175
Why don't you run?

60
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:20,860
You weren't supposed

61
00:07:21,425 --> 00:07:22,700
to die in Wudi City,

62
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:25,925
but here.

63
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,850
You saved me in Wudi City

64
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,450
in order to take my life here?

65
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,450
It doesn't make sense, does it?

66
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,220
Whether I save you

67
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,075
or kill you,

68
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:35,725
it isn't about you.

69
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,450
The person I regard as an enemy

70
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,200
has never been you.

71
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:43,600
You've been expecting me.

72
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:48,750
On the day my mother got assassinated,

73
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,250
where were you?

74
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:54,300
Xu Xiao should have had
an investigation.

75
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,475
I was ordered to a mission outside.

76
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,260
I wasn't in the capital city.

77
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,950
I checked the order.

78
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,460
And I had my men

79
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,750
question everyone

80
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,450
who was still alive.

81
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,250
Han Diaosi,

82
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,575
on the day my mother was assassinated,

83
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,275
you returned to the capital city.

84
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,800
So

85
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,875
someone saw me.

86
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes, someone saw you,

87
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,220
yet he didn't know you.

88
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,340
But that's okay.

89
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,820
Your look is easy to recognize.

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,340
Are you sure you got the right person?

91
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,900
I was 90 percent sure,

92
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,100
but after my journey to Wudi City,

93
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,050
I was given a confirmation.

94
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:34,750
Was this person

95
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
in the capital that day?

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,450
(Han Diaosi)
Yes.

97
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:47,775
You were in the capital city.

98
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,540
Why?

99
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,580
Because the royal family's
assassination on my mother

100
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,380
needed you,

101
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,850
the best martial artist
of the imperial palace.

102
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,450
However, you were afraid
of the revenge from North Liang,

103
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,125
so they gave the fake order.

104
00:09:00,475 --> 00:09:01,800
Who would have thought

105
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,260
that my mother managed to escape?

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,475
You were scared during that period
of time, weren't you?

107
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,150
You were scared that North Liang
would attack the capital city.

108
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:14,780
But it never happened.

109
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,175
Because my mother didn't disclose it.

110
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,600
Why?

111
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,375
Because the country was just founded,

112
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:23,100
if there was another war,

113
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,900
it would cause another turmoil.

114
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,255
Life would be in distress,

115
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,325
and the damage would be unamendable.

116
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,340
For the people across the country,

117
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,275
my mother kept it to herself.

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,925
She was a great woman.

119
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,125
But did you ever care
about the greater good?

120
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,380
North Liang was tough,

121
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:43,025
any ruler would be concerned.

122
00:09:47,725 --> 00:09:49,250
So you admit it.

123
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,580
Now that we've come this far,

124
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,600
it would be indecent of me
if I kept denying it.

125
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Yes.

126
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,100
I admit that I participated

127
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
in the attack on your mother.

128
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:02,780
Good.

129
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,050
The son exceeds the father.

130
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,775
What Xu Xiao failed to figure out,

131
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,625
you have done it.

132
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,050
You seriously underestimated Xu Xiao.

133
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,300
With all that he experienced
over the years,

134
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,540
I don't believe
that he was never suspicious of you.

135
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,620
But he never sought revenge.

136
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,225
Because the peace of the country

137
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,620
cost numerous lives
of North Liang soldiers.

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,980
He didn't dare to start a war

139
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,275
for a personal vendetta

140
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,740
that would set the country in chaos.

141
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,660
He didn't want to be guilty

142
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,525
of failing his dead brothers-in-arms!

143
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,175
The Lord of North Liang
had given priority to the greater good.

144
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,600
But I'm different from Xu Xiao.

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,460
How can I not

146
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,875
avenge my mother?

147
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,860
Why would the innocent abide

148
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,250
and make compromises?

149
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,700
I, Xu Fengnian,

150
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,900
won't put up with the grievances.

151
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,225
So

152
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,300
you'd rather ruin the peace

153
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,925
that the ancestors built?

154
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,025
I told you

155
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,675
that I'm different from Xu Xiao.

156
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,580
I demand individual justice

157
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,550
and public fairness.

158
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:20,925
Why must I choose one over the other?

159
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:22,940
I want both,

160
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,275
and this is
what my heart tells me to do.

161
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,300
Now that I think about it,

162
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,260
Cao Changqing's blatant journey

163
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,150
to West Shu

164
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,775
was to cooperate with you.

165
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:38,975
But something

166
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,850
has been puzzling me.

167
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:43,420
How do you know

168
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,740
that the imperial palace
had to send Zhao Kai to West Shu

169
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,550
and that it would be me

170
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
escorting him?

171
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,650
The weirdest thing is,

172
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,700
during our journey,

173
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,540
we've been constantly changing courses,

174
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,675
how come you get in our way right here?

175
00:11:56,775 --> 00:11:58,200
Obviously, someone

176
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:00,300
tipped him off.

177
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,175
It was you.

178
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,540
You serve North Liang?

179
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,675
Of course not.

180
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,550
His identity

181
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,375
is the answer to all of your questions.

182
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:26,820
You want to know why I knew

183
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,700
the imperial palace would
send Zhao Kai to West Shu?

184
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,860
Well, someone in the imperial palace

185
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,825
helped me lead things in that direction.

186
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,175
In the meantime,

187
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,975
he kept the communication with me.

188
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Who do you work for?

189
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,625
Can't you see that I use a blade?

190
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,550
Gu Jiantang?

191
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:49,475
General Gu's sickness

192
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,175
occurred in time, right?

193
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,975
Impossible.

194
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,050
Why would Gu Jiantang
work with North Liang?

195
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,540
Because as long as I'm alive,

196
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,740
you will leave all the opportunities

197
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,700
to me.

198
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:05,425
While you're around,

199
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,125
Gu Jiantang won't be allowed
to leave the capital city.

200
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,600
The tiger can't return to the mountain.

201
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,000
He's always begrudging.

202
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,625
Even if I was dead,

203
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,700
His Majesty wouldn't
let him leave the capital city.

204
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,580
But fewer obstacles,

205
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,550
more hope.

206
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,125
Good point.

207
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,625
Since you work for Gu Jiantang,

208
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,925
why do you serve as a retainer
of the Xuanyuan Family?

209
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,375
I asked a dumb question, didn't I?

210
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:37,020
The Xuanyuan Family controls
the waterways of the world.

211
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,700
How convenient is that?

212
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:41,425
General Gu can naturally see it.

213
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,140
To General Gu,

214
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,060
I'm nobody.

215
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,060
I was ordered

216
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,540
to serve under the Xuanyuan Family,

217
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,340
at the same time,
I made this choice for my own future.

218
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,220
Too bad,

219
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,025
His Highness acted faster.

220
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,940
When you were in the Xuanyuan Family,

221
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
you started to work with Xu Fengnian?

222
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,525
No.

223
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,940
General Gu couldn't have predicted

224
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,460
that His Highness would interfere
with the Xuanyuan Family's business.

225
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,020
I started to work
with His Highness afterwards.

226
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,325
You couldn't have time to take orders.

227
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,475
Also,

228
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,980
you didn't have any chance

229
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,340
to make acquaintance with Xu Fengnian...

230
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,750
Shangyin Academy.

231
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,020
Keep an eye on Xu Fengnian.

232
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,060
It would be the best
if you can hear what he says.

233
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,100
If you can't,

234
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,150
it's okay.

235
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:29,900
Yes.

236
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,860
I gave you the chance.

237
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,260
General Gu attached
importance to Shangyin Academy,

238
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,725
so he certainly had left his men there.

239
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,500
And I was given the order.

240
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,575
Good effort for General Gu.

241
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,200
I still remember

242
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,750
how you replied to me.

243
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,775
Where have Xu Fengnian

244
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,300
and my wife been?

245
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,150
They were talking in the room.

246
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,850
I dare not get too close
and eavesdrop on them.

247
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,780
Did Xu Fengnian come out

248
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,990
when I was meeting Sword God Li?

249
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,225
Absolutely no.

250
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,860
You started to lie to me from that time.

251
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,700
I apologize,

252
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,525
but you got in General Gu's way.

253
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:08,900
Who is it?

254
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,100
Yuan Tingshan.

255
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,220
General Gu wished to ask you

256
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,860
if you know that Han Diaosi
was actually in the capital city

257
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,660
on the night Her Grace was attacked?

258
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,020
I know.

259
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,660
I also know what General Gu wants.

260
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:29,400
We can talk about it.

261
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:41,260
Now I have pretty much
figured it all out.

262
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,820
Instead of being a hindrance,

263
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:45,975
Gu Jiantang actually facilitated

264
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,200
Zhao Kai's journey to West Shu.

265
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,375
And this person had been
tipping you off along the way,

266
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,300
so you showed up here.

267
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,220
In this case,

268
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,820
the Princess of West Chu
is one of your pawns, too.

269
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:03,780
Jiang Ni isn't a pawn.

270
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:05,980
Even without Jiang Ni,

271
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,340
I could still lure you
out of the capital city.

272
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,060
And coincidentally,

273
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,775
I ran into Cao Changqing.

274
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:15,300
Also, it happened
that Gu Jiantang wanted you dead, too.

275
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,575
It saved my arrangements
in the capital city,

276
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,050
which could be for future use.

277
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,700
A good plot.

278
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,000
Too bad,

279
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:29,500
Gu Jiantang couldn't be here in person.

280
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:31,725
I won't chat with you.

281
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,125
Let's get on board.

282
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,380
This is our ship.

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,225
You get on board first.

284
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,000
You came, too.

285
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,100
Cross the river in that way.

286
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,625
Xu Longxiang.

287
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,750
All four of them have arrived.

288
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,650
Though I'm not a martial artist,

289
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,500
I can't miss

290
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,660
the scene of revenging for Mother.

291
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,700
No wonder you helped
the Xuanyuan Family.

292
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,980
To gather everybody
from all corners of the country,

293
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,140
only the Xuanyuan Family
who controls the waterways

294
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,375
can pull it off.

295
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,300
Jiangnan,

296
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,075
the Academy,

297
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,800
Mount Longhu, and the Xuanyuan Family.

298
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,060
Every stop of yours

299
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,075
was part of your preparation for today.

300
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
You have no way to escape.

301
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,875
The four of you

302
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,060
wish to kill me?

303
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,425
Not just the four of us.

304
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,260
You transferred soldiers
from North Liang?

305
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,750
Xu Fengnian,

306
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:35,225
my eyes are always on North Liang.

307
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,300
Among all Xu Xiao's adopted sons,

308
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,220
only Chu Lushan follows your command.

309
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,620
Chu Lushan didn't make any move.

310
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,875
He's still in North Liang.

311
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,940
Where do you get any reinforcements?

312
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:02,350
Chen Zhibao.

313
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,940
Your relationship is the worst.

314
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,175
Why him?

315
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:39,800
I didn't come here

316
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,620
to aid Xu Fengnian.

317
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,800
I came to avenge my adoptive mother.

318
00:19:57,775 --> 00:19:59,475
We try to fight our way out.

319
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:00,720
Don't wait for me.

320
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,150
Rush to Shu.

321
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,825
Charge, North Liang riders!

322
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,750
These people

323
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,100
are far from enough.

324
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,450
Be careful, Grand Master.

325
00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:36,020
I didn't expect

326
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,150
that it would end up

327
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,900
as an internecine fight
between husband and wife.

328
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,875
I'm not your wife.

329
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:26,140
A born Diamond Realm.

330
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,350
Sadly, such a prodigy

331
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,900
shall fall on this day.

332
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:47,450
Cross the river.

333
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,075
Yes.

334
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:34,875
You didn't lose the blades, did you?

335
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,400
Go for the boss.

336
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,625
Snakes in Sleeves.

337
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,800
What is Heaven's Mandate?

338
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,375
The one who passes the Heaven's Gate

339
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,700
overtops all common men.

340
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,325
I, however, am in defiance.

341
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,300
Of how the Heaven's Way
determines one's life

342
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,380
and fate is not to be fought against.

343
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,540
Of men being subject to Heaven.

344
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,580
Of celestials being immortals.

345
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,780
Only the sword in my hand

346
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,950
cuts open the Heaven's Gate.

347
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:33,980
Now you understand

348
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,525
what Open the Heaven's Gate is, right?

349
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,225
Cut off the Heaven's Mandate,

350
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,600
cut off the fetters.

351
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,060
This thought

352
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,550
is the soul of Open the Heaven's Gate.

353
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,700
Open the Heaven's Gate!

354
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,175
Fengnian.

355
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,300
No need to be a death guard, huh?

356
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,200
Your Highness!

357
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:51,700
Fengnian!

358
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,300
Brother!

359
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,675
Go to hell!

360
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,800
Dahuangting.

361
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,500
Snakes in Sleeves.

362
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,375
Be careful, Grand Master!

363
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:13,580
Deng Tai'e.

364
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,200
And the swords
that Senior Li lent to me.

365
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:18,100
I'll lend this to you.

366
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,180
The next time you open the box

367
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,700
with the Heart Arts
of Snakes in Sleeves,

368
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,125
you have one shot to cast flying swords.

369
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,475
If it weren't for Li Chungang

370
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:28,700
and Deng Tai'e's Sword Intent,

371
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,280
this one attack alone

372
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,850
wouldn't be able to kill me.

373
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,750
Who else attacked my mother?

374
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,580
Grand Master.

375
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:04,460
Father doesn't want to see me?

376
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:07,425
It isn't important

377
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,600
if he wants to see you or not.

378
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,260
You need to fight

379
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,340
for what you desire.

380
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,500
(Zhao Kai in his childhood)
Even if it'll be the end of you,

381
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,700
you have to fight to earn
a glimmer of hope for yourself.

382
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,950
How do I fight to earn it?

383
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,650
I'll teach you.

384
00:31:43,175 --> 00:31:44,450
Xu Fengnian.

385
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,940
You were born the heir apparent
of the Xu family.

386
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,150
Everything is ready for you on a plate.

387
00:31:58,775 --> 00:31:59,860
However, I

388
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,300
have to try the best I can

389
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,750
to earn the slightest chance.

390
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,700
I understand

391
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,900
that you hate me very much.

392
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,135
I don't hate you.

393
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:28,800
But I also refuse to yield to destiny.

394
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,150
So I try to change it!

395
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,260
Even though the change
has brought me to this day,

396
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,675
to this moment,

397
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,850
I don't regret it.

398
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,450
The same for you.

399
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:00,425
You are the one

400
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,420
who found the slightest chance
of avenging your mother

401
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,575
against all odds.

402
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,700
Xu Fengnian.

403
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,500
You are

404
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,660
marvelous.

405
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,100
But I never intended to start a war

406
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,540
for my own satisfaction.

407
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,820
Zhao Kai,

408
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,980
this is the reason

409
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,825
why you end in this way.

410
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:56,100
I admit defeat.

411
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,020
Xu Fengnian.

412
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,600
You're better than me.

413
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,750
Don't drop them again.

414
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,800
General Gu asked me
to express his gratitude to you.

415
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,785
Our cooperation ends here.

416
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,475
Hope we won't encounter in battle.

417
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:49,350
This should be the last time
I work with you.

418
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,325
Who knows?

419
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:55,950
Return to North Liang!

420
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:07,725
Fengnian!

421
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,020
I have a feeling

422
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:28,925
that he'll never see you
as the Lord of North Liang.

423
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
Come home with me.

424
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,620
We have to return to our homes.

425
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,250
If we follow you back to North Liang,

426
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:46,940
it's like we're telling the whole world

427
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,700
that we killed Han Diaosi and Zhao Kai.

428
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,250
When you become the Lord of North Liang,

429
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,500
we'll be able to go home.

430
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,750
Practice your blade skills.

431
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:07,475
Honor the Xu family.

432
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,700
Brother,

433
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,250
I'll save some hawthorn berries for you.

434
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,200
When I'm back in North Liang,

435
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,425
I'll have to take another trip
to North Mang.

436
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,580
The clues about the other assailants

437
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,980
are somewhere on that land.

438
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,300
When I complete the real revenge,

439
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I'll come back

440
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,225
to get you all home.

441
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,100
Thanks.

442
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,975
I'm off.

443
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,340
Where are you going?

444
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,500
There are some books
that I need to read.

445
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,500
I have to rush back
to Tingchao Pavilion.

446
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,850
See you in North Liang.

447
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,950
If I am to go to North Mang,

448
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:24,475
I'll need to learn
how to cast flying swords on my own.

449
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:29,150
Didn't you sense the Sword Heart
that Deng Tai'e left?

450
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,575
It wouldn't be that easy.

451
00:41:31,475 --> 00:41:33,575
But I don't need
to think about that for now.

452
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:35,940
The future is full of uncertainties.

453
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,925
But no matter what the future holds,

454
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,075
remember one thing.

455
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,400
North Liang

456
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:44,900
is expecting our return.

457
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:10,175
(End of Season 1)

458
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,410
(The journey is long,
but you'll get there.)

459
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,550
(Persevere on the way,
the future is full of hope.)

460
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,830
(Wish all the travelers
know their ways back home.)

461
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,425
(Wish all the lost ones
find their paths to the future.)

462
00:43:03,425 --> 00:43:06,679
(Wish to meet again
even though we bid farewell.)

463
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:09,700
(Every ending is a rebirth.)

464
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,625
