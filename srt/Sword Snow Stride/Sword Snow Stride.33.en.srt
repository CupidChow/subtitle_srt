1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 33=

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,300
Mm?

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,875
Why are you glaring at me?

9
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,250
It's not like you to give up.

10
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:08,360
What makes you think so?

11
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,280
Stubborn as you are,

12
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,225
even after Li Chungang

13
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,840
became an Immortal-on-Earth again,

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,275
you wouldn't easily give up
or stop, would you?

15
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,900
Zhang Julu asked me to kill Xu Fengnian.

16
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,250
He's the prime minister, anyway.

17
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,250
How could I explain to him

18
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:29,080
if I didn't fight Xu Fengnian
in a big way?

19
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:33,000
So, you were only pretending?

20
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:34,400
Of course.

21
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,250
Like you said,

22
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,919
if Xu Fengnian is killed,

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,225
North Liang

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,125
won't let it go.

25
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,520
My sword is over there.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,750
I'll take my leave.

27
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,425
(Dragons Rising from Lake Ding)

28
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,840
No one has come after us.

29
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:17,650
Come on.

30
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,199
A master like me should
walk straight ahead.

31
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,900
I can't look back.

32
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:21,200
Or I'll be cowardly.

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,879
Amazing, Senior.

34
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:24,875
You're an Immortal-on-Earth again.

35
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,120
Even Wang Xianzhi
is only in the Celestial Realm.

36
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
You're now the best
martial artist, aren't you?

37
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:31,319
The realm is one thing

38
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,680
while the fight is another.

39
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,400
There're four levels
for masters of the highest rank.

40
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,195
Diamond Realm, Void Realm,
Celestial Realm

41
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,479
as well as Immortal-on-Earth Realm.

42
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:39,280
In a real fight,

43
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,750
martial arts are decisive.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,200
In a life-and-death fight,

45
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,759
Immortals-on-Earth can't always

46
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,250
defeat the masters
in the other three realms.

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,475
Especially Wang Xianzhi.

48
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,199
He can never be judged by the realm.

49
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,759
What's the use of the realms, then?

50
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:51,319
In different realms,

51
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,319
you have different understandings,

52
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,240
and you take different routes, too.

53
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,439
What routes?

54
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,240
The route downhill, for now.

55
00:03:57,675 --> 00:03:58,450
Fine, then.

56
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,599
Let's not talk about Wang Xianzhi.

57
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,550
How about what just happened?

58
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,680
If you had brandished the swords,

59
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,850
could you wipe out Mount Longhu?

60
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,375
There's always someone better.

61
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,360
Mount Longhu has been

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
at a stalemate with Double-Zen Temple
for a thousand years.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,680
It has such a long history.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
God knows how many old masters
there are on Mount Longhu.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,650
Kid,

66
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,675
you must understand.

67
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:14,680
The fight between masters

68
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,120
is just like the buffalo fight.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,079
What buffalo fight?

70
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,879
Buffaloes are mighty

71
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,775
with sharp horns.

72
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,400
But when they fight,

73
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,040
they mostly dash against each other.

74
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,725
When one of them wins,

75
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,325
they stop.

76
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,635
You just used the swords
to intimidate them, didn't you?

77
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,560
If we always had life-and-death fights,

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,319
how many people could still be alive?

79
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,920
Senior, you're the Immortal-on-Earth.

80
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,475
Can you talk like an immortal?

81
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,650
I can.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,160
The fight between masters

83
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,199
is just like the immortal buffalo fight.

84
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,079
All right. All right.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,240
I understand it.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,125
Say no more.

87
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,199
I can't stand it anymore.

88
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,300
- Senior Danping.
- Senior Danping.

89
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:03,850
(Zhao Xuansu, founder of Mount Longhu)

90
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,825
We had a tentative fight

91
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,200
and the result was beyond expectation.

92
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:18,480
Li Chungang

93
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,079
becomes the Immortal-on-Earth again.

94
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,475
Under such circumstances,

95
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,475
you still want to kill Xu Fengnian?

96
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,920
Xu Fengnian has to be killed.

97
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,800
Otherwise, Wudang Sect
would be powerful.

98
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:34,500
However,

99
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,050
he mustn't be killed on Mount Longhu.

100
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,350
We also can't let anyone suspect

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,920
that we're involved in his death.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,300
We won't take the blame

103
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,700
for Xu Xiao's fury.

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,199
You're shifting the big trouble to me?

105
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:53,275
Grandmaster.

106
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,475
You have supreme martial arts

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,825
and you look like a boy now.

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,279
I'm afraid no one in this world

109
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,175
can recognize you.

110
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,225
You're forcing me to take action?

111
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,350
Grandmaster,

112
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,400
our fortune in the next century

113
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,925
is in your hands.

114
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:21,319
Grandmaster.

115
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,199
If you don't mind,

116
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,025
please kill one more person.

117
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,950
Who?

118
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,519
The illegitimate son of His Majesty,

119
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:33,975
Zhao Kai.

120
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:48,325
It's not the way to Wudi City.

121
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:53,975
Do you have something to do there?

122
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,125
Didn't the senior who was fishing

123
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,519
ask us to go to Wudi City?

124
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,350
If we want to kill Xu Fengnian,

125
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:02,439
we don't need to go to Wudi City.

126
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,625
The key

127
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,519
lies in Li Chungang.

128
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,480
Wait.

129
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,439
Senior asked us not to kill Xu Fengnian.

130
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,775
It's a book of secret martial arts
of the Xuanyuan Family.

131
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,825
Where did you get it?

132
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,550
I said I would give you
some books on secret martial arts.

133
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,500
I have to keep my promise.

134
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,439
Senior doesn't want to kill Xu Fengnian

135
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,120
in case the world falls into chaos

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,425
and wars break out again.

137
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:45,825
You're not afraid?

138
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,150
I am.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,250
But if the world isn't in chaos,

140
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,500
how can I find a way out?

141
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,050
Without a way out,
how can I give you a bright future?

142
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,200
Yuan Tingshan,

143
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,600
you've been seeking a chance.

144
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,639
But you must understand.

145
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:04,639
Without a tremendous change,

146
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:08,125
you can get no chance to alter destiny.

147
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:17,925
If you're scared,

148
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,875
you can leave right away.

149
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,750
How can we defeat Li Chungang?

150
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,300
Let's wait for a friend of mine.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,080
Who?

152
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,250
Who can deal with the God of Sword?

153
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,250
Here she comes.

154
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,679
She once hunted me down.

155
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,480
I want you to do me a favor.

156
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,325
Why must I help you?

157
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,025
For White Emperor
Esoterica of Simplicity.

158
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,080
How do you know I want that?

159
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:13,750
I saw you fight.

160
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,550
Judged from your martial arts,

161
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,240
you're from Nanjiang.

162
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,050
Martial artists from Nanjiang

163
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,519
do crafty and variable martial arts.

164
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,919
But without White Emperor
Esoterica of Simplicity,

165
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:29,440
when they only practice with blades,

166
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,225
they'll all go insane at last.

167
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:33,525
Am I right?

168
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,200
No matter whether you want
to build up a sect

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,480
or inherit your original sect,

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,650
you need it.

171
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,275
I can give it to you.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,200
Neither of you shall run about again,

173
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,039
especially you.

174
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,250
Do you hear me?

175
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,625
Your Highness.

176
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:57,950
What's up?

177
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,875
I'm General Ning Emei
of Fengzi Battalion.

178
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,525
I came to apologize, Your Highness.

179
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,925
I want...

180
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,650
I want to keep escorting His Highness.

181
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:09,120
That's what you're supposed to do.

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,900
But I used to support you.

183
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,125
Support me?

184
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,900
Born with extraordinary power,

185
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,925
you're incomparably brave.

186
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:16,679
I thought His Highness was incompetent.

187
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:17,759
So, I decided

188
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,625
to support you
in taking over North Liang.

189
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,550
What's your decision now?

190
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,025
Now...

191
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,075
When escorting him all the way here,

192
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:26,799
I think...

193
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,025
Think what?

194
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,900
I think His Highness

195
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,960
will be a wise ruler.

196
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm glad to hear that.

197
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,025
North Liang belongs to my brother.

198
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,065
No one can take it away.

199
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,550
Your Highness...

200
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,804
Nor can I.

201
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,325
You don't need to fight Xu Fengnian.

202
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,150
I won't put you in a tight spot.

203
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,800
What do you want me to do, then?

204
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,500
I want to meet Li Chungang.

205
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,039
Don't. Don't.

206
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:40,440
I'll leave my brother to you.

207
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,000
My disciple is the most precious.

208
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,700
Rest assured, Your Highness.

209
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,475
For what you just said,

210
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,175
no matter what happens in the future,

211
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,519
I'll leave a ray of hope for your sect.

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,519
Fengnian, I climbed all the trees.

213
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:55,925
These are the ripest.

214
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,639
Fengnian, the hawthorns dropped.

215
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,620
They dropped.

216
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,375
Where's Shu Xiu?

217
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,519
Hasn't she embarked?

218
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,350
She hasn't.

219
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,225
There she is.

220
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,559
Where were you?

221
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,225
I just took a walk around.

222
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:37,900
Hey.

223
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,240
Did you see Senior Wei?

224
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,625
No.

225
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,519
That's weird.

226
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:44,720
He hasn't embarked, I guess.

227
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,399
Maybe he's looking for a place to sleep.

228
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,080
Shall I send some men to find him?

229
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,975
No, don't bother.

230
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,175
Done.

231
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,250
Done.

232
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,825
The hawthorns taste great.

233
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,320
Wait a minute.

234
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,600
Keep it.

235
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,825
But,

236
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,120
won't it feel lonely

237
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:39,575
if it stays away from its sister?

238
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,600
Family members will meet again.

239
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Protect it carefully.

240
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,039
I'll wait until you come back home.

241
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,500
Mm.

242
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,634
Does Master know about the assassination

243
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,120
against Xu Fengnian and Zhao Kai?

244
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,675
Master is in the zone.

245
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,600
You're daring.

246
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,120
Thank you for the help, Grandmaster.

247
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,879
I'm not only helping you.

248
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:10,950
I'm struggling to live, too.

249
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,800
I look like a boy.

250
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,825
But inside my body, I'm exhausted.

251
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,875
I'll die soon.

252
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:27,200
Grandmaster,

253
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,150
how come?

254
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,679
I can't live,

255
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,775
unless I become an immortal.

256
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,700
If Li Chungang and Wang Xianzhi
have a fight,

257
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,399
it'll be sublime.

258
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,225
I may have a chance
to knock open the Heaven's Gate

259
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,480
and find the last hope.

260
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,775
Grandmaster,

261
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,759
hope you'll find the way
to become an immortal.

262
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,225
Here I go.

263
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:00,675
Grandmaster,

264
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,120
are you going

265
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,825
to stalk them?

266
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,050
I'm going to board the ship

267
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,600
and travel with Xu Fengnian.

268
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,175
But how can you sneak
onto Xu Fengnian's ship?

269
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,550
By haunting them shamelessly.

270
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,675
You didn't stay?

271
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,325
You may rise.

272
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:39,000
A North Liang soldier salutes,
but doesn't kneel.

273
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,725
Your Highness,

274
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:42,675
I used to be stupid.

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
You're the future of North Liang.

276
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,559
Not until I'm back to North Liang alive.

277
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,675
Your Highness,

278
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,150
there's a ship ahead of us.

279
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,500
It belongs to the Xuanyuan Family, too.

280
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,680
I've got something to talk to him about.

281
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,350
You go back to your cabins for a rest.

282
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,250
Go.

283
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:53,325
Come out.

284
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,700
We made a deal.

285
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,850
When I leave Mount Longhu,

286
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,875
you should go west.

287
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,400
I remember.

288
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,775
That's the ship for you.

289
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,200
When you board another ship
on the river,

290
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,575
you won't be noticed.

291
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:31,725
Mm.

292
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:33,300
Good plan.

293
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,575
Since Liyang was founded,

294
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,925
there has been chaos in Shu.

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
Fierce armies and bandits
rise from all directions.

296
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,725
Most of them are veterans of Chu

297
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,825
who went to Shu for shelter.

298
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,750
I know that.

299
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,800
Even if you're the princess,

300
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,559
you can't easily persuade those people

301
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,375
to work for you.

302
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,625
The kindness of the royal family of Chu

303
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,425
has been worn away, I'm afraid.

304
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,039
Mr. Chess Master will help me.

305
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,559
I don't think Cao Changqing

306
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,900
can guard you day and night.

307
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,675
You must be very careful.

308
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:36,400
Mm.

309
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,225
Here's the second ship you asked for.

310
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,175
And the pigeons.

311
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,900
Wei Shuyang told me.

312
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:03,500
The pigeons are in the freight cabin.

313
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,775
When you need to send a message,

314
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:05,850
fly more pigeons

315
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,900
in case of accidents.

316
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:08,700
The sailors are all experienced.

317
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,125
They only know
she's heading for West Shu,

318
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,039
but don't know who she is.

319
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:13,475
Thank you.

320
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,200
You're welcome.

321
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,875
We owe you.

322
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:22,119
I'll wait for your message

323
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,100
about what you want next.

324
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,425
I heard that your mother died, too.

325
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:29,175
She died to accompany my father.

326
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,725
Their relationship...

327
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,625
I've never understood that.

328
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:35,925
I'm sorry for your loss.

329
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,925
If you don't mind,

330
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:41,975
I'll take my leave.

331
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,675
If trouble occurs on Mount Hui,

332
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,525
you and your family can come
to North Liang for shelter.

333
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,000
She's different from what she was
when we first met.

334
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,025
What happened has changed her.

335
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,000
Time for me to get to the other ship.

336
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:37,750
Senior Li,

337
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:38,925
I'll take my leave.

338
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh.

339
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,880
I'll go visit you in West Shu.

340
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,750
What for?

341
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:46,800
I'll make you my disciple.

342
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,825
He's already your disciple, isn't he?

343
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,025
He uses the blades.

344
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,150
You're more suited to my swordsmanship.

345
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:55,960
We'll see.

346
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:57,525
I haven't made up my mind yet.

347
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:00,500
Take your time.

348
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:17,900
My job is done.

349
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,075
I'll go back to that ship.

350
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:21,450
Thank you.

351
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:23,575
His Highness sent me.

352
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:06,875
Your Grace.

353
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:09,050
It's been years.

354
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,175
I never expected

355
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,900
that I could be the princess again.

356
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,400
Mr. Chess Master,

357
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,519
let's go.

358
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,650
Did I say anything wrong?

359
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,519
No. Your conversation isn't over yet.

360
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,039
What does that mean?

361
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,350
What's he up to?

362
00:26:51,325 --> 00:26:52,640
What are you coming for?

363
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:55,875
This is for you.

364
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,575
Why did you give this to me?

365
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,825
It's a gift for you.

366
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,700
Are you out of your mind?

367
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,775
It was your mother's sword!

368
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:14,200
Mr. Cao,

369
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,350
shall we

370
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,100
leave them alone?

371
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,825
After they part today,

372
00:27:24,025 --> 00:27:25,920
they don't know
when they can meet each other again.

373
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:43,275
Here.

374
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:45,825
We made a deal.

375
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,975
I pay you for reading books.

376
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,575
But it's been days
since I read last time.

377
00:27:49,575 --> 00:27:51,200
It's the deposit for the next time.

378
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,880
God knows when we'll meet again.

379
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,975
I don't care.

380
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:57,980
I just reserve it.

381
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,119
I'm the princess now.

382
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:02,175
I'll charge more.

383
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,350
The price will be doubled.

384
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,325
Two coins for one word.

385
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,800
That's acceptable.

386
00:28:17,925 --> 00:28:19,875
Do you also like Xu Fengnian?

387
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:23,725
That's not true.

388
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,050
You're nearly strangling the cat.

389
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,565
Mr. Cao,

390
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:40,039
don't talk nonsense

391
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,175
about this stuff.

392
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,600
Your Grace.

393
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:49,275
Time to go.

394
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:51,900
I see.

395
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:58,350
Mr. Cao,

396
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,500
could you do me a favor?

397
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,875
What is it?

398
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,425
When you're going west,

399
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:05,400
can you hype your voyage?

400
00:30:05,775 --> 00:30:06,850
So that people will know

401
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,480
Her Grace and I are going to West Shu?

402
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,480
That's right.

403
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,675
I can do that.

404
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,675
They can be prepared
to welcome Her Grace, too.

405
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:17,300
Thank you.

406
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,025
Wish you

407
00:30:19,225 --> 00:30:20,000
a happy voyage.

408
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:20,950
Xu Fengnian,

409
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,880
have you thought about
how you'll end up?

410
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:27,925
Be specific, please.

411
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:29,480
You're the son of Lord of North Liang.

412
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:31,800
You're destined to defend the world.

413
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,750
Her Grace is going

414
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:35,400
to draw in our former subordinates.

415
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,700
She's getting back
to West Chu, after all.

416
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,079
I'm afraid when you meet again,

417
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,559
you'll meet on the battleground.

418
00:30:42,075 --> 00:30:43,625
This is how you'll end up.

419
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,225
It won't happen, Mr. Cao.

420
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,440
I never

421
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,440
take any route arranged by others.

422
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,525
When that day comes,

423
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,225
trust me.

424
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,425
I'll defend the world and you.

425
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,400
Defend the world and her?

426
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,600
It's a tough job.

427
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,300
Where there's a will, there is a way.

428
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,680
I'll wait and see, then.

429
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,440
Off you go.

430
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,475
So, you're taking the cat, too?

431
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,650
Don't waste your time on me.

432
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:27,375
Talk to Her Grace
if you have anything to say.

433
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,325
We're done talking.

434
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:31,775
Our conversation will continue

435
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,039
when we meet again.

436
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,925
Two coins for one word by then.

437
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,225
All right.

438
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,500
It's a deal.

439
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,700
You simply had such a short talk?

440
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:17,799
He even gave you

441
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,680
his mother's sword.

442
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:20,759
But you didn't respond.

443
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,799
Trust me.

444
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:29,440
I can defend the world and you.

445
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,759
Two coins for one word by then.

446
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,519
It's a deal.

447
00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:15,300
If you send a message
back to North Liang,

448
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,700
she can still be stopped.

449
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,850
Grandpa Wei,

450
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,300
she's got her own way to go.

451
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,400
I'm glad you let go of her.

452
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,675
We don't get something
unless we first let go of it.

453
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,475
Only after we part

454
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,125
can we meet again.

455
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,775
When she's away, you sound grieved.

456
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,550
It's just my true feeling.

457
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:45,900
What's that on your head?

458
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,640
My hair.

459
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:49,600
What's in your hair?

460
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,475
Oh.

461
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:53,825
It's for you.

462
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,200
The Divine Token?

463
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,799
Before Jiang Ni left,

464
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:59,480
she asked me to give it to you.

465
00:33:59,775 --> 00:34:01,575
But it's the national heirloom
of West Chu!

466
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:02,880
You also gave her
Daliang Dragon Sparrow,

467
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,750
didn't you?

468
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:04,839
She gave you the Divine Token

469
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,000
and you gave her Daliang Dragon Sparrow.

470
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,159
How lavish you both are!

471
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,975
Your Highness,

472
00:34:17,525 --> 00:34:18,639
what is

473
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,159
our next stop?

474
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,125
Shangyin Academy.

475
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:01,800
Aren't we going to Wudi City
to wait for Xu Fengnian?

476
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,100
He's going to Shangyin Academy.

477
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,599
After he left North Liang,

478
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:07,315
he visited Xu Zhihu in Jiangnan

479
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,679
and Xu Longxiang on Mount Longhu.

480
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,775
Don't you think

481
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,875
he's going to visit my wife?

482
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,475
Who's your wife?

483
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,725
Xu Weixiong.

484
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,275
Xu Fengnian's second eldest sister.

485
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,519
You're his brother-in-law.

486
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,400
Then why do you want to kill him?

487
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,225
He doesn't know that.

488
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,200
He doesn't know
you're his brother-in-law?

489
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,750
Few people know that.

490
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,675
His sister hasn't told him yet?

491
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,875
His sister doesn't know that, either.

492
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,175
Wait.

493
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,960
She doesn't know that, either?

494
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,880
What doesn't she know?

495
00:35:37,675 --> 00:35:39,125
She doesn't know

496
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,400
she's my wife.

497
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,550
Aren't you extorting it?

498
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,600
She'll be my wife sooner or later.

499
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,100
Only a remarkable lady like Xu Weixiong

500
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,250
can be my wife.

501
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,025
Then why do you want
to kill her brother?

502
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,400
North Liang won't fall into chaos
unless Xu Fengnian is killed.

503
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,119
Only when there's chaos
can I distinguish myself.

504
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,360
By then, I'll be qualified
to marry Xu Weixiong.

505
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,600
So,

506
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,800
I want to kill Xu Fengnian

507
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,725
because I want Xu Weixiong.

508
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,850
I really want to see

509
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:12,275
what kind of a remarkable lady

510
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,125
can be a good match for you.

511
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:50,075
(Xu Xiao is my father. Hello, Brother.)

512
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:56,250
Look.

513
00:36:56,725 --> 00:37:03,375
(Xu Xiao is my father. Hello, Brother.)

514
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,679
What's going on?

515
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,950
My mother said

516
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:09,775
that she met my father

517
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:11,300
when he was fighting influential clans

518
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,375
throughout the nation.

519
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:15,910
They had love affairs.

520
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,325
But she never regretted it.

521
00:37:18,775 --> 00:37:19,675
Brother.

522
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:23,900
We meet at last, Brother!

523
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,325
You're saying Xu Xiao is your father?

524
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,950
I can hardly believe that, either.

525
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,400
I came to you

526
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,800
so that I can go back to North Liang
and figure out the truth.

527
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,350
Why didn't you come to me earlier?

528
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,320
My mother didn't tell me

529
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,750
who my father was.

530
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,525
Why did she tell you at last?

531
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:45,239
She told me about it

532
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:47,416
before she died of a serious disease.

533
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:48,549
She's dead?

534
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,775
I'm still in mourning.

535
00:37:51,425 --> 00:37:52,675
She just passed away?

536
00:37:53,325 --> 00:37:55,825
I buried her not long ago!

537
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,300
What a coincidence!

538
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,250
Shu Xiu.

539
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:15,320
He doesn't do martial arts.

540
00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:20,025
If you don't want me
to go to North Liang,

541
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,875
I won't go.

542
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,075
You don't need to kill me.

543
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,700
What's your name?

544
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,250
Long Yuxuan.

545
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,575
Call me Xiaochong.

546
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,850
Long is your family name?

547
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,150
Mm.

548
00:38:36,275 --> 00:38:37,550
It's my mother's family name.

549
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,525
Arrange a room for him.

550
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,280
Thank you, Brother!

551
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
It's so nice of you, Brother.

552
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,075
It's so nice of you.

553
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,000
Brother.

554
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,125
Brother.

555
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,159
I'll arrange the room for him.

556
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,600
Thank you, Miss.

557
00:38:56,825 --> 00:38:57,880
You're so strong.

558
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,625
Stop talking rubbish.

559
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,375
Come with me.

560
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:01,650
Thank you, Brother.

561
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,325
Thank you, Brother.

562
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,679
Let's see what he'll do

563
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,800
after he's on board.

564
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,325
Mm.

565
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,825
Miss Shu, you have good martial arts

566
00:39:43,025 --> 00:39:43,679
and you're nice.

567
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:44,900
You're beautiful, too.

568
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:47,650
If I can be your disciple,

569
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,175
I'll even laugh in my dream.

570
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:04,575
Let me stay and accompany you.

571
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,559
Miss Qingniao, it's windy.

572
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,025
Shall I hold the spear for you?

573
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,625
You...

574
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,050
Give it to me.

575
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,475
No, thanks.

576
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,599
Let me accompany you for a while.

577
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,125
Brother, are you tired?

578
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,525
Shall I give you a shoulder massage?

579
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:41,625
No.

580
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:43,500
I can do the leg massage, too.

581
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,875
What else can you do?

582
00:40:46,575 --> 00:40:48,079
I can do some simple cooking.

583
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,650
If you get some fish, I can cook them.

584
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:50,599
And?

585
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,719
And...

586
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,800
According to my mother,

587
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,925
boys are hot enough to heat pancakes.

588
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,400
In the evening,

589
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,550
I can make your quilt warm

590
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,125
before you go to bed.

591
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:00,975
Then you'll leave some pancakes in it?

592
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:01,800
No.

593
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,840
That's just a proverb.

594
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,800
Go away.

595
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,825
I'll leave the apple to you, then.

596
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,650
He's such a chatterbox.

597
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:17,325
He has got familiar
with everyone on the ship.

598
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,675
Do you think what he said is true?

599
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:22,060
How did he know
where your ship would pass?

600
00:41:24,225 --> 00:41:25,700
You're quite sharp-eyed.

601
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,599
It was an odd coincidence.

602
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:27,840
Then why did you get him on board?

603
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,000
Keeping him around me

604
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,440
is better than letting him
hide secretly.

605
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,840
Let's wait and see.

606
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,475
Senior,

607
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:39,100
please do me a favor.

608
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,880
I've done you a lot of favors already.

609
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,199
What is it?

610
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:44,150
We're arriving at Shangyin Academy.

611
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:46,599
I don't want others to go ashore.

612
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,825
Please go with me.

613
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,199
In case there are assassins?

614
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,450
My second eldest sister is there.

615
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:51,674
In her eyes,

616
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,775
my journey must be mischievous.

617
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:55,679
You're afraid of your sister?

618
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,800
Not me,

619
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,200
but everyone in my family.

620
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,039
When you're around, she might be kinder.

621
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,239
You're the God of Sword, anyway.
She'll show some respect.

622
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:06,639
Does she beat anyone in your family?

623
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,519
No.

624
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,150
She just...

625
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,975
She just looks fierce.

626
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:12,259
By the way,

627
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,350
when you see her,

628
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,325
never mention Second Eldest Sister.

629
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,125
Why?

630
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,125
She doesn't like that.

631
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,625
It sounds like she's inferior
to my eldest sister.

632
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,350
What's the point of competing for ages?

633
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,625
Because she's too competitive.

634
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,725
She even competes for ages.

635
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,250
- You got the fish.
- I got it. I got it.

636
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:31,400
