(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

=Episode 24=

7
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,300
You're Xu Longxiang?

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,620
Yeah.

9
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:40,780
What a coincidence!

10
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,860
I knew you're in Mount Longhu,

11
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,740
but I didn't expect
to see you right after I came.

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,325
It's destiny, I guess.

13
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:55,180
You want to fight?

14
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,875
People say the second son
of the Xu family has a pure heart.

15
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,540
It turns out to be true.

16
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,380
Sir,

17
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,550
what are you going
to do with my disciple?

18
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:16,825
Zhao Xituan, a Longhu Arch-Taoist.

19
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:18,950
Who are you?

20
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,350
It's just a misunderstanding.

21
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,975
I came to Mount Longhu to find someone.

22
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,380
Sorry to bother you.

23
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,180
Goodbye.

24
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,300
Hey.

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,740
Did I let you leave?

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,875
Old Taoist,

27
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,980
do we fight him?

28
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,975
The Three-thousand Red Thread?

29
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,725
What's the relationship
between you and Han Diaosi?

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,940
I came to find someone under orders.

31
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:52,060
Please let me off.

32
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,940
You wanted to fight?

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,020
Just a misunderstanding.

34
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,325
Say sorry to my disciple.

35
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,140
I was confused just now.

36
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,300
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

37
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,140
No fight?

38
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,900
He's my successor.

39
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,100
Do you think making a bow is enough?

40
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,980
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

41
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,260
No fight? Whatever.

42
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:32,940
How about

43
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:34,275
I kowtow to you?

44
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,500
What's your name?

45
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,700
My name is insignificant.

46
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,275
Go.

47
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,060
Thank you, sir.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,950
He's flexible.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,400
Another rising star
from the new generation.

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,900
Don't be afraid, Old Taoist.

52
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,300
If he bullies you,

53
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:05,500
I'll help you beat him.

54
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,620
Stop calling me Old Taoist.

55
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,020
You need to call me Master.

56
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,325
Old Taoist Master.

57
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,325
Fine, fine, fine. That'll do.

58
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,260
(Mansion of Liu)
Such a tragedy.

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,000
(Mansion of Liu)
Yeah.

60
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,225
Honey.

61
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,075
Honey?

62
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:31,425
My lady.

63
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,060
Mr. Liu

64
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,740
was dragged away by a horse
quite a while ago.

65
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,540
The leader called himself
the Son of the Lord of North Liang,

66
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,300
Xu Fengnian.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Look.

68
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:54,980
That's Lord Liu.

69
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,020
Lord Liu Liting.

70
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,500
Who's dragging him?

71
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,125
(Yangcheng)

72
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,725
Your Highness,

73
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,780
watch out.

74
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:37,775
(Mansion of Lu)

75
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,450
You

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,420
made trouble again?

77
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,200
You look emaciated.

78
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,100
Sister,

79
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,450
let's go home, okay?

80
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:51,540
Fengnian!

81
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:53,750
Fengnian!

82
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,380
Fengnian!

83
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,875
(Capital of Liyang Official Posthouse)

84
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,925
You seem relaxed, Grand Commander.

85
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,380
Han Diaosi.

86
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,700
What brings

87
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,575
you here, Cruel Cat?

88
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,740
I was away from the capital city.

89
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,180
Please pardon me, Grand Commander.

90
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,820
Look,

91
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,700
I come to greet you
right after I get back.

92
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,380
The head of the eunuchs
comes to greet me?

93
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:43,300
That's too much for me.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,600
Grand Commander, things

95
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,275
aren't looking good for you.

96
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,140
What?

97
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
In your opinion,

98
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm going to lose?

99
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,380
I'm afraid you will.

100
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,475
In the last few years,

101
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,075
he hasn't lost a single game.

102
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,140
Is there still hope for this?

103
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:16,900
He

104
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,500
only keeps playing
if he's going to win.

105
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,340
If he's about to lose,

106
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
he'll wipe away all the pieces.

107
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,580
You're quite cheeky as a player.

108
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,425
Not only as a player.

109
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,175
How to play a game,
how to act in life.

110
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,740
Your son

111
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,000
inherited the essence of you.

112
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,650
Has my baby boy

113
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,220
made another mistake?

114
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,380
Secret reports from Jiangnan.

115
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,500
Please have a look, Grand Commander.

116
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,860
Since they are secret reports,

117
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,775
I won't read them, then.

118
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,550
It isn't a small thing.

119
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:12,140
I suggest you read them,
Grand Commander.

120
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm old,

121
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:25,460
and I'm dim-sighted now.

122
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,875
Tell me about them.

123
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:29,225
In Jiangxin County, His Highness

124
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,380
broke into the house
of a Jiangnan gentleman Liu Liting.

125
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,075
He tied Liu Liting up to a horse

126
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,060
and dragged him to Yangcheng,

127
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,620
so that Liu was killed.

128
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,340
All scholars are shocked by this.

129
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,925
Jiangnan scholars wrote
a joint memorial to the throne.

130
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,965
The memorial is on its way
to the capital city.

131
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,275
Since he killed the man,

132
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:50,550
punish him in accordance with the law.

133
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,900
Why are you telling me this?

134
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,340
The second report.

135
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,125
Upon his arrival at Yangcheng,

136
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,660
His Highness was assassinated.

137
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,180
Grand Commander,

138
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,540
don't you ask if he's dead or not?

139
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,100
If he was dead,

140
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,325
you'd come
along with the imperial troops.

141
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:25,325
What are you suggesting,
Grand Commander?

142
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,675
You look at him.

143
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,325
Those eunuchs

144
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,175
like to beat around the bush.

145
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,800
They like to mince words

146
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,300
instead of talking frankly.

147
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:39,580
I mean

148
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,580
I can't put up with them.

149
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,580
Don't get me involved in your bicker.

150
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,060
It wasn't me.

151
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,050
He's the one who cut in.

152
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,800
You cheat again.

153
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,625
The investigation shows
His Highness was stabbed in the back

154
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,785
and spilled blood on site.

155
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,200
Your turn. Hurry.

156
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:12,540
Luckily, his cavalrymen
came to his rescue in time.

157
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,500
Favored by God, His Highness

158
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,140
stayed alive.

159
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,260
As we speak, he's recovering
in the Mansion of Lu.

160
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,625
Well.

161
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,250
Be careful.

162
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,620
How is it?

163
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,300
His wound is healing fast.

164
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,000
It's just a flesh wound.

165
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:44,325
If it was one inch to the left,

166
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:45,540
he would be dead by now.

167
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:46,820
He is a lucky dog!

168
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,275
Sister,

169
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,025
don't worry.

170
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,825
The vermin lives long.

171
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,500
I won't die so easily.

172
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,800
You are just in denial.

173
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,325
Since you knew there would be assassins,

174
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:01,980
why didn't you take precautions?

175
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,050
I was eager to avenge you.

176
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,300
You killed Liu Liting.

177
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,400
He deserved it
because he tried to harm you.

178
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:11,020
Do you know that

179
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,825
his wife wanted
to report you to the government?

180
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:18,675
(Yangcheng Governmental Office)

181
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:27,940
It's a murder in public.

182
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,660
But the law enforcement
doesn't do anything about it.

183
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,625
The government didn't take the case?

184
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,740
Their announcement said the officers

185
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,700
got a cold.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,975
Are they scared of my identity?

187
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,700
This is Jiangnan. Why are they
scared of the son of North Liang?

188
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,260
You made such a big mistake.

189
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,675
The Lu Family should have
kicked you out of here.

190
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,275
They didn't want
to get involved in your trouble.

191
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,500
Then why did they change their mind?

192
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,050
Well,
fortune and misfortune come together.

193
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,380
You got injured at the right time.

194
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,875
His Highness's injury

195
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,780
stirred the Lu Family.

196
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,260
Liu Liting was dead,

197
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,820
and the Lu Family

198
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,875
wanted to stay out of it,

199
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,900
leaving His Highness

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,550
to those indignant Jiangnan scholars.

201
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,125
But it happened

202
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,700
that he got assassinated.

203
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,550
They are scared of North Liang.

204
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,550
Yes.

205
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:41,925
No matter how big the trouble was,

206
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:45,525
the Lu Family would scold him.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,875
After all, you are relatives.

208
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,175
But the assassination

209
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,675
made things more complicated.

210
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,850
The Lu Family now
has to shelter His Highness.

211
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,300
They can't make you feel

212
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,200
it was them who did it.

213
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,340
We're relatives.

214
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,380
No need for the scrupulousness.

215
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,050
Relatives?

216
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,020
Lu Daolin is the Minister of Rites,

217
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,780
and he's right in the capital city.

218
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,140
You've been here for days.

219
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,875
Did he ever come to visit you?

220
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,650
Everybody is busy.

221
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,850
It can't be forced.

222
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:29,400
It's only the three of us here.

223
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Let's put the cards on the table.

224
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,450
It is true that North Liang

225
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,980
and the Lu Family
are bound together via a marriage.

226
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,300
But North Liang isn't the only side
that they depend on.

227
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,675
In my opinion,

228
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,475
when His Highness arrives in Yangcheng,

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,675
they are supposed to be hard on him

230
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,750
to appease His Majesty.

231
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,225
But because of the assassination,

232
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,180
they have to offer shelter
to His Highness.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,350
It's both good

234
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:56,500
and bad.

235
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,860
The benefit

236
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,100
is that

237
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,740
the Lu Family will
take good care of you.

238
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:09,350
They don't dare to watch you die.

239
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,620
Our father doesn't get his title Slayer

240
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,140
for nothing.

241
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,100
The government didn't hear my case

242
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,180
under the order of the Lu Family?

243
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,180
Notable families and great clans
in Jiangnan

244
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,060
are like the noble family.

245
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:23,860
Since there's a benefit,

246
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,175
there also has to be a downside, right?

247
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,140
The downside

248
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,325
is that

249
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,820
the Lu Family is too close
to North Liang.

250
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,700
The capital city

251
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:35,700
won't be happy about it.

252
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,140
I took Er'qiao home from the street.

253
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,460
She isn't a Lu.

254
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,075
There aren't many good Lu people.

255
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,325
If it wasn't for your injury,

256
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:49,380
they wouldn't even send
coals to our room.

257
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,725
They're so harsh on you?

258
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:51,460
Yeah…

259
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,340
Keep dressing the wound.

260
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,400
Stop nonsense.

261
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't listen to her.

262
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,425
I have a pretty good life here.

263
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,340
Let's get back to business.

264
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,475
Father is trying

265
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,140
to keep your hereditary peerage
in the capital city.

266
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,100
But if there is no conflict

267
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,940
between Jiangnan and North Liang,

268
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:15,580
why will His Majesty make you

269
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,740
the Lord of North Liang?

270
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:21,975
Grand Commander,

271
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:24,100
you should know

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,460
what His Majesty would like to see.

273
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:29,025
How am I supposed to know

274
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,020
what His Majesty would like to see?

275
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,950
The murder that Xu Fengnian committed
in Jiangnan

276
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,975
was pure atrocity.

277
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:40,350
But His Majesty enjoys it.

278
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:42,175
The more trouble he makes,

279
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,225
the more Jiangnan scholars hate him.

280
00:16:44,225 --> 00:16:45,980
In the meantime,
the happier His Majesty gets.

281
00:16:46,575 --> 00:16:47,975
You speak the truth

282
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,600
quite generously.

283
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,025
But now His Highness got injured.

284
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,400
The Lu Family has to take care of him.

285
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,625
The situation is not good.

286
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,975
Hey,

287
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,900
how about this?

288
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,580
We ask His Majesty
to give an imperial order.

289
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,575
Uh…

290
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,775
What…

291
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,900
What order?

292
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,100
He orders

293
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,740
Xu Fengnian to kill some Lu people.

294
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,060
By then,

295
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,950
I'm certain they'll fall out with us.

296
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,620
And then everybody's happy, right?

297
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,775
Please don't be absurd, Grand Commander.

298
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,325
It's impossible that His Majesty
gives such an order.

299
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,375
What else can I do, then?

300
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:42,600
I order Fengnian

301
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,975
to kill our relatives?

302
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,625
The only way Xu Fengnian
gets to inherit the peerage

303
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,020
is to make sure North Liang is isolated.

304
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,260
How to make that happen,

305
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,950
you think about it, Grand Commander.

306
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:11,220
I can't play this game anymore.

307
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,125
Let's start over.

308
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,100
That's all for me.

309
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,660
Farewell.

310
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,300
Hey.

311
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,925
Fengnian

312
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,700
was assassinated
by Fujiang Armors.

313
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,580
The last generation of Fujiang Armors

314
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,300
were slain by him.

315
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:40,250
Do you think there's a connection

316
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,780
between the assassination
and Han Diaosi?

317
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:48,740
This game alone is already
nerve-racking enough.

318
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,350
Why would you make it
more difficult for a monk?

319
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,675
Fine.

320
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,525
However, Grand Commander,

321
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:02,620
Han Diaosi was right.

322
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,300
If the Lu Family doesn't fall out with
North Liang,

323
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,220
you don't get
to keep the hereditary peerage.

324
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,975
Didn't you make a backup plan?

325
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,950
Come on, come on.

326
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,975
Let's play the game.

327
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,340
Things will work out for the boy.

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,460
He'll be relying on his luck this time.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,180
In my opinion,
you'd better get yourself healed first.

330
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,350
When you're feeling better,

331
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,140
you find an excuse

332
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,200
to make a scene in the Lu Family.

333
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:36,050
In that way,

334
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,325
things will be easier.

335
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,260
Xu Xiao had me come to Jiangnan

336
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,100
to fall out with the Lu Family.

337
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,140
But I'm not going to follow his plan.

338
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,260
Why?

339
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:49,950
Because you're in the Mansion of Lu.

340
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,450
Xu Xiao had schemed for long

341
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,350
both publicly and furtively.

342
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,700
He took everything into consideration

343
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,060
except for you.

344
00:20:02,225 --> 00:20:03,180
Don't say nonsense.

345
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,260
It'll be easy for me
to fall out with them.

346
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:06,825
They won't kill me,

347
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,625
and I can leave directly.

348
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,620
But what about you?

349
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:11,300
You'll keep living here,

350
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,340
and what will they do to you?

351
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,400
They're nice to me.

352
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,725
How nice?

353
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,700
Other than His Lordship,
no one is nice to you.

354
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,800
You go get a basin of hot water.

355
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:22,925
Okay.

356
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:29,875
Don't listen to her nonsense.

357
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,220
Take the crazy thoughts
out of your head.

358
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,620
I'm their daughter-in-law.

359
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:36,380
How badly can they treat me?

360
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
You just do your thing.

361
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,500
Once you keep your peerage,

362
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,860
you can take over
North Liang fair and square.

363
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,980
Think about the greater good.

364
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,860
So, I have to put you in misery
for the greater good?

365
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,380
I'd rather give it up!

366
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,675
I can fall out with the Lu Family,

367
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,580
but on one condition.

368
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,425
Sister,

369
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,180
leave here with me.

370
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,300
Silly boy.

371
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,180
It's fine that you go to
Wudi City with me.

372
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,260
It's also fine that I have someone
send you back to North Liang.

373
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:13,850
Or

374
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,050
I'll have someone send you
to Mount Wudang.

375
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,925
I won't go anywhere.

376
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,250
Sister,

377
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,860
don't you think about yourself?

378
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,600
All right.

379
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,700
I know that you care about me.

380
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,100
You get yourself healed first.

381
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,380
When you're in good shape,

382
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,575
we talk about it.

383
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,300
Rest well.

384
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,420
I'll leave you alone.

385
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,420
My lady.

386
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:53,285
Shush.

387
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,420
After Young Master comes here,

388
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,660
the Lu Family becomes nicer.

389
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,060
The monthly allowance

390
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,460
will be sent here later.

391
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,850
Way faster than before.

392
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,850
Sit.

393
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,260
What's your order, my lady?

394
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,980
Get a carriage for me.

395
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,225
But don't let them find out.

396
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,180
Where are you going?

397
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,460
To pay respects to the dead.

398
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,525
You're going to the Liu Family?

399
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,620
Keep it down.

400
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,025
You can't go, my lady.

401
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,025
If you do,

402
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:35,980
everybody will think

403
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,740
that you and Liu Liting had an affair.

404
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,060
It's okay.

405
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,300
Just do as I say.

406
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,500
My lady,

407
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,425
don't be so hard on yourself.

408
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,700
What Fengnian doesn't
have the heart to do

409
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,700
will only be done by me.

410
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,820
Go.

411
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:01,250
Where did you get the carriage?

412
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Carriage rental.

413
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,740
I did it behind the Lus' back.

414
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay.

415
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,380
You go back in the house.

416
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,660
I'm going to the Liu Family on my own.

417
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:10,175
I'll go with you.

418
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,940
No.

419
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,600
Fengnian is a clever kid.

420
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,060
He'll ask around if he doesn't see me.

421
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,325
If he asks you,

422
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,420
you tell him
that I went out to get him a doctor.

423
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,580
Don't arouse his suspicion.

424
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,225
My lady…

425
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:25,750
Don't worry.

426
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,460
How about this?

427
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:31,020
You leave Jiangnan with Fengnian later

428
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,100
to stay away from this miserable life.

429
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,460
I must stay by your side.

430
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,340
Such a silly girl.

431
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,700
Go back in.

432
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Jiangxin County.
The Mansion of Liu Liting.

433
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,600
Yes.

434
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,940
Xu Fengnian is injured.

435
00:23:57,775 --> 00:23:58,580
He isn't dead.

436
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:01,660
Listen to me.

437
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,900
I thought about it over and over again,

438
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,380
and I feel like
it's Xu Xiao's ill intent

439
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,780
that he asked us to travel together.

440
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,980
If it's indeed his scheme,

441
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,500
we'll have to depend on Xu Fengnian.

442
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,900
Him?

443
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:17,800
Just for precaution.

444
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Let's go visit an injured man.

445
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,140
It isn't troublesome.

446
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,340
Come on.

447
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,100
Let's go. Go.

448
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,660
I heard you were assassinated.

449
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:37,380
Luckily, they failed.

450
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,075
I wonder if we are needed?

451
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,350
Your Highness?

452
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,600
I'm afraid he's asleep.

453
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,275
Hey.

454
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,020
I thought he was injured.

455
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,550
Where is he?

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,150
How am I supposed to know?

457
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,100
Is Er'qiao here?

458
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,020
Your monthly allowance is…

459
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,540
We're here to see His Highness.

460
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,380
Could you please tell us
where His Highness went?

461
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,725
I don't serve the rooms here.

462
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,020
How am I supposed to know?

463
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,050
We'll keep asking around, then.

464
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,220
Hail, Prime Minister.

465
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,850
What was Xu Xiao's reaction?

466
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:58,100
We talked much,

467
00:25:58,725 --> 00:25:59,925
but he said nothing useful.

468
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,475
When hearing about
the assassination on his son,

469
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,325
he didn't have any reaction, either?

470
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:09,175
His expression didn't change a bit.

471
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,020
Slayer?

472
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,975
I say he's a weasel.

473
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,825
Xu Xiao has made many efforts

474
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,700
to keep the hereditary peerage,

475
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:30,420
so, he won't call it quits.

476
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,250
In my opinion,

477
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,875
the Xu Family will certainly
fall out with the Lu Family.

478
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,500
By then, I'm afraid His Majesty

479
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,300
will have to allow
their hereditary peerage to remain.

480
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,500
North Liang
mustn't belong to Xu anymore.

481
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,475
The assassination

482
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,100
failed, too?

483
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,700
Li Chungang

484
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,260
is at Xu Fengnian's side.

485
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:02,020
Then

486
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,580
we can't take his life?

487
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,420
Our man has set off to Mount Longhu.

488
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:12,900
The one hiding in Mount Longhu

489
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,900
should be able to challenge Li Chungang.

490
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,180
The Fisherman by Bottomless Pool, huh?

491
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,500
How come I don't know about this Pool?

492
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,220
It isn't easy

493
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,340
to kill my brother-in-law.

494
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:39,675
There's a hidden master

495
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,075
in Mount Longhu?

496
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,375
Please don't bother about it,

497
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,580
Prime Minister.

498
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,740
In a word,

499
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,140
please trust us, Prime Minister.

500
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,660
I'll make sure Xu Fengnian
won't return to North Liang alive.

501
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,980
You know that His Majesty

502
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,580
doesn't want Xu Fengnian dead.

503
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,500
Why are you aiding me?

504
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,350
The strategy of appeasement only leads to
endless trouble afterwards.

505
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,140
That's true.

506
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,220
Once Xu Fengnian is killed,

507
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,460
North Liang will rebel for sure.

508
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:21,940
Yet a clean cut is necessary.

509
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:24,140
The momentary chaos

510
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,150
is better than the lengthy chaos.

511
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,950
As long as I'm around,

512
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,980
the tumult will certainly be sorted out.

513
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,780
You are the backbone of the nation.

514
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:42,820
But I don't believe

515
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,140
that you're doing this for the nation.

516
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,300
I don't care

517
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,700
why you want Xu Fengnian dead,

518
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:54,615
but here's a warning.

519
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,780
If it's harmful for the nation,

520
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,700
I won't let you off.

521
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:07,150
If you're going to kill Xu Fengnian,

522
00:29:09,325 --> 00:29:11,950
make it quick.

523
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:17,075
Prime Minister, please

524
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:19,025
wait for the good news.

525
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,350
(Mount Longhu Bottomless Pool)

526
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,650
There really is a fisherman.

527
00:30:05,925 --> 00:30:06,725
Try him.

528
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,075
It's impossible
that we reach Jiangxin County so fast.

529
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,545
Why do we stop?

530
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:09,800
Fengnian.

531
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,600
Seriously?

532
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:30,700
I asked Ning Emei's soldiers

533
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,025
to guard the front and back doors.

534
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
The moment Er'qiao went out,

535
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,860
I knew.

536
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,340
Your wound hasn't healed.

537
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,580
You shouldn't go out on your own.

538
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,420
If I didn't,

539
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:43,800
who would talk you into going back?

540
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,000
The Lu Family isn't
the only big family in Jiangnan.

541
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,275
When I'm recovered,

542
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,650
I'll make enemies with the entire
Jiangnan literary circle.

543
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,100
I'll mess up with more families.

544
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,400
By then,
the capital city will also be pleased.

545
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,325
Sister.

546
00:32:00,975 --> 00:32:02,300
You know well my ability

547
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,860
to make trouble, don't you?

548
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,025
Of course, I do.

549
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,420
So, you promise me

550
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,825
that you stop being hard on yourself?

551
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:20,950
If I chase after you every day,

552
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,500
my wound will never be healed.

553
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,740
Okay, I promise.

554
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,780
You don't need
to worry about me anymore.

555
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,900
That's decided, then.

556
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:39,940
Give me some time.

557
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
When my wound is healed,

558
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:44,200
I'll make a scene.

559
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,000
Is he dead?

560
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,380
He's asleep.

561
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,075
How did you do it?

562
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,900
You were given the authority
to command Fujiang Armors.

563
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,850
What's the relationship

564
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,350
between you and Han Diaosi?

565
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
He's my master.

566
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:19,025
You're the illegitimate prince?

567
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,260
You know me?

568
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,300
I also know

569
00:33:23,575 --> 00:33:25,500
that you come to Mount Longhu

570
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:27,860
to ask me to kill Xu Fengnian.

571
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,850
Are you a deity or what?

572
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,580
Why do you want him dead?

573
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,325
Remove the evil from the nation.

574
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:40,085
No.

575
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:42,525
You wish to cause chaos
across the world.

576
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,740
During the chaos,

577
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:45,500
you'll take your opportunity
to steal the throne.

578
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This is…

579
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,980
The Imperial Seal.

580
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:37,162
(Fengtian Hall)

581
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,260
Bow.

582
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,100
Arise.

583
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,940
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.

584
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,820
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.

585
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,780
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.
- Praise your greatness. Long live the emperor.

586
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,260
It fell.

587
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:56,340
No!

588
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:00,300
No.

589
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:10,500
What…

590
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,950
What's the matter with me?

591
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,540
Was that a hallucination?

592
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,125
All officials bow down to you.

593
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,650
The sovereignty is in your hand.

594
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:21,575
That was a sweet dream.

595
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,650
You can enter my heart?

596
00:36:25,525 --> 00:36:27,125
You really are a deity?

597
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:30,200
Human force has a limit,

598
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:32,425
yet the changes of thoughts

599
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,450
are limitless.

600
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,200
Beautiful mountains,

601
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,600
spring rain and winter thunder,

602
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,660
into your eyes, into your ears,

603
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,025
and eventually into your heart.

604
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,225
All emotions,

605
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,775
all the hate and love,

606
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,020
stem from the heart.

607
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,420
Human heart is the master of the body,

608
00:36:52,725 --> 00:36:54,150
the realm for everything.

609
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
My power

610
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,500
is about heart and mind.

611
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,500
I perturbed your mind with the seal

612
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,175
and led you into the dream.

613
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,750
What you saw in the dream

614
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,780
is what you eagerly crave

615
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,700
deep in your heart.

616
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,260
A dream?

617
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,475
The Imperial Seal…

618
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:23,300
A fake one.

619
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,900
Maybe only the seal

620
00:37:26,325 --> 00:37:28,500
can break into your heart.

621
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,100
Because what your heart

622
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,485
craves the most

623
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,940
is the throne.

624
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:43,675
It is godlike power,

625
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,175
isn't it?

626
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,175
It's not that easy.

627
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,850
First, I need to know about your past,

628
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:55,460
guess your thoughts,

629
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:58,275
and then find a good chance

630
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,180
to perturb your mind

631
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,980
before I lead you into the dream.

632
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,300
You

633
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,350
know me?

634
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:10,075
I knew about you long ago.

635
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:12,975
I heard from my Master

636
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,375
that you also come
from the royal family.

637
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,220
I won't leave the mountain.

638
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,820
North Liang has a large army.

639
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,900
They will be Liyang's major concern.

640
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,820
Only by killing Xu Fengnian

641
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,580
can the lurking danger be erased.

642
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,340
Without getting any fish,

643
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,300
I won't leave the mountain.

644
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:36,420
Fish?

645
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:38,725
What fish do you want?

646
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,550
I-I'll help you.

647
00:38:41,225 --> 00:38:41,900
Okay.

648
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,700
Try it first.

649
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,800
Pull the fishing rod out.

650
00:38:50,025 --> 00:38:50,775
Huh?

651
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:56,020
How deep is the pool?

652
00:38:56,925 --> 00:38:58,400
Didn't Han Diaosi say

653
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:00,200
it's a bottomless pool?

654
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,180
Bottomless?

655
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,325
Then what have you been trying to fish?

656
00:39:06,425 --> 00:39:07,980
A thousand-year salamander.

657
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,050
Does it even exist?

658
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,340
You said you need
to guess one's thoughts

659
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
and perturb one's mind

660
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,350
before leading one into a dream.

661
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:49,075
How come you knocked him out so easily?

662
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,650
When Han Diaosi

663
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,820
put them into the armor,

664
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,975
they lost their minds.

665
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,325
So, it's easy naturally.

666
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,050
How long have you been trying
to fish the salamander?

667
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,700
More than twenty years.

668
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,550
Still haven't got it?

669
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,275
By seniority,

670
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,200
how do I address you?

671
00:40:19,325 --> 00:40:20,540
No seniority with me.

672
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:22,075
Just call me by my name.

673
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,500
Zhao Huangchao.

674
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,550
I wouldn't dare.

675
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,650
(Zhao Huangchao,
Recluse of Mount Longhu)

676
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,350
I'll call you sir.

677
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,600
I need to show respect for you.

678
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,550
No game today?

679
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,075
We played games for days,

680
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,800
and I've been waiting for you to speak.

681
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,925
Since you don't want to tell me,

682
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,875
I'll just ask.

683
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,650
Over these years,

684
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,380
I've been asking you to investigate

685
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,925
who got involved in the assassination

686
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,500
on my wife

687
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,525
in the capital city

688
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:13,100
more than twenty years ago.

689
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,450
It's really difficult to investigate.

690
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,350
It is.

691
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,300
But every time we met,

692
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,125
the first thing you told me was,

693
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:25,740
no progress.

694
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,740
You came to the capital city this time

695
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,925
and we met…

696
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,750
Yang Taisui,

697
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,400
you said nothing

698
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,220
about it.

699
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:40,325
You purposefully avoided bringing it up.

700
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,075
What have you got?

701
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:46,660
I don't have

702
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:48,175
a full list.

703
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,925
But

704
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,925
there was one piece of information.

705
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,375
When your wife was assassinated,

706
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:58,600
someone was in the capital city.

707
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:00,325
Who?

708
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:02,300
He was in the capital city,

709
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,450
but he didn't necessarily do anything.

710
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,325
Tell me his name

711
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,550
and I'll investigate.

712
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
I kept the name from you

713
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,150
for so long

714
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,900
because I'm afraid
it'll cause you trouble.

715
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,575
Will I be scared?

716
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:20,200
Speak.

717
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:24,100
Sir,

718
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,075
you've been fishing here
for more than twenty years.

719
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,200
You can occasionally go out
and come back to continue fishing.

720
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,450
It doesn't make a difference, right?

721
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:32,500
I fought someone twenty years ago.

722
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,125
My power backfired on me.

723
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:35,400
Right now,

724
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,275
the Bottomless Pool stabilizes my mind.

725
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:40,450
Without the salamander,

726
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,050
I will never

727
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,225
leave the mountain.

728
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,375
Who could possibly injure you?

729
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,075
Who?

730
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,550
The one in Wudi City.

731
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,800
