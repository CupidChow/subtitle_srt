1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 9=

7
00:01:35,775 --> 00:01:37,400
Jian Jiuhuang asked me to come here.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,425
Old Huang?

9
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:41,680
Wait!

10
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,050
Do you mean

11
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,760
Old Huang

12
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,625
asked you to take Huangman'er
to Mount Longhu?

13
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,750
Jian Jiuhuang knew
you were in a dilemma.

14
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,000
He left North Liang

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,250
and came to Mount Longhu.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,100
You know

17
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,875
your brother is now

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,075
wanted by many.

19
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,000
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

20
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,919
What else did you find?

21
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:12,240
And those who supported Young Master.

22
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:13,675
Didn't you catch them?

23
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,879
Like Ning Emei,

24
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,560
they were all baits.

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,719
The mastermind behind

26
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,875
is well hidden.

27
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,080
Is Fengnian in Wudang?

28
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,150
Yes.

29
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,120
He refuses to leave there.

30
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,375
He'll come around.

31
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,439
The royal is going crazy

32
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,680
waiting for North Liang's mistakes.

33
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,575
But they know,

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,675
as long as you are in charge,

35
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:45,000
North Liang is the Xus'.

36
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:48,800
We all die.

37
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
That's why Young Master matters.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
If you hand over North Liang
to Xu Fengnian,

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,560
the royal will seek power
by using Young Master,

40
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,280
and North Liang will fall apart.

41
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,800
If you hand over North Liang

42
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,950
to Young Master...

43
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,840
That's exactly what they want.

44
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
Huangman'er

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,240
is still young.

46
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,000
How can he beat

47
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,280
the wily royals?

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,350
Thus,

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,700
all the eyes in the capital are
on Young Master.

50
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,225
Speaking boldly,

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,975
in this world,

52
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,975
only my Mount Longhu

53
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,840
can keep him safe.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mount Longhu has no connection

55
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,719
to our Xu family.

56
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,650
Jian Jiuhuang once told me,

57
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:41,560
Young Master

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,175
was born with great power

59
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,850
and excellent talent.

60
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:46,960
So what?

61
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,280
Do you know

62
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,439
why I haven't yet taken any disciple?

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,919
Because the Heart Arts of my sect

64
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,949
has extremely high requirements

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,639
on the disciple.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,520
One must be born extraordinary

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,879
to assume the mantle.

68
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,560
Jian Jiuhuang chose me,

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,975
because I truly meant to

70
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,360
take him as my disciple.

71
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,080
Your Highness.

72
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,240
It's true.

73
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,125
The line of the sect matters more

74
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,759
than their own lives.

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,000
So, will you protect Huangman'er?

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Since he's my disciple,

77
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,399
that's for sure.

78
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,150
The capital and the royal

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,560
all have their eyes on my brother.

80
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,225
Mount Longhu is known as the Top Sect.

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,519
Can you really resist
the imperial edict?

82
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,475
That's exactly the deal

83
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,360
Jian Jiuhuang made with us.

84
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,400
What deal?

85
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,079
It concerns the royal,

86
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:50,720
highly confidential.

87
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,199
I can

88
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,800
tell you only.

89
00:04:59,150 --> 00:04:59,825
I...

90
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,650
I'll wait outside.

91
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,279
You can stay and listen.

92
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,250
Given my identity,

93
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,900
to listen to Liyang's secret,

94
00:05:10,975 --> 00:05:12,839
do you want me to die sooner?

95
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,120
Why are you out?

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,525
I don't wanna die.

97
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm really confused

98
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,240
about Xu Fengnian and you.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,750
Why?

100
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:42,639
Young lady.

101
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,160
Of all people in the world,

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,439
it's hard to meet the right one.

103
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,650
People are not chained to each other.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Time separates them.

105
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,680
Cherish the present.

106
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,439
Don't be like me,

107
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:05,639
only regrets left at my age.

108
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,160
There is nothing to cherish.

109
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:10,300
It has been fated

110
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,160
between us.

111
00:06:12,675 --> 00:06:13,680
What is fated?

112
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,360
Life and death.

113
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,720
We are alone now.

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,480
Please go ahead.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,639
Why do you think

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,325
Mount Longhu

117
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:27,040
is the Top Sect?

118
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,759
Did you pledge allegiance early?

119
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:33,680
Because one person hides here.

120
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,600
He's also surnamed Zhao.

121
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,199
Isn't everyone surnamed Zhao
after Arch-Taoist?

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,759
Not Arch-Taoist's surname Zhao,

123
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,639
but the royal surname Zhao.

124
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,079
The royal?

125
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,025
Yes.

126
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,250
As to seniority,

127
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,225
he's the ancestor of Liyang.

128
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,800
A royal hides in Mount Longhu.

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,075
Who else deserves the title

130
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,319
of the Top Sect?

131
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,600
Why does he hide in Mount Longhu?

132
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,160
He is fishing.

133
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,920
What?

134
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:09,160
Don't bother about the details.

135
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,450
You only need to know

136
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
he pursues the ultimate martial arts

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,350
in the world.

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,920
But to achieve it,

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,925
Wang Xianzhi in Wudi City

140
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:23,225
is an unavoidable challenge.

141
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,200
An old man in Mount Longhu

142
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,800
wants to test Wang Xianzhi's strength,

143
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,439
but he doesn't dare.

144
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,650
Knowing that I'd go to challenge him,

145
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,000
he gladly wanted to watch it.

146
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,439
Isn't it a deal?

147
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,519
Did Old Huang put himself in the deal?

148
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,650
Exactly.

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Jian Jiuhuang challenges Wang Xianzhi.

150
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:45,240
That person

151
00:07:45,575 --> 00:07:48,199
tries to test Wang Xianzhi's strength,

152
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,880
provided that Mount Longhu
protects Young Master.

153
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,150
Will the royal let it go at that?

154
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,319
After all, a royal elder proposed it.

155
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,079
Moreover,

156
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,800
he is in Mount Longhu.

157
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,480
The royal is at ease, of course.

158
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,040
Plus, he's my disciple now.

159
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:09,385
I'll protect Young Master in secret.

160
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,480
In all aspects,

161
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,875
Young Master is perfectly safe.

162
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,875
Your Highness.

163
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,800
Jian Jiuhuang once said,

164
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,350
he came to Mount Longhu

165
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,959
so that you could

166
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,959
figure out a third way.

167
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,160
These days, I've been thinking about

168
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,279
the things in the past three years.

169
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm useless,

170
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
but

171
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,975
I wanna help you.

172
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:39,480
Old Huang.

173
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,200
Who won, Wang Xianzhi or he?

174
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,475
The latest information has that

175
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,625
he is already outside Wudi City.

176
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,600
I guess

177
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,500
the result of the battle will come soon.

178
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,799
If any news, I'll get you updated.

179
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,175
I've said everything.

180
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,279
Can I see

181
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,675
Young Master Longxiang now?

182
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,200
Thanks,

183
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,639
but no.

184
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:13,000
This...

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,975
This is the best way out.

186
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,240
Mount Longhu is far away.

187
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,559
Huangman'er will miss home.

188
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,775
Will you take him back to North Liang?

189
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:21,879
I'm his brother.

190
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:23,039
I'll protect him.

191
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,039
If he goes back,

192
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,775
North Liang will be in great chaos.

193
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:29,679
I know.

194
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,840
I'll cope with it.

195
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:32,799
Brother.

196
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll go to Mount Longhu with him.

197
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,919
You know nothing. Don't talk nonsense!

198
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,875
I do!

199
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:37,679
If I go,

200
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:38,360
I can help you.

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,159
Nonsense.

202
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,720
I don't need your help.

203
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,720
Stay at home.

204
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
You have me whatever happens.

205
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:44,175
Brother.

206
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,440
I'm willing to go.

207
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,391
You are the talented one in the world!

208
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,679
Jian Jiuhuang didn't lie to me!

209
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:03,720
The line of my school

210
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,650
will be finally carried on!

211
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Taoist Priest.

212
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,519
Can we leave now?

213
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,200
Call me Master!

214
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,759
Why do you take so many men out?

215
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,480
I don't want this, either.

216
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,750
The newest sect rule.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,975
It's a must when Arch-Taoist goes out.

218
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,039
Why did you talk

219
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,320
with the door closed?

220
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,240
If I hadn't put on airs,

221
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,960
they would've reported it to the Chief.

222
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,960
And I have to explain.

223
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,399
It's annoying.

224
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,675
Are there so many rules in your sect?

225
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

226
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,120
My courtyard

227
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,080
is at the foot of Mount Longhu,

228
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,325
far away from the sect.

229
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,759
I have no rules there.

230
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:58,175
I won't let my disciple down.

231
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't beat him.

232
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,360
Don't scold him.

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,679
Don't bully him.

234
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,000
I finally got a disciple.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,150
I will never allow him

236
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,279
to be bullied.

237
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:08,575
Your Highness.

238
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,000
Rest assured.

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,279
My place

240
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,639
is picturesque

241
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,120
and pleasing.

242
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
I'm sure he will like it.

243
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,759
There are rare creatures
in the mountain

244
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,399
for him to catch,

245
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,840
and peach trees and hawthorns.

246
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,475
He can pick the fruits.

247
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,120
Hawthorns?

248
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes, hawthorns.

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,075
Are there many?

250
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,400
Yes, many hawthorns.

251
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,440
What?

252
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,275
Do you like hawthorns?

253
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,360
My brother does.

254
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:36,840
Brother.

255
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:38,400
When hawthorns are ripe,

256
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:40,519
I'll pick and hide them all

257
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,200
for you.

258
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:42,519
OK.

259
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,550
When hawthorns are ripe,

260
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,080
I'll go see you.

261
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,039
Alright.

262
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,650
- Let's go.
- Hey.

263
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,440
Wait.

264
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,240
Huangman'er.

265
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,080
I want something of yours.

266
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:07,475
When I miss you,

267
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,720
I can look at it.

268
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,075
Yes.

269
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,000
OK. Brother.

270
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,360
If you miss me,

271
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,720
call my name loudly.

272
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,559
I can definitely hear.

273
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,559
Alright.

274
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:34,975
Your Highness.

275
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,080
Come.

276
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,440
Let's go, my disciple.

277
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,425
Wait.

278
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,275
Your Highness.

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,039
Can you

280
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,350
take a message to Wang Chonglou?

281
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:49,200
Please go ahead.

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,519
"Chief Wang's known for Dahuangting.

283
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:56,039
How can you hide it?

284
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,850
Mount Longhu would like a spar

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,279
and see the brilliance of Dahuangting".

286
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,475
These are the words.

287
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,900
Please relay the message to him.

288
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,720
Will you suppress Wudang by force?

289
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,200
We are sects.

290
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,240
It's all like this.

291
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,150
Alright.

292
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,039
Let's go, my disciple.

293
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,440
Huangman'er.

294
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,850
If you don't want to go,

295
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,399
tell me.

296
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,200
I'll keep you.

297
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,639
Do you know how to get him back?

298
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:54,279
I know.

299
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,759
If I take over North Liang,

300
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,125
then I can get him back.

301
00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:08,480
You said you didn't want to.

302
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:12,850
If everything is on me,

303
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:17,039
it'll be easier for Huangman'er.

304
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:27,250
Eh?

305
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,175
Did something big happen?

306
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,240
Why did he look at you?

307
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,559
What happened?

308
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,320
I just got the message.

309
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,159
Is it about me?

310
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,575
Say it.

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,281
Jian Jiuhuang

312
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:26,559
is dead.

313
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,875
Give it to me.

314
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,075
Jian Jiuhuang went to Wudi City.

315
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,400
He found a tavern,

316
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,759
ordered two taels of rice wine...

317
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,679
(Jian Jiuhuang walked in Wudi City,)
half tael of sauced meat

318
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,120
(with the sword box...)
and a plate of peanuts.

319
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,240
Fried ones.

320
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,200
He didn't like vinegar-soaked ones.

321
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:06,175
Nor boiled ones.

322
00:16:08,025 --> 00:16:11,100
He preferred fried peanuts with salt.

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,075
(Jian Jiuhuang watched Wudi City
from above,)

324
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:46,250
(and invited Wang Xianzhi.)

325
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,078
(Wang Xianzhi arrived...)

326
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,079
Wang Xianzhi arrived.

327
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,025
Jian Jiuhuang used five swords,

328
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,150
fighting with eight sword moves.

329
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,039
Wang Xianzhi fought
with a single hand,

330
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,359
not taking a step back.

331
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:29,925
After 68 moves,

332
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
Jian Jiuhuang played the Ninth Move.

333
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,279
A martial artist who witnessed this move

334
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,750
said it was like

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,359
the Milky Way

336
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,920
flowing down.

337
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,000
It was no earthly swordplay.

338
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:46,559
Wang Xianzhi finally used both hands.

339
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,750
Jian Jiuhuang damaged Wang's sleeve.

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,650
The two were well matched.

341
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,425
After another 49 moves,

342
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,150
Jian Jiuhuang died of exhaustion.

343
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,050
Old Huang didn't lose.

344
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:03,000
He was just old.

345
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:05,250
Um.

346
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,880
Wang Xianzhi admitted it himself.

347
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,325
Jian Jiuhuang was just too exhausted.

348
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:12,450
In the battle,

349
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,279
he was

350
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,300
slightly at a disadvantage.

351
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,519
Before Jian Jiuhuang died,

352
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,625
Wang Xianzhi asked him

353
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,480
the name of the swordplay.

354
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:23,759
"The Six Thousand Li".

355
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,400
I gave the name

356
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,960
for this move.

357
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,925
The Ninth Move.

358
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,275
"The Six Thousand Li".

359
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,100
Wang Xianzhi sighed,

360
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,050
"In the world,

361
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:46,300
(Jian Jiuhuang seemed to say)
there is no better swordplay than this."

362
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,425
(his last words to Wang Xianzhi.)

363
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,359
Where is his sword box?

364
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,440
At the wall of Wudi City.

365
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,900
At last,

366
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,319
his meridians were all broken,

367
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,825
sitting still at the wall

368
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,475
and looking north
with the last breath.

369
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,625
People heard him

370
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,559
humming an odd song

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,750
until his death.

372
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,559
The north.

373
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,575
(His meridians were all broken,)
He was

374
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,960
(sitting at the wall and looking north)
watching North Liang.

375
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,900
(until his death.)

376
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:25,650
Few could corner Wang Xianzhi

377
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,400
like that.

378
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,920
Jian Jiuhuang

379
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,966
is already a legend.

380
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,850
Can I

381
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,500
keep this letter?

382
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,425
Sure.

383
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,650
Thanks.

384
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,225
Sorry for your loss, Your Highness.

385
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,680
Jian Jiuhuang

386
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,960
achieved what he sought.

387
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,975
Farewell.

388
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:45,720
They've gone.

389
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,000
Did Jian Jiuhuang die in a battle?

390
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,425
Were the details noted down?

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,240
He forced Wang Xianzhi
to use both hands.

392
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,175
The Ninth Move, Six Thousand Li
was awesome!

393
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,050
Badly, I can't see it myself.

394
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,925
(The Ninth Move's name is
given by Jian Jiuhuang himself.)

395
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:20,525
(Jian Jiuhuang seemed to say
his last words to Wang Xianzhi.)

396
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,775
(Jian Jiuhuang watched Wudi City
from above...)

397
00:22:45,775 --> 00:22:48,580
(Wang Xianzhi arrived...)

398
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,580
(After 68 moves...)

399
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:20,450
Young Master.

400
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,000
Learning martial arts

401
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,050
is not a loss.

402
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,880
You have the strength...

403
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,675
You're nagging.

404
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,000
We traveled for 3 years.

405
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,279
I've put every bit of it into it.

406
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,640
Then

407
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,279
the Ninth Move was created.

408
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,500
Name it as Six Thousand Li.

409
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,016
(The Ninth Move's name is
Six Thousand Li.)

410
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,519
I can do you some help.

411
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,039
(His meridians were all broken...)
Now I fear nothing.

412
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,375
(until his death.)
I promise you.

413
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll be right back after the battle

414
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,675
and roast sweet potatoes for you first.

415
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:57,400
OK.

416
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Candles are not enough.

417
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,025
Make it lighter.

418
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,800
I can't see clearly.

419
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,675
Have you seen enough?

420
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,225
Old Huang is dead.

421
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,775
Understand?

422
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:33,920
Something is wrong.

423
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,825
What is wrong?

424
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,225
What the letter said.

425
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:46,150
Where?

426
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:52,600
I've read it over and over.

427
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,650
Only the name Jian Jiuhuang is on it.

428
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,100
Why is there no "Old Huang"?

429
00:26:06,975 --> 00:26:08,400
They only know Jian Jiuhuang

430
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,675
was a peerless swordsman.

431
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,525
Who would think he was

432
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,225
the groom Old Huang?

433
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,750
Zhao Xituan said,

434
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,325
Jian Jiuhuang cornered Wang Xianzhi

435
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,625
and he has become a legend.

436
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,240
A legend indeed.

437
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:43,150
Jian Jiuhuang has become a legend,

438
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:48,225
but Old Huang is dead.

439
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,575
I'd rather him not be a legend.

440
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,079
I'd rather he came back to North Liang

441
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,039
as a loser.

442
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,119
Then

443
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,700
I'd laugh,

444
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:14,119
and let him

445
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:16,300
steal sweet potatoes and roast.

446
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:21,925
Old Huang is gone.

447
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:30,625
Yeah.

448
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,150
Old Huang is gone.

449
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,375
Let's go home.

450
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,675
Your brother went to Mount Longhu.

451
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:08,480
You have no reason to stay in Wudang.

452
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,079
Old Huang.

453
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,799
I want to learn martial arts.

454
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,920
You wanna learn martial arts?

455
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,375
Given your identity,

456
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:50,025
whoever you want to kill,

457
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
North Liang Cavalry can do it.

458
00:28:52,425 --> 00:28:53,519
I wanna do it myself,

459
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,800
to challenge Wang Xianzhi in Wudi City.

460
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,559
Do you know what you are saying?

461
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,359
Old Huang died in Wudi City.

462
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,050
I'll take his sword box back.

463
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,200
Take it back?

464
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,480
You know who Wang Xianzhi is!

465
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,025
He is unrivaled in the world.

466
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:10,359
You didn't learn any martial arts.

467
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,500
Do you want to

468
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,450
challenge Wang Xianzhi?

469
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,150
Yes.

470
00:29:14,825 --> 00:29:15,599
You can

471
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,725
go get a bed.

472
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,599
Lie on it, close your eyes,

473
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,125
and dream it.

474
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,400
I'm not as good as him now,

475
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,425
but I can practice.

476
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:26,759
You think you are a genius?

477
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:29,075
How long will it take to be his match?

478
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:31,400
Fifty years?

479
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,480
No matter how many years,

480
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:34,480
the sword box can't be at the wall.

481
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,575
Please tutor me.

482
00:29:44,175 --> 00:29:44,950
Are you

483
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,400
serious?

484
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,519
Alright.

485
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,550
What do you wanna practice?

486
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,039
I only have a blade.

487
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,050
Practice blade then.

488
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,575
Unsheathe the blade.

489
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,240
Straighten your arm.

490
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,375
Stand for an hour.

491
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,900
If the stone falls

492
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,875
in an hour,

493
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:22,925
don't come to me again.

494
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:55,950
Are you alright?

495
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,675
Stay away from me.

496
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,825
Time is up.

497
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,119
The stone didn't fall.

498
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,250
My admiration.

499
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,319
Next, four moves.

500
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:22,375
Thrust.

501
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:24,975
Slice.

502
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:26,775
Split.

503
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,279
Sweep.

504
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,225
4,000 times each.

505
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,119
You should know

506
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,480
Wang Xianzhi is
a barrier to all martial artists.

507
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,625
No one can surpass him.

508
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:22,400
Even

509
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,575
the God of Sword Li Chungang's

510
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:29,440
sword Mumaniu was broken by him
with two fingers.

511
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,475
Zhao Xituan has a message
to Wang Chonglou.

512
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,225
What is it?

513
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:38,599
"Chief Wang is known for Dahuangting.

514
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,950
Mount Longhu would like a spar

515
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,650
and see the brilliance of Dahuangting".

516
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,325
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

517
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,050
I forgot.

518
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:56,775
A spar?

519
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,275
That's a challenge.

520
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
Mount Longhu will take action on us.

521
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:06,700
We've never offended Mount Longhu.

522
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:10,300
Mount Longhu is in its prime.

523
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,450
The court backs them up.

524
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,240
I've achieved Dahuangting.

525
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,160
They want to defeat me,

526
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:20,575
going up by taking Wudang
as a stepping stone.

527
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,500
We can simply defeat them.

528
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,675
It's not that easy.

529
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,450
If we win,

530
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,960
Wudang will be Mount Longhu's
first enemy.

531
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,875
By then,

532
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,950
(Sanqing Hall)

533
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,000
Wudang

534
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,960
could be doomed in my hand.

535
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:45,599
We can't win or lose.

536
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,559
This is really hard.

537
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:52,720
What is Xu Fengnian doing?

538
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,450
Practicing blade.

539
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,160
How is my bladeplay?

540
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:07,150
It's awful.

541
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,875
1,000 times more for each move.

542
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,750
Looks like I do have some talent.

543
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,639
Who said that?

544
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:16,440
You promised Old Huang

545
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,825
you'd protect me for only two months.

546
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,960
Then you would leave.

547
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,840
Now two months is over.

548
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,679
If I'm not good,

549
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,440
will you still tutor me here?

550
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,119
The Xus

551
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,880
are all sly like you.

552
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,575
How talented

553
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,575
do you think I am?

554
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:39,625
I can't deny it.

555
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,400
You are made for bladeplay.

556
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:44,679
The blade skills can be practiced.

557
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,450
What about your genuine spirit?

558
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:47,519
Practice it as well.

559
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,975
It can be practiced,

560
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,480
but it's too late.

561
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,039
Practicing genuine spirit is hard work.

562
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,475
It's trained over time.

563
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,925
Given your age,

564
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,400
you can hardly catch up with others.

565
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:00,375
Is there a shortcut?

566
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:01,400
No.

567
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,975
The truth is cruel.

568
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,650
You can never

569
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:07,625
be Wang's match all your life.

570
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,875
To go to Wudi City,

571
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,750
using the North Liang Cavalry

572
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:13,400
is the only way.

573
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,075
Tomorrow, 2,000 times more

574
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:18,400
of each move.

575
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,599
It's in vain.

576
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,500
Without inner power,

577
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:27,850
you can be a second-tier master at best.

578
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,425
I'll try hard.

579
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,391
Inner power? Genuine spirit?

580
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,700
Do you wanna cut off the waterfall?

581
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,950
I'm trying to practice genuine spirit.

582
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:57,200
You can't cut it off like that.

583
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,760
Can you?

584
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:03,920
I can't either.

585
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,559
But I might not hurt my hand.

586
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:09,700
Have a try.

587
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,625
Do you play martial arts?

588
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,875
No.

589
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,880
What was it then?

590
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,960
It's the fist arts.

591
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:52,900
You don't play martial arts.

592
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,960
Where did you learn it?

593
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:55,925
I created it by myself.

594
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,550
By yourself?

595
00:37:59,225 --> 00:38:01,100
I read Taoist scriptures
in Xuanyue Palace.

596
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,599
I stretched my arms after a long sit.

597
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,100
I came up with it.

598
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,039
It's from Eight Trigrams to
Four Divisions,

599
00:38:07,075 --> 00:38:09,525
Three Elements to Yin and Yang,

600
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,950
though it's much inferior

601
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,000
to Taiji and Wuji.

602
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,880
It's not something serious,

603
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,400
not for fighting.

604
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,550
But cutting waterfall
won't hurt your hand.

605
00:38:24,525 --> 00:38:26,275
You can try it if you want.

606
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,100
Can the fist arts

607
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,199
be used for bladeplay?

608
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,350
One rule may suit all.

609
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,519
Fist arts have no difference
from blade arts.

610
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:37,400
So, you can learn bladeplay

611
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:39,325
from sword manuals.

612
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,525
What sword manuals?

613
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,159
(Jiazi Sword Manual at Lyushui)
The basic sword manual of Wudang.

614
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,050
See if you can be inspired.

615
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,000
Is there a shortcut for genuine spirit?

616
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:50,375
No.

617
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,550
It's ugly.

618
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:24,675
Wash before sleeping.

619
00:39:33,225 --> 00:39:35,100
Do you think what you do

620
00:39:35,775 --> 00:39:37,519
will get Old Huang back to life?

621
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,150
During the three-year travel,

622
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,199
Old Huang had told me
to learn martial arts.

623
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,400
I turned a deaf ear to it.

624
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:52,800
I thought

625
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,725
I could deal with problems

626
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,200
with my wisdom.

627
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:02,300
Now I get to know,

628
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:05,150
the so-called wisdom

629
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,559
is useless.

630
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:10,960
When I was desperate,

631
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:13,900
it was Old Huang

632
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,050
who got me out of it.

633
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,480
I'm learning martial arts now.

634
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,925
First, I wanna take his sword box back.

635
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,400
Second,

636
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:34,360
I don't want anyone

637
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,679
to die for me again

638
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,500
in such a situation,

639
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,920
whereas I cannot do anything.

640
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:47,100
If Old Huang saw that

641
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:49,079
I could protect myself,

642
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:53,159
he might smile.

643
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,079
Don't train yourself to death.

644
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,425
Jiang Ni.

645
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,375
Can you promise me something?

646
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,320
What?

647
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,975
If I get into trouble in the future,

648
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:44,225
leave me alone and run away.

649
00:41:44,675 --> 00:41:45,400
OK?

650
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:52,650
Noisy.

651
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,375
Sleep.

652
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,625
If you were dying,

653
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,599
I'd stab you with Divine Token,

654
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:24,525
at least to kill you with my own hands.

655
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:31,850
You should stab well.

656
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,250
You'll lose money if you fail again.
