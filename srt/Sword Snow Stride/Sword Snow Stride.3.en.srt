1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 3=

7
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,840
Your Highness.

8
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,079
Where are your people?

9
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,560
They are of no help

10
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,680
in the brothel.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,680
I asked them to leave.

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,120
Your Highness,

13
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
is this the divine horse you just got?

14
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,599
No.

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,879
Just an aged horse.

16
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,319
We have plenty of

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,719
good horses at the mansion.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Do you want to change one?

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm used to it.

20
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,319
Alright.

21
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,079
Then I won't talk nonsense.

22
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,920
Let's go now.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,519
Your Highness,
why not get on the horse?

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
It doesn't allow me to ride.

25
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:03,920
Are you in a rush?

26
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,239
No.

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Alright,

28
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,359
I haven't been back for three years.

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,879
Let's take our time

30
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:08,759
and walk around.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,719
Come on.

32
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,840
Jiang Ni, keep up.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,440
(Tingchao Pavilion)

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,759
Did you catch any fish?

35
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,639
I've caught several.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,000
That's enough.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,879
Go back to your room.

38
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,360
No, I can't.

39
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,240
We're eating grilled fish tonight.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,080
You guys

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,560
may leave now.

42
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,319
Not you.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,159
Stay here.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,960
Son, look.

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,840
There are abundant water plants
over there.

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,360
There must be a lot of fish.

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,680
Go fishing over there.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,000
Really?

49
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,240
I never lied to you.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,879
Alright.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,840
Sit down.

52
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,479
Thank you

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,800
for these three years.

54
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,280
My Lord, you have already
said thank you.

55
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,919
That's not enough.

56
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,840
I've been thinking that

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,919
I should give you something.

58
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,599
Meat is fine.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,439
Streaky pork will be the best.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,280
Do you really want to

61
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,039
be a horseman for the rest of your life?

62
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,199
As long as you want,

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
North Liang can help you

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,159
to get back to your business

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
and reproduce the mien
of Jian Jiuhuang.

66
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,079
My Lord, to be honest,

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,240
I've thought about it.

68
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,360
I've had this

69
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,399
with me during these years.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
I always felt like I couldn't
let go of my old self.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,399
I've messed with myself for years

72
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,120
without much peace.

73
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,720
Then, let your sword
come out of the box.

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
After the three-year travel
with Young Master,

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,199
I've got

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,279
my inner peace.

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,040
My Lord, you happen to be here,

78
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
please

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,720
bear witness for me.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,040
Jian Jiuhuang

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
was already dead

82
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,560
on the city wall.

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,519
From now on,

84
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,839
I'm just Old Huang
by Young Master's side.

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,959
Tell me when the fish are grilled.

86
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,639
His Highness is back!

87
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't let him see you.

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,519
He is lustful.

89
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,720
I heard that he has taken

90
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,839
a lot of girls back to his mansion.

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
He looks handsome.

92
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,720
It's not a bad choice.

93
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,759
This servant also looks cute.

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,040
So pretty.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,800
Where does this cute boy come from?

96
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
You don't understand.

97
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,079
But he doesn't look manly.

98
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,680
What's wrong with your eyes?

99
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,000
How can a man be so pretty like me?

100
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,160
We're going to a brothel.

101
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,120
It's not appropriate
to say you're a girl.

102
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,600
Your Highness, you're back!

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,079
It's been years.

104
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,920
All the girls are missing you
all the time.

105
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,120
Don't talk too much.

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,720
Lead the horse to the backyard.

107
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,399
Go.

108
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,079
I finished it.

109
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,839
That's fast.

110
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,000
You're pretty like Old Huang.

111
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,439
We have no fruit now.

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
I don't need to go in.

113
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:42,600
Then you're

114
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,240
the fruit.

115
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:43,720
Come on.

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,519
What?

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,600
What do you mean?

118
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,399
I'll pay you, OK?

119
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
(Lingzhou Zijin Brothel)

120
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,480
(Zijin Brothel)
What game is His Highness playing?

121
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,240
He even brings two girls here.

122
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,079
How dare you

123
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,560
gossip about His Highness?

124
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,279
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
How much do these cost?

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,279
A dozen taels, I guess.

127
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,319
A dozen?

128
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,279
These are cheap ones.

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Your Highness,

130
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,399
the new belle is here.

131
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,399
What's your name?

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,759
(Belle of Zijin Brothel Yu Youwei)

133
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,399
Yu Youwei.

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,399
Nice name.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,720
How honored I am

136
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
to meet

137
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,399
Your Highness here today.

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,759
You know who I am?

139
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,960
General Chu told me.

140
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,320
Your Highness,

141
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,559
her sword dance is famous.

142
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,039
You can't see her waist
if not the dance.

143
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,480
Then,

144
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,480
Miss Yu, please.

145
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,600
I can dance

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
two kinds of sword dance.

147
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,159
One is

148
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,960
for the

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,919
common people.

150
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,679
What about the other one?

151
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,720
The other

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,679
is only

153
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,039
for my lover.

154
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

155
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,679
Because the latter one

156
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,360
is pretty flirtatious.

157
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,480
That's great.

158
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,879
If Your Highness can come
with me to the backyard,

159
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,519
then I can dance

160
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,440
to Your Highness alone.

161
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,879
Let's go

162
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,799
and see how flirtatious it is.

163
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,080
Double blades?

164
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
It's not common.

165
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,799
The tea is freshly brewed.

166
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,519
Your Highness, do you wanna try it?

167
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,120
No.

168
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,519
I just want to see your dance.

169
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
The flirtatious one.

170
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,799
West Chu's Sword Dance?

171
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,879
It's sharpened?

172
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,400
(Chu)

173
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,399
You shouldn't have made use
of the dance.

174
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,480
The Halberd Troops of West Chu

175
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,639
outside Lingzhou City tried to kill me.

176
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
What you did would only

177
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:50,120
remind me of West Chu's Sword Dance.

178
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Assassination doesn't need
to be so complicated.

179
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,440
Are you from the Chu?

180
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,519
Why do you want to kill me?

181
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,759
Xu Xiao wiped out the Chu.

182
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,360
Who else should I kill?

183
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,519
That's not a right way to talk about it.

184
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
That was a national war between
Liyang and West Chu,

185
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,639
not a private feud.

186
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Even if Xu Xiao had not led the troops,

187
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,960
someone else would have
wiped out West Chu as well.

188
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,759
If you want to take revenge,

189
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,399
you should go to Liyang's royal family.

190
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,120
There is no reason for you
to keep targeting my family.

191
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,759
That's not only a national war.

192
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,039
Then what else do you think it is?

193
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,559
If the Great Chu was defeated,

194
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:41,639
we could surrender.

195
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,360
But what did Xu Xiao do?

196
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,399
He led his troops into the palace

197
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,559
and killed His Majesty and the Empress!

198
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,879
Not only that,

199
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,799
hundreds of people in the palace
all didn't survive,

200
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,639
even the young princess was beheaded!

201
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,919
Is she highly skilled in martial arts?

202
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,519
She can't do martial arts.

203
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,320
Just sword dance.

204
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,679
That's good.

205
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
Please take Jiang Ni here.

206
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,679
Wait!

207
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,399
Even if I can't kill you,

208
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,679
I will never let myself be humiliated!

209
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,919
Can you wait for a moment?

210
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,080
Until that person comes.

211
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
Why should I go?

212
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,480
You can ask him yourself.

213
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,919
Did he get horny?

214
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,759
It's really an assassination!

215
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,200
Look!

216
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,320
Even the girl in the brothel

217
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,080
can't stand such a rascal like you.

218
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
That's the common wish!

219
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,799
She danced West Chu's Sword Dance.

220
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,960
You're from the Chu?

221
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,279
Show her

222
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,079
your dagger.

223
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,960
She is about to kill herself.

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
Don't bother.

225
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,200
I can do it myself.

226
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,000
Wait a second!

227
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,720
Since you know West Chu's Sword Dance,

228
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
you must not be a civilian, are you?

229
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,759
My father was an official.

230
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,559
My mother was the sword servant.

231
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,599
Then you must know this dagger.

232
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:42,559
Divine Token?

233
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,359
You said

234
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,799
the young princess was beheaded.

235
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:50,279
Have you ever seen her head?

236
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,079
What do you mean?

237
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,640
Xu Xiao spread the rumor
of the beheading.

238
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,960
The Princess is not dead.

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,440
She's standing right here.

240
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,119
Have you ever seen the Empress
of West Chu?

241
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,519
You're really…?

242
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,200
They say I look like my mother.

243
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,759
It seems to be true now.

244
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,599
I'm Jiang Ni,

245
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,519
princess of the conquered nation.

246
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,440
Your Highness!

247
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,400
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

248
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,000
Your Highness.

249
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,000
You're back.

250
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,160
I'll go make the tea now.

251
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,000
No hurry.

252
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,279
Find her a room.

253
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,799
Your Highness, where did you

254
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,039
get this confidante from?

255
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,200
Yu Youwei,

256
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,559
the belle of Zijin Brothel.

257
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,200
Settle her down first.

258
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,119
Yes.

259
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,120
(Wutong House)

260
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,160
Where is my python whip?

261
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,640
Is it this one?

262
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,279
Yes.

263
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
How is this room?

264
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,480
Not bad.

265
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:21,640
What do you think?

266
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
It's good as long as you like it.

267
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,880
Bedding should be replaced
with new ones.

268
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,000
OK.

269
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,359
I'll ask them to prepare it.

270
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,359
She looks to be smiling all day.

271
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,880
She is the one
with the deepest thoughts.

272
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:49,839
Let's get in.

273
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,759
Your Highness, please.

274
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,880
Don't call me that.

275
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,200
I'm Jiang Ni.

276
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,000
There is no princess
after our nation fell.

277
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,599
I know you have something to ask.

278
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's talk inside.

279
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,960
General Chu, why are you still
kneeling in my courtyard?

280
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,640
You're not going back to your battalion?

281
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,880
Your Highness, please just call me
Fatty Lushan.

282
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,960
I don't dare to.

283
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,000
If I call you that again,

284
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,400
I won't know

285
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
which assassin you'll take me to again.

286
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:40,839
Your Highness,

287
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,599
I really didn't know that Yu Youwei
was an assassin!

288
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,400
General Chu, you should go back.

289
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,799
I have no official rank

290
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:52,880
nor military position.

291
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:54,920
I feel embarrassed

292
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,039
to have a third-ranking officer
kneel in my courtyard.

293
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,519
I'm willing to be punished.

294
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,080
(Ruide Hall)

295
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
You'd better think twice.

296
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,599
It's not late to leave now.

297
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,839
I put Your Highness in danger.

298
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,039
I should take punishment.

299
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,599
But it was never planned by me.

300
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,359
I can tell nothing else

301
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,400
even if Your Highness kills me.

302
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:38,640
Really?

303
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,279
Let me kill you then.

304
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,000
Just ask whatever you want to know.

305
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,039
They all said

306
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,559
Xu Xiao had killed everyone
in the palace.

307
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,000
And…

308
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,279
And…

309
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
And beheaded me?

310
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,359
Was it not Xu Xiao?

311
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,319
Back then,

312
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,839
the capital city of Chu was captured
by Xu Xiao,

313
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,839
but his men

314
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,079
never killed prisoners
or hurt civilians.

315
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,400
However, it was not only the
North Liang army that entered the city.

316
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,680
Some of the bigwigs of Liyang

317
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,440
were also waiting
to rush into the palace.

318
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,759
What did they want to do?

319
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,519
The royal concubines of Chu.

320
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,039
The noble status

321
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,880
made them more excited.

322
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,759
What a batch of rascals!

323
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,640
It was Xu Xiao

324
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,599
who closed the palace gate

325
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,279
before anyone else

326
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,039
to prevent others from entering.

327
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,480
But he was not the Emperor of Liyang,

328
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,000
so he couldn't hold back for long.

329
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,200
Then my father

330
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,279
begged to die,

331
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,920
and everyone in the palace

332
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,559
was willing to die with him.

333
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,600
(Palace of West Chu)
(Xuanzheng Hall)

334
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,640
Xu Xiao promised to keep me alive.

335
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,480
(Juvenile Jiang Ni)
Don't look back.

336
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,540
(Juvenile Jiang Ni)

337
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,319
Look forward.

338
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,599
After that day,

339
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
the Princess of West Chu died.

340
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,759
Only Jiang Ni is left.

341
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,559
You have been here

342
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,200
among all these years?

343
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,880
Where else can I go?

344
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,319
Have you

345
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,119
never thought of revenge?

346
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,400
I was little back then

347
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,480
and couldn't remember everything.

348
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,039
I just remember

349
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,960
my father stroked my head

350
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,039
and told me to live well.

351
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,079
I see.

352
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,839
What else do you want to ask?

353
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,759
Are you…?

354
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,599
What's that mincement about?

355
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,680
Go ahead.

356
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,000
Are you like the two girls just now?

357
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,039
Like what?

358
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,680
You are all Xu Fengnian's…?

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,720
I'm not that kind of maid!

360
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,400
Xu Fengnian didn't…?

361
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,359
He has more than 20 maids

362
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,519
and never touched any of us.

363
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,680
But the rumors said…

364
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,039
The rumors said

365
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,960
Xu Fengnian is a womanizer.

366
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,200
The rumors also said that I was dead.

367
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,119
Alright.

368
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,200
(Ruide Hall)

369
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,839
Dead?

370
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,880
I…

371
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,720
I am still breathing.

372
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:37,759
My Lord,

373
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,640
the news that

374
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,119
His Highness is whipping General Chu

375
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,279
has been spread.

376
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,200
At the door came many generals

377
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:48,000
to ask for a meeting.

378
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,759
I won't meet them.

379
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:51,759
Then…

380
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,319
Then

381
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,559
what about His Highness?

382
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,200
Let him do it.

383
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:58,640
But

384
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm afraid General Chu

385
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,720
can't hang in there anymore.

386
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,680
Let's talk about you.

387
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,279
Are you still killing Xu Fengnian?

388
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,480
Your accomplices

389
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,359
are also in Lingzhou.

390
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,400
For the sake of Chu,

391
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,319
I'll find a chance for you
to escape and join them.

392
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,680
I don't have accomplices.

393
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,519
Then how did you enter Zijin Brothel

394
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,680
and how did you become the new belle?

395
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,880
I don't know.

396
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,599
Never mind.

397
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,519
I really don't know.

398
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,079
I have been watched among the years

399
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,720
and only dancing.

400
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,799
They told me to prepare for
assassinating Xu Fengnian

401
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,440
and avenging Chu.

402
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:02,880
Who are they?

403
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,359
I asked before.

404
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,599
They never answered me.

405
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,319
Where were you locked?

406
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,599
It was a big yard

407
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,440
with heavy guard.

408
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,240
I've never left there

409
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,039
so I don't know where it is.

410
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,359
But I could hear chanting sometimes.

411
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,400
What about the people
who took you there?

412
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,039
They left.

413
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,640
They just told me
to wait for Xu Fengnian.

414
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,240
Sounds like

415
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
you're just a puppet.

416
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you know Chu Lushan?

417
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,279
Never heard of him.

418
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,880
Then why did he

419
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,839
take Xu Fengnian to you?

420
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,200
(Ruide Hall)

421
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,720
Your Highness.

422
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,359
Your Highness.

423
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
General Ning Emei
from Fengzi Battalion

424
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,559
shows greetings to Your Highness.

425
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,000
I know you.

426
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,200
You led the troops to pick me up.

427
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,920
Your Highness,

428
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,960
why are you whipping General Chu?

429
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,680
Are you greeting me
or questioning me?

430
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,319
I don't dare to.

431
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,039
I just wonder why.

432
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,960
He took me to the brothel

433
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,160
and I met an assassination.

434
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,160
Can that be a reason?

435
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,000
Has General Chu admitted

436
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,000
that he planned it?

437
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,319
Would you admit it if it were you?

438
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,960
Then, is there any evidence?

439
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,279
No, so what?

440
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,440
It's unreasonable to impose lynching

441
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,519
without evidence.

442
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,359
I remember you were with

443
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,200
your halberd last time.

444
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,599
You don't bring it with you?

445
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,279
I don't dare to meet Your Highness
with that.

446
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:18,039
It's better to take it with you
when negotiating.

447
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,839
North Liang has its own laws

448
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
which don't depend on the weapon

449
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,599
nor superiority and inferiority.

450
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,000
There are laws

451
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,400
and there is no superiority.

452
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:39,519
Nice speaking.

453
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,799
Your Highness flattered me.

454
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,279
I'm speaking bluntly.

455
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,839
Do you know that even Xu Xiao

456
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,839
doesn't dare to speak to me like that?

457
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,279
Who do you think you are?

458
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,119
I'm Ning Emei, Military General

459
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,759
from Fengzi Battalion.

460
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:58,759
Alright,

461
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,519
I bear you in mind.

462
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,519
The laws won't work. What to do?

463
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,160
Your Highness, please think twice.

464
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,680
Think about what?

465
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
If you let the army down,

466
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,359
no rule will work in the three states.

467
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,519
When the time comes,

468
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,000
can Your Highness still be able to
be in charge of Xu's army?

469
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,000
Guard!

470
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:23,079
Take this rebel to prison!

471
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,960
Whether it's planned by Chu Lushan
or not,

472
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:31,759
your assassination

473
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,640
is not that easy.

474
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,240
You were only taught with sword dance

475
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
but no fighting skills.

476
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,880
If they really wanted you
to kill Xu Fengnian,

477
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,440
that's

478
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,039
unreasonable.

479
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,440
What do they want then?

480
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
Xu Fengnian was also assassinated

481
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,799
by Chu people on his way back.

482
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,720
Was it related to my assassination?

483
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,640
I don't know.

484
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,559
But I feel that this is not done yet.

485
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,759
It's fine as long as Your Highness
is not involved.

486
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,839
I told you not to call me that again.

487
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm leaving.

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,160
Please don't get angry.

489
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,839
I'm not angry.

490
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,279
I need to work.

491
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,680
The books in his room

492
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,599
need to be dried every month.

493
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,319
So annoying.

494
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,400
My Lord,

495
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,119
His Highness is sending Ning Emei

496
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,359
to the prison.

497
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,280
Alright.

498
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,000
His Highness

499
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,119
told the maid to send a message
to the gate.

500
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,239
What is it?

501
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,280
His Highness said

502
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,440
Ning Emei came to negotiate

503
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,679
and is in prison now.

504
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,480
If anyone of you still wants
to help Chu Lushan,

505
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,760
don't kneel here

506
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:34,880
and come directly in.

507
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,560
(Xu Xiao's Adopted Son Chen Zhibao)

508
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,440
My Lord,

509
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,639
Chen Zhibao is here.

510
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,119
Now

511
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,199
he is heading to His Highness.

512
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:33,559
I got it.

513
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,480
It's cold.

514
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,480
Alright,

515
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,639
I'll change it right now.

516
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,039
His Highness,

517
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,800
Chen Zhibao is coming.

518
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,480
White Chen?

519
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:10,000
You know him?

520
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,400
Chen Zhibao, War Immortal in White.

521
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,960
Xu Xiao's henchman.

522
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,800
The top general in North Liang

523
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,920
and the top one of the Adopted Six.

524
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,920
The backbone of North Liang.

525
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,440
It's said that

526
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,679
he is the only one capable to take over

527
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,280
North Liang after Xu Xiao.

528
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,159
Sounds like there is nothing
to do with me.

529
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,280
You're also well-known.

530
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,400
Chen Zhibao is the hope of North Liang

531
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:30,960
and you are the shame of North Liang.

532
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,440
You're both famous.

533
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,719
Have some tea

534
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,039
and wait for White Chen.

535
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,280
(Ruide Hall)

536
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:39,159
Don't stand in the way.

537
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,800
I can't even see him.

538
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,679
You're also here to persuade me?

539
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,599
Chu Lushan is

540
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
the general I look down upon the most.

541
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,679
I have told them

542
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,719
that one day

543
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,719
I will send him to hell.

544
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,880
If you really want to kill him,

545
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,000
I can do it for you.

546
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,440
The problem is,

547
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,159
do you really want to kill him?

548
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:26,880
What is it?

549
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,119
Head.

550
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,880
The person who gave your portrait out

551
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,920
and sent the belle

552
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,039
to the brothel.

553
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,639
Who is it?

554
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,199
A military officer.

555
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,000
You don't know him.

556
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,559
Only an officer

557
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,159
can make such big trouble?

558
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,840
That's interesting.

559
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,760
He is the most brutal

560
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:59,519
and ridiculous one among the generals.

561
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,199
But this devil happens to be

562
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,960
most loyal to you.

563
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,840
I guess you whipped him

564
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,719
just to show the North Liang army.

565
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,719
In that way,

566
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,360
if someone wants to harm you,

567
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,199
the first choice to draw over

568
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,159
is the resentful Chu Lushan.

569
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,280
And you're also waiting.

570
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,039
The one who comes to save him

571
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,199
may be the murderer

572
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,199
who planned to kill you.

573
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,000
What a coincidence.

574
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,239
You're here now.

575
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,079
That's a harsh whip.

576
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,719
It's hard for him

577
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,400
to suffer for you.

578
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,599
Your Highness, please whip hard

579
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,400
later when you punish me.

580
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
It has to be hard enough

581
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
to be believed by others.

582
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,039
If you want to fish,

583
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,039
the bait must be put enough.

584
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,159
Your Highness.

585
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,199
Let's have a word alone.

586
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,599
They all say

587
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,440
you should be the one

588
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,760
to take over North Liang.

589
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,639
In contrast,

590
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,400
I, the son of Lord of North Liang,

591
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,440
am treated as a joke by others.

592
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,679
What do you think?

593
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,480
Didn't you ask for a talk?

594
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:41,840
Why don't you speak?

595
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,280
Did you question the belle?

596
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,039
She grew up being raised in a mansion,

597
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,280
practicing sword dance every day

598
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,280
just to stab me with that sword.

599
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,559
She doesn't know

600
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,840
who raised her.

601
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,320
She was just sent there.

602
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,159
Kill her.

603
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,599
No way.

604
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,400
She is pretty.

605
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,800
You can go meet her.

606
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,719
Maybe you will like her.

607
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,000
The assassination outside the city

608
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,239
and the sword dance

609
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,360
were just to make you suspect that
a rebel is hiding in the army.

610
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,320
You already fell into the trap

611
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,760
when you used Chu Lushan
to find him out.

612
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:23,480
Once you feel suspicious,

613
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,840
the army will be in a mess.

614
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:29,159
Kill that belle,

615
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
together with the officer's head,

616
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:34,199
so that the whole matter can be over.

617
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,519
Over?

618
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,719
That means no more investigation?

619
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,400
We should keep on investigating,

620
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,559
but on the surface,

621
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:45,880
this is over.

622
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,639
So, that officer

623
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,000
was not the murderer.

624
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,280
Just to end it on the surface,

625
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,840
he was beheaded.

626
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
He broke the military law

627
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,440
and had long been sentenced to death.

628
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,360
He had been sentenced to death

629
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,079
but he died now

630
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,760
just to end this up?

631
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,920
How many endings like this
are you hiding?

632
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,119
There are internal
and external problems.

633
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
The three states of North Liang

634
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,199
can't be in a mess.

635
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,000
That's why you, Chen Zhibao,

636
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,800
are the backbone of North Liang.

637
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:26,559
Yes,

638
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,360
I am.

639
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,920
I just told you

640
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,800
that the belle is pretty.

641
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,519
I'm reluctant to kill her.

642
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,480
