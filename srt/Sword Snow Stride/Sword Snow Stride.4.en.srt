(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

7
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,650
The belle is pretty.

8
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm reluctant to kill her.

9
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,100
What to do now?

10
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,439
I know it's hard for you

11
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,480
to hide your sharpness.

12
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,120
But I still despise you.

13
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,120
I know it.

14
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,775
Even if mountains and seas
come tumbling down,

15
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,825
I will only meet them alone.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
If you don't have this courage,

17
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,879
how can you take over North Liang?

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,875
I didn't say I want to take over.

19
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,360
If Xu Xiao passed away one day,

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,300
leaving North Liang in a mess,

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
will you want to take it over?

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,850
With me here,

23
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,825
North Liang won't be in a mess.

24
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:54,625
Come out.

25
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,400
See?

26
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,625
He looks down upon you.

27
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:11,800
Thanks.

28
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,075
What do you mean?

29
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,100
Judging from the atmosphere just now,

30
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,240
you were afraid that he would hurt me,

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,975
so you made some noise deliberately.

32
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,560
Don't worry,

33
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:23,800
he won't take any action.

34
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,250
Nonsense!

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,900
That was an accident.

36
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,960
It's good if he attacked you.

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,150
I could give him a hand.

38
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,075
I think it's the day to dry my books.

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,425
Where are they?

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,719
The book is broken.

41
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,500
You should pay for it.

42
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,919
Isn't that reasonable?

43
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:01,525
Where are you going?

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,475
To get my coin box!

45
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,000
You feel better now?

46
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,325
Ning Emei is a frank guy.

47
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,800
Give him a reason

48
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,950
and let him go.

49
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,225
The assassination isn't done yet.

50
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,800
Next time,

51
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,120
we'll know who is behind.

52
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
Chen Zhibao

53
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,575
is talented

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,600
and handsome.

55
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,950
Even I

56
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,925
can't compare with him.

57
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,475
You're being humble.

58
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,360
He has his tricks

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,900
but you have your own schemes.

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,079
After you take charge of North Liang,

61
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,725
he is the first one you should subdue.

62
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,200
It's a little difficult.

63
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,425
I'm just a playboy.

64
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,519
How can I take such a responsibility?

65
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,639
And you just told me

66
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,920
that next assassination

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,400
will happen anytime.

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
I should stay alive for now.

69

(Third Graduate in the Palace Examination

(Retainer Miss Fan)

71
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:31,575
After we arrive in Lingzhou,

72
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:32,875
we should be apart.

73
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,680
Why?

74
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,400
Did I do anything wrong?

75
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:46,800
As you know,

76
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm going to Lingzhou for Xu Fengnian.

77
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:50,975
You shouldn't be involved

78
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,040
in such big trouble.

79
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:54,725
No matter what you do,

80
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,650
I'm willing to be by your side.

81
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,125
Lin,

82
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,879
don't you trust me?

83
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:08,150
Yes.

84
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm just touched.

(Tingchao Pavilion)

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,750
Why don't you get in?

87
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,950
We had a deal.

88
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,025
I'll get in only when

89
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:42,550
I finish my job as your bodyguard.

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,399
Don't make it so rigid.

91
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,240
You can get in now.

92
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,200
Now?

93
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,750
Wait a moment.

94
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,600
What is it?

95
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:03,850
Grilled chicken.

96
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,300
Why did you throw it in the lake?

97
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,150
Come on, let's get in.

98
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,800

Come on!

101
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,425
I'll lead you.

102
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,925
On the first floor, there are
30,000 volumes of basic martial arts,

103
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:50,975
at which you may turn your nose up.

104
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:52,525
30,000 volumes?

105
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,650
On the second floor, there are
4,000 unique copies of

106
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,375
Yin Yang theory and debating,

107
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,000
and also 49 great weapons.

108
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,480
On the third floor, there are
20,000 volumes of precious secret books

109
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,759
which can be considered as profound.

110
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,720
The fourth floor is full of antiques,

111
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
in which you may not be interested.

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
Don't go to the fifth
and sixth floor for now.

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,360
I need to ask for Xu Xiao's permission.

114
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,225
There are so many books and weapons,

115
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,700
but why don't you know martial arts?

116
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,399
The academy is full of moral articles.

117
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,500
Why are there still many rascals?

118
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,925
That's different.

119
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:17,450
I'm lazy.

120
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,560
The son of a Lord
can't suffer from this.

121
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm afraid the army won't obey you

122
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,439
if you don't have the strength to fight.

123
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,800
You also want to persuade me
to take over North Liang?

124
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,050
Whether you take over or not

125
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,559
has nothing to do with me.

126
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,080
That's fine.

127
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,480
Alright,

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
take your time.

129
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,799
I'm leaving.

130
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:42,550
Oh,

131
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,200
I need to tell him.

132
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,000
Grandpa Wei!

133
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
Grandpa Wei!

134
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:55,200
Let me borrow your blade.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,440
Dry weather!

136
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,200
Beware of fire!

137
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:09,775
Dry weather!

138
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,519
Xu Fengnian!

139
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,320
Beware of fire!

140
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,480
Stop knocking!

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,519
Xu Fengnian,

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
are you trying to kill me?

143
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,759
Your Highness,

144
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,399
greetings

145
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,350
to you.

146
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,500
This is Grandpa Wei.

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,425
You can ask him for the books you want.

148
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,475
This is Nangong Puye.

149
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:42,475
She is here to read books.

150
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,519
Nangong?

151
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,480
(Tingchao Pavilion Wei Shuyang)

152
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,320
(Tingchao Pavilion Wei Shuyang)
The family from North Mang?

153
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,850
Xu Xiao knows her.

154
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,325
Oh,

155
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:49,675
then that's alright.

156
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:50,759
I'm leaving then.

157
00:09:50,975 --> 00:09:52,050
Wait, Your Highness.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,150
Since you're back,

159
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,240
won't you go upstairs
to meet your master?

160
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,200
I can't meet him now.

161
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:05,625
Why?

162
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,600
The assassination

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,750
is planned by someone.

164
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,250
Before I find it out,

165
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,399
I feel ashamed to see him.

166
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:12,879
Master?

167
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,500
You don't know martial arts, do you?

168
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,080
My master doesn't teach me martial arts.

169
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,900
What does he teach you then?

170
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,279
Chess.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Who is this? What a big scene.

172
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,104
Yeah.

173
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,196
What's going on?

174
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,425
It's Lin!

175
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:54,100
Yes. Right.

176
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,350
His family is in charge of

177
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,575
the financial affairs in Qingzhou.

178
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:57,708
It's a great honor

179
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,350
to his family to have such a scholar!

180
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:00,775
Who is this?

181
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,625
I don't know.

182
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,225
Have you ever seen him?

183
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,000
- Thanks.
- No.

184
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,610
Come on. Let's go have a look.

185
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:10,650
Is it him?

186
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,575
Ladies and gentlemen,

187
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,900
I have something to say.

188
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,120
Please stay

189
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,000
and listen to me.

190
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,425
What is he talking about?

191
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,950
What? I don't understand.

192
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:26,799
Xu Xiao,

193
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,279
known as the Lord of North Liang,

194
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,840
is actually a rebel!

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,039
That's a big problem!

196
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,300
He is a brutal maniac

197
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,600
who should be punished by all.

198
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,800
This is a capital crime!

199
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:40,559
He is ferocious and violent,

200
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:42,080
but he has achieved

201
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,225
war success.

202
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,575
The most disgraceful

203
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,799
is the eldest son of the Xu Family,

204
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,800
Xu Fengnian!

205
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,559
The son of Lord of North Liang

206
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,639
is greedy, lustful,

207
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,000
- as vicious as a viper.
- What a deep grudge does he have?

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
Such an evil person

209
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,759
with bad intentions

210
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,080
is really the biggest human disaster

211
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,600
and the biggest trouble in the world!

212
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,559
Here you are.

213
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,475
Let's go out together.

214
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,320
No.

215
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,100
I heard someone is scolding me
in the street.

216
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,080
Really?

217
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Why should I lie to you?

218
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,159
And it's said that guy is literary,

219
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,360
scolding me for hours

220
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,125
without repeating words.

221
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't believe it.

222
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,320
If someone scolded you in the street,

223
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,775
he or she would be arrested already.

224
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,159
He is the third graduate
in the imperial examination.

225
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,575
No one dares to arrest him.

226
00:12:29,575 --> 00:12:31,125
The third graduate

227
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,799
came to Lingzhou to scold you
in the street?

228
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,639
Yeah!

229
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,679
It's once in a blue moon.

230
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,400
Come on!

231
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,440
I need to learn something from him.

232
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,200
Let's go.

233
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:41,600
Old Huang, why are you coming?

234
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
I'll go watch the fun.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,159
Old Huang likes watching the fun.

236
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,720
Aren't you being scolded?

237
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,850
Why do you look so happy?

238
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,750
I like watching the fun, too!

239
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,440
Hurry up!

240
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,279
Or it'll be over.

241
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:56,925
Come on.

242
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,425
If there is a righteous gentleman

243
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,440
who can't bear to see
that harrowing scene,

244
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,550
how can he sit idly by?

245
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:05,559
What is he talking about?

246
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,559
We should be outraged!

247
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,575
- Defend our world,
- I don't understand.

248
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,039
- speak righteously
- He must be scolding.

249
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,350
- to show our attitude!
- Yeah.

250
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,360
I can't understand.

251
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,350
Lin.

252
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,550
I can't understand a word of him.

253
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,060
He even gets thirsty.

254
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,510
I don't understand.

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,475
Excuse me.

256
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:23,100
Coming through.

257
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,250
He is the third scholar?

258
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,925
Yeah.

259
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,030
What is he talking about?
I don't understand.

260
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,519
Thanks.

261
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:33,855
He even dares to talk about
Lord of North Liang.

262
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,450
Ladies and gentlemen,

263
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:37,425
- This lady looks pretty.
- I've scolded him for long.

264
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,475
I'd like to ask you

265
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,720
if you know why

266
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,159
the shameless Xu Fengnian

267
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,639
can do harm to Lingzhou?

268
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,150
Why?

269
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,800
Say it!

270
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:48,840
Go ahead!

271
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,650
Up to the situation now,

272
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:52,159
it's still because of

273
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:54,240
the rebellious villain,

274
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,879
Xu Xiao!

275
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,639
He is bold.

276
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,000
The country's etiquette

277
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,675
and moral model

278
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,050
are all ruined by him.

279
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,825
What is he saying? Too bookish.

280
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:09,879
Xu Xiao!

281
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,500
Old Huang.

282
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,025
Yes?

283
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,175
- What do you think?
- He used the military power

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,240
- He is not scolding well.
- to ignore the imperial decree!

285
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,050
Why?

286
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,480
No one can understand.

287
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,475
Scolding without dirty words

288
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:20,200
is so boring.

289
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,200
- That's right.
- This guy

290
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,080
is really the serious trouble

291
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
of Liyang

292
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,450
and the traitor of the country!

293
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,325
Ouch!

294
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,850
- You brat!
- What happened?

295
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,240
How cruel you are!

296
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:33,900
You're running over me!

297
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,480
He broke the elder's leg.

298
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,775
My carriage didn't move!

299
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,120
Get up first!

300
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:39,759
My hand!

301
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:42,759
My hand is broken, too!

302
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,720
I didn't move!

303
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,399
The carriage is parked!

304
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:46,799
Everyone saw it!

305
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,600
My carriage didn't even move!

306
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,480
Everyone saw it!

307
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,375
My eyes also get blind!

308
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,402
They even made him blind!

309
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:56,879
You said we ran over your leg.

310
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,440
- How did your eyes get blind?
- How?

311
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,950
They got blind from pain!

312
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,400
His eyes even got blind.

313
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,700
I know this guy!

314
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,519
How cruel is he!

315
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,575
Old Xu.

316
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,525
Old Xu.

317
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,475
Cheating for money?

318
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,568
See?

319
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,700
Look how poor the old man is.

320
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,320
Xu?

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
(Cavalryman of Yugu Battalion Xu Yongguan)
Yeah.

322
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,000
Come on.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,900
Let's talk when we're back.

324
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm not done yet.

325
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,399
Xu,

326
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,639
he is the third scholar.

327
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,500
We can't afford to offend him.

328
00:15:23,575 --> 00:15:25,250
He is rich.

329
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,075
How dare he offend him?

330
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,525
But he is bullying.

331
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,425
He needs to be sent to jail.

332
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,426
He can't escape.

333
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:31,975
Yeah.

334
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:32,850
- Hold on a second.
- Don't try to escape!

335
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,039
Where is he?

336
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,360
Here.

337
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:50,525
Stop that!

338
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,120
Without the North Liang Army,

339
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,750
the world wouldn't be in peace like now!

340
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,440
You are not grateful

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,150
for the favor of peace.

342
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,399
Shame on you!

343
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:00,960
Nonsense!

344
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,350
Don't touch me!

345
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,575
My eyes are blinded by your touch!

346
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:05,919
My eyes!

347
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,000
- My eyes!
- Come on.

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,879
Let's go back home.

349
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,075
Sorry. Sorry.

350
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,320
- Why are we leaving now?
- Let's go home.

351
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,725
Let's go home and have some drinks.

352
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,568
Come on.

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
How poor he is.

354
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,679
So boring.

355
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,725
What a rascal he is!

356
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,080
No play to watch.

357
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,159
What a bust.

358
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,150
How boring!

359
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,720
They got spoiled.

360
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,399
Let's go.

361
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,519
Scholar,

362
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
you'd better go now.

363
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,875
- Or you may get caught
- What to do now?

364
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,919
by the government.

365
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:30,720
That's right.

366
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,679
Go now.

367
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,159
- Or you'll get arrested!
- He will be sooner or later.

368
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,440
The scholars have their own bearing.

369
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,900
Since I have scolded him,

370
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,825
I might as well face the rebel directly.

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,625
Miss Fan,

372
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,675
let's go to the Mansion
of Lord of North Liang

373
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,175
to blame Xu Fengnian face to face.

374
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:52,850
Alright.

375
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:54,375
I'll be with you

376
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,559
wherever you go.

377
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,700
Stop running!

378
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,200
Stop!

379
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,950
Old Huang, get it!

380
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,200
Have you caught it?

381
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:09,759
Wait a second!

382
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,450
We have blocked it.

383
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,799
You can't even catch a duck.

384
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,519
Idiot!

385
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,075
He is an idiot.

386
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,519
I need to get a tool.

387
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,025
I'll go get a tool.

388
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,850
Stop there!

389
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:28,625
Stop waving.

390
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,825
It's because of the war.

391
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,440
I'm really blind.

392
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:33,875
Ah.

393
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,759
How do you know I'm waving my hand?

394
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,400
You even made a wind.

395
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:41,680
I got it!

396
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Stew it!

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,160
There are drinks inside the room.

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,275
Leave it to me.

399
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:47,480
The kitchen is over there.

400
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,359
Alright!

401
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,160
Wait a moment!

402
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,440
Let me make it delicious for you!

403
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,440
I haven't seen you for years.

404
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,559
I guess you got married.

405
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,720
I thought,

406
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,160
who would be so unlucky

407
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,119
as to marry a brat like you?

408
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:11,759
I didn't expect that you really got one.

409
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,039
She is great.

410
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,480
She sounds cute and pretty.

411
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,880
That's a great scolding.

412
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:17,857
Um-hmm.

413
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm not!

414
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,325
I didn't marry him!

415
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,640
Xu Fengnian! Say something!

416
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:24,900
We haven't got married yet.

417
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,900
Ah?

418
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,519
You already stay together
without getting married?

419
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,359
Do her parents agree?

420
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,720
No! We're not together!

421
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,039
Her parents passed away.

422
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,366
Then, you must treat her nicely.

423
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,225
Don't break her heart.

424
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,640
You!

425
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,599
Skip our business.

426
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,240
Let's talk about you.

427
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,680
What our business?

428
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,119
Xu.

429
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:47,680
Ah.

430
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,799
It's been years

431
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,240
and you become generous.

432
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,440
You even treat us
with the duck you raised.

433
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,575
I don't raise ducks.

434
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:57,319
What is the duck we caught then?

435
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,000
It belongs to my neighbor.

436
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,625
It just came to visit.

437
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,200
Old Huang!

438
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,680
What's wrong?

439
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm plucking it.

440
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,759
Nothing.

441
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:13,039
Remember the salt.

442
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,799
Got it.

443
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,279
You caught it.

444
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:18,800
You pay for it.

445
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,720
You deserve it.

446
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,350
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

447
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:37,800
Wait, Miss Fan.

448
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,425
Um?

449
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,240
Lin Family from Hedong

450
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,675
is here to visit

451
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:53,975
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)
the son of Lord of North Liang.

452
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,325
Lin Family from Hedong

453
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,075
is here to visit
the son of Lord of North Liang.

454
00:20:24,325 --> 00:20:25,759
Lin Family from Hedong

455
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,680
is here to visit

456
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,475
the son of Lord of North Liang!

457
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,000
Here is Lin's visiting card!

458
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,081
(Third Graduate
in the Palace Examination)

459
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,359
Why doesn't anyone take this?

460
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,880
Let's wait a little longer.

461
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:56,880
Perhaps the name of my family

462
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,920
shocked the concierge.

463
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,759
So he's rushing back to inform them.

464
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,525
How rude they are!

465
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,250
Men of prowess

466
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,200
know nothing about etiquette.

467
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,650
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

468
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,680
Coming!

469
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,200
Here comes the duck!

470
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,375
Here.

471
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,575
Hey!

472
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,200
You want it?

473
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,880
Take it away!

474
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:30,839
What's going on?

475
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,759
What are they fighting for?

476
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:32,839
The leg.

477
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:44,025
Lass,

478
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,000
have it.

479
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,075
Xu,

480
00:21:54,675 --> 00:21:56,725
stop fooling around.

481
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,839
Learn some skills

482
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,359
or open a shop.

483
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,400
Don't

484
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:05,200
let the girl suffer with you.

485
00:22:10,675 --> 00:22:11,799
I see.

486
00:22:12,025 --> 00:22:13,279
Just eat the duck.

487
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,800
Lin Family from Hedong is here

488
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,634
to visit His highness, Xu Fengnian.

489
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,850
You're the scholar
who shouted abuses in the street?

490
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:51,225
If His Highness is not convinced,

491
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,025
he can argue with me face to face.

492
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:56,839
His Highness is not home.

493
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,160
Hey!

494
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,550
Open the door and let us wait inside!

495
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:20,525
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

496
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:38,680
You're a veteran?

497
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:39,880
Um.

498
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,839
I'm from Yugu Battalion,

499
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,550
a time-honored battalion in Jinzhou.

500
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,599
You have

501
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,400
fought a lot of battles?

502
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,800
Of course.

503
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:55,050
Back then, all the states
were in chaotic wars.

504
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,319
I've met

505
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
almost all the battles.

506
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,640
Forget about it.

507
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,100
Now the world is pacified.

508
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,039
Why bother to recall that?

509
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,240
Xu looks unreliable,

510
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,920
but he is kind inside.

511
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,480
You made the right choice.

512
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,250
He is a good boy for life.

513
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,375
What a brat.

514
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:39,850
How about

515
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:42,000
getting back to the carriage?

516
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680
They have no manners

517
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
but we have to keep our proper sense.

518
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:52,725
Lin,

519
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,240
why do you hate Xu Fengnian so much?

520
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,850
Now the three northern states
only obey the Xu Family

521
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,880
but not the royal power.

522
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,240
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)
That's the potential problem.

523
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Once a villain like Xu Fengnian

524
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,925
is in charge of the world,

525
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:22,160
the world will be devastated.

526
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:24,675
If I know martial arts,

527
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,799
I'll kill him myself

528
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:31,325
to eliminate the hidden trouble
for the world.

529
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
He doesn't know you're Xu Fengnian?

530
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,960
He is Old Xu

531
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
and I'm just Xu.

532
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,839
That's great.

533
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,039
He fought for your family,

534
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,799
but look what life he is living now.

535
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:07,960
You owe him a lot.

536
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,039
Yeah.

537
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,440
My family owes him

538
00:26:12,675 --> 00:26:13,559
and all of them.

539
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,319
So

540
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,240
we can only repay them a peaceful world.

541
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,680
Why don't you tell him

542
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,875
you're the son of the Lord?

543
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,200
So many people in this world

544
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,759
can live well

545
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,880
just because these people

546
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,039
are dead,

547
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,160
wounded,

548
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,775
and disabled.

549
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,160
So, my status as His Highness

550
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,119
means nothing

551
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,150
in front of them.

552
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm

553
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:41,279
just a brat.

554
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,640
No war.

555
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,975
So great.

556
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:16,119
Isn't that the scholar who scolded you?

557
00:27:21,925 --> 00:27:23,519
Oh, you're Mr. Lin.

558
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,640
The old man who caused trouble

559
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,875
was taken away by him.

560
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,799
Thank you

561
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:32,850
for helping me out just now.

562
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,325
Mr. Lin, what are you

563
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:36,359
waiting for here?

564
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,160
None of your business!

565
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,175
Visit His Highness.

566
00:27:41,975 --> 00:27:43,079
Why don't you get in?

567
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,000
They have no manners

568
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,425
and don't know about hospitality.

569
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:47,525
Oh.

570
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,559
- They didn't take our visiting card.
- Open the door!

571
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,000
It's of no use to knock at the door.

572
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,960
Come on.

573
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,799
Come inside.

574
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,279
Why are you looking at me?

575
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,480
Pretty.

576
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,600
You must be a good wife.

577
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,625
You!

578
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,375
Old Huang.

579
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,680
Young Master.

580
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,875
I can help you if you like her.

581
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,039
I'm afraid you can't.

582
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,079
Shameless.

583
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,350
How could you scold Old Huang?

584
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,050
I'm scolding you!

585
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,079
What?

586
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,725
Go tell Qingniao

587
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:17,800
to wait for me by the lake.

588
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:20,450
No.

589
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
You have taken my money.

590
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:22,400
Go.

591
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,500
Or give it back to me.

592
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:35,640
Are you one of them here?

593
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,759
Kind of.

594
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:39,839
Looks like you're also literate.

595
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,240
Do you know

596
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,640
who is the top villain in Liyang?

597
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,900
Xu Xiao.

598
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,079
Since you know his sin,

599
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,550
why do you offer service to him?

600
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm not offering service.

601
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:53,559
My father lives here.

602
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,400
I have no choice.

603
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,680
Your father is Xu's assistant?

604
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,700
Not that capable.

605
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,599
Guard?

606
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,920
He is too old to do that.

607
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,559
Then…

608
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,725
Maybe the steward.

609
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:03,125
Oh.

610
00:30:03,675 --> 00:30:04,960
Since you often stay here,

611
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,319
have you ever met Xu Fengnian?

612
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,225
I met him often.

613
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,000
What do you think of him?

614
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:13,759
So-so.

615
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,575
Kind of a rascal.

616
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,050
I didn't expect you to be in danger

617
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:20,650
but still dare to speak up for justice!

618
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:22,575
Liyang

619
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,759
still has hope for having
such a young person

620
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,839
of noble aspirations.

621
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,400
I feel flattered.

622
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,480
Since you're always here,

623
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,525
can you tell me the details

624
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:33,000
about how greedy
and lustful Xu Fengnian is?

625
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,599
Here they are.

626
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,115
Where is Xu Fengnian?

627
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:06,559
The playboy

628
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,480
always shows up with girls around.

629
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,480
Keep cool.

630
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,350
Take your seat.

631
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,559
He hasn't come.

632
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,225
No hurry.

633
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,119
Aren't you here for Xu Fengnian?

634
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,000
Who else are you waiting for?

635
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes.

636
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,950
I'm waiting for him.

637
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:30,350
Here I am.

638
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,759
What did he say?

639
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,880
He said he is Xu Fengnian.

640
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,039
Who are you?

641
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,675
Son of Lord of North Liang, Xu Fengnian.

642
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,759
Mr. Lin, you're so cute.

643
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,900
You spoke contrary to your thought.

644
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,759
You pretended to scold me in the street

645
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,975
but think so highly of me in mind.

646
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,079
When did I think highly of you?

647
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,240
Liyang just needs such a young person

648
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,359
of noble aspirations.

649
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,519
Didn't you say that?

650
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:01,650
Are you really Xu Fengnian?

651
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:04,039
Do you think there is anyone else

652
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:05,720
who would dare to pretend to be him?

653
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,680
Then, you're making fun of us?

654
00:32:11,025 --> 00:32:12,400
You wanted to get in,

655
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,850
so I let you in.

656
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,119
You scolded Xu Xiao,

657
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,160
I went along.

658
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,640
You asked to see Xu Fengnian,

659
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,375
so I prepared seats by the lake.

660
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,039
Why do you say

661
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm making fun of you?

662
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,720
You concealed your identity.

663
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,799
You're insidious and treacherous!

664
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,799
No more verbal arguments.

665
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,559
If you are Xu Fengnian,

666
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,880
do you know that

667
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,200
North Liang's leadership

668
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,880
is in the period of stagnation?

669
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,000
Your family occupies three states

670
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,240
and gets the military power.

671
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,725
What is your purpose?

672
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,319
Xu Fengnian!

673
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:43,680
If you still have a sense of loyalty,

674
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,825
you should reflect on yourself!

675
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:48,900
What did you say

676
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:50,400
to this lady just now?

677
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,519
No more verbal arguments.

678
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,279
Isn't this verbal argument
you're talking?

679
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,039
Mr. Lin,

680
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,450
to scold,

681
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,359
you should speak dirty words.

682
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,075
You!

683
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,599
Looks like you won't come around.

684
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:22,375
Although you

685
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,500
have a lot of bad deeds,

686
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:26,759
you've got a lot of guts.

687
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,839
You have no bodyguards with you

688
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,119
when meeting with people.

689
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,075
Aren't you afraid of

690
00:33:32,925 --> 00:33:34,175
being assassinated?

691
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:42,625
The assassin is also bold

692
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,200
if he dares to do it here.

693
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:49,200
For the sake of the people,

694
00:33:49,525 --> 00:33:51,079
I'd like to risk my life!

695
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,880
Rebel,

696
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:52,800
prepare to die!

697
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,400
This is not finger method.

698
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,000
It's not.

699
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,950
Also not swordsmanship.

700
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:26,625
It's marksmanship.

701
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,760
I've always suspected that

702
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,519
Xu Xiao hid a master by my side,

703
00:34:51,525 --> 00:34:53,320
and the first suspect is you.

704
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,599
You took them in

705
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,575
just to test me with her sword?

706
00:34:58,475 --> 00:34:59,679
I have to know

707
00:35:00,025 --> 00:35:01,800
the people around me.

708
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,159
What if I'm not?

709
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,599
I'm so smart.

710
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,920
How can I guess wrong?

711
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,800
Are you a dark minion or a death guard?

712
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:18,280
Why don't you ask His Lordship?

713
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,800
It would be boring if I asked him.

714
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,320
It's more fun to find the people

715
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,725
he planted around me.

716
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,920
I'm thankful for you two this time.

717
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,559
I take full responsibility
for the assassination.

718
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,679
It has nothing to do with Mr. Lin.

719
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,079
Does it?

720
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,639
Mr. Lin,

721
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:42,159
she said she arranged the assassination
on her own,

722
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,559
and you were not involved.

723
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,039
Is it true?

724
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,719
You need to know that the person
who performed assassination against me

725
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:57,350
in North Liang will be tortured.

726
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,650
Soon,

727
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,719
they will peel your skin

728
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,320
without missing a piece,

729
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:05,125
and it will be hung on the wall,

730
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,280
fluttering in the wind.

731
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,679
That feels quite ethereal.

732
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,800
I…

733
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,159
I…

734
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,519
So you'd better think clearly

735
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,350
before answering my question.

736
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,039
It really has nothing to do with me.

737
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,519
Is that so?

738
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,125
Yes.

739
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,775
You can look into it, Your Highness.

740
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,679
I knew Miss Fan

741
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,960
on my way up north.

742
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,900
It was a real accidental acquaintance.

743
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,960
I was tricked by her as well.

744
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,575
I had no idea of her evil heart.

745
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,360
Pick up the sword.

746
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:55,250
Your Highness,

747
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,039
I really didn't mean to assassinate you.

748
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,960
I swear to God.

749
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Old Huang.

750
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:20,525
She tricked the Third Graduate
in the Palace Examination, huh?

751
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,600
So vicious.

752
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,320
Yes,

753
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,320
this woman is sinister and vicious.

754
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,350
Take it.

755
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,320
I didn't mean to assassinate you.

756
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,800
I'm not asking you to stab me with it.

757
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,925
I want you to kill her.

758
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,559
Hold the sword steadily.

759
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,550
Walk up to her,

760
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,000
aim at her heart,

761
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,960
and stab through her body.

762
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,650
Remember to chop her ribs open.

763
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:01,760
It's quite easy.

764
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,825
Try it.

765
00:38:06,525 --> 00:38:07,250
Yes.

766
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:09,825
After human skin is dried,

767
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,350
it looks really nice

768
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,475
on the wall.

769
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,425
Yeah.

770
00:38:25,175 --> 00:38:25,920
Go.

771
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:48,850
Yeah.

772
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,600
I lied to you.

773
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,175
I deserve it.

774
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
Do it.

775
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,199
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

776
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,200
It was foolish of me.

777
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:55,360
I read the books for nothing.

778
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,760
The Xu family is the backbone
of our nation.

779
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,400
I shouldn't have said the nonsense,

780
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,350
and insulted you.

781
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm despicable.

782
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,400
I'm foolish.

783
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,480
I deserve to be beaten.

784
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:04,559
I deserve to be beaten.

785
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,159
I deserve to be beaten.

786
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:05,920
I deserve it.

787
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,679
I deserve to be beaten.

788
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:07,199
I deserve it.

789
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:07,840
I deserve it.

790
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,400
I deserve it.

791
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,300
You don't dare to kill anyone?

792
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,000
You're a scholar.

793
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:18,119
It's understandable.

794
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,039
Thank you for understanding.

795
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,960
But you don't have to slap yourself.

796
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
You just insulted someone,

797
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,639
it's not like you killed anyone.

798
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:28,600
It's fine.

799
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,400
Thank you for your benevolence.

800
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:34,575
You don't dare to kill anyone,

801
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:35,920
but do you dare to hit someone?

802
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,850
She lied to you.

803
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,719
How about you take it out on her
by hitting her?

804
00:40:54,475 --> 00:40:55,775
Or you can curse her.

805
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,119
Do I hit her after cursing her?

806
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:01,360
Suit yourself.

807
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,599
You witch!

808
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,575
I didn't expect you to be so sinister.

809
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,280
I'm unsophisticated,

810
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,599
and was tricked by her.

811
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:14,719
Along the way,

812
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,375
she defamed His Highness several times,

813
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,975
so I was misled.

814
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:20,675
You are…

815
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,360
You are…

816
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,519
You are such a…

817
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,519
You don't know
how to use dirty words at this point?

818
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:27,975
I do.

819
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,480
Your mother

820
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,440
failed to educate you!

821
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,880
Enough.

822
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,880
Fine!

823
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:47,000
I can't watch this anymore.

824
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,719
You saw

825
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,840
what he has said and done.

826
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,000
Do you resent him?

827
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:01,760
I lied to him.

828
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,050
Hitting or cursing,

829
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:05,750
I deserve them both.

830
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,025
I don't feel aggrieved.

831
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:13,559
Women.

832
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,750
Men.

833
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,725
Mr. Lin,

834
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:21,599
I now believe

835
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,475
that you have nothing to do
with the assassination.

836
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,525
Take her away.

837
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,200
What?

838
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:35,575
You're concerned that

839
00:42:35,575 --> 00:42:37,320
Mr. Lin might assassinate me again
when you're out of here?

840
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,100
It's fine.

841
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:42,925
Go.
