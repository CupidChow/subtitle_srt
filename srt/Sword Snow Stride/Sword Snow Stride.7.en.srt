1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 7=

7
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,961
You could've stopped him to go.

8
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,080
He's been running most of his life.

9
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,201
He can finally face his fate.

10
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,521
No one has the right

11
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,201
to stop him.

12
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:23,120
Brother.

13
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:27,720
Slow down.

14
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,040
You are sweating.

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,321
Did Old Huang leave?

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,761
I got steamed buns for him

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,080
from the kitchen.

18
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,080
He would be back.

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,800
What are you sighing for, Huangman'er?

20
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,561
If only he hadn't left.

21
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:53,841
If only everyone could stay

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,561
and no one would leave.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,080
Right.

24
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,121
No one would leave.

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,640
(Tingchao Pavilion)

26
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,600
(Imposing and Magnificent)

27
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:23,840
It's so strange.

28
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,121
The Nangong Family from North Mang

29
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,840
is noble and reputable.

30
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,280
My spies

31
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:34,001
have been digging into it for many days

32
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,921
yet nothing is found

33
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:37,921
about Nangong Puye.

34
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:41,561
You should believe your son's eyes.

35
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,080
How good is this woman?

36
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,361
Excellent.

37
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,520
Give her ten years

38
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,320
and she can ruin the world.

39
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,520
Do you mean

40
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,640
Fengnian has luckily got a talent?

41
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,840
I quit.

42
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,640
The vibe of a master.

43
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,601
What is the vibe of a master?

44
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,080
It should look good.

45
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,001
Isn't it
your Coming-of-Age Ceremony today?

46
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,121
Why are you here?

47
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,880
Xu Xiao wants my master to attend it.

48
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
(Imposing and Magnificent)

49
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,361
Will he come down?

50
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,880
No.

51
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:23,121
Why?

52
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:26,561
This is the cage he made for himself.

53
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,361
The war

54
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,041
has been long over.

55
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,801
Why can't you

56
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,880
let it go?

57
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,041
Do you remember

58
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,520
what people said about me back then?

59
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,161
Can't you let it go?

60
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,481
How?

61
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:00,280
Hands stained with blood

62
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:02,640
cannot be washed clean.

63
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:03,681
As you said,

64
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:04,880
should I kill myself

65
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,640
for what I did?

66
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:08,200
No. No. No.

67
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,561
It's different.

68
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,041
My blade

69
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,760
was used to end the chaos

70
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,681
in the world.

71
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,241
Now,

72
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,320
Liyang is unified.

73
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:22,880
My thing

74
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,161
is already done,

75
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,880
but

76
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:28,960
yours not.

77
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:32,440
The banner of Xu

78
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,161
on North Liang's land

79
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,601
cannot fall yet.

80
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:36,801
Thus,

81
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
you can't stop moving.

82
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,200
You need to go on.

83
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,001
You have more to do than me.

84
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,561
You hide here at leisure,

85
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,121
and leave me so many difficulties.

86
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm tutoring your son.

87
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:55,960
You?

88
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,320
You do well, huh?

89
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,680
You may go down.

90
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,081
It is

91
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,560
Fengnian's Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

92
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,121
Don't get it delayed.

93
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,800
Li Yishan is your master.

94
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,800
No wonder you don't learn martial arts.

95
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,241
Commanding

96
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,241
is better than fighting in battle.

97
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:26,961
It's just that...

98
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,441
It's just that such people
can be advisers at best,

99
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,880
but cannot unite the armies as one.

100
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,841
If I take over North Liang,

101
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,280
people won't be convinced.

102
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
Is this what you mean?

103
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,721
You know it.

104
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,481
Why don't you learn martial arts?

105
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,721
If a lord's son is an all-round talent,

106
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,321
how long do you think he can live?

107
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:01,560
So, you are known

108
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,241
as a pervert,

109
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:04,560
a loser.

110
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,400
A loser

111
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,121
lives long.

112
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,441
You should go.

113
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:24,201
It's my Coming-of-Age Ceremony today.

114
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:26,841
Would you attend it?

115
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:28,560
I don't like noise.

116
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:31,560
Fine.

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,880
I'm going.

118
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,080
(Tingchao Pavilion)

119
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,200
Doesn't my master come down?

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,360
Never mind.

121
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,960
He is old and not very healthy.

122
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,519
It's so cold.

123
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,879
He can't stand it.

124
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,279
Your Lordship. A secret report from
Mount Longhu.

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,440
(Jian Jiuhuang has left Mount Longhu
for Wudi City.)

126
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,679
Old Huang has left Mount Longhu

127
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,559
on his way to Wudi City.

128
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,679
He can be back soon after the fight.

129
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,120
No mortal is a match

130
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,519
to the East Sea Wang Xianzhi.

131
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,159
It's your Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

132
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,320
No more about that.

133
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:23,879
Let's go.

134
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Wait.

135
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,080
The ancestral temple is
in this direction.

136
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,200
I know.

137
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,240
The Coming-of-Age Ceremony

138
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,360
should be held in the ancestral temple.

139
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
I changed the place.

140
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,759
As per ancient rules,
we shall pray to Heaven and Earth,

141
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,480
and ancestors.

142
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,840
No.

143
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:42,159
Neither pray to Heaven and Earth,

144
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,159
nor pray to ancestors?

145
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,480
Where will it be held then?

146
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
In front of your mother's grave.

147
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,759
Let her see the day

148
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,200
when you come of age.

149
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,799
When your mother was alive,

150
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,720
these two stone lions

151
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,279
were her favorites.

152
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,720
There are your two sisters
and Huangman'er.

153
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,519
Only you are on this side.

154
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,279
Your mother's love and partiality to you

155
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,559
has never ended.

156
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,320
They say I am

157
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,840
crazy and ruthless,

158
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,440
a vulgar person who has no manners.

159
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,240
I admit it.

160
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,799
Today we won't pray to Heaven and Earth,

161
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,279
only to your mother.

162
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,440
(Xu)

163
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,559
Where is Huangman'er?

164
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,159
You should know him well.

165
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,360
Every time he comes
to your mother's grave,

166
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,039
he cries his eyes out.

167
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,480
Let's

168
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,399
finish the ceremony first.

169
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,600
Let's go.

170
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Our son has come of age.

171
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,399
He's an adult now.

172
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,679
You can rest in peace.

173
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,360
Kneel.

174
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,360
Take the Cap

175
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,639
and change the Gown.

176
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,840
(The Coming-of-Age Text)
On this good day,

177
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,039
you are given the Cloth Cap.

178
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,600
Forsake your childishness,

179
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,320
and have the morality of adults.

180
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:31,399
Be upright and virtuous.

181
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,159
Wish you health and longevity.

182
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,080
The whole capital

183
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,720
is watching this.

184
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,159
As per the ancient rule,

185
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,320
from today on,

186
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,279
you can no longer wear it.

187
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
Afterwards,

188
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
you may be an official

189
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,080
and govern the country.

190
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:03,840
Remove the Cap

191
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,440
and change the Gown.

192
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,080
Kneel.

193
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,480
On this good day,

194
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,919
you are given the Pelt Cap.

195
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,119
May you have an awesome bearing,

196
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,799
and good characters.

197
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,839
Wish you longevity.

198
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,400
Heaven bless you.

199
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,519
The Pelt Cap is for nobles and officials

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,480
in charge of military affairs.

201
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,279
Afterwards,

202
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,759
you may serve in the army

203
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,559
and have military power.

204
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,240
In North Liang,

205
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,039
350 thousand cavalrymen

206
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,200
are all waiting for this moment.

207
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,559
Remove the Cap

208
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,519
and change the Gown.

209
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,200
Kneel.

210
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,759
On this auspicious day

211
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,440
of the time,

212
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,279
the ceremony is held for you.

213
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,920
All the attendees are here to celebrate,

214
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,200
for the virtue of yours.

215
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,599
Wish you longevity.

216
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,319
Heaven bless you.

217
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,640
The third one should be
the Lordship Cap,

218
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,720
to grant you the right
of ancestral worship.

219
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,839
I thought about it

220
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,279
and got it changed.

221
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,960
This Cap

222
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,359
is not in line with rituals.

223
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,079
No allusion either.

224
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,599
You can say

225
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,079
it is nothing.

226
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,119
No one

227
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,480
will care about this,

228
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
but your mother.

229
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,240
Because

230
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
it's the Cap that she made for you.

231
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,319
When she was making it,

232
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,000
she hoped

233
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,200
to see the day when you wore it.

234
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,599
Now,

235
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,880
she can finally see.

236
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,599
To be an official or a lord

237
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,559
in charge of military power

238
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,240
is good.

239
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,359
But however good it is,

240
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,759
it's no better than this.

241
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,240
Yes.

242
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,279
Nothing is better than this.

243
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,279
Come.

244
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,319
Mother.

245
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,160
Please look.

246
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,119
I have grown up.

247
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,119
Where are the others?

248
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,000
I told them to go back.

249
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,920
What are you looking at?

250
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,119
The world is so big.

251
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,079
Standing so high,

252
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,559
I still can't see all of it.

253
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
You might not be able to see all of it.

254
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,960
Maybe

255
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,640
it's not high enough.

256
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,279
Isn't it high enough?

257
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,240
The higher you are,

258
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,079
the better you see.

259
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,799
The scene down there is also good.

260
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,200
Fengnian.

261
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,319
As per ancient rituals,

262
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,440
you are a grownup

263
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,640
after the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

264
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,720
Are you persuading me
to take over North Liang again?

265
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,680
No. No. No.

266
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,000
No hurry.

267
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,240
You can

268
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,119
take your time

269
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,319
and think about it.

270
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,599
What are you trying to say?

271
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,799
I mean,

272
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,079
before today,

273
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
you are still a child.

274
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,000
Yes.

275
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,759
Youth is good.

276
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,759
But you are not very thoughtful

277
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
and insightful.

278
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,759
It doesn't matter.

279
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,319
I'm your father.

280
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm like a big umbrella,

281
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,319
shielding you

282
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
from wind and rain.

283
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,440
So,

284
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,079
for the things you can't decide,

285
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,880
I've made

286
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,440
the decision for you.

287
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,359
What decision?

288
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,519
Huangman'er!

289
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,559
Where has Huangman'er gone?

290
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,799
He has left the city.

291
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:38,839
Don't worry.

292
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,680
He will come back.

293
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,799
You don't want to kill Ning Emei.

294
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,359
And you want your brother
stay in North Liang.

295
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,599
I have to find you the third way.

296
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,319
No killing.

297
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,480
Your brother can stay.

298
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,079
And North Liang won't be in chaos.

299
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,839
What do you want exactly?

300
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:01,759
Let me ask you.

301
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,960
Why do the officials in the army

302
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,599
get close to your brother?

303
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,480
He was born with great power.

304
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:09,599
And he is valiant and peerless.

305
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,279
What if he lost his talent?

306
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,000
What do you mean?

307
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
I'll reshape him

308
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
and let him be a mortal.

309
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,960
That way,

310
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
you don't have to kill,

311
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,480
your brother can stay forever

312
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,920
and they won't use him

313
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,519
to disrupt North Liang.

314
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
How to reshape him?

315
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,799
In the world,

316
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
there are many sects

317
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,960
and martial arts.

318
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,799
One of the sects has the martial arts

319
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,119
that can make your brother's body

320
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,920
change.

321
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,039
Which sect?

322
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:51,799
The Wudang Sect.

323
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,280
(Mount Wudang)

324
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,440
Xu Xiao.

325
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,200
You promised my mother to protect him!

326
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,400
I promised her

327
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,400
to protect both of you.

328
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
You want it good for both sides.

329
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,160
That's the only choice I can make.

330
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,920
The power struggle

331
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:35,039
is a game of survival.

332
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,960
To make him ordinary

333
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,279
is to give him a peaceful life.

334
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,400
That's the only way to keep him

335
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,680
in North Liang.

336
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:21,680
Can you do me another favor?

337
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,079
Speak.

338
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,400
Be my bodyguard again

339
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,480
and go to Mount Wudang with me.

340
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,920
The smell of killing.

341
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:31,960
Are you forcing your way there?

342
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,759
No, to save my brother.

343
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,960
There are 350 thousand cavalrymen
in North Liang.

344
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,400
Why do you ask me to guard you?

345
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
Xu Xiao's men are everywhere.

346
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,079
So, your father didn't agree.

347
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,680
It's my business,

348
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,880
and my decision.

349
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,559
I can't help you.

350
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,839
Why?

351
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,319
If I helped you,

352
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,880
your father would kick me out
of Tingchao Pavilion.

353
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,559
I thought we were friends!

354
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:14,880
Do you know

355
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,519
why I stay in Tingchao Pavilion?

356
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,839
You want to be the Top Master.

357
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,000
Why do I want to be the Top Master?

358
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,880
Because that's the only way

359
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,839
to complete

360
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
the oath that I wrote with blood,

361
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,279
to uphold justice for the dead.

362
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,000
It's the only goal that I live for.

363
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,759
Sorry.

364
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,880
No need to say sorry.

365
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,519
I can't help you,

366
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,160
but one person here

367
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,119
isn't under your father's command.

368
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,000
The person out of water.

369
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,039
I forgot him!

370
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,039
Thanks.

371
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:43,759
Wait.

372
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,000
Protect yourself with Xiudong.

373
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,559
Return it when you are back.

374
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,519
I can't play martial arts.

375
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,759
I could fail the blade.

376
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,640
Take it as kindness

377
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
from a friend.

378
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,480
(Tingchao Pavilion)

379
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,039
Eat some more.

380
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,000
Eat up.

381
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,920
Eat.

382
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,200
What's the problem?

383
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,279
Go out of the city with me.

384
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,359
Why?

385
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,599
No.

386
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,000
You promised Old Huang to be my guard.

387
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,000
Will you go back on your word?

388
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
Where are you going?

389
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,079
Mount Wudang.

390
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,160
So far?

391
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,279
No, I won't.

392
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,880
You break your promise.

393
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,079
It's bad for your fame.

394
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,680
We are friends.

395
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,279
Xu Xiao.

396
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,839
Look.

397
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,680
Not a single horse.

398
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,640
Your father has taken
all the horses away.

399
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,880
Go out first.

400
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,279
There is a horse market in the street.

401
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,200
We can buy them there.

402
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,519
Your father ordered that

403
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,079
all horses shall be taken
to the barracks.

404
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,200
I assumed you'd make trouble,

405
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,519
so, I asked these two horses.

406
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,480
Would you borrow them?

407
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,319
Two taels of silver.

408
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,799
Let me make it clear.

409
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,559
Given your father's deeds,

410
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,240
you cannot

411
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,880
buy any horse in Lingzhou.

412
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,079
Thanks.

413
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,559
I said you should pay.

414
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,480
I know.

415
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,240
Two taels of silver.

416
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:54,839
You'll have it when I'm back.

417
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,680
I'm not helping you.

418
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,319
You'd better leave North Liang.

419
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,720
Without you around me,
I will feel easy.

420
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,000
Senior.

421
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:13,640
Are you going out

422
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,680
against your father's will?

423
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:17,359
Yes.

424
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
To catch up with my brother.

425
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,759
Perhaps we'll have to fight to get him.

426
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,720
Are you scared?

427
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,279
This is more interesting.

428
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,559
I come to see what you need.

429
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:17,599
I heard that

430
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,279
you gave horses to Xu Fengnian.

431
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,599
Does it spread so fast?

432
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:24,680
Xu Xiao obviously

433
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,720
doesn't want him to go out.

434
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,559
You will be in trouble.

435
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,000
Why do you fear while I fear nothing?

436
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:30,839
You...

437
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,239
What?

438
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,039
You two...

439
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,159
Sworn enemies.

440
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,440
This man is so sly.

441
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,159
I've got no chance to kill him.

442
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,880
Did nothing happen to you?

443
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,159
It did.

444
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,719
I was fined when I failed.

445
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,639
Why do you want to kill him?

446
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,800
He robbed me of my money.

447
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,119
He's been bullying me since childhood.

448
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,880
That's not a reason.

449
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:19,960
Perhaps

450
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,920
to let him get used to it first.

451
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,199
Get used to what?

452
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,400
Get used to that

453
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
either of us will end up dead.

454
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,039
What are you implying?

455
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,639
Against fate,

456
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,079
people all fight alone.

457
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,119
Open the gate.

458
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,000
Fengzi Battalion is ordered
to close the city.

459
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,119
No one shall go out

460
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,400
without an order.

461
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,199
Do you know who I am?

462
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,880
In the order,

463
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,079
His Lordship specially

464
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:15,119
prohibited you, Your Highness,
from going out.

465
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,159
Should we fight a way out?

466
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,960
They are following the order.

467
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,199
They don't deserve to die.

468
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Check other gates?

469
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,000
Xu Xiao won't make such mistakes.

470
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,320
We can pull some strings.

471
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,320
I know

472
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,800
why Xu Xiao asked Chu Lushan

473
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,239
to take Huangman'er to Mount Wudang.

474
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,079
Your father calculated everything.

475
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,519
You've got no chance.

476
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,159
What?

477
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,079
Have you given up?

478
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,320
The barrack name sounds familiar.

479
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,480
I recall it.

480
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:50,960
Let's go.

481
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:04,920
You come again, Your Highness.

482
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,039
Outside Lingzhou,

483
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,119
I met you for the first time.

484
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,760
Yes.

485
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,559
I was ordered to bring you back.

486
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,440
You said

487
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,400
Fengzi Battalion was under your command.

488
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:17,880
Yes.

489
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,559
Let's go.

490
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:21,480
What to do?

491
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,599
Help me open the gate.

492
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,840
What happened to the gate?

493
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,199
Fengzi Battalion has closed the city.

494
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,480
Why is the city closed?

495
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,840
It's Xu Xiao's order.

496
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:32,760
If it's a military order,

497
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,639
I shall obey.

498
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:34,679
I won't go.

499
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,119
He'll ruin my brother's body.

500
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:39,880
Young Master Longxiang!

501
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,719
Whether we can save him or not,

502
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,320
it's up to you.

503
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:52,480
Xu Fengnian entered the dungeon
with a token.

504
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,639
Was the token

505
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,559
from his master?

506
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,360
Ning Emei must order to open the gate.

507
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,239
He's the leader of Fengzi Battalion.

508
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:04,960
His words are orders to them.

509
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,639
Ning Emei admired Huangman'er the most.

510
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,199
He'll definitely go to save him.

511
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Can you catch up with them?

512
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:21,760
Yes.

513
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,440
Deliver a message to him

514
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,480
for me.

515
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,199
Please go back, Your Highness.

516
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,239
The gate won't be open

517
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,440
until tomorrow.

518
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
General Ning is back.

519
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,039
Pass my order.

520
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,199
Open the gate

521
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,599
and prepare horses.

522
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,639
Yes.

523
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,600
(Lingzhou)

524
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,840
Stop.

525
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,519
Your Highness.

526
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,480
Where is Huangman'er?

527
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:12,440
In Mount Wudang.

528
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,960
Do you leave him there alone?

529
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,519
Do you know why Xu Xiao got him

530
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,079
in Mount Wudang?

531
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,159
He didn't tell me.

532
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,159
He'll ruin the body of Huangman'er.

533
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,639
Don't worry so much.

534
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,239
Only Dahuangting,

535
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,679
the Achiever of Wudang Heart Arts,

536
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,440
can change one's body.

537
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,800
No one in Wudang Sect can do that
for years.

538
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,239
What's wrong?

539
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,400
You don't know it.

540
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,119
Wudang Sect declines.

541
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
It's the Chief Wang Chonglou
who is in charge.

542
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,199
He is extremely talented.

543
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,159
He's achieved the Dahuangting.

544
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,320
Has someone in Wudang Sect
achieved the Dahuangting?

545
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,960
Move.

546
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,039
Let's go to Mount Wudang.

547
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,400
Chen Zhibao.

548
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,480
You go first, Your Highness.

549
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,559
I'll stop him.

550
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,159
We can't run away.

551
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,400
A message for you.

552
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:08,880
Go ahead.

553
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,159
My adoptive father has a message
for you.

554
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,519
Fengnian.

555
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,119
You are now an adult.

556
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,800
You should learn

557
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,519
to make choices now.

558
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,280
It's a dilemma about Huangman'er.

559
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,239
Since you decide to go there,

560
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,280
the result

561
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,920
is on you.

562
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:30,960
Did he

563
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,239
allow me to go to Mount Wudang?

564
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
If you want
to keep Xu Longxiang's power,

565
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,159
you need to make a choice like before.

566
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,440
Or

567
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,719
let him leave North Liang forever.

568
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:42,760
Or

569
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,519
learn to kill.

570
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,639
Kill?

571
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,400
Who to kill?

572
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,039
You can go to Mount Wudang.

573
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,880
North Liang Army must
go back to Lingzhou.

574
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,360
Ning Emei,

575
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,760
Chu Lushan,

576
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,159
go back with me.

577
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:00,079
He is ordering me.

578
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,280
He's right.

579
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,079
Your Highness.

580
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,079
North Liang Army is
a big concern to the royal family.

581
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,480
Long absence from the garrison

582
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:09,280
might raise suspicion.

583
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,719
You should go back.

584
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,360
Yes.

585
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,039
For the sake of brotherhood,

586
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:19,880
please protect Young Master.

587
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,519
You have my word.

588
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,760
Xu Fengnian.

589
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,599
Consider the consequences

590
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,519
before you make the decision.

591
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,400
Move.

592
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,400
Let's go to Mount Wudang.

593
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:48,039
Here we are.

594
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:49,679
How to get him back?

595
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:50,960
Fight a way out?

596
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,360
I don't think the Chief Wang Chonglou

597
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:54,440
would like to see us directly.
