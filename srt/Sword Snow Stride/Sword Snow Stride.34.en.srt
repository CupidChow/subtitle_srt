1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 34=

7
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,700
That's my sister.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,900
Senior, remember

9
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,100
not to call her my sister

10
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,900
and not to mention Jiang Ni.

11
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,425
Um.

12
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,175
Sister.

13
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,919
I'm Xu Weixiong, greetings to Mr. Li.

14
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:38,725
Your shouting of swords in Mount Longhu

15
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,719
enlightened the benighted.

16
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,850
You already knew it?

17
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,029
It spread that fast?

18
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:44,950
Thank you for escorting him
along the way.

19
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:46,650
The sword is good.

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,840
The Hongchi Sword

21
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,280
is a gift for you.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,919
No need.

23
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,825
I have a lot of swords.

24
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,050
Just keep it.

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,960
I only know some techniques,

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,975
but I know nothing
about the art of swords.

27
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,375
The sword will only be wasted

28
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,840
in my hands.

29
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,910
The sword is good indeed,

30
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,500
and you've spent plenty of time on it.

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,450
You're just being too modest.

32
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,159
After I left Mount Longhu,
it doesn't make any difference

33
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,400
whether there is a sword or not to me.

34
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,425
Xu Weixiong.

35
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,789
You are his second elder sister.
Don't test me.

36
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:20,750
I promised Xu Xiao

37
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,560
that I would make sure this boy
can go back to North Liang

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,225
with no legs or arms missing.

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,900
I would keep my word

40
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,875
even in Wudi City.

41
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:28,275
Thank you for keeping your word.

42
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,500
I heard

43
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,525
that you picked on Jiang Ni before?

44
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,075
That's true.

45
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,025
Do you look down on her?

46
00:03:41,175 --> 00:03:43,840
It's normal that sisters-in-law
don't get along.

47
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,919
But it doesn't mean
the husband's family is all bad.

48
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,150
They just want the wife

49
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,325
to remember the merit of her husband.

50
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,700
My mother passed away early.

51
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,800
I have to be the villain.

52
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,039
So you also think Jiang Ni

53
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,025
can make a couple with this boy?

54
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:03,025
Even a pig

55
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,360
can tell that.

56
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:07,725
All right.

57
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,595
I was going to avenge Jiang Ni.

58
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,800
Since you said that, I can't do it now.

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,900
But I have to say,

60
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,200
Xu Weixiong, you have a talent.

61
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,700
But Jiang Ni is better than you!

62
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,175
Do you hear it?

63
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,250
He said that to you.

64
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:26,519
What does Jiang Ni's martial art

65
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,720
have anything to do with me?

66
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,900
I don't care if Jiang Ni
disobeys you in the future.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
You're an interesting girl.

68
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,560
Xu Xiao is lucky to have you two

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,900
as his children.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,600
I also think so.

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,575
Sister, why are you waiting for me here?

72
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:46,875
You knew we would come here?

73
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,480
Is there anyone

74
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,800
who doesn't know where you are?

75
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm not that ostentatious.

76
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,204
Let's talk

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,800
at my place.

78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,850
Senior.

79
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,475
Um.

80
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,639
Mr. Li.

81
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,550
I have some family affairs
to talk about with Xu Fengnian.

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,050
No one can stop you
if you want to listen.

83
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,360
Then I'm not going with you.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
You're not going...?

85
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,480
You'd better stay here.

86
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,125
Let's go.

87
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:07,725
Eh.

88
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,850
Let me borrow your Divine Token.

89
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,975
There are few people today.

90
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:56,340
Today is the triennial examination.

91
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,600
They are not in the school now.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,950
The examination is not in the school?

93
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,399
My class

94
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,680
will be tested on geomantic omen today.

95
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:03,199
They're going to Mount Difei

96
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,720
to study the terrain

97
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,680
and find the auspicious locations.

98
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,625
Why didn't you go with them?

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,879
I don't need to be tested.

100
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:08,800
Why?

101
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:11,279
Wang Jijiu who taught this class

102
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,275
once had a geomantic-omen match with me

103
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:14,900
and he lost to me three times.

104
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,000
Then I don't need
to take the test anymore.

105
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,759
You defeated your teacher?

106
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,279
He took me as his teacher.

107
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,900
What did the academy say?

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,519
They're used to it.

109
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,825
What do you mean?

110
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:28,079
Chess, poetry, scripture,

111
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,120
calligraphy and painting,
and incantation,

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
the teachers of these classes
all lost to me.

113
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,399
Recently,

114
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,100
I've been teaching these classes.

115
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,879
That's why these students
are so afraid of you?

116
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,750
In this case,

117
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,700
they should also call me teacher.

118
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:43,875
You even beat your teachers.

119
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,000
Sister.

120
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:46,600
There is no one else like you.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,875
I'm no match for you.

122
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,279
You come all the way
to Wudi City to die.

123
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:52,675
Old Huang's sword box is in Wudi.

124
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,550
Your Highness, there you are.

125
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,959
Who is this?

126
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,240
You've had a long journey.

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm your brother-in-law.

128
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,025
He is not.

129
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,040
Not for now,

130
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,360
but I will be one day.

131
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:08,959
Hold on.

132
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:19,040
Your Highness, is it your first time
to visit Shangyin Academy?

133
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,100
I've never been here before.

134
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,625
I'll show you around sometime!

135
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,399
There are many schools
at Shangyin Academy,

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,800
and there are
a couple of interesting places.

137
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,875
I'll leave soon.

138
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,720
What a pity.

139
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,050
Tell me in advance next time.

140
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:41,625
Eh.

141
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,350
The left side.

142
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't be eager to kill me.

143
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:53,879
Let's get acquainted with each other.

144
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,500
We can get acquainted after I kill you!

145
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,560
Your Highness, please don't mind.

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,639
If we keep chatting,

147
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,820
your brother-in-law will be dead.

148
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,750
I understand.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,970
What's your name?

150
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,150
Zhao Kai.

151
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,225
Maybe we will meet again.

152
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,040
Another guy with the surname of Zhao.

153
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,575
Let's go.

154
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:22,759
Sister.

155
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,175
He is kind of interesting.

156
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,450
Forget what I said.

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,450
I was in a hurry

158
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,900
to catch up with Xu Fengnian
in Shangyin Academy.

159
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:59,300
It's faster indeed to go by water.

160
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:00,750
Where is he?

161
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,050
He is heading for his sister's place.

162
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,679
There's no one else around him.

163
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,080
Don't you want to kill him?

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,075
It's a good time.

165
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,750
I can't do it here.

166
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,525
It's just an academy.

167
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,440
If I kill him here,

168
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,625
I'll ruin my reputation.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,975
Then,

170
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,759
what's the point of sounding him out?

171
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,159
This is the safest place,

172
00:09:21,475 --> 00:09:22,759
and this is the only place

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,240
where Li Chungang may not be with him.

174
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,200
Keep an eye on Xu Fengnian.

175
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,399
It would be the best
if you can hear what he says.

176
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,175
If you can't,

177
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:31,480
it's okay.

178
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,125
What about you?

179
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm going to see Li Chungang.

180
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,159
Come in.

181
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:31,900
Senior.

182
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,279
Doesn't Xu Fengnian ask you

183
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,700
to rest in the ship?

184
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,205
Feng City Lyupao

185
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:38,030
still has something left in this world.

186
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,650
Who taught you to say that?

187
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,000
Someone wants to see you.

188
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,279
Where is that person?

189
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,840
Right behind the house on the street.

190
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,480
Does Xu Fengnian

191
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,000
know it?

192
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:18,000
Sword God Li, your name
reverberates like thunder.

193
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:19,775
It's my luck

194
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,480
to meet you today.

195
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,025
I was wondering

196
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,625
if I should

197
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,550
start with some small talk

198
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,879
to show my politeness

199
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,525
when I see you.

200
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,919
Later I realized it's unnecessary.

201
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,559
I'd better

202
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,575
tell you my intention directly

203
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,675
and be frank with you.

204
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,075
Go on.

205
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:41,300
I want to kill Xu Fengnian.

206
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,279
There are a lot of people
who want to kill him.

207
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200
But no one can kill him with you around.

208
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,975
That's why you are here to kill me?

209
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,320
I'm not

210
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,769
that overconfident.

211
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,320
Since I knew

212
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,975
you've been escorting Xu Fengnian
to the east,

213
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,325
I've read many stories about you.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,960
Did you kill

215
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,759
Feng City Lyupao yourself?

216
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,300
Everyone knows it.

217
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,325
But I think you didn't want to kill her.

218
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,919
If I'm guessing it right,

219
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,120
this is the reason

220
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:18,320
why you had lived
in seclusion for years.

221
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,350
Which old man told you that?

222
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:23,245
Senior.

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,525
I don't know

224
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,120
what Xu Xiao offered you

225
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,039
that makes you protect Xu Fengnian,

226
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,080
but I think I can also make an offer.

227
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,519
I hope you can

228
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,825
give me a chance to kill Xu Fengnian.

229
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:39,200
You know what,

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,720
although Feng City Lyupao died,

231
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,879
there are still disciples

232
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,440
of her sect

233
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,960
living in the world.

234
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,600
It's a small sect now.

235
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,080
It has been a rocky time for them.

236
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:56,919
This sect

237
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:00,200
is her only existing inheritance.

238
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,850
I guess

239
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,120
probably you want to know

240
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,200
where the sect is

241
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,525
and who

242
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,000
they are.

243
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,000
If I don't agree,

244
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,399
you will kill them all.

245
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:16,475
Senior, it's not a threat.

246
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,100
Whether you agree or not,

247
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:28,025
I'll still give it to you.

248
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,275
You took a lot of effort to find it.

249
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:33,600
Now you just give it to me?

250
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,500
This is my sincerity.

251
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,100
Speaking of it,

252
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:41,075
Xu Fengnian is neither your relative
nor your friend.

253
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,120
Whatever Xu Xiao promised you,

254
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,100
I can also do it for you.

255
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:47,300
Whatever Xu Xiao can't do,

256
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,150
I'm willing to do it for you.

257
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,325
When are you going to kill Xu Fengnian?

258
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:00,400
In Wudi City.

259
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,600
It depends on

260
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,825
if you're willing
to give me that chance.

261
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,700
(To Sword God Li Only)

262
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,750
That's where you live?

263
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,500
Sister.

264
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
Aren't you proficient
in all kinds of musical instruments?

265
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,975
Why don't you hang a zither on the wall?

266
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:40,600
You can write or draw something.

267
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,279
Old Huang's sword box will always
be on the top of Wudi City's wall.

268
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:46,919
It doesn't make any difference
when you get it.

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,879
Turn the ship around

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,025
and you can go back to North Liang now.

271
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,250
I've waited long enough.

272
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,159
I don't want Old Huang to get anxious.

273
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,500
He's dead.

274
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,250
I'll get anxious.

275
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,759
You go back to North Liang.

276
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,025
I'll get the sword box for you.

277
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,575
Sister.

278
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,759
You can't.

279
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,399
Without Sword God Li escorting me,

280
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,400
I can't get it, either.

281
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,725
Do you know what the two
most conspicuous matters are

282
00:16:18,225 --> 00:16:20,200
right now?

283
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,250
One is Li Chungang's visit
to Wudi City again.

284
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,039
People all guess that he will

285
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:28,919
have a match with Wang Xianzhi again

286
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,519
and avenge his broken sword.

287
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,200
Senior has no grudge
against Wang Xianzhi.

288
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,075
He doesn't care about the broken sword.

289
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:36,575
Will this battle

290
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:37,919
take place?

291
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,175
It's possible.

292
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:43,750
Do you know what it means?

293
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:45,350
It means

294
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,450
it's probably a battle between
the two strongest people in the world.

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,840
There are rumors

296
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,279
that Deng Tai'e

297
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:51,879
is also heading for Wudi City.

298
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:53,375
Sword God Peach Blossom?

299
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,159
Wang Xianzhi called himself
the Second Best,

300
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,720
since then, no one has dared
to claim to be the best.

301
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,000
Wang Xianzhi.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,125
Cao Changqing.

303
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,325
(Deng Tai'e, Sword God Peach Blossom)
Deng Tai'e.

304
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:03,720
(Deng Tai'e, Sword God Peach Blossom)
I think

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,375
they are the three most powerful people
in the world.

306
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,200
Now,

307
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,775
Sword God Li reentered
the Realm of Immortal-on-Earth.

308
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,839
There is one more candidate
for the most powerful masters.

309
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,925
I definitely root for God Sword Li.

310
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,325
Why would Deng Tai'e head for Wudi City?

311
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,750
To watch the battle?

312
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,400
It's said that those
who reach the ultimate realm

313
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,039
would ascend to heaven.

314
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,400
I know.

315
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,720
It's said that Qi Xuanzhen,
the last master of Mount Longhu,

316
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:33,559
ascended to heaven in the end.

317
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:35,880
It's hard to tell

318
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,079
if it's true,

319
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,599
but there is one thing for sure.

320
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,559
If Li Chungang and Wang Xianzhi
go all out,

321
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:44,525
maybe

322
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,599
they could open the gate of heaven.

323
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,450
There would be a chance
to ascend to heaven.

324
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,850
Therefore, Deng Tai'e

325
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,000
wants to take this chance

326
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,525
to ascend to heaven?

327
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:55,900
At that time,

328
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,550
you will also be in Wudi City.

329
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:00,480
I kind of like here.

330
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
I'm not going to ascend to heaven.

331
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,279
If the three of them are in a melee,

332
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,599
who can guarantee your safety?

333
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,839
Even Li Chungang

334
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,825
may not be able to protect you.

335
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,400
It's like

336
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,200
soldiers charging in a battle,

337
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,880
and you are

338
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,625
just an ant on the way.

339
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,825
You can die in a blink of an eye

340
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,359
and your life
totally depends on providence.

341
00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:19,559
Even so,

342
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,275
are you still going to Wudi City?

343
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:24,575
Yes.

344
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,450
I know all the truth.

345
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,150
Sister.

346
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,475
There is a little problem.

347
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,279
I don't want to be a Lord of North Liang
like Xu Xiao.

348
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,775
Sister, don't worry.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,480
Whether it's Wang Xianzhi

350
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,600
or Deng Tai'e,

351
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,039
as long as I have God Sword Li,

352
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,375
I'll be fine.

353
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,775
If it was a few years ago,

354
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,125
I would tie you up
and bring you back to North Liang.

355
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:00,250
Sister.

356
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,975
You said

357
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,720
there are two conspicuous things

358
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,880
in the world.

359
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,079
What's the other one?

360
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,880
It's surely your Jiang Ni

361
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,700
and Cao Changqing going to West Shu.

362
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,000
Everyone knows it now?

363
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,559
The world is strife-torn.

364
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,825
There will be a great tumult.

365
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,225
The game

366
00:19:22,175 --> 00:19:23,875
has finally got here.

367
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,225
You've been prepared?

368
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,625
To be frank with you,

369
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,359
Cao Changqing's whereabouts

370
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,960
was spread

371
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,325
thanks to my effort.

372
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,519
Xu Fengnian.

373
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,700
What exactly do you want to do?

374
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,500
To make a big noise, of course.

375
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,923
(The Imperial Palace of Liyang,
the Capital)

376
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,200
We are in the Imperial Palace.

377
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,450
You are His Majesty's eunuch.

378
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:03,359
You don't need to kneel
to an alien official.

379
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,575
Get up.

380
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,119
Who is His Majesty

381
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,325
meeting now?

382
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,759
Prime Minister.

383
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,119
Well...

384
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:14,920
You shouldn't ask it.

385
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,200
Leave me.

386
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,450
Yes.

387
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,275
Eh!

388
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,359
Leave.

389
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:41,125
Yes.

390
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,750
Greetings to Prime Minister Zhang.

391
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,975
Ah.

392
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,425
His Majesty

393
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,960
was meeting you.

394
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:06,375
His Majesty is weary
of the national affairs.

395
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,960
Today,

396
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:10,465
I'm afraid he won't be able to see you.

397
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:21,600
Has His Majesty

398
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,775
read my memorial?

399
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:24,920
Yes.

400
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,250
He has.

401
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,425
Then he should know

402
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,964
how important it is.

403
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,160
Shu has been a dangerous place
since ancient times.

404
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,800
Most of the survivors of West Chu

405
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,755
sneaked into Shu

406
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:41,475
and raised weapons.

407
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,900
Although it's troublesome,

408
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,139
they are nothing but

409
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,900
insignificant diseases.

410
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,675
But now

411
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,920
Cao Changqing is heading for Shu

412
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:53,359
with the Princess of West Chu.

413
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,150
They want

414
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,025
to gather these people.

415
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:00,880
It's said

416
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,400
that they contacted

417
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:05,200
about ten groups of rebels.

418
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,150
It's going to be

419
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:09,050
a huge mess.

420
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:11,875
You're right.

421
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,119
Sister.

422
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,150
How about I wash your hair?

423
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:42,145
You've been doing this
since you were a kid.

424
00:23:42,425 --> 00:23:44,525
You think I can't beat you
when my hair is wet?

425
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,975
Sister.

426
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,160
You deliberately let
Jiang Ni and Cao Changqing

427
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,570
spread the news

428
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,575
and make a deal out of it

429
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,400
just to show the court?

430
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,025
I knew I couldn't keep it from you.

431
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,900
What's the reason?

432
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,925
How do you think
the court will handle it?

433
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:27,119
The most efficient way

434
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,175
to quell the chaos in West Shu

435
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,475
is to dispatch the North Liang Army
to the west.

436
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,050
No matter how chaotic Shu is,

437
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,000
there is no way to stop
the North Liang Cavalry.

438
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,550
But the court

439
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,625
would never take such a step.

440
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,600
The reason is simple.

441
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,839
We can't let the Xu family
plant a flag on the land of Shu.

442
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,950
If it happens one day,

443
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,400
West Shu

444
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:03,480
and North Liang

445
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,700
will join forces.

446
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:07,275
The world

447
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,175
will be no match for them.

448
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:14,350
You've been wary of North Liang.

449
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,039
Of course, you won't let that happen.

450
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:20,475
Therefore,

451
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,720
the safest way

452
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,875
is to transfer Gu Jiantang
from the capital to the west.

453
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,975
Among the four grand generals,

454
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:32,800
except for Xu Xiao,

455
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,875
there is only Gu Jiantang left.

456
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,920
Gu Jiantang has been trapped
in the capital for years.

457
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,759
If he goes to the west,

458
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,039
your Jiang Ni won't last long.

459
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,125
Do you think it could be him?

460
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:48,759
If he leaves the capital,

461
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:50,775
it's like releasing a dragon
back to the sea

462
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,650
and a tiger back to the forest.

463
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,640
Our emperor

464
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,720
doesn't have the guts.

465
00:26:05,975 --> 00:26:07,525
In an unusual situation,

466
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,720
we must take unusual actions.

467
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,559
Let's think in a different way.

468
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:14,600
If Gu Jiantang

469
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:15,920
can lead the troops,

470
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:17,875
the most restless place

471
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,160
is not the capital,

472
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:21,150
but North Liang.

473
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:25,700
General Gu fell ill.

474
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,425
What illness?

475
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,450
It's said

476
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,100
that he caught a cold.

477
00:26:37,775 --> 00:26:39,039
Caught a cold?

478
00:26:43,575 --> 00:26:47,200
The man who excels at the blade
could also catch a cold.

479
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,025
At this moment,

480
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,725
he only wants to protect himself.

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,550
What does His Majesty say?

482
00:26:58,675 --> 00:26:59,600
He ordered to send him medicine

483
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,825
and let him recuperate.

484
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,050
Fine.

485
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,600
Forget about Gu Jiantang.

486
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,720
There is one more person in my memorial

487
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,525
who can be used.

488
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,375
If we dispatch this person,

489
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,839
I'm sure we can
pacify the rebels in Shu.

490
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
More importantly,

491
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,119
with his talent,

492
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,160
he might be able

493
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,119
to change the situation of North Liang.

494
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,375
(Xu)

495
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:45,000
(Yinma River, North Liang)

496
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,400
Report!

497
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:01,450
General.

498
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,375
(To Chen Zhibao Only)

499
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,279
General Chen.

500
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,680
There are rebels in West Shu
invading the borders.

501
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:14,960
I think

502
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,920
the court should send you

503
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,975
to Shu to quell the chaos.

504
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,825
If you volunteer to take this mission,

505
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,640
I will recommend you in the court

506
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,450
to be the second lord

507
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,800
not born in the royal family.

508
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,279
You will no longer be held in check

509
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,175
by the Lord of North Liang.

510
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,825
Sincerely,

511
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,000
Zhang Julu.

512
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,675
(Xu)

513
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,599
Chen Zhibao

514
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,559
is respected in the army.

515
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,960
His prestige is high.

516
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,849
He is the second most powerful man
in the North Liang Army indeed.

517
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,650
If he is made a lord

518
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,240
and ordered to lead his troops

519
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,200
to quell the chaos in Shu,

520
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,039
the North Liang Army

521
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:29,400
may fall apart

522
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,799
and collapse from inside.

523
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:38,275
His Majesty also praised

524
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,050
your sophisticated strategy.

525
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,839
In that case,

526
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:44,079
His Majesty should issue an order
as soon as possible.

527
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,240
No matter how North Liang reacts,

528
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,575
the army

529
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:49,825
will be disturbed.

530
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just His Majesty has some concerns.

531
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,600
What are the concerns?

532
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,275
Xu Xiao is still alive.

533
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:05,240
Chen Zhibao

534
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:07,119
may not dare to take the order.

535
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,160
May not?

536
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,675
That's

537
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,825
his concern?

538
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,279
After all,

539
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:17,634
Chen Zhibao is Xu Xiao's adopted son.

540
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,150
Even a father and his biological son

541
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,775
can turn against each other,

542
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,200
not to mention an adopted son.

Grand General!

555
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,550
Grand General is back!

556
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,327
- Grand General!
- Grand General!

557
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:15,250
- Grand General is back!
- Yes.

558
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:15,825
Grand General!

559
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:16,500
I just came back

560
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,550
and ran into such a lively occasion.

561
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:21,700
What are you doing here?

562
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,160
Drilling!

563
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:24,175
Drilling?

564
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:24,720
Yes.

565
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,480
The detachment of Chihou Battalion
entered the woods

566
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,350
and started to fight.

567
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:28,880
There are also other means
of competition

568
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,875
in the woods,

569
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,160
and this is one of them.

570
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:31,815
Oh.

571
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,825
What's the prize?

572
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:34,799
Winners eat meat!

573
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:37,880
Grand General is back.

574
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,275
He is in the woods now.

575
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,325
Should we go to greet him?

576
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Don't stop! Continue!

577
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,775
Come on!

578
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:57,440
Grand General.

579
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,650
Put it down.

580
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,875
You have few people.

581
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,559
You'll lose without my help.

582
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,160
The situation on the battlefield
changes quickly.

583
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,720
It's the destiny whether we have
more people or fewer people.

584
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:06,359
Did Chen Zhibao

585
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,200
come up with this method
of training soldiers?

586
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,775
Yes.

587
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:13,200
Where's that boy?

588
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,575
He is watching the whole situation
from the tower.

589
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,100
All right, go on!

590
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,750
Continue!

591
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:20,544
Yes!

592
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,075
What is he doing up there?

593
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,039
The land of North Liang
still belongs to the Xu family.

594
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,119
His Majesty

595
00:33:06,225 --> 00:33:08,759
wants to use your strategy

596
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,750
after Xu Xiao dies.

597
00:33:11,175 --> 00:33:13,799
Then we will let Chen Zhibao
and Xu Fengnian

598
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,000
fight with each other.

599
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,350
What about now?

600
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:22,250
We need someone to lead the troops
to quell the chaos in Shu.

601
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,640
It has been suggested

602
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,759
not to use an army

603
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,575
given the circumstances.

604
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,799
Shu has always been chaotic.

605
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:36,000
The cause

606
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,300
of our problem right now

607
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,025
is the Princess of West Chu.

608
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,450
If the Princess of West Chu dies,

609
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,125
those people

610
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,350
would still be ill-organized.

611
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,575
Assassination.

612
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:53,319
Yes.

613
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:56,079
Find someone to kill
the Princess of West Chu,

614
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,599
then

615
00:33:57,599 --> 00:33:59,250
we can mediate

616
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,079
and clear the mess.

617
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,175
Cao Changqing is by her side.

618
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,750
How to kill her?

619
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:07,599
How?

620
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:09,519
I don't know, either.

621
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,800
Who came up with this idea?

622
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,525
Not me.

623
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Where is Han Diaosi?

624
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,100
Han Diaosi?

625
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:35,000
No matter how the court
handles the mess caused by Jiang Ni,

626
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,920
what about you?

627
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:39,880
What are you trying to get out of this?

628
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,975
What worries His Majesty most

629
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,760
is the possibility

630
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,800
of another North Liang in the world.

631
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,250
Therefore,

632
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,200
there is only one way

633
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:51,944
to deal with Jiang Ni.

634
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:56,239
People's minds change quickly,
and you are far away from the court.

635
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:58,519
How can you be so sure

636
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,200
about the countermeasures of the court?

637
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,275
Do you have a spy

638
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,119
in the capital?

639
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,500
No.

640
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,320
This is too important to go wrong.

641
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:09,480
That person

642
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,950
is definitely not a small potato.

643
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:12,719
It's not a spy,

644
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,450
but your accomplice.

645
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:19,000
I can't hide anything from you.

646
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,320
There are only a few people

647
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,400
who can influence
his Majesty's decisions.

648
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,025
You will figure it out

649
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,800
if you keep guessing.

650
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:29,550
Does Father know

651
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:30,880
that you have an accomplice now?

652
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,400
He doesn't know.

653
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,825
You even keep it from Father.

654
00:36:40,225 --> 00:36:41,320
There's something

655
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,725
I want to do myself.

656
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,225
So, going to Wudi City

657
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,360
is also part of your plan?

658
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,100
No.

659
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:54,950
I'm going to Wudi City
only for Old Huang's sake.

660
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:04,320
What can I do for you?

661
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,519
You don't want to ask
what I want to do?

662
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,159
With all the information,

663
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,119
I think

664
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,521
I know what it is.

665
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:21,650
I'm glad you're my sister.

666
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:34,119
It's the Xuanyuan Family's ship.

667
00:37:34,725 --> 00:37:36,025
It's mine now.

668
00:37:36,225 --> 00:37:37,880
It's nothing that you took their ship.

669
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,900
But don't take their daughter.

670
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,750
Sister.

671
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,100
I'm not interested in Xuanyuan Qingfeng.

672
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,639
You don't need to explain it to me.

673
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,719
As long as Jiang Ni trusts you.

674
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,719
I used to pretend to be a playboy.

675
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:49,400
It was fake. You know it.

676
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,975
Your Highness.

677
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,854
My Lady.

678
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,639
Where are other people?

679
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,875
In the barn.

680
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:55,480
I remember

681
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,199
Qingniao should be on duty today.

682
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,480
She changed shift with me.

683
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,719
Your maids

684
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,119
and I don't get along.

685
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,119
I think they are avoiding me.

686
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,550
That's not true.

687
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,320
Don't play dumb.

688
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,975
Sister Weixiong!

689
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,320
Who is that?

690
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,679
Sister Weixiong!

691
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm your brother you never met!

692
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,400
I found him on the road.

693
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,850
He said Xu Xiao is his father.

694
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,440
I finally meet you!

695
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,800
I have a family again!

696
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:30,070
- Brother!
- I'll walk you here.

697
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,800
Help! Brother!

698
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,700
- Be careful on the road.
- Sister Weixiong!

699
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,275
- Help!
- I know.

700
00:38:32,275 --> 00:38:33,119
I can't swim!

701
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,650
Brother! Brother!

702
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,189
Brother!

703
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:38,900
- Bodhisattva.
- Help!

704
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,575
Come here.

705
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:40,625
Brother!

706
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:43,880
Sister Weixiong!

707
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,050
Help! Sister Weixiong!

708
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:46,900
Brother!

709
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,559
Help!

710
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:52,550
I can't swim!

711
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,925
Brother!

712
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:56,480
What's this?

713
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:57,875
I found it on the road.

714
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,880
- A male and a female.
- Brother!

715
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,960
- The male is called Vajra.
- Brother!

716
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,840
I gave it to Huangman'er.

717
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,070
- This female...
- Help!

718
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,950
- ...is called Bodhisattva.
- Brother!

719
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,000
It's for you.

720
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,825
What's the use of it?

721
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,440
- The academy is all about righteousness.
- Brother!

722
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,920
- How boring it is to be alone.
- Help!

723
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,550
It won't be that quiet
with it around you.

724
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,693
Brother!

725
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:18,175
Brother!

726
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:19,275
I like quietness.

727
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,600
Sister Weixiong! Help!

728
00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:22,600
It likes you.

729
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,754
Sister Weixiong!

730
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,422
Sister Weixiong! Help!

731
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,780
I can't swim!

732
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,575
Okay.

733
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,125
Brother!

734
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:30,925
I'm leaving.

735
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:32,199
I'll wait for your news.

736
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,239
Give me a hug before you leave.

737
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,250
Help!

738
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,079
Brother!

739
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:46,900
Sister Weixiong!

740
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,575
Brother!

741
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,125
Help!

742
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,125
Is everything all right on the ship?

743
00:39:58,325 --> 00:39:59,079
Yes.

744
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,450
God Sword Li got off the ship.

745
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,239
- Where is he now?
- Brother!

746
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:03,840
He is back.

747
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:05,175
- Okay.
- Brother!

748
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,650
Then let's set sail.

749
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,840
Brother!

750
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,050
Should I get him out of the water?

751
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,159
Brother!

752
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,525
Help!

753
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,975
Brother!

754
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,525
Why?

755
00:40:22,525 --> 00:40:24,239
What did I say wrong?

756
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,000
Where is Brother Fengnian?

757
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,250
I'm going to see my brother.

758
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:32,175
Hold on.

759
00:40:32,175 --> 00:40:32,725
Ah?

760
00:40:35,025 --> 00:40:36,150
Let your clothes dry first.

761
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,225
Miss Shu, you are the best.

762
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,350
You're wrong about me.

763
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,599
I'm pretty bad.

764
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,325
Where have Xu Fengnian

765
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,679
and my wife been?

766
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:05,700
They were talking in the room.

767
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,400
I dare not get too close
and eavesdrop on them.

768
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,239
Did Xu Fengnian come out

769
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,900
when I was meeting God Sword Li?

770
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:12,125
Absolutely no.

771
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:13,159
That's good.

772
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:15,625
What did Li Chungang say?

773
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,025
I think he agreed.

774
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,525
He won't step in

775
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:22,175
when I kill Xu Fengnian.

776
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,650
How did you do that?

777
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,280
There is

778
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,025
always something

779
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,825
he cares about in the world.

780
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,719
As a Sword God,

781
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,150
he won't go back on his word.

782
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:41,920
If he doesn't step in,

783
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,975
I'll have a chance to kill Xu Fengnian.

784
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:45,825
Where will you do it?

785
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,050
Still in Wudi City.

786
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:50,725
When Li Chungang and Wang Xianzhi
are fighting,

787
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,775
we will kill Xu Fengnian.

788
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:55,199
Since Li Chungang promised
not to protect him,

789
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:57,575
why should we wait for them to fight?

790
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,825
There are twelve martial slaves
in Wudi City

791
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,119
who once lost to Wang Xianzhi.

792
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,250
They are top martial artists.

793
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,150
Now,

794
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,350
they volunteer to stay
and guard Wudi City.

795
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,920
When Xu Fengnian

796
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,400
gets on the top of the wall
to get the sword box,

797
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,175
the twelve martial slaves
will try to stop him.

798
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,960
At that time,

799
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,000
Xu Fengnian's guards
will have no time to protect him

800
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,900
and it's the perfect time to kill him.

801
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,575
I'm afraid the sword box

802
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:20,900
is just Xu Fengnian's excuse.

803
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,575
Does this young master

804
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:25,550
really dare to offend Wang Xianzhi?

805
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,975
I think

806
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,250
he dares.

807
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,375
A playboy.

808
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,000
People are wrong about him.

809
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:36,975
I think

810
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:39,000
he and I

811
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:41,700
are the same kind of people.

812
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:42,750
What kind of people?

813
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,075
We won't surrender to the destiny

814
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,200
and we are shrewd.

815
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:51,925
Come on.

816
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,840
