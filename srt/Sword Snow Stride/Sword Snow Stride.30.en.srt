1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 30=

7
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,350
Greetings, Your Highness.

8
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:47,250
Don't worry.

9
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,275
My disciple will be right back.

10
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,475
Your Highness,

11
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,050
what are you doing?

12
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:01,400
Thank you for taking care of my brother.

13
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,860
Didn't I tell you?

14
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,050
He's my disciple
and I should take care of him.

15
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,175
Senior.

16
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:07,830
Ah?

17
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,575
Mount Longhu and Mount Hui

18
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:11,000
are only separated by a river.

19
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,300
You must be familiar
with the Xuanyuan Family, aren't you?

20
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,275
I know a little bit.

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,550
Why?

22
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,900
He wants to draw the Xuanyuan Family
over to his side.

23
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,780
The Xuanyuan Family
is an influential clan.

24
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,725
Besides,

25
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,775
Old Ancestor Xuanyuan Dapan
of the Celestial Realm

26
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,500
won't easily work
for North Liang, will he?

27
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,140
Take it easy.

28
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:33,450
Let's just have a talk.

29
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:34,425
Oh.

30
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,925
About what?

31
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,525
About interesting stories
of the Xuanyuan Family.

32
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,300
There are some.

33
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Tell me about them.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,780
Why do you want to know the stories?

35
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:45,580
I'm going back to Shu soon.

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,820
Maybe they'll be helpful.

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,175
You just want to gossip.

38
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,020
You just don't understand.

39
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,950
Shu?

40
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,225
Why are you going back there?

41
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,620
She's the princess of West Chu.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,725
Oh. Ah?

43
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,100
Never mind.

44
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Let's continue.

45
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,385
Your Highness,

46
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm at least an Arch-Taoist
of Mount Longhu.

47
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,740
But you exposed her identity to me?

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,540
It doesn't matter.

49
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,820
You're Huangman'er's master.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,580
We're a family.

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,225
Don't you fear that I'll arrest her?

52
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:09,900
Go ahead.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,575
What?

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,820
Cao Changqing is following her.

55
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,375
Invincible Cao Changqing?

56
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:16,140
Yes.

57
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,575
My Mr. Chess Master.

58
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,300
Very well.

59
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:23,260
Let's get back to the interesting stories
of the Xuanyuan Family.

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,075
All right.

61
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,250
(The Xuanyuan Family, Mount Hui)

62
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:36,800
(Xuanyuan Jingcheng's wife)

63
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,200
Mother.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,225
Why are you back?

65
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,325
Old Ancestor summoned me.

66
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,075
He asked me to enter Wending Pavilion.

67
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,075
If I get the instruction from him,

68
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,220
I may get back

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,625
the power of our family.

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,200
You don't need to tell me anything

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,620
about the Xuanyuan Family.

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,625
If one day

73
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,050
you take control of the Xuanyuan Family,

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,700
remember to expel me.

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,800
But you and Father are a couple.

76
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,660
Have I ever begged you before?

77
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,850
Fine.

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,660
You shouldn't have come back.

79
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:48,750
What makes you say that?

80
00:04:48,975 --> 00:04:50,260
You've always been looked down upon

81
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,450
and you don't dare
to fight for anything.

82
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,490
I don't care.

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,980
But now I've got a chance

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,500
to get back what we deserve.

85
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,700
Why are you trying to stop me?

86
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,550
Xuanyuan Dapan

87
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,675
doesn't mean to instruct you.

88
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:01,620
Then why did he

89
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,150
summon me to Wending Pavilion?

90
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,575
For a chat?

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,875
He wants to marry you

92
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:16,825
for better martial arts.

93
00:05:23,975 --> 00:05:25,300
Are you out of your mind?

94
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,060
He's Old Ancestor of our family.

95
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,400
He's a forefather.

96
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:30,925
Xuanyuan Dapan

97
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,860
isn't one of our family.

98
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,500
Xuanyuan Dapan isn't
one of the Xuanyuan Family?

99
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,850
How's that possible?

100
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
It's true.

101
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,275
He used to be a retainer
of the Xuanyuan Family.

102
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,855
Later, he was a son-in-law by adoption.

103
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,650
But isn't Xuanyuan his family name?

104
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,100
Whoever is adopted
should use their family name.

105
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,225
And then he even became their ancestor?

106
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,800
He reached the Celestial Realm, anyway.

107
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,375
His adoption is always kept secret.

108
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,550
Only old men like us are aware.

109
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,350
So, the Xuanyuan Family

110
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,580
are his offspring?

111
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:12,660
No.

112
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,340
None of his offspring

113
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,825
was alive

114
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,250
after years of martial struggle.

115
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,375
They all died?

116
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,050
Mm.

117
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,100
The Xuanyuan Family
was watching out for him.

118
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,925
At that time,

119
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,375
he didn't reach the Celestial Realm yet.

120
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,300
He had to bear it.

121
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,740
Then why is he still staying
in the Xuanyuan Family?

122
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,425
It's indeed weird.

123
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,750
His offspring died.

124
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,620
But he has been staying

125
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,900
in the Xuanyuan Family willingly

126
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,975
as Old Ancestor.

127
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,380
I'm afraid he indeed treats himself

128
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,125
as a member

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,725
of the Xuanyuan Family.

130
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:42,400
Right?

131
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,425
He's taking revenge?

132
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,475
Life is full of unpredictability.

133
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,215
Who would expect him

134
00:06:50,425 --> 00:06:52,175
to reach the Celestial Realm

135
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,700
and even become
the ancestor of our family?

136
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,460
He was injured in his early years

137
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
so that he didn't have a child.

138
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,025
Now, in the Celestial Realm,

139
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,125
he has the chance

140
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,300
to have his own children.

141
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,900
Why did he pick me?

142
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,950
He's been waiting for this day.

143
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,175
He wants our family

144
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,275
to be his real lineage.

145
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,860
But he's so old.

146
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,650
He hates lineal descendants
of our family.

147
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,350
How's that possible?

148
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,300
Is that true?

149
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,580
This is a secret,

150
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,260
but your uncles know that.

151
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,025
Then why did they ask me to come back?

152
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,800
I'm their niece.

153
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,580
Why didn't you tell Yuan Tingshan

154
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,725
so that I would know the truth?

155
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,800
I told him.

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,875
What?

157
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,780
My father doesn't want me
to go back home.

158
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,380
There must be a reason, isn't there?

159
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,675
He didn't give me a reason.

160
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,100
I explained everything to him

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,375
so that he would tell you the truth.

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,875
Why did he keep it from me?

163
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,400
Your family

164
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,100
is quite filthy.

165
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,125
I'm leaving.

166
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,625
Don't worry.

167
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,000
I won't let Qingfeng get hurt.

168
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:35,660
What do you think you can do?

169
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,800
(Mount Hui)

170
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,625
Uncle Jingyi.

171
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,950
(Mount Hui)

172
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,150
Tomorrow, Old Ancestor will see you.

173
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You mustn't leave.

174
00:09:05,475 --> 00:09:07,275
You should know what he's going to do.

175
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,700
His order

176
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,780
cannot be disobeyed.

177
00:09:10,225 --> 00:09:12,000
But I'm your niece.

178
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,275
Our family needs a man
of the Celestial Realm.

179
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,625
Without him,

180
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,380
we would no longer be powerful.

181
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,550
So, you're sacrificing me?

182
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:23,300
After he marries you,

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,600
he'll indeed be connected
with our family.

184
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:30,075
Our clan has been inherited
for centuries.

185
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,000
It can't be ruined.

186
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,300
For our family,

187
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,525
you mustn't leave.

188
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:38,200
When I'm here,

189
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,025
you're not able to leave, either.

190
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,375
You knew everything?

191
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,225
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,900
You had to come back,

193
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,820
or I would be a retainer all my life.

194
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,250
After I enter Wending Pavilion,
you can be a member of my family?

195
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,750
After I marry you,

196
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,350
I can be one of your family.

197
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,275
I'll marry you

198
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,620
and change my family name.

199
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:26,860
Xuanyuan Dapan

200
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,540
is a master of the Celestial Realm.

201
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:31,225
He won't marry
someone else's wife, will he?

202
00:10:31,525 --> 00:10:32,600
Yuan Tingshan!

203
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,875
Be patient.

204
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,980
I know you don't like me.

205
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:38,180
It doesn't matter.

206
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,750
After we get married,

207
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,000
you can like anyone you want.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,525
I won't sleep with you.

209
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,300
What exactly do you want?

210
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,750
A chance.

211
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:52,950
A man like me

212
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,660
has been living a humble life

213
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,500
and I've only learned
the second-rate artistry of blade.

214
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,820
The lost martial arts

215
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,940
have always been kept

216
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,780
by famous clans like yours.

217
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,060
I won't have access to Wending Pavilion

218
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,260
or make it to the top

219
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,830
unless I'm one of the Xuanyuan Family.

220
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:10,180
Xuanyuan Dapan reached
the Celestial Realm.

221
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,980
Why can't I make it?

222
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,175
Funny.

223
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:15,450
You think I'll marry you?

224
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,725
Think about it carefully.

225
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:20,500
You will

226
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,250
marry a dying widower

227
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,100
or

228
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,020
marry me to get away.

229
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,475
You have only one night.

230
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:30,875
Don't think for too long.

231
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,475
I heard your daughter tried to leave.

232
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,225
Jingyi stopped her, didn't he?

233
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,000
Go persuade her when you have time.

234
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,850
We've raised her for years.

235
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,700
It's time for her to repay us.

236
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Xuanyuan Dapan

237
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,500
will not stop.

238
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,525
I know that.

239
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,580
He wants

240
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,700
to enjoy all girls of this generation.

241
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,340
And you'll let him be?

242
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,125
He's in the Celestial Realm.

243
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,925
With him,

244
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,525
our family will always be prestigious.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,150
When he's satisfied,

246
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,750
he's still Old Ancestor of our family.

247
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,050
And our family

248
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,650
can be inheritable.

249
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:52,950
Without righteousness,

250
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,425
what's the point of inheritance?

251
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,850
Who told you that?

252
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,850
I read about it from books.

253
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,425
Can you reach the Celestial Realm
by reading books?

254
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,625
Jingcheng,

255
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,475
after Qingfeng marries Old Ancestor,

256
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,075
you'll have no offspring.

257
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,585
Why not

258
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,580
hand your connections over to me?

259
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,425
I'm more humane than Jingyi.

260
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,020
I won't embarrass you.

261
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,400
You've been waiting for this day,
haven't you?

262
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,625
Don't put me on the spot.

263
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,375
If you don't understand,

264
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,900
I can go talk with your wife.

265
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,425
She always looks down on you.

266
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,460
Over the years,

267
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,620
she has been having a hard time.

268
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,740
Actually,

269
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:23,000
one can also reach the Celestial Realm

270
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:27,220
by reading books.

271
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,325
Fengnian, hawthorns for you.

272
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,500
Only these hawthorns are ripe.

273
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,125
He has stayed

274
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,225
by the hawthorn tree every day,

275
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,075
waiting to pick some for you.

276
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,575
It tastes great.

277
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,800
Thank you, Huangman'er.

278
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,400
Eh?

279
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,980
What?

280
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,180
Interesting.

281
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,500
(Great Prestige, Gold Path)

282
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,675
(Eternal Longevity, Cultivate for Eternity,
Unity of Everything)

283
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,925
(Xiaoyao Temple)

284
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,850
Xu Xiao's son?

285
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:30,540
That's me.

286
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,850
You two indeed look alike.

287
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
A little bit in appearance,

288
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:38,350
but a lot in spirit.

289
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,260
Who are you?

290
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,825
Xuanyuan Jingcheng.

291
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,800
Qingfeng's father.

292
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,260
You don't do martial arts, do you?

293
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,175
Why could you fly to me?

294
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,875
I have a portrait.

295
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,725
You look like the person in it.

296
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:03,875
I don't understand.

297
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,525
The person in the portrait

298
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,550
is closely linked with you.

299
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,975
You indeed look like her

300
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:11,775
in appearance.

301
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,725
Who

302
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,450
are you talking about?

303
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,650
You look as graceful

304
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,650
as your mother used to be.

305
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,250
Shut up!

306
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,450
Uncle Jingyi has blocked all the ways
away from Mount Hui.

307
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,550
Now that they want to give you
to Old Ancestor,

308
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,660
they won't let you leave.

309
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,820
I was dubious

310
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,140
of what Father told me.

311
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,980
But now I know it's true.

312
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,575
Mother,

313
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,350
do you have a way to leave?

314
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,775
If I did,

315
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:08,435
I would have left already.

316
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,515
So, we don't have a way out?

317
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,850
Xu Fengnian sent you
back to Mount Hui?

318
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,400
Are you saying

319
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,350
that I should ask him for help?

320
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,550
How can he interfere
with our family business?

321
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:28,700
If he didn't want to interfere,

322
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,975
he wouldn't have given you a ride.

323
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,250
I can't even leave Mount Hui.

324
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
How can I beg him for help?

325
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,450
You don't help your brother?

326
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,150
I don't need to.

327
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,850
That uncle doesn't mean to fight.

328
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,620
How do you know?

329
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,750
I just know.

330
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,700
So much for this.

331
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,260
God of Sword, you've got an heir

332
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,660
for your Snakes in Sleeves.

333
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,975
He's using it poorly.

334
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,700
He's the right person.

335
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:21,540
His Highness isn't talented enough

336
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,900
for the moment.

337
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,625
But given some time,

338
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:27,300
he'll inherit your great martial arts.

339
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:27,975
Come on.

340
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:28,980
He isn't as talented

341
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,500
as his little brother.

342
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,700
This boy is born in the Diamond Realm.

343
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,050
He's generally beyond compare.

344
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,600
Now that you're not here for a fight,

345
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,275
stop gossiping about my mother.

346
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,675
I wasn't gossiping.

347
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,940
I was telling the truth.

348
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,780
You indeed look like your mother.

349
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,850
What does it have to do
with your portrait?

350
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,900
(Jianjia House)

351
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,125
To be honest,

352
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,780
the person in the portrait

353
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,800
is your mother.

354
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,350
You met my mother?

355
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,700
My wife did.

356
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,875
She portrayed your mother.

357
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,475
Wait.

358
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:12,675
Why did your wife

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,060
portray my mother?

360
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,600
When my wife met your mother,

361
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,525
your mother was disguised as a man.

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,500
Your wife never knew that?

363
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,350
When she got to know the truth,

364
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
she had fallen in love

365
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,740
with your mother.

366
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,180
But she knew they couldn't be together.

367
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,740
So, she portrayed the person
in her memory.

368
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,820
To her,

369
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,950
she only wanted

370
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,180
to remember

371
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,620
the young swordsman who attracted her.

372
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,740
So, she only loves

373
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,580
the person in the portrait.

374
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,150
What do you want?

375
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,125
Xuanyuan Dapan wants to marry Qingfeng.

376
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,175
How old

377
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,450
is Xuanyuan Dapan?

378
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,700
Nearly a hundred years old.

379
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,740
Shame on him!

380
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,475
If people know about it,

381
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:12,300
our family will be laughed at.

382
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,050
Xuanyuan Dapan is
in the Celestial Realm.

383
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,100
No one dares to laugh at him.

384
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,700
So, great martial arts

385
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,900
can make people
ignore the sense of shame?

386
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,275
That's right.

387
00:22:20,475 --> 00:22:21,100
So?

388
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,225
Could you leave Mount Hui

389
00:22:22,525 --> 00:22:23,985
and take my message to Xu Fengnian?

390
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:24,725
No.

391
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:25,940
I haven't told you what message it is.

392
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,225
Even if North Liang is interested
in the Xuanyuan Family,

393
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:29,875
why must they work with you?

394
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,225
They could talk to your uncles.

395
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,820
Will Xu Fengnian really offend
a master of the Celestial Realm

396
00:22:34,075 --> 00:22:36,425
just for you?

397
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:38,000
You have only one option.

398
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,825
Marry me tonight

399
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,580
and make me one of your family.

400
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,660
You've been waiting for this day, right?

401
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,625
On Mount Hui,

402
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,625
no one dares to marry you,

403
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,425
but me.

404
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,150
After tonight,

405
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,525
you'll have no more chance.

406
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,150
Fine!

407
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,925
Let's get married!

408
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,850
Let's do it tonight.

409
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,100
We would be stopped if we did it now.

410
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,940
Xuanyuan Dapan

411
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,925
wants all descendants
of the Xuanyuan Family

412
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,750
to be his.

413
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,140
So, what he wants

414
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,650
is more than marrying your daughter.

415
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:40,300
Why can such a man
be a master of the Celestial Realm?

416
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,925
The level of martial arts
has nothing to do with morality.

417
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,375
Mr. Jingcheng,

418
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,925
you didn't only come

419
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,550
to tell us about the scandal

420
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,800
in your family, did you?

421
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm going to kill Xuanyuan Dapan.

422
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,025
But he's a master
of the Celestial Realm.

423
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,140
In the past twenty years or so,

424
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,150
I've learned all the secret martial arts
in Wending Pavilion.

425
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,140
Are you sure you can kill him?

426
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,740
In five years, I'll be able to kill him.

427
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,340
But now I'm running out of time.

428
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,425
When I fight him,

429
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,575
no matter I win or lose,

430
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:24,875
I'll die.

431
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm not afraid of death.

432
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,600
But I worry

433
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,220
about some people.

434
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,580
Your wife and daughter.

435
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,000
After I die,

436
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,950
I don't know

437
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,425
how they'll end up.

438
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,675
Luckily, you've come.

439
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,175
In this world,

440
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,860
no one can save them, but you.

441
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,900
Why must I save them?

442
00:24:57,725 --> 00:24:59,275
After Xuanyuan Dapan dies,

443
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:01,425
my daughter will take over Mount Hui.

444
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,150
But she's too young.

445
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,875
She needs time
to build up a stable foundation.

446
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,275
During that,

447
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,400
you can use her as a puppet

448
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:13,775
and take control of the Xuanyuan Family.

449
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,680
From then on, Mount Hui

450
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,100
will fall under the control
of North Liang.

451
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,550
Who told you that we wanted Mount Hui?

452
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,650
What worries you, Your Highness?

453
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,550
You have two brothers.

454
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,975
One of them, Xuanyuan Jingxuan,

455
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,835
has controlled Mount Hui for years.

456
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,575
But your daughter has no supporters.

457
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,235
Even if I support her,

458
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,725
she might not defeat them.

459
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,540
You made sense.

460
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,825
I understand what you're talking about.

461
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,650
You don't want to marry your daughter
to Xuanyuan Dapan.

462
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,450
You don't need to kill him.

463
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,780
Bring your daughter here

464
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
and marry her to His Highness.

465
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,900
It's a perfect plan.

466
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,650
Isn't it?

467
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,025
Xuanyuan Dapan can get

468
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,500
whatever he wants.

469
00:25:55,925 --> 00:25:57,375
He doesn't care

470
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:58,500
even if Qingfeng is married
to someone else.

471
00:25:58,825 --> 00:25:59,525
How about this?

472
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:01,900
Come to our sect for shelter
with your family.

473
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,325
We're neighbors.

474
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,660
It's convenient

475
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,275
to help each other, isn't it?

476
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,475
We can't come to you for shelter.

477
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,750
Why?

478
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,100
When we take action,

479
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,800
we'll certainly keep your daughter safe.

480
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,975
You're too close to Mount Hui.

481
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,525
If you interfere,

482
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,150
our family

483
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,000
will never have our day.

484
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,925
Only North Liang can help you?

485
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,200
Yes.

486
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,200
What about your brothers?

487
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:29,350
I'll kill Xuanyuan Jingxuan first.

488
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,350
When?

489
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,725
Immediately.

490
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:36,875
In two hours,

491
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,525
I'll go to Hill Guniu

492
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:42,225
and have a life-and-death fight
against Xuanyuan Dapan.

493
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,725
Your Highness,

494
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,050
I invite you to go and watch it.

495
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,650
What if I don't go?

496
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,550
Your Highness,

497
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:02,800
you can decide the destiny of my family.

498
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,100
If he were really sincere,

499
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,540
he should have brought Xuanyuan Qingfeng

500
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,550
as the hostage.

501
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,425
There's no such thing as free lunch.

502
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,125
He only gave you the bait.

503
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,140
Xu Fengnian is Xu Xiao's son.

504
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,100
As long as he appears on Mount Hui

505
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,175
within two hours,

506
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,825
it's like a declaration

507
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,750
that he'll interfere
with the coup of the Xuanyuan Family.

508
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,380
By then, even if he wants
to step backward,

509
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,300
he can hardly do that.

510
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,660
But it's true

511
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,000
that there'll be a fight
in the Xuanyuan Family.

512
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,480
Why don't we just watch

513
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,200
and make a decision
after the fight is over?

514
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,475
If I don't appear on Mount Hui
within two hours,

515
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,660
I'll lose the chance
to control the Xuanyuan Family.

516
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,425
It'll be risky if you go.

517
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:55,775
It'll be regretful if you don't.

518
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,025
Huangman'er,

519
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,125
do you think I should go?

520
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:01,925
Do you want to go?

521
00:28:01,925 --> 00:28:02,775
I do.

522
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,250
I planned to go to Mount Hui long ago.

523
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,670
Now, the Xuanyuan Family is in chaos.

524
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,850
I want to see it personally.

525
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Now that you want it, do it.

526
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:15,875
Good point.

527
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,175
Now that I want it, I'll do it.

528
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,180
Let's go!

529
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,050
Your Highness. Your Highness.

530
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,375
This is our bowl.

531
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:27,225
A bowl

532
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,925
costs two coins.

533
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,150
Mother,

534
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,425
I'm getting married tonight.

535
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,540
You have no way out.

536
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,875
I'll kill myself
if the worst comes to the worst.

537
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,775
Do you want to die?

538
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,650
Uncle Jingxuan,

539
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,325
please don't force me.

540
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,540
After you marry Old Ancestor,

541
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,140
you can learn any martial arts you want.

542
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:58,800
But I don't want to marry him.

543
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:01,250
You're born in our family, anyway.

544
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:03,575
Sister-in-law,

545
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,940
do you know where my brother has gone?

546
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,660
It's not my concern.

547
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:09,375
Over the years,

548
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:10,850
I'm sorry to have you suffer

549
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,780
when living with my brother.

550
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,450
I guess

551
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,380
you know how I care for you.

552
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,275
Uncle Jingxuan...

553
00:29:17,275 --> 00:29:18,975
My nerd brother

554
00:29:18,975 --> 00:29:20,825
doesn't know how women feel.

555
00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:23,950
Women often feel lonely.

556
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,850
Am I right?

557
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,350
Sister-in-law!

558
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:28,850
Let go of her.

559
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't interfere with the elders!

560
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,375
Let go of my mother.

561
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:40,820
Don't hurt her!

562
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,550
Your Highness,

563
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,325
there are many retainers
in the Xuanyuan Family.

564
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:44,475
Now that you're going up Mount Hui,

565
00:29:44,475 --> 00:29:45,925
shall we bring Fengzi Battalion?

566
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:48,150
When I go there only for travel,
no matter how the fight ends up,

567
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,375
there's a turning back for me.

568
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
But if I took Fengzi Battalion,

569
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,740
it would be a different thing.

570
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,400
Then why didn't we take
Young Master Longxiang?

571
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,775
If we have to fight,
he can hardly control himself.

572
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,750
Ning Emei,

573
00:29:59,175 --> 00:30:01,000
how many people do you think we need

574
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:02,675
to wipe out this mountain?

575
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:05,625
We're strong enough already.

576
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:13,800
Respect your uncle.

577
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,225
Keep that in mind!

578
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:17,750
Sister-in-law,

579
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:19,425
let's continue.

580
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:24,460
You'd better think it all out.

581
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,400
According to Old Ancestor,

582
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,700
tomorrow, I'll officially be the master

583
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,900
of the Xuanyuan Family.

584
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,000
From tomorrow on,

585
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:33,780
I don't need to consider anything.

586
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,775
Leave.

587
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:39,800
If I leave now,

588
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,800
how can I still be your daughter?

589
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,425
If you keep fighting me,

590
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:50,660
I'll break your limbs

591
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,825
and send you
to Old Ancestor's room personally.

592
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,850
Why must you struggle?

593
00:31:12,175 --> 00:31:13,150
Wait!

594
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,460
If I survive,

595
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,300
I'll kill you!

596
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:16,475
Jingxuan.

597
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:21,575
Jingcheng?

598
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,425
You've been quick-tempered since little.

599
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:32,300
In some cases,

600
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,475
before everything is settled,

601
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,875
don't rush to judge.

602
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,260
What shall I wait for, then?

603
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,650
You?

604
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,925
Xuanyuan Dapan gave you the pill?

605
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,675
How do you know?

606
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:48,475
I can see that.

607
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,820
He gave me the pill
to enhance my strength.

608
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,325
Now I'm in the Void Realm.

609
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:55,875
I'm qualified

610
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:59,200
to be the master of our family.

611
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,925
Enhancing you forcibly

612
00:32:01,775 --> 00:32:03,800
will give you no experience.

613
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,775
It's harmful

614
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,675
to the development of your martial arts.

615
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,180
Should I thank you for reminding me?

616
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,750
Your impatience

617
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,300
will ruin our family.

618
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:19,500
So what?

619
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,075
Jingxuan,

620
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,250
if you leave Mount Hui

621
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,580
and our family immediately,

622
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,260
I'll keep you alive.

623
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,420
Over the years,

624
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,380
you don't even dare to enter this house.

625
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:39,860
Even if I break your daughter's limbs

626
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,180
and rape your wife

627
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,350
right in your face,

628
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,260
what can you do?

629
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,450
The whole clan

630
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,900
of Mount Hui

631
00:33:22,675 --> 00:33:23,775
is filthy.

632
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,425
It's kind of timely rain.

633
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,675
Let the rain

634
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,100
wash it up.

635
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,900
You're totally insane, I guess.

636
00:33:38,425 --> 00:33:39,620
How dare you...!

637
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,400
It's time

638
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:57,980
to change the clan's fate.

639
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:02,925
(Mount Hui)

640
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:03,750
Master Jingyi,

641
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,250
Master Jingxuan was seen
to go to Master Jingcheng's house

642
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,260
and got in an argument.

643
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,925
He's hopeless.

644
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,450
All he cares about is such crap.

645
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,625
Let's go have a look.

646
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,150
Master Jingyi.

647
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,750
Master Jingyi,

648
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,775
Xu Fengnian is coming up the mountain.

649
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:20,650
The patrolling retainer asked
if we should stop him.

650
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,650
Assemble our retainers.

651
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,330
Yes.

652
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,450
(Mount Hui)

653
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,980
So, you can do martial arts.

654
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:27,460
You've kept it from us for years.

655
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,675
I never keep it from anyone.

656
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:32,250
You just think I'm a loser

657
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,380
when I only read books.

658
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,020
Can you get genuine spirit by reading?

659
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,225
Something like that.

660
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:40,050
You're finally going to do something?

661
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,450
We can't build the new
unless we destroy the old.

662
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,740
Xuanyuan Dapan has led our clan

663
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,140
to the wrong path.

664
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:46,260
Today,

665
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,775
I'll set things right

666
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,725
and get our clan back on the right path.

667
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,525
How arrogant!

668
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,685
Speaking of martial arts,

669
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,820
you and Jingyi can't defeat me
even if you fight together.

670
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,150
Well, show me

671
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,250
how talented you can be.

672
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,550
You're in the Void Realm.

673
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,525
I'll kill you with the same power.

674
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,100
How's this possible?

675
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,450
You're in the Void Realm,
but you have a poor mental state.

676
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,325
What a waste of the Void Realm!

677
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,900
Jingxuan,

678
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,050
your punch

679
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,075
wasn't even as amazing
as Xu Fengnian's brandish of his blade.

680
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,225
Wait, Jingcheng.

681
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,875
I'll go tell Old Ancestor.

682
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,975
You should be

683
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,150
the master of the Xuanyuan Family.

684
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,780
I will kill Xuanyuan Dapan.

685
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,700
To prosper our family,

686
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,075
some people should be alive.

687
00:36:01,975 --> 00:36:03,525
I gave you a chance to make your choice.

688
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,580
Wait, Jingcheng.

689
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,975
I'm sorry.

690
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,580
I'll go tell Old Ancestor.

691
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,180
You should be the master of our family.

692
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:29,500
You should be the master.

693
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:43,450
He's dead?

694
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:22,100
(Mount Hui)

695
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,425
What a turbulent martial world!

696
00:37:30,475 --> 00:37:31,780
If you keep walking,

697
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,220
you'll reach our private mansions.

698
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,075
Your Highness, why are you coming here?

699
00:37:37,075 --> 00:37:39,260
How much further is it
from that old man's mansion?

700
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,400
It's not very far.

701
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,500
When we go up, we'll reach Guniujiang.

702
00:37:42,675 --> 00:37:44,250
There's a flatland,

703
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,300
known as Snowfield.

704
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,220
Xuanyuan Dapan lives there.

705
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,900
Let's go enjoy the scenery
of Snowfield Guniujiang.

706
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,620
Li Chungang?

707
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,380
Your Highness,

708
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,550
are you going to break into Mount Hui?

709
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,525
What makes you think so?

710
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,600
Guniujiang is where
our Old Ancestor resides.

711
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,950
No strangers are allowed in.

712
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,060
It's raining.

713
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:13,340
What?

714
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,580
Do you have an umbrella?

715
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:17,220
Lend it to me.

716
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,250
A jar of Danggui Wine
is sent to you every year.

717
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:24,750
Have you really not tasted any?

718
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,350
(Danggui Wine)

719
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,580
You finally dared to do something.

720
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:32,650
It tastes good.

721
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,225
You can have a taste.

722
00:38:35,275 --> 00:38:36,325
It's not that I didn't dare.

723
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,000
Our clan

724
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:40,325
(Danggui Wine)
indeed owed Xuanyuan Dapan.

725
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:43,350
He used to be a shield of Mount Hui.

726
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,620
But I didn't expect him
to want my daughter.

727
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,625
What?

728
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,275
I...

729
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,275
I came

730
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,475
to tell you something.

731
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,800
Xu Fengnian has arrived at the gate.

732
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:06,625
Master Jingyi and the retainers

733
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:07,800
are...

734
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,000
are in a stalemate with him.

735
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,250
I'm glad he has come.

736
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,325
Off you go.

737
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:12,625
Yes.

738
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,775
Bring Xu Fengnian to Guniujiang.

739
00:39:18,175 --> 00:39:20,125
I'll take care of the rest.

740
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,800
Xu Fengnian will fight Xuanyuan Dapan?

741
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:24,850
Qingfeng,

742
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,125
I'll leave your mother

743
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,225
to you.

744
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:35,075
(Danggui Wine)

745
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,300
Xuanyuan Jingcheng,

746
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,860
where are you going?

747
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,650
Guniujiang.

748
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:44,325
Snowfield.

749
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,875
As the saying goes,

750
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:47,150
we can't expect a better world

751
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,700
without cleaning our rooms first.

752
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,700
It's time

753
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,055
to clean our rooms.

754
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,500
You're going to fight him?

755
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,100
But he's in the Celestial Realm!

756
00:39:58,575 --> 00:39:59,900
I don't care.

757
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll let no one hurt my daughter.

758
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
I've never regretted

759
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,275
marrying you.

760
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,075
You can keep the umbrella,
Your Highness.

761
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,925
But please leave immediately.

762
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,350
Now that I want to enjoy the scenery,

763
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,250
I insist on seeing it.

764
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:56,250
Make way, please.

765
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,375
This isn't

766
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,650
North Liang.

767
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:00,785
Stop him.

768
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,550
Father is going to fight Old Ancestor.

769
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,800
Why has Xu Fengnian come?

770
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,660
Your father invited him
for you, of course.

771
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,900
For me?

772
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:28,460
If Xuanyuan Dapan dies,

773
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:30,550
you can't take over Mount Hui

774
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:32,580
unless you have supporters.

775
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,900
The premise is
that Xuanyuan Dapan is killed.

776
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,180
If he isn't killed,

777
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,050
you can leave with Xu Fengnian.

778
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,025
I'll take him to Guniujiang.

779
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:47,450
Mother,

780
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,900
you're not going there?

781
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:51,975
I'm not.

782
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,175
If Father really kills Xuanyuan Dapan,

783
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,800
don't you want to see that?

784
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,175
Get to your business.

785
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,475
Leave me alone.

786
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,460
(A hard life doesn't matter,)

787
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,950
(as long as my beloved one comes back.)

788
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:55,800
His Highness is going up the mountain.

789
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:57,175
Make way, please.
