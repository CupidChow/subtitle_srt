1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 20=

7
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,450
This one is available.

8
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,225
(Cuihua, swordswoman
of Sword Tomb of the Wu family)

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,840
Here.

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,560
Tastes great.

11
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:03,286
Cuihua.

12
00:02:03,286 --> 00:02:03,879
Mm?

13
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,079
Why does the pickled cabbage you made

14
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,519
taste so good?

15
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,425
Mm.

16
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,199
However,

17
00:02:11,725 --> 00:02:12,975
there's always pickled cabbage.

18
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:14,325
How about

19
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:15,450
another kind of vegetable?

20
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,960
I can only make pickled cabbage.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,840
That's brilliant enough.

22
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,360
You keep eating every day.

23
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,350
Didn't you say you would
bother Xu Fengnian?

24
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,080
The senior around him is too strong.

25
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm afraid I can't defeat him.

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,141
He scared you so quickly?

27
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,196
Anyway,

28
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,625
someone will try to hurt Xu Fengnian.

29
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,919
I'm in no hurry.

30
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,100
Who are you?

31
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:11,879
Pull out your sword.

32
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,500
Why didn't you pull out your sword?

33
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,599
Haven't you heard about it?

34
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,130
If I have the sword in my heart,

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,479
even grass or stone

36
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,400
can be used as a sword.

37
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,479
Nonsense!

38
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,550
What a waste!

39
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,150
A sword is a sword.

40
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,575
Grass is grass.

41
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,075
Only ignorant people think
they're the same.

42
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,825
Pull out your sword.

43
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:09,360
Be patient.

44
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,759
The sword is most threatening

45
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,160
when it's still in the scabbard.

46
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,240
She's your swordswoman?

47
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,839
More than that.

48
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,279
She makes delicious pickled cabbage.

49
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,399
It's good luck
for Sword Tomb of the Wu family.

50
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,915
In this generation,

51
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:27,680
there are two gifted swordsmen.

52
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,780
Will you keep fighting?

53
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,750
No.

54
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,516
Wasn't the fight

55
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,399
a little bit ridiculous?

56
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,600
They two are good.

57
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,240
They're qualified.

58
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,160
It's you?

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,240
Here's another chance for you.

60
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:48,400
Tomorrow afternoon,

61
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,199
Xu Fengnian will go to the reeds
out of the town.

62
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,900
By then, this man

63
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,160
will fight Xu Fengnian with you.

64
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,360
Who's he?

65
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:04,100
I'm Wang Mingyin.

66
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,350
Wang Mingyin,

67
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,639
the No. 11 martial artist?

68
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,050
(Wang Mingyin, the No.11 swordsman)

69
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:21,300
Wang Mingyin is also in Xiangfan?

70
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:21,901
Yes.

71
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,475
Someone brought the message to the inn.

72
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,759
The waiter passed it on to us.

73
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,600
Who sent the message?

74
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,875
A girl, according to the waiter.

75
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
She smiled

76
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:29,639
and left without telling her name.

77
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:31,250
Do you know who she is?

78
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,275
I don't.

79
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,639
Who's Wang Mingyin?

80
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
In the ranking of martial artists,

81
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,399
(Wang Mingyin has arrived in Xiangfan.)
he's always No.11.

82
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,350
But there are usually top ten masters.

83
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,120
He's just No.11.

84
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,879
He must be very depressing.

85
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,439
In such a big world,

86
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,920
he's already one of the best

87
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,120
even though he's No.11.

88
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,350
What does it concern you?

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,439
He came to kill me, I guess.

90
00:08:05,325 --> 00:08:06,360
Why?

91
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:10,040
Because...

92
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,575
The Xu family is my enemy.

93
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,075
How?

94
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,560
Have you brought them?

95
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:18,775
Lord of Jing'an asked me
to return them to you,

96
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,550
as a token of his sincerity.

97
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,399
In the box

98
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,400
are the eyes
of my brother Wang Mingyang.

99
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,250
Wang Mingyang?

100
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,960
It sounds familiar.

101
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,225
He used to be a famous general

102
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,600
of West Chu.

103
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,679
Oh, I remember.

104
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,759
No.1 Defender Wang Mingyang.

105
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,799
No.1 Defender.

106
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,799
He's worthy of the title.

107
00:09:11,975 --> 00:09:13,480
When Xu Xiao besieged Xiangfan

108
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,480
with 100 thousand soldiers,

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,519
Wang Mingyang defended the town
for three years

110
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,919
before it was broken into.

111
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,600
I've heard about it.

112
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,480
After the town was broken into,

113
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,279
Wang Mingyang died in the battle.

114
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,679
The fortunes of West Chu

115
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,024
started to decline.

116
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,120
So, Wang Mingyin wants to kill you,

117
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,136
to avenge his brother?

118
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:40,125
There's no personal grudge in a war.

119
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,840
During battles,

120
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,039
people die or live.

121
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,825
But after that battle,

122
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,360
I once said

123
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,100
that no one from the Xu family

124
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,750
could come to Xiangfan again.

125
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,250
Now that Xu Fengnian has come,

126
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,639
he can't leave!

127
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,480
What happened

128
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,039
to the eyes?

129
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,425
Mr. Wang Mingyang

130
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,879
dug out his eyes

131
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,559
before he died,

132
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,960
saying he would like to see

133
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,025
how Xiangfan and West Chu

134
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,840
would end up.

135
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,080
After the battle,

136
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:13,675
his body was burned in the fire.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,175
Only his eyes were kept.

138
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,440
Lord of Jing'an

139
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:20,440
always admired your brother.

140
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:21,960
Since he commanded Qingzhou,

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,639
he's been enshrining your brother, too.

142
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,639
This time,

143
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,350
he's returning the eyes to you

144
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
so that

145
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,519
he'll take a load off his mind.

146
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,039
Even if he didn't return the eyes,

147
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,639
I would kill Xu Fengnian, too!

148
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,879
Of course.

149
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,639
There are a lot of masters
around Xu Fengnian

150
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,799
as well as the cavalry.

151
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:41,346
I will

152
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,519
help you, too.

153
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,639
You?

154
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
For your information,

155
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:48,425
I've prepared

156
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,525
some special tools.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,425
Fujiang Armor?

158
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,400
Besides this,

159
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,639
Lord of Jing'an

160
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,500
will transfer some cavalrymen
for besiegement.

161
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,375
Tomorrow, Xu Fengnian will die

162
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:06,759
in the reeds.

163
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,000
You know someone is going to kill you.

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,300
Why are you still taking a troll?

165
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
It's a famous ancient town.

166
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,825
I should certainly take a look around.

167
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,840
Don't worry.

168
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,325
Even if they want to kill me,

169
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,800
they won't do it today

170
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:30,500
or in the town.

171
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,350
You'd better be careful.

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,360
Your Highness.

173
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,050
Wen Hua!

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,575
(Ranger Wen Hua)

175
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,689
Xu.

176
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,639
What were you doing here?

177
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,840
Sleeping. Didn't you see?

178
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,875
Who did you steal the clothes from?

179
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,029
You even stole two blades.

180
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,679
If the owner comes to you,

181
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:35,775
don't get me in trouble.

182
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,480
Come on.

183
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,050
You still look untidy.

184
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,450
You haven't been famous yet, have you?

185
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:41,500
Don't talk nonsense.

186
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,720
If you're a true friend,

187
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,725
take off your clothes

188
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,799
and exchange them for a meal

189
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,080
so that we can have a good time.

190
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,775
Go get us a meal.

191
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,175
Where did you get her?

192
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,360
I told you

193
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
I was from an aristocratic family
of North Liang.

194
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,799
I don't believe that.

195
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,919
Enjoy it, please.

196
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,240
Thank you, Mrs. Xu.

197
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,159
Mr. Wen, you get it wrong.

198
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,250
I'm a mere maid.

199
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,600
You're a beautiful girl.

200
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,080
It's ridiculous if you're only a maid.

201
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,570
If he bullies you,

202
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,840
tell me.

203
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,575
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

204
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,639
Seriously.

205
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,375
Why did you come to Xiangfan?

206
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:45,450
I had a crush on a girl.

207
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,075
She's so beautiful...

208
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,950
Again?

209
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,000
What do you mean again?

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,559
I indeed like her.

211
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,650
You like every girl you meet.

212
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:57,600
Forget it.

213
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,450
Where's Old Huang?

214
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,720
He hasn't come with you?

215
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,039
He's gone.

216
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,525
He's dead?

217
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:15,605
Yes.

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Old Huang...

219
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,919
He's a good man.

220
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:26,039
I don't care about others.

221
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,275
But I must go

222
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,399
and see Old Huang's tomb.

223
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:29,559
Where was he buried?

224
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,550
He died near East Sea.

225
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,375
There's no tomb for him.

226
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,840
Why did he go too far?

227
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,480
When I met you that year,

228
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,080
Old Huang kept nagging.

229
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,679
I found him so annoying.

230
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,759
But when he's gone,

231
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,840
I feel kind of lonely.

232
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,300
I feel lonely, too.

233
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,080
What are you doing?

234
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,399
Look at you.

235
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,200
Old Huang will think you disgrace him.

236
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,650
Some people are born

237
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,759
and some people are gone.

238
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,840
This is the martial world.

239
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,120
Cheers.

240
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,250
If Old Huang were here,

241
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,425
I wouldn't have the drumstick.

242
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,039
Neither would I.

243
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,450
- Forget about him!
- Forget about him!

244
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,840
- Let's enjoy the drumsticks!
- Let's enjoy the drumsticks!

245
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,175
If he were here,

246
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:56,275
we wouldn't have
even a single piece of the chicken.

247
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,050
Cheers.

248
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,639
Remember!

249
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,975
Some people are born.

250
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,450
- Some people are gone.
- Some people are gone.

251
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:04,500
This is

252
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,600
- the martial world.
- The martial world.

253
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:20,050
What's wrong?

254
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,440
That's a good place.

255
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,525
This is inappropriate.

256
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,240
Stay away and don't look.

257
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,650
It's inappropriate.

258
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,679
Why is it?

259
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,000
Xu.

260
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:39,039
Xu!

261
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,559
Sorry.

262
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,879
I was a bit impolite.

263
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,159
Let's go farther.

264
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,605
Or she'll hear us.

265
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,279
Old Huang is gone.

266
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,000
Would you like to travel with me?

267
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,639
I would like such a meal
from time to time.

268
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,039
But if I have it every day,
life will be too happy.

269
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,175
Anyway,

270
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:04,160
if I always enjoy a happy life,

271
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
I'll be in no mood for sword practice.

272
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,599
Don't hold up my supreme swordplay.

273
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,875
You only practice casually.

274
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,880
What swordplay do you have?

275
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,175
Come on.

276
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,020
Leaves on your side are wider.

277
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:21,675
Pick some for me.

278
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:25,800
I want to use them myself.

279
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,725
Don't be stingy, will you?

280
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,559
Get some for me.

281
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,200
Just use the thin leaves.

282
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:34,400
How...?

283
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,475
How can I just use them?

284
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,160
I feel much better.

285
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,400
It's getting late.

286
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,839
I should leave.

287
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,680
I owe you a meal.

288
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,839
I'll repay you later.

289
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,720
Where are you going?

290
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
To the border of North Mang.

291
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,300
There'll be chaos there, I'm afraid.

292
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:58,279
Take care of yourself.

293
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,675
How did you know?

294
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,839
Are you really from
an aristocratic family of North Liang?

295
00:18:02,975 --> 00:18:03,960
I am.

296
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't care who you are.

297
00:18:06,725 --> 00:18:08,279
You're my buddy, anyway.

298
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:11,600
We're good buddies.

299
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,050
Chaos is good.

300
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,880
We practice the sword

301
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,440
in chaos,

302
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,079
where we can sharpen the swordplay.

303
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,759
Very well.

304
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,279
Hope you'll obtain
the supreme swordplay soon.

305
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,640
When I'm in trouble,

306
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,720
I'll count on you.

307
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,680
I simply owe you a meal.

308
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,000
But I have to defend you with my life?

309
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:34,720
All right.

310
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,559
I'll say no more.

311
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm leaving.

312
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,675
Don't know when we can meet again.

313
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,900
The martial world isn't actually big.

314
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,880
We will meet.

315
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
- Steamed buns
- Steamed buns

316
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,475
- aren't as white as girls' hands.
- aren't as white as girls' hands.

317
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,240
- Tips of lotus leaves
- Tips of lotus leaves

318
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,279
- aren't as curly as girls' eyelashes.
- aren't as curly as girls' eyelashes.

319
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:07,839
See you.

320
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,480
The martial world isn't actually big.

321
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,000
We will meet.

322
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,200
Steamed buns

323
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,960
aren't as white as girls' hands.

324
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,359
Tips of lotus leaves

325
00:19:23,975 --> 00:19:26,799
aren't as curly as girls' eyelashes.

326
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,600
What were you singing?

327
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,440
The song we composed.

328
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,200
Your Highness,

329
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
you met Mr. Wen

330
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,240
when you were traveling about?

331
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,200
Yes.

332
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,920
He had a trip with Old Huang and me.

333
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,640
Looks like you think highly of him.

334
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:43,039
According to Mr. Li,

335
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:44,650
the patterns are used

336
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,240
to transmit genuine spirit.

337
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,325
The pattern inside the Armor

338
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,650
is very complicated.

339
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,200
I can't figure it out

340
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,000
in a short time.

341
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,240
You don't need to rebuild the Armor.

342
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:57,720
See if you can find out its weak points.

343
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,350
Seeing from this angle,

344
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:01,119
we can try attacking

345
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,359
from some points.

346
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:04,480
Maybe,

347
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,359
we can slow down the Armor

348
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,960
for a couple of seconds.

349
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:09,839
That's good.

350
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:11,200
Your Highness, you think

351
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:12,799
Fujiang Armor

352
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,519
will appear tomorrow?

353
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:17,160
If they want to kill me,

354
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:19,525
tomorrow is a good chance.

355
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:35,525
A gentleman doesn't go
to dangerous places.

356
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,200
Now that

357
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,440
you know it's dangerous,

358
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,599
why not leave Qingzhou quickly

359
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,519
and keep going east?

360
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:46,839
I can't leave.

361
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,240
Now that I let Wang Linquan
leave Qingzhou,

362
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,200
Lord of Jing'an won't easily let me go.

363
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,050
Your Highness,

364
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,725
you've got your father's charm.

365
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,079
I don't want to be like him.

366
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,625
Grandpa Wei.

367
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,325
Mm?

368
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,680
If Fujiang Armor appears tomorrow,

369
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,480
please try hard

370
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,720
to deal with it.

371
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:16,425
I will.

372
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,400
I'll keep checking the pattern.

373
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,025
Mm.

374
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:48,480
Your Highness.

375
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,475
You don't need to keep watch at night.

376
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,525
Like I said,

377
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,625
your mother and the Lin family

378
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,800
have left Qingzhou with Uncle Wang.

379
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:19,075
They're safe now.

380
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,799
I know.

381
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,925
Then why do you still stay in Xiangfan?

382
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,559
I mean

383
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,960
you don't need to follow me.

384
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,720
Are you expelling me?

385
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,480
I'm not.

386
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,759
Xu Xiao kept you around me,

387
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:45,925
taking you and your family as a chip.

388
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:48,079
Now that I've let them go,

389
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,125
you don't need to stay.

390
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:51,925
You can go find Uncle Wang.

391
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:53,599
He'll help you settle your family.

392
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,079
But my mother said I was dead.

393
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,640
I'm no longer one of the Lin family.

394
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,000
Your mother is alive, after all.

395
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,675
You don't need to stay around me.

396
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,839
I assassinated you.

397
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,920
I gave in to destiny, too.

398
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,400
Everybody in the world says

399
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,839
your family is
the traitor of our nation.

400
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,625
But in the end, you and your father

401
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,759
let us live.

402
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't know what is right

403
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,100
or what is wrong.

404
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,599
I also don't know

405
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,279
the point of things

406
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,799
I've ever done.

407
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,200
But I promised you

408
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,720
that I would protect you

409
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,875
with my life.

410
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,359
Even a loser like me

411
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:25,150
wants to keep his promise.

412
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,761
I'm not leaving.

413
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,550
Why are you still here?

414
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,775
Didn't I ask Ning Emei to take you away?

415
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:31,920
Why must I leave?

416
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:34,775
Listen to me.

417
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,075
Tomorrow, in the reeds,

418
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:36,920
we don't know what will happen.

419
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,850
Let Ning Emei take you back
to Mushan Island.

420
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,799
Yu Youwei and Fengzi Battalion
are there.

421
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,279
You're going to leave me on the Island?

422
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,319
No.

423
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,720
I want you to leave Qingzhou

424
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,200
and meet us later.

425
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:47,920
What if it doesn't go smoothly tomorrow?

426
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,200
If it doesn't,

427
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
I'll probably die.

428
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,525
You can then go away

429
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,000
and be free.

430
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,319
I'm not leaving.

431
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,359
Why?

432
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,799
Are you going to be in danger with me?

433
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:03,079
If we have to be ruined tomorrow,

434
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,039
I'll kill you personally.

435
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:08,440
Xu Fengnian,

436
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,440
when you have to die,

437
00:26:11,025 --> 00:26:12,599
no one can kill you, but me.

438
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:30,720
All right.

439
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:33,725
Sounds good.

440
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:36,880
Don't be desperate.

441
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:41,075
When I'm around,

442
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,400
neither of you will die.

443
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,875
How did you come in?

444
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,839
When did you come in?

445
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,200
When you were

446
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,359
saying something romantic.

447
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,350
Are you out of your mind?

448
00:26:56,725 --> 00:26:58,480
I said I would kill him.

449
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,359
That wasn't romantic!

450
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,425
That was harsh!

451
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,839
What did you come for, senior?

452
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,000
Go out with me for a stroll.

453
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,275
For a stroll?

454
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,079
You and me?

455
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,850
Mm.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,680
What exactly are you doing?

457
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:49,725
Before I left North Liang,

458
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:51,650
Xu Xiao begged me for one thing.

459
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,440
He said when there was no hope,

460
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,680
as long as you asked me for help,

461
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,125
I would take you back
to North Liang alone.

462
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,000
Let me ask you now.

463
00:28:01,225 --> 00:28:02,225
Would you like to run away?

464
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,240
What about the others?

465
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:07,559
I have one arm left.

466
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,519
I can't save a second person.

467
00:28:14,525 --> 00:28:15,525
Thank you, senior.

468
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,759
But I don't want to run away.

469
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,920
Think carefully about it.

470
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:19,079
You only live once.

471
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,200
Once you die, you're forever gone.

472
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:21,440
I won't easily die.

473
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,319
Do you remember Making Immortals Kneel?

474
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,480
How would I possibly forget that?

475
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,575
I've been trying it secretly,

476
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:03,300
but I still can't use it.

477
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,475
What's the essence of martial arts?

478
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:07,160
Strength,

479
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:08,160
speed,

480
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:09,079
technique,

481
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:11,640
and experience.

482
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:13,075
Yes, at the beginning.

483
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:15,000
But strength will be exhausted.

484
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,960
When martial artists
get to the best level,

485
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:19,119
their strength and speed
will reach the limit.

486
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,839
Then they should mix the power of nature

487
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,119
into their martial arts.

488
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,599
At that time, temperament is decisive.

489
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,279
Your obsessive thoughts

490
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,720
will dominate your martial arts.

491
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,359
Minds change martial arts?

492
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,119
Wrong.

493
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,500
Martial arts originate from minds.

494
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,119
Making Immortals Kneel.

495
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,240
What are immortals?

496
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,119
They seek longevity

497
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,160
and brilliance.

498
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,480
They have vitality forever.

499
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,119
It's the essence of immortals.

500
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,200
What is vitality?

501
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:33,480
Grass grows out of the ground

502
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,519
against the laws of nature.

503
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,720
This is vitality.

504
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,359
There's vitality and death.

505
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,359
If you want to be an immortal,

506
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,799
you should keep the vitality only

507
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,650
and remove the death!

508
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,000
That year,

509
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,680
when I created Making Immortals Kneel,

510
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,039
I was very proud.

511
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,839
Those mediocre men

512
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
claimed to defy the laws of nature.

513
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,799
They wanted to do that

514
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,960
and become immortals.

515
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,200
But I didn't want to associate

516
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,400
with such losers!

517
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,920
I created Making Immortals Kneel

518
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,720
just to borrow the power of nature

519
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,880
to oppress all mortal beings.

520
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,079
I'd cut off the pride
and wild fancy of losers

521
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:04,839
so that they would know

522
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,240
there could be no immortals in the world

523
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,700
as long as I lived!

524
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,875
With Dahuangting in your body,

525
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:16,920
you've got a foundation.

526
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,799
Also,

527
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,279
you're somewhat

528
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,200
as proud

529
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,640
as what I used to be.

530
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,839
When you understand
the true meaning of the swordplay,

531
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,279
maybe you can learn it.

532
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:27,150
Is Making Immortals Kneel

533
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,450
your strongest sword move?

534
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,960
Every move of mine is the strongest.

535
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,559
Right. Right.

536
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,920
But speaking of my strongest move,

537
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,799
it must be

538
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,799
Snakes...

539
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:35,440
In Sleeves.

540
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,440
Hey.

541
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,000
Who are we waiting for?

542
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:39,575
Consort of Jing'an.

543
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,350
You gave her a bracelet

544
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,000
and your letter was like a love letter.

545
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,240
She's Consort of Jing'an.

546
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,680
Why would she come to see you?

547
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,160
Even if she wants to,

548
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,599
Lord of Jing'an won't agree.

549
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:51,480
Just the opposite.

550
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,599
She may not want to come.

551
00:32:54,775 --> 00:32:56,000
But Lord of Jing'an

552
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,800
will make her.

553
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,480
His Lordship ordered

554
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,359
that Her Grace should
meet Xu Fengnian alone

555
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:55,680
to see him off.

556
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,475
Your Highness,

557
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,639
I've arranged guards

558
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,050
to escort Yu Youwei out of Qingzhou.

559
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,920
The rest of Fengzi Battalion
have returned.

560
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:18,325
Count heads.

561
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,050
Yes.

562
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,050
Fengzi Battalion has converged
with Xu Fengnian.

563
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,800
Fengzi Battalion has arrived.

564
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:50,599
What about the cavalry
of Lord of Jing'an?

565
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:52,950
Senior,

566
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,450
let's...

567
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:55,639
Let's keep waiting.

568
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,079
Your Highness,

569
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,400
three soldiers are missing.

570
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,050
Where were they missing?

571
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,325
When we set out, they were there.

572
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:06,775
They went missing in the reeds, I guess.

573
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,360
I'll take some men to look for them.

574
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,039
Wait.

575
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,200
Your Highness,

576
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,000
we can never abandon our companions!

577
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,800
If you don't want more soldiers
to be hurt,

578
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,000
listen to me.

579
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,159
Here she comes.

580
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:00,095
She indeed came.

581
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,300
What's she doing?

582
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,650
She isn't even taking a guard.

583
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,650
Is she coming for a date?

584
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,920
Why do you think Lord of Jing'an asked

585
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,960
his favorite consort

586
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,600
to see Xu Fengnian alone?

587
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:13,675
You know the reason?

588
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,025
I don't understand, either.

589
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,719
I'm afraid no one knows
what Lord of Jing'an is thinking,

590
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,639
but Xu Fengnian.

591
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,119
Where's the bracelet I gave you?

592
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:07,800
Why aren't you wearing it?

593
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

594
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:14,100
But I'd like to return it.

595
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,480
Why are you returning it?

596
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
You don't like it?

597
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,275
Sorry, Your Highness.

598
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:24,975
Let me throw it away, then.

599
00:38:26,725 --> 00:38:27,700
What does my uncle

600
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,625
want you to tell me?

601
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,239
This is his message for you.

602
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:43,100
(See the nephew off.)

603
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,875
We can no longer wait.

604
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,825
Xu Fengnian is leaving.

605
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,225
I'm afraid the Cavalry will not come.

606
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,440
Shall we take action or retreat?

607
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:58,960
Take action.

608
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,600
There are too many masters around him.

609
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,360
Lure them away.

610
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,975
Give it back to me later.

611
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:26,719
If I die,

612
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,760
bury it outside Xiangfan.

613
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,920
Here we go.

614
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:42,925
Mr. Wu,

615
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,519
don't you use your sword?

616
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,100
The bamboo pole is handy.

617
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,039
Crafty guy.

618
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,500
See the nephew off.

619
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,325
Only four words?

620
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,400
What else did my uncle say?

621
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,760
He asked me to give the message to you,

622
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,325
without saying anything else.

623
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,000
Maybe when he knew
you would leave Qingzhou,

624
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,725
he wrote this to see you off.

625
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,679
No, no.

626
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,725
(See the nephew off.)
There are two meanings

627
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,559
(See the nephew off.)
of the four words.

628
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,650
But neither of them means seeing me off.

629
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,280
Two meanings?

630
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,039
The first one is easy to understand.

631
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,039
Off means down,

632
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:44,550
namely the hell.

633
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,425
He wants to kill me.

634
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,100
I've brought you the message

635
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,800
and returned the bracelet.

636
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,600
I won't bother you, Your Highness.

637
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:55,039
I'll take my leave.

638
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,719
Aunt, get off the carriage
and let's talk.

639
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,225
Behave yourself, Your Highness.

640
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,250
Do you think you can leave?

641
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,800
Please get off the carriage, Aunt.

642
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:33,975
Tell me.

643
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:35,440
What would you like to talk about?

644
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:37,425
Our soldiers.

645
00:41:40,275 --> 00:41:41,125
Go save them with me!

646
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:41,960
Wait!

647
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,000
What are we waiting for?

648
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,039
They're soldiers of North Liang.

649
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,199
You're disturbed already.

650
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,039
Grandpa Wei!

651
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:46,750
I'll go after them!

652
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,800
Shu Xiu, Lyu Qiantang,

653
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,480
follow him.

654
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,500
Fengzi Battalion, follow up.

655
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,079
Aunt, get onto this carriage.

656
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,639
What exactly are you doing,
Your Highness?

657
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,480
It's a dangerous place.

658
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,725
I'm protecting you, of course.

659
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:37,159
You're daring.

660
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,559
You still hold her hands.

661
00:42:50,125 --> 00:42:51,280
I said,

662
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,155
no one from the Xu family
can come to Xiangfan again!

663
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,500
No.11 swordsman,

664
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,050
