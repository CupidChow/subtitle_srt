00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

=Episode 10=

7
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,000
Your Highness.

8
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,680
Your Highness.

9
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,120
How did you do it last time?

10
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,040
Show me again.

11
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:45,200
Just do it.

12
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,750
This is drawing circles.

13
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:15,125
Essentially,

14
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,000
everything returns
to primordial nothingness.

15
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,000
You saw it twice and you understand it?

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
As for the skills,

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,360
it's more like borrowing power
and defusing power.

18
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,975
It's true.

19
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:32,800
Let me think about it.

You didn't pass out today?

47
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,025
Is the cucumber ripe?

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,120
Don't touch it!

49
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,475
Not ripe?

50
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,400
It's my garden.

51
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,175
You don't allow people
to eat your vegetables.

52
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:14,450
Why do you grow them?

53
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm happy to.

54
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,325
I don't believe

55
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,100
you can guard here 24 hours a day.

56
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:34,240
Just kidding.

57
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,399
As the son of the Lord of North Liang,
how could I steal your vegetables?

58
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,125
What's there you can't do?

59
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,400
It's still early.

60
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm going to practice a little more.

61
00:05:49,425 --> 00:05:50,160
Sweet potatoes?

62
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,500
Somehow

63
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,275
I found them in the garden.

64
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,480
I don't want them.

65
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:57,879
Take them away.

66
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,319
Go away.

67
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,439
Don't bother me.

68
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,050
What are you doing?

69
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,160
It's a good way to practice my hands.

70
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,275
Interesting.

71
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,199
Your Highness.

72
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:38,279
Miss Jiang Ni

73
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,920
guards the garden every day
like it's forbidden.

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,575
You didn't steal

75
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,500
the sweet potatoes, did you?

76
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm worried

77
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,000
she would kill you later.

78
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,920
On Mount Wudang,

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,725
who dares to take anything
from that girl's garden?

80
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,000
Why does she

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
like the garden so much?

82
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,040
Probably

83
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,525
she never owned anything

84
00:07:02,525 --> 00:07:03,925
since she was little.

85
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,319
Where is Xu Fengnian?

86
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,439
I'm asking you.

87
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,675
Where are Xu Fengnian and his brother?

88
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:13,600
This maid doesn't understand mandarin?

89
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,720
Don't step on my vegetables!

90
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,959
How dare you!

91
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,480
Hold on.

92
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:24,399
Why did you push me?

93
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,160
You ruined my vegetables.

94
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,480
You pushed me for these vegetables?

95
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,560
It's mine!

96
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
How unappreciative.

97
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,050
I'll teach her a lesson!

98
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:34,200
There's nothing to be proud of
to hit a maid.

99
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,039
I'll give you a chance.

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,633
Apologize to me now.

101
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,225
You stepped on my vegetables first.

102
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,725
Destroy the garden.

103
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,275
Yes!

104
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:44,000
Hurry!

105
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,919
I will clean it up for you.

107
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,279
I don't want it anymore.

108
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,200
Burn it later.

109
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,240
Yes.

110
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:18,840
The roasted sweet potatoes you made

111
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,650
are much worse than what old Huang made.

112
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:27,425
Your Highness.

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,475
Do you practice martial arts
to go to Wudi City?

114
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:36,950
Do you also think it's impossible?

115
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,350
Why impossible?

116
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,279
Because I'm just getting started,

117
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,679
but Wang Xianzhi has long been peerless.

118
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,875
What should I do then?

119
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,400
I've never started
practicing martial arts.

120
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,480
What does it have to do with you?

121
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,450
Because I'm the best in the world.

122
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:09,150
You?

123
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:11,175
The best?

124
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:12,870
Yes.

125
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,519
I must be the best in the world.

126
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,879
When are you going
to start practicing martial arts?

127
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,800
Never.

128
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,225
And you want to be
the best in the world?

129
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:29,600
I promised my senior fellow apprentice

130
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,480
that I won't go down the mountain

131
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,879
until I become the best in the world.

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
However, I have to
go down the mountain one day.

133
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,399
It never occurred to you

134
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,600
that it's impossible?

135
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,799
I believe in myself.

136
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,399
Therefore, you should also
believe in yourself.

137
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,725
You will be able to enter Wudi City

138
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,240
and get back the sword box.

139
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,250
It sounds like two crazy people talking.

140
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
If you don't even believe in yourself,

141
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,025
what else can you believe?

142
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,250
Xu Fengnian!

143
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,759
You will be able to enter Wudi City!

144
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:28,540
Okay.

145
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,759
Hong Xixiang!

146
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,650
I'll wait for you to be
the best in the world!

147
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:51,925
It's done.

148
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,679
Apologize.

149
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,600
You are going to cry?

150
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:12,805
Tears don't work.

151
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,279
How dare you!

152
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,950
Don't come over.

153
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,639
I knew it long ago

154
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,080
that tears don't work.

155
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:26,950
Kneel down.

156
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:34,505
You want to hit back?

157
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,970
You are a noble person.

158
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,125
You don't need to do it yourself.

159
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,600
It's beneath your dignity.

160
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,520
Slap her.

161
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,000
Until she apologizes.

162
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:44,925
Yes!

163
00:12:44,925 --> 00:12:45,525
Go ahead!

164
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,475
It's Xu Fengnian.

165
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,294
You must be the son
of the Lord of North Liang.

166
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:07,919
A brute indeed.

167
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,636
How rude!

168
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,950
Does it hurt?

169
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,225
No.

170
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:17,559
Did she bully you?

171
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,480
She stepped on my vegetables.

172
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,600
So, I pushed her.

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,025
She destroyed my garden.

174
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:24,480
So, I threw mud on her!

175
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,440
I got back at her expect this slap.

176
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn't lose to her.

177
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,159
As the son of the Lord of North Liang,

178
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,950
you can't even discipline a maid well.

179
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,240
What a disappointment.

180
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,399
What do you mean by that?

181
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,150
Apologize.

182
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,080
What do you say?

183
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:07,675
That girl behind me,

184
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:08,975
I can bully her,

185
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:09,679
but

186
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,225
you can't.

187
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,350
Well,

188
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,059
do you want to fight with us

189
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,399
without asking who we are?

190
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,100
Do I need to know a dog's name
before I beat it?

191
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,660
You have a quick tongue indeed,

192
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,665
but I'm afraid you are not
as strong as you think!

193
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,080
Go on!

194
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,639
Just don't kill him!

195
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,686
You put your blade back so fast?

196
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,549
Didn't they say he can't fight?

197
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:47,360
I think he just starts
to learn martial arts.

198
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
His strength and skills are good,

199
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,559
but it's a pity

200
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,725
that he lacks the genuine spirit.

201
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:56,919
I guess it's the only move you know.

202
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,550
Is this old pale man your lover?

203
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,960
Kill him!

204
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,075
You are courting death.

205
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,825
Hold the blade tight.

206
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,120
Who are you?

207
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,559
Let's just fight.

208
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,639
Why do you care who I am?

209
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,250
You...!

210
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:36,399
Xu Fengnian!

211
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,120
Do you know who I am?

212
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,879
Sui dug up two luminous pearls

213
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,160
in Mount Tai.

214
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
I've heard about it.

215
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,799
Isn't that how you got your name,

216
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:47,925
Princess Suizhu?

217
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,279
Since you know who I am,

218
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,750
get down on your knees now!

219
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,399
I think you should
get down on your knees.

220
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,950
We got engaged three years ago.

221
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
Although I had been away
for three years,

222
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,639
and the marriage didn't work out,

223
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,950
you're still my wife on some level.

224
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,200
Xu Fengnian!

225
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,480
I'm an easy-going person.

226
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,679
You don't need to kneel down at my feet.

227
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,900
Just apologize to her.

228
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,200
You want me, a princess,

229
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,875
to apologize to a maid?

230
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,075
Why is that?

231
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,360
Senior.

232
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,375
Can you win?

233
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,825
Of course.

234
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,700
Because we can fight!

235
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,525
You!

236
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,475
You want to fight against
the Princess of Liyang.

237
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,775
Sun Diaosi.

238
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:36,400
Yes!

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,159
Take them down!

240
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,600
Master.

241
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,725
(Sanqing Hall)
They are halfway up the mountain.

242
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,120
Are we not going to do anything?

243
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:47,700
Yeah.

244
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,879
One is the Princess of Liyang.

245
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,960
The other is the son
of the Lord of North Liang.

246
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,950
It will cause us trouble
to help either of them.

247
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,875
After Mount Longhu
sent the letter of challenge,

248
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,200
many disciples have left
one after another.

249
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,480
Master.

250
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:06,119
If we turn to the royal family,

251
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,275
the Mount Longhu

252
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,425
won't be so aggressive.

253
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,480
Isn't it just a competition?

254
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,839
Master's Dahuangting

255
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,678
may not lose to the Longhu Arch-Taoist.

256
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,950
Yeah.

257
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,925
It doesn't matter
whether we win or lose.

258
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,000
What do you mean?

259
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,599
Mount Longhu is just an excuse.

260
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,075
The one who wants
to reorganize the sects

261
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,300
is the one on the throne.

262
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,039
If the capital can support Mount Longhu,

263
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,400
it can also tolerate Wudang Sect.

264
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:41,185
In recent years, Mount Longhu
has annexed many sects.

265
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,075
They tore down their gates

266
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,200
and moved to the capital.

267
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,825
If we do that,

268
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,600
Wudang Sect will be destroyed.

269
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,519
Yeah.

270
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:49,700
At least there is a way to live.

271
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,425
Exactly.

272
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:52,925
Eh.

273
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,025
What do you think?

274
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,680
I can't go to the capital.

275
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,440
Why?

276
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,425
I took an oath

277
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,225
that I won't go down the mountain

278
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:07,475
until I become the best in the world.

279
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,319
It's not the time for jokes!

280
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:12,175
Yeah.

281
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,440
You have a point.

282
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,000
- Master.
- Master.

283
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,605
Master!

284
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,675
Master!

285
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,759
You can apologize now?

286
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,480
What do you want?

287
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,275
You don't understand my words?

288
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,160
I want you to apologize.

289
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,225
No need to apologize.

290
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,325
I only want my garden.

291
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,319
What?

292
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,075
Give my garden back to me.

293
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:50,720
How dare you!

294
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,039
Then don't apologize.

295
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,200
Compensate for the garden.

296
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,440
How much is this shabby garden worth?

297
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,480
I think it's worth
one thousand taels of gold.

298
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,880
Fine.

299
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,880
One thousand taels of gold.

300
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,799
I'll send you the money later.

301
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,799
Later?

302
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:06,319
Want to welch on your debt?

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,160
I have no money now.

304
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,680
What's in your hand?

305
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,825
Is everyone in Wudang Sect dead?

306
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,359
Are you from Wudang Sect?

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,400
I am the Master of Wudang Sect,
Wang Chonglou.

308
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

309
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,079
I order you
to take these three people down

310
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,859
right now.

311
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm ashamed to say

312
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,960
that our sect only cultivates spirit.
We are not good at martial arts.

313
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,865
You even dare to defy the royal order?

314
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:06,559
We are unskillful
in martial arts indeed.

315
00:20:07,025 --> 00:20:08,720
Sorry to let you down, Your Highness.

316
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,544
You're getting your sect destroyed!

317
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,000
I just heard

318
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,279
that Your Highness mentioned gold
with Young Master Xu.

319
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,839
How about I pay for you first?

320
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,200
But the Princess must write an IOU

321
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,300
with her fingerprint on it.

322
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,839
Very good.

323
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,480
Wudang Sect is going to be
Xu Fengnian's dog?

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,039
How can you borrow money
with that attitude?

325
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,875
Take it!

326
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,160
500 taels of gold for one pearl.

327
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,400
Take them all!

328
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:02,279
Senior.

329
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,240
Please put back your blade.

330
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,575
I'm incompetent.

331
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,575
I embarrassed you, Your Highness.

332
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,825
It has nothing to do with you.

333
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,359
Is it all right?

334
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,400
You need to ask her.

335
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:38,575
I only want my garden.

336
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:39,250
You...!

337
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,250
Turn it into the way it was.

338
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,279
Well,

339
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,825
this girl doesn't know what's good.

340
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,350
Why not give the two pearls to me

341
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,160
if she doesn't want them?

342
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,480
I won't give you

343
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,125
what you want.

344
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,875
It's such a waste.

345
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,175
What a spendthrift.

346
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,079
Xu Fengnian.

347
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,619
Wang Chonglou.

348
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,225
Remember today.

349
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,880
Restore this place.

350
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:11,359
Hurry!

351
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,759
Stop!

352
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:21,599
What's wrong again?

353
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,700
I thought about it.

354
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,319
Your people are too dirty.

355
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,319
Don't let them touch my garden.

356
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,235
You're humiliating me.

357
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:35,950
You slapped me on the face.

358
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:37,559
I humiliated you.

359
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,880
We are barely even now.

360
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:43,206
You...!

361
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,759
What else do you have to say?

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Suit yourself, Your Highness.

363
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:51,645
Where is Xu Longxiang?

364
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,300
You are here to see my younger brother?

365
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,795
You didn't marry me,

366
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:57,680
so, you want to become my sister-in-law?

367
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,680
Don't go too far!

368
00:23:01,225 --> 00:23:03,720
My brother has been taken
to Mount Longhu.

369
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,839
Ask Master Wang if you don't believe me.

370
00:23:08,475 --> 00:23:09,825
I can prove it.

371
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's go down the mountain.

372
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,550
Yes, Your Highness.

373
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,160
Let's go!

374
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:31,700
Master.

375
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
That was embarrassing for the Princess.

376
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,175
Do you have time

377
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:38,160
to have a few words with me?

378
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,240
Give me a minute.

379
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:45,125
I'll wait for you at the waterfall
where you practice martial arts.

380
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:46,839
I'll be there right away.

381
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,480
Let's go back to North Liang right now

382
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,500
in case the Princess's people
will come after you.

383
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,559
Do you think I'm afraid of her?

384
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,640
Have you cooled down?

385
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,700
I didn't provoke her.

386
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,775
She stepped on my vegetables first.

387
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,680
I know.

388
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,200
She was looking for you.

389
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,425
It's my fault to get you into this.

390
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,799
How about I restore it for you?

391
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,240
Forget it.

392
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:45,000
This is my fate.

393
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,440
I don't deserve to own anything.

394
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,559
Even when I own something,

395
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,000
I will lose it in the end.

396
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,721
There is no such fate in the world.

397
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,500
My father is dead.

398
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,279
My mother is dead.

399
00:25:01,825 --> 00:25:03,060
My home is lost.

400
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:04,440
My country fell.

401
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:08,960
There's no need to restore it!

402
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,920
I was born to owe this world.

403
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,750
I wish it was all ruined.

404
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,600
Your Highness.

405
00:25:36,825 --> 00:25:38,480
I'm incompetent.

406
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,925
Sorry to get you insulted.

407
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,559
Send people to find out

408
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,759
if Xu Longxiang
really went to Mount Longhu.

409
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,275
Yes, Your Highness.

410
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,920
What do you think of Xu Fengnian?

411
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,759
Your Highness.

412
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,880
The man is bold and audacious.

413
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,240
It doesn't matter how bold he is.

414
00:25:57,575 --> 00:25:59,440
The point is whether he is smart enough.

415
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,319
He has a sharp tongue.

416
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:07,079
I don't think

417
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,559
he is stupid.

418
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:10,640
I think it's the other way around.

419
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,039
The man is reckless and ignorant.

420
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,640
He is a real idiot.

421
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,525
Your Highness,

422
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,225
why do you have

423
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:20,100
such a low opinion of him?

424
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,569
The relationship
between the capital and North Liang

425
00:26:24,569 --> 00:26:25,519
is very subtle.

426
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,119
It looks like that the emperor
and the officials are of one mind,

427
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,160
but in fact...

428
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,720
If Xu Fengnian is clever,

429
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
he shouldn't reveal my identity.

430
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:37,119
If things get ugly,

431
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,720
neither North Liang
nor the capital can end it properly.

432
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:42,200
Oh.

433
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,200
So, you provoked Xu Fengnian on purpose?

434
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:48,839
We came here for two reasons.

435
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,075
One is Xu Longxiang.

436
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,589
The other is

437
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,850
that I want to see

438
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,930
what kind of person he is.

439
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,850
You really thought I got here in a hurry

440
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,279
just to quarrel with him?

441
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,300
There should be records in the palace

442
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,750
about what Xu Fengnian did every year.

443
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,450
That kind of stuff is useless.

444
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,960
Xu Xiao will die one day.

445
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,825
I must see him in person to know

446
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,680
what the nature of Xu Fengnian is,

447
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,039
and how dangerous he is
to the royal family.

448
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,920
I prepared a lot of means,

449
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,759
but I didn't expect him to be rattled

450
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,000
just because of a maid.

451
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,069
If North Liang is left to such a person,

452
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:30,875
the Xu family will come to an end.

453
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,150
Your Highness, you are right.

454
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,700
I think your fate is not that bad.

455
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,250
Despite all the suffering,

456
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,475
you ended up being my maid.

457
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:09,359
It's kind of a silver lining.

458
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,425
That's an attempted assassination.

459
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:31,700
Shouldn't you give me compensation?

460
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,200
I stabbed the ground!

461
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:35,880
What's wrong with you?

462
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,175
Stab the ground with a dagger.

463
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,454
Yeah.

464
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:43,300
You're the smartest one.

465
00:28:44,075 --> 00:28:45,799
You provoked the Princess on purpose

466
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,200
to make her think

467
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,279
that you are an impulsive
and irritable idiot.

468
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:10,875
I kind of

469
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:12,700
did it on purpose.

470
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,175
But it's mainly because...

471
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,359
I have a bad temper.

472
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,450
Then you're a real idiot.

473
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,799
What about you?

474
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,375
You knew they outnumber you,

475
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,750
but you still confronted them.

476
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,475
Didn't you ask for trouble?

477
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,640
The world is hard like a stone
and sharp like a weapon,

478
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,175
but I will never give in.

479
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,839
Look at your attitude.

480
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,000
Princess Suizhu must really hate you.

481
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,440
She should hate you more

482
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,000
than she hates me.

483
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:51,725
Um.

484
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,500
Why should we care about her?
Eat the cucumber.

485
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,700
Don't throw it!

486
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,975
It is good.

487
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,675
There are a few more left.

488
00:30:23,025 --> 00:30:24,425
I hate both of them!

489
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,200
Didn't you do it on purpose,
Your Highness?

490
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,839
I'm still angry.

491
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,279
Xu Fengnian and that maid humiliated me.

492
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,160
How can I swallow my anger?

493
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,640
But he is still
the son of the Lord of North Liang.

494
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,599
I'm afraid it's not easy
to get back at him.

495
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,240
Not only Xu Fengnian,

496
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,079
but also Wang Chonglou.

497
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,839
Based on what just happened,

498
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:50,240
Wudang Sect is determined
to turn to North Liang.

499
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,759
With the backing of North Liang,

500
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,599
it's also hard
to make a move against Wudang Sect.

501
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,960
Xu Xiao never has a good attitude
towards those sects.

502
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,880
I'm afraid it's just

503
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:04,050
Wang Chonglou's wishful thinking.

504
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:19,700
Who's in the way?

505
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:28,759
Hong Xixiang.

506
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,975
Hong Xixiang?

507
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:34,359
Wang Chonglou's
junior fellow apprentice?

508
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,720
Yes.

509
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,094
Why are you standing in the way?

510
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,160
My senior fellow apprentice
is determined

511
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,720
to go against the court,

512
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,400
but all other disciples

513
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,160
are willing to set things right.

514
00:31:50,525 --> 00:31:52,250
So, you are going to
go against Master Wang?

515
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,680
Not to go against him,

516
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:55,526
but to find a way to survive.

517
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,925
I can't let him drag Wudang Sect down

518
00:31:58,175 --> 00:31:59,450
to the abyss.

519
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,599
Wang Chonglou cultivated Dahuangting.

520
00:32:03,925 --> 00:32:06,839
You are a little Taoist.
How do you set things right?

521
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,575
Usually, I can't stop him.

522
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,325
But there is an opportunity today.

523
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:11,720
Please

524
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,559
follow me back.

525
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,050
Thank you for speaking up for me.

526
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,079
It wasn't for justice,
but for my own benefit.

527
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,160
In that situation,

528
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,400
I spoke up for you,

529
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,440
telling the Princess

530
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:43,160
that Wudang Sect is following
North Liang's lead.

531
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:46,654
In fact, you don't need
to help either of us.

532
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,519
How do you think of
the world of martial arts?

533
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,850
It's free without restraint

534
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,160
and desirable.

535
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,559
The world of martial arts

536
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,325
is insignificant.

537
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,075
The fights over power on the court
are the undercurrents

538
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,359
which can stir up huge waves.

539
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,640
The so-called sects

540
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,920
are just a few boats on the water.

541
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:17,725
Without foundation,

542
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:19,839
it could topple at any moment.

543
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,279
The two biggest undercurrents
at the moment

544
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,200
are the capital and North Liang.

545
00:33:26,925 --> 00:33:29,480
Wudang Sect is facing a rough sea now.

546
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,119
If we keep being indecisive

547
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,400
and standing aside,

548
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:36,160
we will be swallowed by the waves.

549
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,759
I think I know it.

550
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,525
Wudang Sect wants to turn to
North Liang?

551
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:43,275
We just want to protect ourselves.

552
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,680
What does Master Wang

553
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,400
want to do?

554
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,680
You should know

555
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,840
the martial artists
are divided into nine ranks.

556
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,599
I know.

557
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:13,371
There isn't much to say about
the second rank to the eighth rank.

558
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,651
Let's just talk about the first rank.

559
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:17,199
Wang Xianzhi must be in the first rank.

560
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,400
That's right.

561
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,159
But there are four levels

562
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,575
in the first rank.

563
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:25,500
The first level is the Diamond Realm.

564
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,075
Diamond Realm

565
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,039
is the entry for the martial artists.

566
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,350
The body is hard to destroy
and the bones won't decay.

567
00:34:33,225 --> 00:34:35,079
The one who comes here with you

568
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,600
is about at this realm.

569
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,920
After the Diamond Realm,

570
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,225
it's the Void Realm.

571
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:43,225
It's more amazing.

572
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,150
Jian Jiuhuang once reached that realm.

573
00:34:48,075 --> 00:34:49,050
Old Huang?

574
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:53,119
You mean he reached
the Void Realm before?

575
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,250
In the battle of Wudi City,

576
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,440
Jian Jiuhuang used

577
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,250
the Ninth Move.

578
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,850
It reached the Celestial Realm.

579
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,884
It was something.

580
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:04,519
Indeed.

581
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,760
There are very few people

582
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,725
who can enter the Celestial Realm.

583
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,679
Wang Xianzhi in Wudi City

584
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,000
has been in this realm

585
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:15,519
for half a lifetime.

586
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,050
It's too high to reach.

587
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:21,920
There are four realms in the first rank.

588
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:25,039
Diamond, Void, and Celestial.

589
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,000
It's only three realms.

590
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,375
The top one
is called the Immortal Realm.

591
00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:32,119
This realm

592
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,150
is just a legend.

593
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,079
Is there no other realm on top of that?

594
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,679
Above the first rank is the Unity.

595
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,425
What is the Unity?

596
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,320
The four realms are shadowy.

597
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,719
I don't think I can see it.

598
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:58,765
Why do you tell me

599
00:35:58,765 --> 00:35:59,920
about this?

600
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,920
I heard that you want
to go to Wudi City.

601
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,250
You need to reach
the Void Realm at least.

602
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,075
You are talented,

603
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,250
but you started too late.

604
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:14,950
That can't be helped.

605
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,199
I'll take my time to practice.

606
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,975
Wudang Sect's Dahuangting
is not the strongest martial art,

607
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
but it's definitely special.

608
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:30,079
How is it special?

609
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,480
Dahuangting can change a person's bones.

610
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,850
I think you know it.

611
00:36:35,025 --> 00:36:36,719
Besides,

612
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,450
the most amazing thing about Dahuangting

613
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,599
is to serve others.

614
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:44,599
To serve others?

615
00:36:46,575 --> 00:36:48,400
The one who cultivated Dahuangting

616
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,301
can give his genuine spirit

617
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,840
to someone else.

618
00:36:54,975 --> 00:36:56,300
Give away the genuine spirit?

619
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,480
If you all practice Dahuangting

620
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,939
and pass it to one person,

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,475
isn't that person
going to be invincible?

622
00:37:02,975 --> 00:37:04,199
Your Highness.

623
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:06,280
Dahuangting is extremely hard
to cultivate.

624
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,575
In recent years,

625
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,550
except for Master Wang,

626
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,119
no one else acquires it.

627
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
That's good.

628
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,280
And there is a catch

629
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:20,400
that Dahuangting can only be passed

630
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,320
to someone who never
cultivates his genuine spirit.

631
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,000
How much he can absorb

632
00:37:24,525 --> 00:37:26,075
after the transmission

633
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,450
depends on the destiny.

634
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:29,175
It's only

635
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,731
five or six out of ten most of the time.

636
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,880
You want to pass Dahuangting to me?

637
00:37:35,325 --> 00:37:36,199
Hold on.

638
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,960
What will happen to you after you
pass your genuine spirit to me?

639
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,150
Without my genuine spirit,

640
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,719
I'll die soon.

641
00:37:46,425 --> 00:37:47,505
Are you crazy?

642
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,575
I'm wide sober.

643
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,920
You are going to give up your life

644
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
to help me?

645
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,119
We're not even close.

646
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,400
It's not for you,

647
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,375
but for Wudang Sect.

648
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,280
I've made myself clear.

649
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,559
Wudang Sect can only survive

650
00:38:00,675 --> 00:38:02,875
with the backing of North Liang.

651
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,239
Xu Xiao won't agree.

652
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,725
It's not important.

653
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,975
As long as they see me
passing my force to you,

654
00:38:11,975 --> 00:38:13,239
everyone will believe

655
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,300
that Wudang Sect joins
North Liang's side.

656
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:20,250
Who can see it?

657
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:34,900
Wang Chonglou wants
to pass his force to Xu Fengnian?

658
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,960
There are clouds
of various colors at dusk.

659
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,199
Close the eyes and look into oneself.

660
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,639
Then I realize I'm in a cave of heaven.

661
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Huangting turns out
to be a blessed land.

662
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,000
(Funeral)

663
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:13,150
(Childhood Xu Fengnian)

664
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,119
Mother.

665
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,405
(Childhood Jiang Ni)
Mother.

666
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,840
Your mother is dead.

667
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,360
She won't come back alive.

668
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:50,800
But you still have a father,

669
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,960
elder sisters,

670
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,600
and a younger brother.

671
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:55,239
I...

672
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,331
I'm the only one left in my family.

673
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,239
She will always live in your heart

674
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:06,950
and look at you.

675
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,480
Wipe your tears.

676
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,175
Don't let her see you cry.

677
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,719
Fengnian.

678
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,400
