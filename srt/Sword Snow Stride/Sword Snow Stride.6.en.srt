00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

7
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,800
(Ruide Hall)

8
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,480
Why?

9
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,519
I came to bid farewell.

10
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,600
Farewell?

11
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,120
I can do martial arts,

12
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,440
but I used to keep it from you.

13
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,679
I was dishonest.

14
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,760
From this day on,

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
I no longer dare to stay around you.

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,800
Xu Xiao asked you to protect me?

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,600
I deceived you, Your Highness.

18
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,240
That's unforgivable.

19
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,520
How many people

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,479
has my father arranged for me secretly?

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,399
Four death guards.

22
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,399
Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta.

23
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm Charlie.

24
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,840
Who are the other three?

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
We work independently.

26
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,359
I don't know who they are.

27
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,520
I have to guess, then.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,640
But His Lordship said

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,159
that Bravo and Delta...

30
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,040
...had died for you.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,719
Two have died for me,

32
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,400
but I don't even know their real names.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Alfa is still alive.

34
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,359
Can it be Hongshu?

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,239
I don't know.

36
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,439
I'm in a bad mood today.

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,959
This is a punishment for you.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,120
You've got a lot of work to do.

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
Stop trying to leave.

40
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,640
Get back to your work.

41
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,599
Wait.

42
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,879
Remember.

43
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
From this day on,

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
you're no longer a death guard.

45
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,040
You're only my maid.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Got it?

47
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,879
It feels good.

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,039
Off you go.

49
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,919
His Highness is nice to you.

50
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
I thought he would expel you.

51
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,879
From this day on,

52
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,400
I'm no longer a death guard.

53
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm the maid for His Highness,

54
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,400
Qingniao.

55
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:38,400
What about you?

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Why did you come to His Highness?

57
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:43,840
What is

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,919
your real identity?

59
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:49,280
Guess.

60
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,360
Nothing.

61
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,000
I've got nothing to do,

62
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,520
so that I want to talk to someone.

63
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,479
Qingniao turns out

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,399
to be a death guard

65
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,519
whom my father arranged for me.

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,240
She told me

67
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
there were four death guards around me.

68
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,279
Two of them have died.

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,759
The last one

70
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,480
is still hiding around me.

71
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
Can you do martial arts?

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,839
Yes, I guess.

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Then you're the last death guard

74
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,079
staying secretly around me.

75
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,519
I'm not.

76
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
Me?

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,560
You don't look like one.

78
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,560
You...

79
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,959
You can do martial arts?

80
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,759
A little.

81
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,319
How great are your martial arts?

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
This great.

83
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,199
But every time bandits ran after me,

84
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,879
you escaped faster than me!

85
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,800
I have great martial arts.

86
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,319
I can't...

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,399
I can't easily fight.

88
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Or people will die.

89
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,959
Don't brag!

90
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,800
I shouldn't have guessed
that you were a death guard.

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,720
No masters

92
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,920
would behave like you.

93
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,279
When you stole a chicken,

94
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,680
half of the villagers ran after you.

95
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,639
Old Huang.

96
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,040
Xu Xiao asked me to make a choice.

97
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,040
I should either kill Ning Emei

98
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,480
or

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
send Huangman'er out of North Liang.

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,199
Young Master.

101
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,079
Someone in the army supports Huangman'er

102
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,519
in taking over North Liang.

103
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
That's basically what happened.

104
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,519
Even I don't know

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
where Xu Xiao will send Huangman'er.

106
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,319
I...

107
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
I guess I know

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,839
where His Lordship

109
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,920
will send Young Master Longxiang.

110
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,639
You do?

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,720
It doesn't matter where he will be sent.

112
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,639
The point is...

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Young Master,

114
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,279
do you not want him to leave?

115
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't, of course!

116
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,399
But my point doesn't help at all.

117
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,920
I didn't want it

118
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,079
when my sisters were sent away.

119
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,240
They were still sent away, at last.

120
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,519
I am

121
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,079
a young master unworthy of the name.

122
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,319
Young Master,

123
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,639
these days,

124
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
I've been thinking

125
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,879
about what we experienced
in the past three years.

126
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,199
I'm...

127
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I'm useless.

128
00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:16,360
However,

129
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,160
I still want to help you.

130
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm glad you think so.

131
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,120
You know Old Hunk
under the Lake, don't you?

132
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:48,279
I certainly do.

133
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,279
When Mr. Lin assassinated me,

134
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,000
I begged Old Hunk for help.

135
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:54,519
Then have you thought

136
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,839
about releasing him?

137
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:57,680
I tried when I was little.

138
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,720
The chain on him

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,600
couldn't be cut off.

140
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,320
So, Young Master,

141
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,679
what you need

142
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,039
is a sharp blade.

143
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,399
What's up?

144
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:33,600
Where's Grandpa Wei?

145
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:38,960
He's asleep.

146
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,759
That's good.

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
Actually, I came to see you.

148
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,279
You once told me

149
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,039
that you had a very sharp blade.

150
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,879
This is it, right?

151
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,440
Chunlei, isn't it?

152
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,279
Just get to the point.

153
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,120
May I borrow it?

154
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,840
For a while.

155
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,679
I'll return it soon.

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,840
What do you need it for?

157
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,440
Under the lake,

158
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,440
an old hunk has been locked

159
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,159
for any years.

160
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,840
I want to borrow your blade

161
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
and release him.

162
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,000
Why do you want to release him?

163
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,960
If I save him,

164
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,919
maybe he'll help me, too.

165
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,159
Who told you that?

166
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Old Huang!

167
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,120
Old Huang.

168
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,000
Tell her

169
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,840
about Old Hunk under the Lake.

170
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,200
The man under the Lake

171
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,200
is locked by four meteorite iron chains.

172
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,480
If someone can

173
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,919
cut off the chains

174
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,720
and help him leave,

175
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,039
he will

176
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
be conquered.

177
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,799
You believe that?

178
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,320
I'd like to have a try.

179
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,039
Don't you have enough helpers already?

180
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,320
In some cases,

181
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,480
my father's men may not help me.

182
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,240
How could you throw your blade

183
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,080
at someone who doesn't do martial arts?

184
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,879
What if you hurt me?

185
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Do you think this blade will be helpful?

186
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,080
It looks shining.

187
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,440
It'll be helpful, I assume.

188
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,120
All blades are shining,
except for wooden ones.

189
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,200
Give it back to me, then.

190
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,080
Fine. Fine.

191
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm going down.

192
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,679
Will there be any problem
if I release him?

193
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,559
Don't worry, Young Master.

194
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,240
I'm here.

195
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,679
Young Master.

196
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,240
Oh, my waist hurts.

197
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,440
Where's my blade?

198
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,320
Old Hunk is holding it.

199
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,759
He looked like

200
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,240
he wanted to unchain himself.

201
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,680
(Imposing and Magnificent)

202
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,960
Have I made it?

203
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:27,960
Sure.

204
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,520
(Tingchao Pavilion)

205
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,159
Get back!

206
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,160
(Tingchao Pavilion)

207
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:12,720
Amazing.

208
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:13,440
Old Huang.

209
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,200
Isn't he awesome?

210
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,799
Is Li Yishan still alive?

211
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,720
After being locked underwater
for so many years,

212
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
you can still speak.

213
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:28,559
Don't fight him!

214
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,920
Go away.

215
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,160
Young man,

216
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,079
don't risk your neck.

217
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,039
I saved you.

218
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,680
That's why I keep you alive now.

219
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,279
I...

220
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,000
He'll be conquered?

221
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I'm asking you one last time.

222
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,480
Where's Li Yishan?

223
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,240
(Imposing and Magnificent)

224
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,680
(Propitious Omens)

225
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,080
(Propitious Omens)

226
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,520
(Imposing and Magnificent)

227
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,040
(Imposing and Magnificent)

228
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,200
Li Yishan,

229
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm glad you're still alive.

230
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,319
Otherwise,

231
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,839
I wouldn't know how to take revenge.

232
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,039
Li Yishan?

233
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,400
The Supreme Master?

234
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:22,640
Isn't he dead?

235
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,440
He's your master?

236
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,440
(Imposing and Magnificent)

237
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,480
(Propitious Omens)

238
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,240
Old Huang,

239
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,519
what a bad idea you had!

240
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,480
Didn't you say after I released him,

241
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:15,559
he would be conquered?

242
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,240
Let's fight him until he's conquered.

243
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:19,039
Go.

244
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,600
(Propitious Omens)

245
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,039
Seriously?

246
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
Jian Jiuhuang?

247
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
You're still alive, too.

248
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,839
Very well.

249
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,799
I'm going to defeat you

250
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,319
and take revenge
for my failure last time.

251
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,440
The First Move,

252
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,799
Dragon and Snake.

253
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,119
The Second Move,

254
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,880
Twin Lotus.

255
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,480
Old Huang?

256
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,480
Wait a minute, Young Master.

257
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,480
This isn't over yet.

258
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,799
That year,

259
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,519
I knocked you into the lake.

260
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,000
Today,

261
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,480
you'll end up the same way.

262
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,880
The Third Move,

263
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,720
Three Catties.

264
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,560
(Propitious Omens)

265
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,079
I haven't had enough food.

266
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,359
I'll stop fighting.

267
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,680
Old Huang, you...

268
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,680
You...

269
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:52,680
Young Master.

270
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,120
(Propitious Omens)

271
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,039
He's conquered!

272
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,680
Old Huang,

273
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,880
you...

274
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,839
You have such great martial arts?

275
00:25:59,559 --> 00:25:59,880
Young Master,

276
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,599
didn't I tell you?

277
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,480
I have great martial arts.

278
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,079
Like this great.

279
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,960
Deng Tai'e has only a peach blossom.

280
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
But Jian Jiuhuang's sword box

281
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,680
is full of famous swords.

282
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,039
I'm going to get changed.

283
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,400
I want some meat!

284
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,599
You're Jian Jiuhuang.

285
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,200
You know him?

286
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,240
In recent 50 years,

287
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,400
besides God of Sword Li Chungang,

288
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,599
there have been only two sword masters.

289
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,119
One is Deng Tai'e,
New God of Sword of Peach Blossom.

290
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,240
The other one

291
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,599
is him.

292
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,680
Take it away. Take it away.

293
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,279
You've had fish for a dozen years.

294
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,720
No more fight?

295
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,599
I'm going to sleep, then.

296
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,559
Would you like to have some food?

297
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,519
I'm going to do some reading.

298
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,240
Tell me.

299
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,720
Why did you release me?

300
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:47,759
Young Master saved you.

301
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,359
Shouldn't you repay him?

302
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,079
Nonsense.

303
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,880
He released me.

304
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,599
At most, I'll show some mercy

305
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,480
and won't kill him.

306
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,079
Why must I repay him?

307
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:04,839
If you don't repay him,

308
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:06,680
I'll kick you

309
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,359
back to the bottom of the lake.

310
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,599
I'm not in a hurry.

311
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,640
Take your time.

312
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,680
After you're done eating,

313
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,599
give me your reply.

314
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:28,839
Young Master,

315
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,279
have the meat

316
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,119
when it's still hot.

317
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
It'll taste bad when it's cold.

318
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,119
Come on.

319
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:43,920
Have you made up your mind?

320
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,960
How do you want me to repay him?

321
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,480
Stay in the Mansion

322
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:50,799
and protect Young Master.

323
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,720
When you're around,

324
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,279
why does he still need me?

325
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,559
I'm leaving soon.

326
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,880
Before I come back,

327
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,519
protect Young Master for me.

328
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,119
You're leaving?

329
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:04,839
I'll tell you about it later, all right?

330
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,680
All right.

331
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:23,680
What do you say?

332
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,279
When will you come back?

333
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,960
Within two months.

334
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:27,960
All right.

335
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,839
In two months,

336
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,680
even if you're not back,

337
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,519
I'll be still leaving.

338
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,240
Deal.

339
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,600
(Wutong House)

340
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,400
Let me take off your shoes.

341
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
Make yourself comfortable
in your own room.

342
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,920
I can take them off by myself.

343
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,720
Then what do you need us for?

344
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:08,119
Qingniao,

345
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,480
when I have Old Huang
and Old Hunk under the Lake,

346
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,400
you don't need to be a death guard.

347
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,680
Just be my maid without concern.

348
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,000
You care so much
for Qingniao, Your Highness.

349
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,799
I care for you, too.

350
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,640
In case of danger, stay far away.

351
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:26,720
No one in my house

352
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,119
should die before me.

353
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
What shall I ask him for?

354
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,720
Old Huang.

355
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,440
Here's the wine.

356
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,880
Master Huang.

357
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,519
Let me fill your cup.

358
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,599
Old Huang.

359
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,440
What you said this afternoon...

360
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:53,960
Young Master,

361
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,960
how many eggs did we take away
when we stole the chicken?

362
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,319
Two or three?

363
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:06,680
Three.

364
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,079
I knew it.

365
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,200
Old Huang,

366
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
you said you would be leaving.

367
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,480
Where are you going?

368
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm going to Mount Longhu.

369
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,519
The biggest sect in Liyang?

370
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,200
Why are you going there?

371
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,160
Some old friends of mine live there.

372
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,680
I'm going to visit them.

373
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,240
After that,

374
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,680
I have to

375
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,680
visit Wudi City.

376
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,440
East Sea Wudi City?

377
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,519
Why will you go there?

378
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,960
There's a fight

379
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,319
I stopped halfway.

380
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,519
I have to go and finish it.

381
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,279
Since I was old enough
to remember things,

382
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,400
you've been living in my family.

383
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,519
When did you have the fight?

384
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,200
Nearly 30 years ago.

385
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,960
I wasn't even born at that time.

386
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,920
Would you like to listen to my story?

387
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,039
I'm all ears.

388
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,359
It's quite a simple story.

389
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,799
I used to be a swordsmith.

390
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,440
As I forged swords,

391
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:13,039
I suddenly began
to understand swordsmanship.

392
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,160
Then I became a swordsman.

393
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,799
So easy?

394
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,839
I just had good luck.

395
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:21,640
Go on.

396
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
Then I traveled around the world

397
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,359
and collected famous swords

398
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,240
for my sword box.

399
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,240
This box?

400
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,160
Famous swords in it?

401
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,319
There are Top Ten Famous Swords.

402
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,799
In my sword box,

403
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,359
there were six of them.

404
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,079
Were?

405
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,640
When I visited East Sea Wudi City

406
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,160
and challenged Wang Xianzhi there,

407
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,400
I left Sword Huanglu

408
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,960
in the city wall.

409
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,400
(Wudi City)

410
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,079
I lost.

411
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,599
I lost.

412
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,200
It's no big deal.

413
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,000
Some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

414
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,279
Halfway through the fight,
I knew I would lose.

415
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
I was so scared.

416
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,880
Of death.

417
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:25,640
Of defeat.

418
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Then I ran away.

419
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,880
In several years after I left Wudi City,

420
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,200
I had a nightmare every night

421
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,480
where I was defeated by Wang Xianzhi

422
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,880
and I died.

423
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,279
Young Master, do you know
why I came to North Liang?

424
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,880
Because North Liang is far away
from the East Sea!

425
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,240
I've been hiding like a rat.

426
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,680
I don't dare to confront Wudi City

427
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,319
or Wang Xianzhi.

428
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,599
I had thought

429
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,400
this would be my life.

430
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,599
I didn't get through this

431
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,880
until I traveled with you
for three years.

432
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,519
How did our trip help?

433
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,559
Young Master,

434
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:20,559
you can't do martial arts.

435
00:34:21,799 --> 00:34:22,559
But over the past three years,

436
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,720
you've never evaded,

437
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,359
shrunk back,

438
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,359
nor felt scared.

439
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,839
How shall I put it?

440
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,599
Suddenly, I'm no longer
afraid of anything.

441
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,119
Defeat...

442
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Death...

443
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,920
No big deal.

444
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Eventually,

445
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,400
I can confront

446
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:45,960
Wudi City

447
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,640
that has haunted me for 30 years.

448
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:49,960
At last, I can confront Wang Xianzhi

449
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,079
who haunts in my heart.

450
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,559
I won't stop you

451
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:06,039
from challenging him.

452
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,319
But you must come back after it's over.

453
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,519
Others don't broil sweet potatoes

454
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,480
as well as you do.

455
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,000
I promise you, Young Master.

456
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,440
I'll come back immediately
after I fight him.

457
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,400
The first thing I'm going to do
is to broil sweet potatoes for you.

458
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You're going to Wudi City,

459
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,400
aren't you?

460
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,440
Why are you going
to Mount Longhu before that?

461
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,400
To do business.

462
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,800
With people on Mount Longhu?

463
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,239
An old man on Mount Longhu

464
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,960
always wants to know
how strong Wang Xianzhi can be.

465
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,360
But he doesn't dare
to challenge Wang Xianzhi at all.

466
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,719
When he knows
I'm going to challenge Wang Xianzhi,

467
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,880
he'll watch it happily.

468
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,639
It's a chance for business, isn't it?

469
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,639
You'll challenge Wang Xianzhi, anyway.

470
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,119
You can take the chance

471
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,679
to ask that man for something.

472
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,840
Of course.

473
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,599
I won't waste the chance.

474
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,840
What do you want to ask for?

475
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,239
It's a secret.

476
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,800
You'll know it later.

477
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,519
You old rascal.

478
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,840
When are you leaving?

479
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,119
Early tomorrow morning.

480
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,360
In such a hurry?

481
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,280
The fight has been delayed for 30 years.

482
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,159
The earlier it's over,

483
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,440
the earlier
I'll take the load off my mind.

484
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,480
Old Huang.

485
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,159
How does your song go?

486
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,480
♪Old dog Old dog♪

487
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,280
♪There is no dog like you♪

488
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,039
♪Buried in the earth♪

489
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:23,320
♪Distress in the joy♪

490
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,679
♪Old dog Old dog♪

491
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,039
♪There is no dog like you♪

492
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,320
Old Huang,

493
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,320
it turns out to be a song

494
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,239
about your own story.

495
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,239
Yes, isn't it?

496
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,519
I'm known

497
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,719
as Jian Jiuhuang.

498
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:41,079
Actually, I haven't figured out
the ninth move yet.

499
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,599
When I traveled with you
for three years,

500
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,679
I brought together our experiences.

501
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:48,920
Then,

502
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,920
I figured out the ninth move.

503
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,920
That's good, isn't it?

504
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,079
Young Master,

505
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,840
how about

506
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,519
naming the ninth move?

507
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,920
In the past three years,

508
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,840
how far have we traveled?

509
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,239
Six thousand li in total, I'm afraid.
[*li: a unit of length, equals to 500 meters]

510
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,840
Call it Six Thousand Li, then.

511
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,239
Change it later if you don't like it.

512
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,840
Let's take this name.

513
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,719
The Ninth Move,

514
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,119
Six Thousand Li!

515
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,600
(Mansion of Lord of North Liang)

516
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,159
Young Master, learning martial arts
doesn't hurt anything.

517
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,760
You won't be fooled, either.

518
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,039
- How many times have I told you?
- You just take it...

519
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,920
I won't.

520
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,559
I just won't learn martial arts.

521
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,079
Are you sure?

522
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,239
If you get in trouble,

523
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,400
I have two sentences for you

524
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,519
which will help a lot.

525
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,199
- I know that, too.
- Something...

526
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:04,840
Something's wrong.

527
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:07,719
Leave immediately.

528
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,079
- I have something for you.
- I have something for you.

529
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,199
It's tasty salt.

530
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,400
What do you want to tell Young Master?

531
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:05,920
Just say it.

532
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,199
It said,

533
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,760
"Young Master,

534
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,679
don't bother to see me out."

535
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,559
Go.

536
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,639
I'll walk you out of the town.

537
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,639
Young Master,

538
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:45,639
this is where you stop.

539
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,719
Is Wang Xianzhi very strong?

540
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,119
He's the Second Best.

541
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,320
Who's the best, then?

542
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,159
When he calls himself the Second Best,

543
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,519
no one else dares to be the best.

544
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,840
Can you defeat him?

545
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
I don't care!

546
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,039
I don't care whether I'll win or lose.

547
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,800
The fight has been delayed for 30 years.

548
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,760
I have to finish it.

549
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,119
Come back quickly after it's over.

550
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,800
Young Master, wait for me.

551
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
I'll bring back the wine
from the East Sea

552
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,000
and let's enjoy it together.

553
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:42,639
