(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,439
Look at the lake.

8
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,519
Is it beautiful?

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,079
The landscape falls into the lake.

10
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
The cloud is like crystal-clear frost.

11
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,400
It is

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
the best view in the world indeed.

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
It's not beautiful now.

14
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,120
It's beautiful with fish.

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,840
Where is the fish food?

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,639
Look!

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,960
Fish!

18
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,080
The golden scales break the blue sky.

19
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
It's more beautiful now.

20
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,080
It's not superlative.

21
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,639
The view at the center of the lake
is spectacular.

What to do now?

30
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,920
Spread the fish food.

31
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,720
Don't be so stingy.

32
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,680
This is the best view.

33
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
Don't you take a look?

34
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,240
You are from the Lin family
in Hedong, right?

35
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:48,920
Yes.

36
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,800
I trust you

37
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,120
about the assassination,

38
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,519
but people gossip.

39
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,800
Your family has to do something

40
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,759
to reassure North Liang.

41
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,199
Mr. Lin?

42
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,120
Your Highness,
you have a big appetite indeed.

43
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Why are you acting like
a different person now?

44
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Things change,

45
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,079
but I'm still who I am.

46
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,879
So, you've been acting.

47
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,560
If not,

48
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,720
how would you let your guard down?

49
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,240
If you don't let your guard down,

50
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,600
how would I have the chance
to be alone with you?

51
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,040
You want to kill me?

52
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,920
Yes.

53
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
I came here just to kill you.

54
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,519
What about Miss Fan?

55
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,279
I met her on the way here.

56
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,399
It's a godsend.

57
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,279
That slash of her sword

58
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,519
made you less defensive.

59
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
What will happen if you kill me?

60
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:06,639
If you die,

61
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,199
there will be no future
for the army of Xu!

62
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,160
That's it?

63
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:11,959
That's it.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,079
I read sage books

65
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
to serve the people.

66
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,240
I'm willing to kill the culprit
for my country.

67
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Are you not afraid
that she is a master of martial arts?

68
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll take a chance!

69
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,360
You won.

70
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,759
That girl can't fight at all.

71
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,560
You won't

72
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,480
be able to live if you kill me.

73
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,600
What's there to be afraid

74
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:47,759
to die for my country?

75
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,639
Miss Fan will die, too.

76
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,439
Those who came here with you

77
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,319
will all die.

78
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,800
For the great cause,

79
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,360
one has no fear for sacrifice!

80
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,399
Do they know

81
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,279
that you will sacrifice them?

82
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,920
I'll make amends to them

83
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,319
in the hell!

84
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,959
I know you can't fight,

85
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,639
but I learned swordsmanship
from an early age.

86
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,519
Xu Fengnian.

87
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
That smile you just had

88
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,360
should be your last smile

89
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,800
in your life.

90
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,399
I smile

91
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,279
because I finally figure out

92
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,439
the purpose of the three assassinations,

93
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,000
and

94
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:32,240
who's behind all this.

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,519
What are you talking about?

96
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,279
No one orders me to kill you.

97
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,120
You are a pawn.

98
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
How would a pawn know
who is playing chess?

99
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,600
Xu Fengnian.

100
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,840
What a pity.

101
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a good swimmer.

102
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,919
Just die under the water!

103
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,000
I couldn't be happier.

104
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,159
I'm not going to save you.

105
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,520
(Chu Kuangnu,
bladesman from North Mang)

106
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,120
I

107
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,080
want to eat meat.

108
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,919
Thanks for coming down to save me.

109
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,600
Who...

110
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,600
Who wants to save you?

111
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,799
I want to see how you die.

112
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,679
I must let you down.

113
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
What is that thing
at the bottom of the lake?

114
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,320
I call him Old Hunk under the Lake.

115
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,919
Is it a person or a monster?

116
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
I guess it's a person.

117
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,600
No way.

118
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,759
How can a man live underwater?

119
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,080
In the first place,

120
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,519
he has strong internal force.

121
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,519
You know

122
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,639
people with strong internal force
have longer breathing intervals.

123
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,440
He still needs air.

124
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,919
There are fish in the lake.

125
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,960
But he's not a fish.

126
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,799
He eats living fish

127
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,320
and rips the swim bladder
from the fish's belly.

128
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,840
There's air inside the swim bladder.

129
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,879
That's how he stays alive.

130
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,679
There's not much air.

131
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
With strong internal force,
he doesn't need much air.

132
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,000
He kills a few more fish every day

133
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,960
and just gets through it.

134
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,440
Then when did you find him?

135
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,200
I fell into the lake when I was a child.

136
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,360
He saved my life.

137
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,120
Later, I often threw hot food

138
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,519
into the lake to feed him.

139
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
Gradually,

140
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,480
we got familiar.

141
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,279
So, you planned

142
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,039
where to park the boat?

143
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,919
Yeah.

144
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,720
You gave Mr. Lin a chance
to kill you on purpose.

145
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,120
That's right.

146
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,240
You never trusted him the whole time.

147
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,679
What you said and what you did
are just for testing him?

148
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,639
Why would I trust him?

149
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,759
So, you were also testing me

150
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,480
to see if I would join hands with him

151
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
in a crisis?

152
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:51,919
That's not what I meant.

153
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,399
Who knows when you are telling the truth

154
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
and when you are lying?

155
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,600
I swear in the name of my mother

156
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,639
that I have no intention of
testing Jiang Ni.

157
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,600
That would be the best.

158
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,759
But I didn't expect you

159
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,039
to jump into the lake to save me.

160
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,279
I said I wasn't trying to save you!

161
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,240
What are you doing?

162
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,399
My clothes are soaked.
It feels uncomfortable.

163
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,000
Stop taking off your clothes.

164
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,759
Keep your underclothes.

165
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:30,559
Rest assured.

166
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,720
I'm not that shameless.

167
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:33,960
You are already shameless.

168
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,000
How about you?

169
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,720
Are you not feeling uncomfortable?

170
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,759
I'm not uncomfortable.

171
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,559
I'm fine.

172
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,879
Your sleeves are wet.

173
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,519
I'll gouge your eyes out
if you keep looking at me!

174
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:43,799
Let's go.

175
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,080
Go by yourself.

176
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,559
I'll be back later.

177
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,399
Your clothes are all wet.

178
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,159
How improper it will be

179
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,159
if someone else sees you!

180
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,960
You walk ahead of me.

181
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Does my back look good?

182
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,679
Very ugly.

183
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,000
Then why are you looking at it?

184
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,960
I'm not!

185
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,279
I jumped into the lake.

186
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,639
You didn't get guards for me,

187
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
but you brought me clothes?

188
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,279
Why do I feel
that I can't see through you,

189
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,960
Old Huang?

190
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,799
What's hard to see through me?

191
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,159
Can you stop chatting?

192
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:22,960
Just one more word.

193
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,399
Guess what I found?

194
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Xu Fengnian!

195
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,639
Young Master.

196
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,480
I didn't let you go!

197
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,480
Wait.

198
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,799
Young Master.

199
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,480
Why did you jump down again?

200
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,559
What did you find?

201
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,440
A big fish?

202
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,960
Look.

203
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,679
I got it back for you.

204
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
I don't need it.

205
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,320
Old Huang.

206
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,600
I don't know what it is

207
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,519
and what's in it,

208
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,360
but I know

209
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,320
you've been carrying it with you
for years,

210
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
and it's important to you.

211
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,639
That's all in the past.

212
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,159
Why do you deny your past?

213
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:28,440
Your past

214
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,600
makes who you are now.

215
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,200
No matter what,

216
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,559
you're always Old Huang to me.

217
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,799
If you don't want it anymore

218
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,360
one day,

219
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,279
you need to tell me formally.

220
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,559
The wood is good.

221
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll chop it

222
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,559
and roast a duck with it.

223
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,720
Since God wants you to find it,

224
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,639
don't use it to roast a duck.
I can't bear to let you do that.

225
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,679
Don't throw it away again.

226
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,399
I'll leave the man lying there to you.

227
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,519
No problem.

228
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,080
I'll take care of it, Young Master.

229
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,079
You are awake.

230
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,279
What's at the bottom of the lake?

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,799
It's my family's lake.

232
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,039
None of your business.

233
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,480
Kill me.

234
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Don't think too much about it.

235
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:36,480
I'm here

236
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,079
to let you know

237
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,200
the consequences of this assassination.

238
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,240
The consequences?

239
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,559
Although I failed,

240
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,400
there will be other righteous men

241
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,279
coming after you.

242
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,920
No. Mr. Lin.

243
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,880
The Lin family is over.

244
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,920
It's my own decision to assassinate you.

245
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
What does it have to do
with my family?

246
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,279
You are the eldest son
of your family.

247
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,079
What do you think?

248
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,359
Isn't it over if I die?

249
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,039
Don't try to kill yourself.

250
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,160
It won't change the result

251
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
whether you die or not.

252
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,119
I just assassinated the son of
Lord of North Liang.

253
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,680
I'll get beheaded at worst.

254
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,920
My family won't be implicated.

255
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,200
What about the conspiracy of rebellion?

256
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,799
What rebellion?

257
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,359
The Lin family

258
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,519
colludes with the rebels in secret.

259
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,480
What else could it be

260
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,960
if it's not a rebellion?

261
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,680
There are no rebels!

262
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,680
You're trying to frame my family.

263
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's just your side of the story.
Who would believe you?

264
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,279
That's why

265
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,759
you have to be more careful

266
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,160
and cautious

267
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,440
when you do things,

268
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,039
so as not to be used as a pawn
and get your family exterminated

269
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,440
without knowing it.

270
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,079
You are talking nonsense

271
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,839
to throw me off balance.

272
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,039
Believe it or not.

273
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:24,720
Alright.

274
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm done.

275
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,240
I'll leave.

276
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,319
Hold on!

277
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,880
What about Miss Fan?

278
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,799
She is in a woman's cell.

279
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,519
Would we lock her up with you?

280
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,160
I used her in this matter.

281
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,319
She has nothing to do with it.

282
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,000
It's too late.

283
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000
She has been implicated by you.

284
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,359
Xu Fengnian!

285
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,000
Xu Fengnian!

286
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,039
I know you are a righteous man,

287
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
but have you thought about

288
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,200
that you might have gone too far?

289
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,039
I don't even know your name.

290
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,079
Never mind.

291
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:16,200
It's not important.

292
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,640
It's impossible.

293
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,319
It's impossible.

294
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,839
He was just trying to scare me.

295
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,720
Xu Fengnian!

296
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,359
Xu Fengnian!

297
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
Xu Fengnian!

298
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,480
Why are you still on the first floor?

299
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm reading books.

300
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
But there are introductory books
on martial arts on this floor.

301
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,680
You don't need them anymore.

302
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,480
To be the best in the world,

303
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,400
I need to learn from the ground up.

304
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,200
Good luck.

305
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,680
I'll go to see someone.

306
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,200
Your Grandpa Wei
is sleeping in the back.

307
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,599
I'm not looking for him.

308
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,519
I want to see my master.

309
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
Didn't you say you couldn't face him

310
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,640
until you unravel
the whole assassination event?

311
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,400
I unraveled it.

312
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,279
You know who's trying to kill you?

313
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,920
I know

314
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,519
who is behind the scenes,

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,559
but his purpose

316
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,839
is not to kill me.

317
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:47,720
The three assassinations

318
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,119
all happened in Lingzhou,

319
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,119
but the result he wants

320
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,319
is thousands of miles away.

321
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:52,960
I'll tell you in detail later.

322
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,839
That's not necessary.

323
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,440
If it's not about martial arts,

324
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,039
I'm not interested anyway.

325
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:00,599
I'm leaving.

326
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:10,960
Master.

327
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:11,839
I'm back.

328
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,799
Did you unravel

329
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,279
the whole assassination event?

330
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,279
Yes.

331
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,079
Who planned it?

332
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,119
Zhao Heng,

333
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,359
the Lord of Jing'an in Qingzhou.

334
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,400
Be more specific.

335
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,640
In the first round of assassination,

336
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,200
the remaining troops of Chu assembled.

337
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,559
I believe

338
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,480
the Lord of Jing'an must be
the driving force behind it.

339
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,680
In the second round of assassination,

340
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,119
Yu Youwei is the daughter
of a swordsman from the Chu.

341
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,599
She acted like she wanted
to avenge her lost country.

342
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,400
Xu Xiao annihilated the Chu.

343
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,000
Who else should I kill but you?

344
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,000
Zhao Heng kept Yu Youwei

345
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
for such a day.

346
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
Lin initiated
the third round of assassination,

347
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:12,480
which is the most important round.

348
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,000
(Noodles)

349
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,920
He wants to kill me

350
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,039
because he believes

351
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,759
that North Liang endangers the country.

352
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,599
But all this

353
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,720
can't be done

354
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,839
without Zhao Heng,
being the driving force behind it.

355
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,000
What's the evidence?

356
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,519
There isn't any evidence.

357
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,880
Even Lin himself wouldn't know

358
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,839
that he wants to kill me

359
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:32,640
because he was subtly influenced
by the Lord of Jing'an.

360
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,920
What are you talking about?

361
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,680
No one orders me to kill you.

362
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
Once Lin made a move,

363
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,279
everyone would think

364
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:41,359
that the Lin family joined hands
with the Chu veterans,

365
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,079
and what he did

366
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,119
became treasonous in nature.

367
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,039
So,

368
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,359
the Lin family is over.

369
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,160
Then why would Zhao Heng

370
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,400
try to make all of this happen?

371
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,880
Qingzhou is one of the key areas
to defend against North Liang.

372
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,119
(Qingzhou)
Zhao Heng commands Qingzhou

373
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
(Qingzhou)
and controls the Navy.

374
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,319
You can say

375
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,359
(Lingzhou)
that he grabs North Liang by the throat.

376
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,920
But he did contend
for the throne before.

377
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,839
The court doesn't trust him.

378
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,559
That's why it has been
the Lin family in Hedong

379
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,720
who has the fiscal control of Qingzhou.

380
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,880
After three rounds of assassination,

381
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,720
the Lin family would fall into
the whirlpool of treason.

382
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,720
They can't be saved.

383
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,400
After that,

384
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
the fall of the Lin family

385
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,960
would leave the Lord of Jing'an
in sole control of Qingzhou.

386
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,279
No one can play against him anymore.

387
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,319
He planned all this

388
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,200
not to kill me,

389
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,920
but

390
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,200
to take full control of Qingzhou.

391
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,119
A series of lethal moves.

392
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,319
The real game

393
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:07,400
is outside the chessboard.

394
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,400
The cause and effect
are thousands of miles apart.

395
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,960
The Lord of Jing'an, Zhao Heng,

396
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,759
is a scary player indeed.

397
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,680
What if you get killed?

398
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,440
If I die,

399
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,559
North Liang would be in chaos.

400
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,960
It would do good to Qingzhou.

401
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,440
The Lord of Jing'an would win anyway

402
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,279
in this game.

403
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,200
You haven't seen through

404
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,599
this game.

405
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,680
Who are you?

406
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,519
I am the usurper.

407
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,119
Look.

408
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,319
I'm standing right in front of you.

409
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,440
You don't even know who I am.

410
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:32,960
Xu Xiao?

411
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,839
Actually,

412
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,280
I kind of appreciate you.

413
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,880
You want to persuade me to surrender?

414
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,480
Xu Xiao.

415
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,559
It can only happen in your dream

416
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,920
to make me serve a usurper.

417
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,279
You are so righteous.

418
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,039
I'm embarrassed to keep lying to you.

419
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,839
What do you want to say?

420
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,880
Come in!

421
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,000
Brother Lin.

422
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:07,920
Miss Fan.

423
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Xu Xiao!

424
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,559
It has nothing to do with her!

425
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,440
Brother Lin.

426
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,880
Did they release you?

427
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,880
I lied to you.

428
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,119
You can hit me

429
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,680
and scold me.

430
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,000
I deserve it.

431
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,839
I'm not wronged.

432
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,279
We are all acting.

433
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,720
Did I do a good job?

434
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:01,799
You...

435
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,559
Lin.

436
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,039
Do you really think

437
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,079
we met by accident?

438
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,240
I had her

439
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,599
waiting for you

440
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,279
on the way

441
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,680
when you left your mansion.

442
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,160
Why?

443
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,319
First of all,

444
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:21,759
the assassination

445
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,160
entered

446
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,440
the third round.

447
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,720
I must let her give you a push

448
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,759
at the crucial moment.

449
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,480
Second,

450
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,160
my son must find out

451
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,839
who Qingniao is.

452
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:34,680
Therefore,

453
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:38,119
she must wield her sword.

454
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,839
How hard it is for me to be a father.

455
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,599
I have to find a way

456
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,079
to give my son what he wants.

457
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,160
Am I right?

458
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,599
What's more,

459
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,000
with my words,

460
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,640
it would be set in stone
that the Lin family

461
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,920
colludes with the Chu survivors.

462
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,920
There is no chance

463
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,119
to turn the tide.

464
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,279
Xu Xiao!

465
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,599
You treacherous man!

466
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,720
The planning is done.

467
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,039
I have told you the truth.

468
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,920
Regard it

469
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,559
as my respect for your righteousness.

470
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,440
Shu Xiu!

471
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Grand Commander.

472
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,519
Send a message to Wang Linquan

473
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,440
that

474
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,480
the Lin family is over.

475
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,039
Make sure he will destroy

476
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,559
the lifeblood of the Lin family
step by step.

477
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,640
Zhao Heng has always wanted
to destroy the Lin family

478
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,839
and dominate Qingzhou, right?

479
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:41,799
Good.

480
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,880
Let's give him a hand.

481
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,279
The Lord of Jing'an doesn't know

482
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,960
that although the Lin family falls,

483
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,839
his henchman who will take over
Qingzhou's fiscal power

484
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,160
is actually

485
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
from North Liang

486
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,519
who has been planted
by his side long ago.

487
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,000
This is a good game

488
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,839
indeed.

489
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:06,599
Go ahead.

490
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,960
I need to thank you

491
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,640
for this whole thing.

492
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,640
Your name is Lin...

493
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:23,400
Lin...

494
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,279
Lin...

495
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,599
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

496
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,759
You mean Xu Xiao has been prepared

497
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,359
for this game?

498
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:00,839
It's more than that.

499
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,400
Could there be a deeper layer?

500
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,839
You must always keep in mind

501
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,119
that what you need to see

502
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,720
is not just the game,

503
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
but also

504
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,119
the secret plan of the chess player.

505
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,640
I think you know the deepest dungeon

506
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:24,799
in the mansion.

507
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,160
Yes.

508
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,880
Go there and take a look.

509
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,839
Maybe you'll understand.

510
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,799
Access to the deepest level
requires Xu Xiao's warrant.

511
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:32,920
I don't have it.

512
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,640
This will do.

513
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,319
What do you want me to see?

514
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,920
What else could it be?

515
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
It's a person.

516
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,920
Someone you know.

517
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,559
Show your warrant.

518
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,839
Why are you here?

519
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,359
Did you forget

520
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,960
it was you who gave the order?

521
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,000
Soldier!

522
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,960
Put this rebel

523
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,480
in jail!

524
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,279
But I've set you free.

525
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,480
I'm afraid you got it wrong.

526
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,839
Ning Emei is an honest man.

527
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,200
Make up an excuse

528
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,279
and release him.

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Do you know Lin?

530
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,319
Who?

531
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,599
You don't know him.

532
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,480
You have nothing to do
with the Lin family's operation.

533
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Did you ask Yu Youwei to assassinate me?

534
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,799
If you want to kill me,

535
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,039
just do it.

536
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,279
Why bother to fabricate a charge on me?

537
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,599
You have nothing to do with Yu Youwei.

538
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,880
Could it be outside Lingzhou...?

539
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,280
No.

540
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,599
It was you

541
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,840
who showed up in time

542
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,559
and saved me from the Chu people.

543
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,960
You have nothing to do
with three assassinations.

544
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,920
Why are you here?

545
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,039
On the lowest floor of the dungeon?

546
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,639
You are also here.

547
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,079
Dig deeper.

548
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:11,719
Okay.

549
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,440
Leave us.

550
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,079
You want to see me?

551
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,679
Why is Ning Emei
still locked up in the dungeon?

552
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,440
It's something I shouldn't know?

553
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,679
You'll know it sooner or later.

554
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,360
I didn't tell you

555
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
because

556
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,039
I don't want
to put you in that position.

557
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:51,920
Is it a big deal?

558
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,159
Do you know

559
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,880
where our greatest enemy is?

560
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,599
North Mang?

561
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,159
Not there.

562
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,239
The capital?

563
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,599
The royal clan

564
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,440
is indeed wary of North Liang,

565
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,559
but they are still

566
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,039
foreign enemies.

567
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,519
You mean

568
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,000
North Liang's greatest enemy

569
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:11,920
is inside of us?

570
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,239
That's right.

571
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,559
The North Liang Cavalry
is unparalleled in the world.

572
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,800
The only way to destroy
the foundation of North Liang

573
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,760
is to start from

574
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:20,960
the inside.

575
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,760
Does Ning Emei
collude with foreign enemies?

576
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:23,440
No.

577
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,960
Is he plotting a rebellion?

578
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,559
He is loyal.

579
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,719
Then why did you lock him up?

580
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,280
He supports your younger brother.

581
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,719
What did you say?

582
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,599
Get up.

583
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,280
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

584
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,079
Huangman'er

585
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,400
was born with great strength.

586
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:26,920
He has

587
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,679
plenty of supporters in the army.

588
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,039
Isn't it a good thing?

589
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,280
There are even people

590
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:32,920
supporting him

591
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,440
to take over military power

592
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,840
and rule North Liang.

593
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,360
Ning Emei is one of them?

594
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,599
So, you're going to kill him yourself

595
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,880
to stabilize the army.

596
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,679
Just for that?

597
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:44,559
Wait,

598
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,639
they want your younger brother

599
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,920
to take your place.

600
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:47,920
What's wrong with

601
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,760
letting him take my place?

602
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,800
I don't want it anyway.

603
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:54,880
Do you know

604
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,199
why they support him?

605
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,119
You just said yourself

606
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,400
that Huangman'er was born
with great strength.

607
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,679
But he has the mind of a child.

608
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,239
The royal clan is coveting North Liang.

609
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,760
There are countless foreign enemies.

610
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,320
How do you expect your brother

611
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,440
to take control over

612
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,440
such a situation?

613
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,840
Those who support him

614
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,800
don't know that?

615
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,480
Why do they choose Huangman'er?

616
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:20,840
Just because

617
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,440
he is naive

618
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,760
and easy to control.

619
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,440
If

620
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,639
your little brother

621
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,880
takes over North Liang,

622
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,800
he will become

623
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,199
a pawn of those schemers.

624
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,599
When that day comes,

625
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,519
the Xu family

626
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
will be doomed.

627
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,079
Ning Emei doesn't look like a schemer.

628
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,639
He certainly wasn't trying
to control your brother.

629
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,679
He just

630
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,679
admires Huangman'er.

631
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,719
Men like him in the army

632
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,719
are pawns

633
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,719
put on the surface by those people.

634
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,800
Then who are the people

635
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,639
trying to take this chance

636
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,360
to control North Liang?

637
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,519
I'm still looking into it.

638
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,119
No hurry.

639
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,119
Kill Ning Emei first.

640
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,239
That will be a wake-up call for them.

641
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,079
But I need a charge to kill Ning Emei.

642
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,599
The assassination
of Lord of North Liang's son.

643
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:08,880
There are only words

644
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,760
without evidence.

645
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,519
Who would believe it?

646
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,239
If I kill Ning Emei like this,

647
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,199
it will undermine
the morale of the army.

648
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,280
Who said there is no evidence?

649
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,159
Do you remember

650
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,360
someone sent your portrait
to the bandits

651
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,320
in the first round of assassination?

652
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,119
I'll find out

653
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,000
about the portrait for you.

654
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,800
He colluded with foreign enemies.

655
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,440
It's a crime deserving
the death penalty.

656
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,239
Was it really Ning Emei

657
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,440
who sent out the portrait?

658
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,599
Is it that important

659
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:41,039
whether he did it or not?

660
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,519
Who gave the portrait to the Chu people?

661
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,239
You gave them the portrait?

662
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:08,719
Look.

663
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,320
Look at it.

664
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,880
I picked one

665
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,599
that looks like you the most.

666
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,039
The Lord of Jing'an

667
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,599
plotted assassinations

668
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,199
for the fiscal power of Qingzhou,

669
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:31,960
and you played along

670
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,280
to root out dissenters.

671
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Ning Emei also
has supporters in the army.

672
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,280
As long as we convict him

673
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,760
of collusion with the enemy,

674
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,199
we can kill him.

675
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,119
Even he's innocent?

676
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,400
North Liang can't be in chaos.

677
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,360
We have to kill him

678
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,280
to stabilize the army.

679
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,360
North Liang can't be in chaos.

680
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,880
That's also what Chen Zhibao said.

681
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,159
He also knows it, right?

682
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,599
You're my oldest son.

683
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,079
What we did

684
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,000
is for your good.

685
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,719
I won't kill Ning Emei.

686
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,559
Fengnian.

687
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,639
Your last name is Xu.

688
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,599
To protect North Liang

689
00:41:19,639 --> 00:41:20,480
is one of

690
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,079
your inherent responsibilities.

691
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:22,599
So, I can kill innocent people

692
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,400
for the sake of North Liang?

693
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,800
I won't kill Ning Emei.

694
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:33,480
Okay.

695
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,079
You don't have to kill him.

696
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:42,800
There's a second option.

697
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,599
If

698
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,599
Huangman'er is gone,

699
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,400
there will be

700
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,119
no fight over power anymore.

701
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,400
Do you know what you're talking about?

702
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,480
That's not what I meant.

703
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,760
Even a vicious tiger
will not eat its cubs.

704
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
What do you mean by he is gone?

705
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,760
Make Huangman'er leave North Liang.

706
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,079
Enough!

707
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,320
Whether you kill Ning Emei

708
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,719
to punish those ambitious men
in the army,

709
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,639
or I send Huangman'er away

710
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,679
to solve this problem for good.

711
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,800
You have to make a choice.

712
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,719
I'm not going to choose either one.

713
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:24,400
North Liang occupies

714
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:25,519
the land of three states

715
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,239
and commands
the cavalry of 350,000 soldiers.

716
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,320
To guard such a vast land,

717
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,480
how can you not get blood on your hands?

718
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,400
That's why I said

719
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,079
I never wanted it!

720
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,360
What about North Liang's future?

721
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,239
Don't they call Chen Zhibao
the Little Slayer?

722
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,559
He is the ideal person!

723
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,119
I've made myself clear.

724
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:46,039
Huangman'er can't leave.

725
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,239
Ning Emei can't be killed.

726
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:51,639
So be it.
