1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

=Episode 37=

7
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,000
Back off!

8
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,400
You scared me.

9
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,599
In your condition,

10
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,775
even you are an immortal,

11
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,975
you can't kill anyone.

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,500
I'm not going to kill you,

13
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
but to damage your luck.

14
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,775
Xu Fengnian.

15
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,400
You didn't acquire Dahuangting

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,300
through your own effort.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm passing my own luck

18
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,350
and my martial arts

19
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,550
to you,

20
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:19,800
and also passing

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,975
my ordeals to you.

22
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:23,439
Nothing would happen to you

23
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,719
if you had been practicing martial arts
since childhood.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,900
But now,

25
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,800
your internal force
will be out of whack.

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,000
No one can save you.

27
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,075
Even if my soul is going to perish,

28
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,450
I must kill you
in front of Deng Tai'e first.

29
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:03,000
The luck-changing technique?

30
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,050
You are that old man's disciple?

31
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,200
Xu...

32
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,759
Why did you save me?

33
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,220
Your Highness! Your Highness!

34
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,925
Your Highness.

35
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,360
Because your mother gave me a chance

36
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,900
when I was desperate.

37
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,625
Here.

38
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,560
I'll kill

39
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,560
whoever tries to kill you.

40
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,240
We'll meet again.

41
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,319
Two coins for one word by then.

42
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,560
All right.

43
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,720
It's a deal.

44
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,300
That will be

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,425
a new-year gift for you.

46
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,775
Are you a dog?

47
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:04,279
The girl behind me,

48
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,519
only I can bully her,

49
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,100
but you can't.

50
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,550
(Cake Pastry)

51
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,350
I was born to owe something
to this world.

52
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,875
I wish everything was ruined!

53
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:42,975
Xu Fengnian.

54
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,040
Even you are going to die,

55
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,450
you must die in my hands.

56
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:02,399
Trust me.

57
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,959
I can defend the world and you.

58
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,025
Where is that girl?

59
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,319
She has left.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
She didn't say anything?

61
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,360
No.

62
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,275
The bitterest battle in this world

63
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,500
is over.

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,125
(Wudi City)

65
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,500
I think I'm okay.

66
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,975
I just feel a little dizzy.

67
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,575
That man from Mount Longhu

68
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,875
passed his martial arts

69
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,100
to Your Highness before he died.

70
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,125
He wanted

71
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,100
to mess with your internal force

72
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,560
and damage your luck,

73
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,825
but

74
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:05,200
Miss Hehe

75
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,480
stopped him

76
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,975
and took his luck for you.

77
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:09,975
Your Highness,

78
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,600
you are almost fit now.

79
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,075
You only need to rest for a few days.

80
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,975
What will happen to that girl?

81
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't know.

82
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,500
The luck-changing technique is rare.

83
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,125
I don't know much about it.

84
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,375
Since she knows

85
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,625
such a rare technique,

86
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,839
it means someone taught it to her.

87
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:27,200
Nothing serious is gonna happen to her.

88
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:28,600
Senior Li.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,750
Are you finished?

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,050
Yes.

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,759
Did Deng Tai'e give it to you?

92
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,325
Yes.

93
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:34,600
Where is Senior Deng?

94
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,800
He's gone.

95
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,875
He really left it to me?

96
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:41,240
He left you the flying swords
and passed you his swordplay.

97
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,725
He's generous to you.

98
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:44,920
Observe the flying swords
when you have time

99
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,575
and think about his moves today.

100
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,084
Didn't you ask me

101
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:50,725
to go my own way

102
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,425
and not to learn from others?

103
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:53,439
With me teaching Sword Intent,

104
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,350
there is no need to learn from others.

105
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,240
But the flying swords of Deng Tai'e

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,950
can be used for reference.

107
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,175
It's just that the sword is too delicate

108
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:02,199
in such a bright color.

109
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,575
It's the taste of little girls

110
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:04,825
under the age of eight.

111
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,075
I'm glad Senior Deng left,

112
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,725
or you would fight again.

113
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:10,000
So what?

114
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm no match for Wang Xianzhi,

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,125
but I can beat Deng Tai'e.

116
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:14,625
Did you lose

117
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,399
above the East Sea?

118
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,525
The battle is still up in the air.

119
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,279
But I think I would lose
if we keep fighting.

120
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:22,759
You are not finished?

121
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,040
We stopped.

122
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,950
Heaven's Gate will reopen
if we keep fighting.

123
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,325
Is there really an Immortal Realm?

124
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,680
What's different about immortals?

125
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:31,680
They're all idiots
who think they're immortals.

126
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,775
Do you know the secrets
of the Immortal Realm?

127
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,120
You don't need to know

128
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,250
that kind of meaningless thing.

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,360
With your ability,

130
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,450
that place is a long way off.

131
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:42,879
If you say so.

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
But then again,

133
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
if this battle wasn't finished,

134
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,100
you didn't lose.

135
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,175
Maybe Wang Xianzhi would be exhausted

136
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:49,800
if you keep fighting.

137
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,375
If you lose, you lose.

138
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,080
Wang Xianzhi has a solid foundation,

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,799
and he learns quickly.

140
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,200
He's been cultivating himself steadily

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,159
and he has won
almost every great martial artist

142
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,200
to hone his skill.

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,400
I wasted a few years,

144
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,975
and I can't win with one arm.

145
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,000
Anyway, in my heart,

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
you are the best in the world.

147
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,075
Who cares?

148
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,425
Having fun is what's important.

149
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,919
But during that battle,

150
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,700
Wang Xianzhi used
nine-tenths of his force.

151
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,360
I'm afraid there are only a few people

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
who can force him to this point.

153
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,500
He didn't do his best?

154
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,120
If Wang Xianzhi does his best,

155
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I'm afraid only Lyuzu 500 years ago

156
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,519
can get an edge over him!

157
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
Is he that strong?

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,679
Um.

159
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,200
Are we still gonna stay in Wudi City?

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,325
Of course.

161
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,960
Let's run now!

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
I even took Old Huang's sword box.

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,240
Just take it.

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,025
Wang Xianzhi will still do me
such a little favor.

165
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,850
Well,

166
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:52,720
how big a favor do you think
he can do for you?

167
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,100
What do you want?

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,525
Can I talk to Wang Xianzhi?

169
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,475
Why do the people of Mount Longhu
want to kill you?

170
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,639
To weed the country
of treacherous people.

171
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,440
Who are they?

172
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:31,840
Me,

173
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:33,519
and Xu Fengnian.

174
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:35,440
Both of us.

175
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,519
Hold on.

176
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,360
I can understand
that Xu Fengnian is treacherous.

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
After all, North Liang is a big threat
for the court.

178
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:42,919
What about you?

179
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,975
Didn't you say you are a prince?

180
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,919
It can't be helped.

181
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,159
I'm an illegitimate son.

182
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,320
The real reason
I want to kill Xu Fengnian

183
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,240
is to instigate a war,

184
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:55,000
so that I can take the chance
to hold military power.

185
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,759
Now I've been seen through.

186
00:10:58,675 --> 00:10:59,875
It makes sense

187
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:02,275
that they want to kill me.

188
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,480
Who has seen through you?

189
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,159
Mount Longhu?

190
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,960
Mount Longhu is only the enforcer.

191
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:10,759
The person behind this

192
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,799
is probably Zhang Julu.

193
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:14,039
That old man is shrewd.

194
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,759
It's too hard to keep anything from him.

195
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,759
So you know why Mount Longhu
wants to kill you?

196
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,240
Yes.

197
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:22,874
If I were them,

198
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,650
I would do the same thing.

199
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:27,559
Kill me

200
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,480
to prevent future chaos.

201
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:32,639
Since I refuse to be average,

202
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:34,720
I should take all the consequences

203
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
on my own.

204
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,325
I can't blame anyone else.

205
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,500
You even figured out who is behind this?

206
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,450
Yeah.

207
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:46,975
Then why do you still look so confused?

208
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,450
I just can't figure out

209
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,100
why he saved me.

210
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:57,775
He recognized the Fujiang Armor

211
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,550
and confirmed that I've been trying
to kill him along the way.

212
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,000
We should be dead enemies now.

213
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,279
Why did he save me?

214
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,650
Because he wants
to make friends with you?

215
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,879
If I've been trying
to kill you all the time,

216
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,525
would you want to make friends with me?

217
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,125
I can't think of anything else.

218
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,675
I can't figure it out.

219
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,759
Never mind, let's go.

220
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,375
Go back to Wudi City?

221
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:33,360
Yeah.

222
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,435
To do what?

223
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,900
To kill Xu Fengnian.

224
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,320
He is still alive and kicking.

225
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,919
He saved you.

226
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,100
Are you still going to kill him?

227
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,675
I'm grateful to him in my heart,

228
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,759
but it doesn't conflict
with killing him.

229
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,840
It's hard to get both you want.

230
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,480
There is no need to go.

231
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Grand Master!

232
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,900
(Wudi City)

233
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:27,075
Wang Xianzhi!

234
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,600
Are you sleeping?

235
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,159
Let's have a chat!

236
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,440
Is that gonna get him to show up?

237
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:54,525
What's the matter?

238
00:13:56,425 --> 00:13:57,925
He wants to see you!

239
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:03,559
The 12 Flying Swords of Deng Tai'e?

240
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,000
He gave it to him.

241
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,550
You are lucky.

242
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,400
Nice to meet you, Senior Wang.

243
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,659
I'm Xu Fengnian.

244
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,159
I need to ask for one favor from you.

245
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,300
No.

246
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:16,679
Two favors.

247
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
I need to ask for two favors from you.

248
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,125
Favors?

249
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,639
Go ahead.

250
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,025
The first thing

251
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,600
is that I want to borrow
a good carriage from you.

252
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,840
To be frank with you,

253
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,100
I'm injured.

254
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,820
I don't want to go back by water.

255
00:14:30,475 --> 00:14:32,925
You killed six martial slaves
in Wudi City,

256
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,925
and you took the relic of Jian Jiuhuang.

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,375
Now you are asking me for a carriage?

258
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,440
I didn't kill those six men.

259
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:42,764
I'm not capable of doing that.

260
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,600
As for Old Huang's relic,

261
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,240
I will give you an account.

262
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,050
How?

263
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,050
Old Huang and Sword God Li

264
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,875
are my elders!

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,375
I will take over

266
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,450
what they left undone!

267
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,725
Dying in a battle
is the fate of Old Huang

268
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,750
as a martial artist. He had no regrets.

269
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,275
I never

270
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,350
blamed you for that.

271
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,575
As for Senior Li's battle today...

272
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,900
I also lost.

273
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,480
The battle is not won yet.

274
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,240
Okay!

275
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,080
It's not won yet.

276
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,800
One defeat and one draw.

277
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:31,600
They both didn't win you.

278
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,080
Senior Wang,

279
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:35,975
give me some time!

280
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,039
I, Xu Fengnian, hereby swear to heaven

281
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,775
that I will return to Wudi City one day

282
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,200
and have a final battle with you

283
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,960
above the East Sea

284
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,240
for the sake of Sword God Li

285
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,825
and Old Huang!

286
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,840
Are you challenging me?

287
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,050
Yes!

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,240
Not only to challenge you,

289
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,125
I will beat you!

290
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,639
Young people now are bold indeed.

291
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:14,559
All right.

292
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,700
I'm gonna be crazy today, too.

293
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,600
I've never won you in my life.

294
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,125
Wang Xianzhi.

295
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,875
I'll give my last chance

296
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,800
to this boy.

297
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,360
Do you trust him?

298
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,525
What's good about the way of swords?

299
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,225
The good thing

300
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,850
is that it can be passed on!

301
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:41,960
Among the young people today,

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,879
you are the first one

303
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,275
who dares to challenge me in my face.

304
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm afraid

305
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,425
you will also be the last one.

306
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:51,500
All right.

307
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,150
I'll wait for you.

308
00:16:58,525 --> 00:16:59,759
Thank you, Senior Wang!

309
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,100
When I return to Wudi City,

310
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,200
I'll give the carriage back to you.

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,850
I'll have someone send you the carriage.

312
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,750
The second thing

313
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,950
is that I heard from someone

314
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,799
that you were also in the capital

315
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,925
when my mother was attacked.

316
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,920
You've been looking for
the one who killed my mother?

317
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,119
Since Lady died,

318
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,300
I've been looking into it.

319
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,839
Everything I found out about the killer

320
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,200
over these years
has been recorded in it.

321
00:17:42,425 --> 00:17:43,825
I was in the capital

322
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,650
at that time.

323
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:49,079
It was recorded in a booklet

324
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:50,700
of my family
who have been investigating it.

325
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,975
But no one has ever seen you
as a suspect.

326
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,625
Because we all know

327
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,680
that if it was you who did it,

328
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,785
my mother would never
make it out of the capital alive.

329
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,799
My presence in the capital
had nothing to do with her.

330
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,025
I just want to ask you

331
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,050
who besieged and killed my mother.

332
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,880
I saw a few people

333
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,279
who weren't supposed to be
in the capital,

334
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,175
but I didn't see them

335
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:15,075
during the battle.

336
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,625
Was this person in the capital that day?

337
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:38,200
(Han Diaosi)
Yes.

338
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,519
Thank you, Senior Wang.

339
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:56,975
Who else was there

340
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:58,925
besides him?

341
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,375
I don't remember the names.

342
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,039
I only remember

343
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,319
I saw some people from North Mang
in the capital.

344
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,759
People from North Mang?

345
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,559
Martial artists?

346
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
I guess.

347
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,425
For me,

348
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:16,850
they were all the same.

349
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,700
The royal family of Liyang

350
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,575
joined hands with their enemy

351
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,640
to ambush their own official.

352
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,375
How absurd.

353
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:27,840
Take it easy.

354
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,450
Thank you, Senior Wang.

355
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,640
What are you going to do?

356
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,700
I think it's time for me
to get on another trip

357
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:34,829
after I get home.

358
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,175
Are you going to North Mang?

359
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:40,800
Yes.

360
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,850
Don't forget our engagement.

361
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:46,000
Rest assured.

362
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,640
I won't die in North Mang.

363
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,400
Senior Wang!

364
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,240
There is one last thing.

365
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,240
That's the third thing you're asking.

366
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,225
What did Old Huang say before he died?

367
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,850
Come on.

368
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,759
Bring wine

369
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:30,625
to His Highness.

370
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
Which way was he looking?

371
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,075
North.

372
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,720
Your Highness.

373
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,559
Wait for me.

374
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,839
I'll bring you the wine of the East Sea
and we will drink together.

375
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay.

376
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,700
You filled the cup!

377
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,680
Qingniao, get in the carriage.

378
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,794
Senior, you too.

379
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,025
(Wudi City)

380
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,425
Your Highness, you leave first.

381
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:46,045
I'll get Fengzi Battalion's brothers

382
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:47,225
and catch up with you soon.

383
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,359
Shu Xiu, you go with him.

384
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,160
Tell the boatman to go back
down the river

385
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,950
and send them to North Liang.

386
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,135
Yes.

387
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,025
Let's go.

388
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,875
(Wudi City)

389
00:22:30,275 --> 00:22:30,890
Go.

390
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,875
(Wudi City)

391
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,875
Go to West Shu?

392
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,359
Cao Changqing
and the Princess of West Chu

393
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,675
have arrived in Shu.

394
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,400
The survivors of Chu
are ready to take action.

395
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,475
The court believes
that there will be turmoil in Shu.

396
00:22:56,925 --> 00:22:57,914
This is a chance.

397
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,875
Exactly.

398
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,300
The court needs someone
to go to Shu and put down the riot.

399
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,880
Could it be me?

400
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,850
Who else could it be?

401
00:23:08,175 --> 00:23:09,000
But,

402
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,160
it's not supposed to be me.

403
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,975
Xu Xiao can't go there.

404
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,225
If North Liang takes over West Shu,

405
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,450
the whole world will be surnamed Xu.

406
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,675
What about Gu Jiantang?

407
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:23,825
Gu Jiantang called in sick.

408
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,039
His Majesty dares not

409
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,850
set free a tiger like him
back to the mountains.

410
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,519
That's right.

411
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:32,775
The person who commands the army
in West Shu

412
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,675
must be trusted by His Majesty.

413
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,319
Grand Master.

414
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:40,950
But,

415
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,634
there are also other princes.

416
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:44,839
I...

417
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,025
Who are willing

418
00:23:48,975 --> 00:23:52,275
to risk their lives
and fight against Cao Changqing?

419
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,640
They are either hesitant

420
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,725
or scared.

421
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,880
This is the chance of a lifetime.

422
00:23:58,425 --> 00:23:59,599
I got the mission

423
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,279
of quelling the unrest in West Shu

424
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,000
for you.

425
00:24:04,425 --> 00:24:05,425
This is

426
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,250
His Majesty's imperial secret edict.

427
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,359
But Cao Changqing
is difficult to deal with.

428
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,975
I'll go to the west with you.

429
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,625
More importantly,

430
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,425
you don't have to make an enemy
of Cao Changqing.

431
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,079
Let me ask you.

432
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:46,799
What's the ultimate goal
of the Chu people?

433
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,850
To go back home?

434
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:48,900
That's right.

435
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,500
Hiding in Shu
is only a temporary measure.

436
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,279
After Cao Changqing
and the Princess of West Chu

437
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,839
gather those veterans together...

438
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,200
They will leave West Shu

439
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,240
and go back to Chu.

440
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,440
By that time,

441
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,750
there will be no one in West Shu
who can hold you back.

442
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,680
You are the rightful commander

443
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,000
of the military.

444
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,100
At that time,

445
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,275
you will be the new Lord of West Shu.

446
00:25:13,675 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm afraid that His Majesty
would issue an order

447
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:17,750
and take back my power at that time.

448
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,125
Will you take such an order?

449
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,625
Of course not.

450
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:31,200
After I take control of Shu,

451
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
the next step
is to reach beyond the border.

452
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,625
Beyond the border,

453
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,700
the wildness area?

454
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,050
After the wilderness
and West Shu are stitched together,

455
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,050
it will provide me with the groundwork
for taking control of the Central Plains.

456
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,125
I'll become an unshakable Lord of Shu

457
00:25:48,225 --> 00:25:50,525
in the worst situation.

458
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,450
You are able to foresee that.

459
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,350
My teachings over these years
have not been wasted.

460
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,000
Grand Master, thank you

461
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,400
for seizing such a good chance for me.

462
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,680
Say no more.

463
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,050
Let's set off for West Shu immediately.

464
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,525
Who is this guy?

465
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,100
Yuan Tingshan.

466
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,825
He used to be a retainer
of the Xuanyuan Family.

467
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:18,759
Now he is driven desperate

468
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,050
and he can be used.

469
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm willing to be a blade
for the Lord of Shu

470
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,075
to kill all the enemies.

471
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,275
This world has
finally given me a chance.

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,839
A chance

473
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:45,119
to make a great coup.

474
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,950
We're finally going back.

475
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,500
Eh.

476
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,350
Kid.

477
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,000
Let me see the flying swords
of Deng Tai'e one more time.

478
00:27:02,175 --> 00:27:03,800
Qingniao, open it for me.

479
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,000
Do you also know this sword array?

480
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,700
In the beginning,
there are thousands of ways of swords,

481
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,550
but all the ways seem to lead
to the same destination.

482
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:25,100
But it's just an illusion.

483
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,200
Kid.

484
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,039
No ways lead to the same destination.

485
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:29,519
The flying swords of Deng Tai'e

486
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,519
and my sword

487
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,279
look similar,

488
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,725
but they are totally different.

489
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:34,119
It's hard to explain to you.

490
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,100
The more I say,
the harder for you to understand.

491
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:36,575
Figure it out yourself.

492
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,025
Excellent.

493
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,900
You deserve a reward.

494
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,200
The Fengzi Battalion is back.

495
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:38,400
Let's go home!

496
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:18,925
Grand Master.

497
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
Why are we taking so many turns
along the way?

498
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,325
In case someone should block our way.

499
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,475
Will anyone block my way?

500
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,550
We must be careful all the time.

501
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,350
Why don't we speed up the horses?

502
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,799
The horses also need to rest.

503
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,680
Don't wear the horses out
in the middle of the road.

504
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:34,759
Grand Master.

505
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,160
Wang Xianzhi and Li Chungang

506
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,950
could fly to the sky.

507
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:42,125
They used their genuine spirit.

508
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:44,575
Can you do it?

509
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,025
You tell me.

510
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,625
Xu Fengnian is also on his way home.

511
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,700
Do you even know that?

512
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:56,625
I have someone keep an eye on him
from a distance.

513
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,475
When we were resting along the way,

514
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:01,680
there were spies reporting
Xu Fengnian's whereabouts.

515
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,625
Is there a need to keep an eye on him?

516
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,550
If I can become the Lord of Shu,

517
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,275
I won't have to kill him.

518
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:12,839
Actually...

519
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:13,975
I've been thinking all the way

520
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,039
that you said

521
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,600
Xu Fengnian saved your life
in Wudi City.

522
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,500
It doesn't make sense.

523
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,700
Could it be that Xu Fengnian knew

524
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,225
we are going to command the military
in West Shu?

525
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,575
How could he know the secret edict?

526
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,650
Even if he knew,

527
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,250
why did he save Zhao Kai?

528
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,400
West Shu and North Liang
can join hands to become more powerful.

529
00:30:31,575 --> 00:30:33,475
Xu Fengnian
is the next Lord of North Liang.

530
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:35,250
If he makes an alliance
with the Lord of Shu,

531
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,125
he can rest assured without anxiety.

532
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,440
There is some truth in that.

533
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:42,640
It still doesn't make sense.

534
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,675
Xu Fengnian was thousands of miles away
from the court.

535
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:47,160
How could he know
what the court would do?

536
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:48,700
Furthermore,

537
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,240
when we were in Wudi City,

538
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,925
Grand Master hadn't come yet.

539
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:54,400
I didn't even know
that I would go to West Shu.

540
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:56,050
Anyway,

541
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,039
Xu Fengnian had no reason to save you.

542
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,839
There is something odd about it.

543
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,900
So I had

544
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,800
spies keep an eye on him along the way.

545
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,700
Where did you get so many spies?

546
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,125
After all these years,

547
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,680
I should build some forces for myself.

548
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,425
It will all be yours one day.

549
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:17,550
Grand Master.

550
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:19,800
If it weren't for you,

551
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,839
I wouldn't be here today.

552
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,160
If it weren't for your mother,

553
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,525
I wouldn't be here today, either.

554
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:27,920
All right, enough with this.

555
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,750
The spies reported

556
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,525
that Xu Fengnian and his entourage
are heading for North Liang.

557
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,680
Based on the distance,

558
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,429
even they want to block us,

559
00:31:35,775 --> 00:31:36,640
they can't.

560
00:31:37,325 --> 00:31:38,475
That's foolproof then.

561
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:39,640
During these days,

562
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,160
Xu Fengnian has been in the carriage
and never showed up.

563
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,025
Is he injured?

564
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:45,150
I don't know.

565
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,825
Your spies

566
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,825
can't block and search them, right?

567
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,000
Xu Fengnian and his entourage

568
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:56,500
are almost past Guangling.

569
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,900
What's that?

570
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:31,640
I sent a message to Zhao Yi,
Lord of Guangling.

571
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:32,925
Zhao Yi?

572
00:32:33,675 --> 00:32:34,839
That guy

573
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,525
is notorious among the vassals.

574
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,164
What message did you send to him?

575
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,279
Nothing important.

576
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,650
I mentioned two things.

577
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,000
One is

578
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,799
that the court is not happy

579
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,625
about Xu Fengnian leaving Wudi City

580
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,175
successfully.

581
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:49,600
What's the other thing?

582
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,075
Xu Fengnian
is accompanied by a beauty.

583
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,425
Zhao Yi and his son are lascivious.

584
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,100
Do you want to

585
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,079
use Zhao Yi's

586
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,200
Guangling Army

587
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,240
to test Xu Fengnian?

588
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,279
Although that guy

589
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,525
is notorious,

590
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,765
he is no fool.

591
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,650
Would he dare to harm Xu Fengnian?

592
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,000
Why would he harm Xu Fengnian?

593
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,480
Just scare Xu Fengnian with the army

594
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,240
to make the court look good

595
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,039
and then take the girl away.

596
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,075
It's just a girl.

597
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,050
What can North Liang say?

598
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,275
Xu Fengnian

599
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,575
won't give her away.

600
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:27,525
Zhao Yi doesn't know
what kind of person Xu Fengnian is.

601
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,200
With the way he handles things,

602
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,475
a girl

603
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:34,300
is not as important as an object.

604
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:18,825
Senior Li.

605
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,750
It's Zhao Yi's Guangling Army.

606
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,600
Senior Li.

607
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:06,300
It looks like there are
over a thousand soldiers.

608
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,300
I finally got a good sleep.

609
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,199
It's so troublesome.

610
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:12,075
(Tingchao Pavilion)

611
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,550
(Tablet of Zhao Changling
Tablet of Chen Qiong)

612
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,900
(Tablet of Wang Jian)

613
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,275
People all think

614
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,079
(Tablet of Shao Jingui)
that you will trap yourself

615
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,275
(Tablet of Dong Dashun)
on the top of Tingchao Pavilion forever.

616
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,840
Today is the Memorial Day
of my brothers.

617
00:38:24,675 --> 00:38:25,800
How can I not come?

618
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,079
Besides,

619
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,639
my prison is Tingchao Pavilion.

620
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,525
My activities

621
00:38:33,525 --> 00:38:35,679
are restricted to Tingchao Pavilion.

622
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,119
Whether it's on the top

623
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:37,975
or beneath the ground,

624
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,375
I'm still

625
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:41,280
inside Tingchao Pavilion.

626
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,679
I've never crossed the border.

627
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,800
Well,

628
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,320
we do this every year.

629
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:56,440
There are fewer and fewer people

630
00:38:57,275 --> 00:38:58,480
around us

631
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:00,559
but more and more

632
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,079
spirit tablets.

633
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,079
Finally,

634
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,650
we've gained world peace.

635
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:14,639
But they

636
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,360
can't see it.

637
00:39:19,325 --> 00:39:20,600
They are seeing it now.

638
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,550
They've been seeing it.

639
00:39:27,025 --> 00:39:30,800
Li Chungang defeated more than 2,000 soldiers
with one slash of his sword.

640
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,775
The Guangling Army is terrified.

641
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:37,825
Do you hear it?

642
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:41,300
Do you hear it?

643
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:42,800
It's the one,

644
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,480
the Sword God Li

645
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,239
who had been with you

646
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,440
for years.

647
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,639
He showed

648
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,075
his power this time.

649
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:52,719
Fengnian

650
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,675
didn't show up.

651
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
You know what,

652
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:01,175
I've got everything prepared this time

653
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,400
for his trip to the martial world.

654
00:40:05,275 --> 00:40:08,280
Let it be Qingzhou

655
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,599
or Jiangnan,

656
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,150
my plan

657
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,760
is basically seamless.

658
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:17,679
Chen Zhibao

659
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,960
never showed up in the camp.

660
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,480
No one

661
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,325
knows his whereabouts.

662
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:32,275
I can't believe

663
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,950
Fengnian pulled off his plan

664
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,875
when I got everything planned.

665
00:40:38,675 --> 00:40:40,275
He even fooled me!

666
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,679
I didn't know

667
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,275
what he was doing

668
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,559
until the end.

669
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:52,920
If he followed

670
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:56,280
your plan all the time,

671
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:57,900
he would become

672
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,625
another Xu Xiao.

673
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:03,800
Um.

674
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,300
He chose

675
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:15,125
a different path from mine.

676
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,794
It's a path

677
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,719
I never dared to set foot on.

678
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,559
My son,

679
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,639
Xu Fengnian,

680
00:41:28,075 --> 00:41:30,119
will break my chains on him

681
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,320
and face the world in his own way!

682
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,800
He is the next Lord of North Liang!

683
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,000
He will keep the flag of North Liang
flying in the air

684
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,675
and guard

685
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,975
the world we built together!

686
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,400
Are you satisfied

687
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,875
with such a future

688
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,075
and such a Lord of North Liang?

689
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:14,325
Our time

690
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,700
is finally coming to an end.

691
00:42:19,925 --> 00:42:21,119
North Liang

692
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:25,775
has a new lord now.
