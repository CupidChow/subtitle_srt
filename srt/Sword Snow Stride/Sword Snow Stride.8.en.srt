(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

(Hong Xixiang

(Wudang)

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,480
(Wang Chonglou Master of Wudang Sect)
The Master of Wudang Sect

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,039
came down the mountain to
welcome you in person.

11
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,440
It appears Wudang and North Liang
have a good relationship.

12
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Where is Huangman'er?

14
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,039
Who left him here?

15
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,159
Master.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,679
It must have been a long journey,
Mr. Chu.

17
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,079
Greetings, Master Wang.

18
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,200
And this is…

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
The last disciple of my master,

20
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,280
the youngest junior of mine.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,319
Hong Xixiang.

22
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,519
He shares the same seniority with you?

23
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,519
Exactly.

24
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,280
If things don't go wrong,

25
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,519
he'll be the next Master of Wudang.

26
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,719
Hong Xixiang,

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,560
don't you think you owed
the Xu family enough?

28
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,239
That was what your father wanted.
What could I do?

29
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,120
Mr. Chu is our guest.

30
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,879
Junior,

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,959
come and say hello.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,319
Mr. Chu.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Good, good.

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,840
Take me to him.

35
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,239
Senior,

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,519
how about you take them up
the mountain?

37
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
You come with us.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,159
I'd like to herd the cattle
for a little longer.

39
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,680
That's unimportant.

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,359
Your Highness.

41
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
Mr. Chu. This way, please.

42
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,359
Come, come.

43
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:28,760
Your Highness.

44
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,840
This way, please.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,280
Please.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,879
Your Highness, please.

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,039
Brother.

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,919
Brother.

49
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,080
Brother.

50
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,159
I was thinking of you,

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:12,879
and here you are.

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,599
Are you okay?

53
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm fine.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,520
Have you got your strength?

55
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm glad to know.

56
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,879
Come.

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,599
Come home with me.

58
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,919
What?

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,840
Father said,

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,960
I can't go home.

61
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,159
I say you can, and my word counts.

62
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
But Father said,

63
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,360
if I went home,

64
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,360
I'd bring trouble to you.

65
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:39,680
I don't mind any trouble.

66
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:41,919
Don't be anxious, Your Highness.

67
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,360
Calm yourself first.

68
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you trying to stop me?

69
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
It's your family business.
How dare I stop you?

70
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,560
I'm only suggesting you think clearly.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,080
After your little brother
goes back to North Liang,

72
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,240
what would be waiting for him?

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,080
I'll secure him.

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,680
I won't allow him to be used.

75
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,719
Can you stay by his side forever?

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,919
Why can't I?

77
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,319
Are you going to

78
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,400
chain up your brother?

79
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,360
I know your brotherly bond is strong,

80
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:19,840
but have you ever thought

81
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,159
what if the ones
who support your brother

82
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,759
do something against you?

83
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,159
I'll deal with them.

84
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,159
What if the ones who support you

85
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,560
do something against your brother?

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,000
Who dare do it?

87
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,919
In a power struggling,
anything is possible.

88
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,879
If you take him home like this,

89
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
you're pushing him

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,800
into an abyss.

91
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,319
You'd better think before you act.

92
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:00,439
Come.

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,199
Where are you taking him?

94
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,519
I'll take him on a tour around Wudang.

95
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,240
Before you make a decision,

96
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,480
I won't do anything.

97
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,399
I won't go.

98
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:23,720
I'll just stay here.

99
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,680
Come.

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,600
I haven't visited Wudang for years.

101
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,800
I'll take a look around.

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,839
How about we

103
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
sit and talk inside?

104
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,400
(Purple Bamboo Forest)

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
(Wang Xiaoping
No. 1 Swordsman of Wudang)

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,879
What's on your mind, Your Highness?

107
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,040
Did I upset my brother?

108
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Not you.

109
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,000
But why did Father say

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,600
it'd be bad for my brother

111
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:50,959
if I went home?

112
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,319
It's because your brother
isn't cruel enough.

113
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,959
And that's not good?

114
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,720
That is good.

115
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,560
(Purple Bamboo Forest)
It's just the human world is like hell,

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,879
and the soft-hearted gets hurt.

117
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,319
I can protect him.

118
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,480
Junior,

119
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,120
how come you left Purple Bamboo Forest?

120
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,079
This is the second son of His Lordship.

121
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,319
A born talent.

122
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,680
With a pure heart.

123
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,439
Good.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,079
How about His Highness

125
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,040
lives in the Purple Bamboo Forest?

126
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
From the perspective of the heart,

127
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
across the entire Mount Wudang,

128
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,839
you're the one who

129
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,519
resembles His Highness the most.

130
00:08:59,439 --> 00:08:59,839
Okay.

131
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,519
I pretty much got it.

132
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
Someone wanted to
steal the power from you

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,240
using your brother

134
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,319
as a pretext.

135
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,839
I never wanted
the sovereignty of North Liang.

136
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,000
How about you give it to him?

137
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,439
Huangman'er has a pure heart

138
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,439
and is unsophisticated.

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
If I gave him North Liang,

140
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,160
someday, those who support him

141
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,720
would take his life.

142
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,680
Then the result

143
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,000
would be the same
as His Lordship predicts.

144
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,519
There are only two options.

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,800
One, your brother
never returns to North Liang again.

146
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,759
Two, you wipe out all those

147
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
ambitious men in the army.

148
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
I must make a decision.

149
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,120
But which person

150
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:02,960
is behind your brother?

151
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,519
He's too well-hidden.

152
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,799
Even Xu Xiao couldn't find him.

153
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, that's easy.

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,519
Now that your brother
can't return to North Liang,

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you keep him here in Wudang for now.

156
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,759
If you miss him, you can come
and see him anytime you like.

157
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,799
This is where the problem lies.

158
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,679
Can Wudang

159
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,200
secure him?

160
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a large sect.

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Surely we can secure him.

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,080
You need to understand one thing.

163
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,919
Those who support Huangman'er

164
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
aren't necessarily the North Liang Army.

165
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Who are they, then?

166
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,519
Who wants North Liang to fall apart

167
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,080
the most?

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,960
Liyang Royal Family.

169
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,919
In their eyes,

170
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,039
Huangman'er is a great tool
to break the balance.

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,159
Wudang is but a martial-world sect.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Can you cope with the royal power?

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,120
Don't worry.

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,519
Would they come here
to take him away by force?

175
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,280
(Capital City Liyang Imperial Palace)

176
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,279
Sun Diaosi.

177
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:43,519
(Zhao Fengya Princess Suizhu of Liyang)
Have you got the Xu brothers' traces?

178
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,679
Your Grace,

179
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,519
(Sun Diaosi, the eunuch)
Xu Fengnian

180
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,799
and Xu Longxiang

181
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,120
both left Lingzhou

182
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,799
for Wudang one after another.

183
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,840
(Mount Wudang)

184
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Okay.

185
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,279
Let's go to Wudang as well.

186
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,879
Three years ago, Xu Fengnian
broke off our betrothal,

187
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
making me a laughing stock
in the capital city.

188
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,360
How dare a son of a martial man

189
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,440
humiliate the royal family?

190
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,399
I'll pay the humiliation I had
three years ago

191
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,759
back to him on Mount Wudang.

192
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,440
The wimpy Taoist

193
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,320
is gone?

194
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,399
He was afraid of my punches.

195
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,279
He sneaked off.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,360
What about your brother?

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,159
He can't go back to North Liang,

198
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:53,519
but I don't know

199
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,320
where to put him

200
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,639
to keep away from the royal family.

201
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,000
Before I figure out a solution,

202
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,159
I'll stay here in Wudang.

203
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
I feel like

204
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,039
there won't be a solution.

205
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,440
I'll keep thinking.

206
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:13,320
Is it true that the young Taoist

207
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,840
will be the next Master of Wudang?

208
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,559
Yes.

209
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,639
Then why did you beat him right here?

210
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:25,519
He owed me.

211
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,039
Owed you what?

212
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,440
He failed my sister.

213
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,759
That young Taoist?

214
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,360
My family often came to Wudang,

215
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,039
and over time,

216
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,879
my eldest sister started
to have feelings for the young Taoist.

217
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,120
And then?

218
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Nothing particular.

219
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,480
The young Taoist refused
to go down the mountain

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,600
and my sister

221
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,559
married someone in Jiangnan.

222
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,679
Did he promise her
that he'd go down the mountain?

223
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Never.

224
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
Then it wasn't his fault.

225
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,879
Though he never said it,

226
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,159
everybody could tell that

227
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,960
he was into my sister.

228
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,279
Since they had feelings for each other,

229
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,679
how come they weren't together?

230
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,639
Did his Master forbid him?

231
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,840
He made a vow that

232
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,320
before becoming the best martial artist,

233
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
he wouldn't go down the mountain.

234
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Then he'll never

235
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,360
be able to go down the mountain
in this life.

236
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,240
And Sister refused
to get on the mountain.

237
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:35,960
Forget it.

238
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,799
It isn't important.

239
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,519
What matters the most now
is Huangman'er.

240
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,639
Before I work out a solution,

241
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,960
I'm afraid
you'll have to stay here, too.

242
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,919
Xu Fengnian.

243
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,399
Little Jiang Ni?

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,679
Is there something wrong with my ears?

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,720
Xu.

246
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,440
Feng.

247
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,200
Nian.

248
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,519
It is you.

249
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,639
What are you doing here?

250
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,279
Why don't you speak?

251
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,600
You bad guy.

252
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,799
What did I do?

253
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,080
Do you have any idea how heavy this is?

254
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,639
I carried it all the way
up the mountain.

255
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm exhausted.

256
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,200
What is that?

257
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,720
Clothes for change.

258
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:12,679
Writing brushes, ink sticks,
paper, and inkstone.

259
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,759
You came to Wudang without
any of them,

260
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,919
and I had to carry all the stuff here.

261
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
Xu Xiao guessed

262
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:20,679
that I'd be living in Wudang
for a while.

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,080
He knows you too well.

264
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,559
Why did he send you here?

265
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,240
He learned about me lending the horse.

266
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:29,440
It was all your fault.

267
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,120
You came up by yourself?

268
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,879
The carriage only took me to
the foot of the mountain.

269
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,440
You didn't go back?

270
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,919
Xu Xiao asked you to look after me
in Wudang.

271
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,120
You'll live a miserable life.

272
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,919
Are you a dog?

273
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,279
You two can have the room.

274
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,480
I'll find a place to live myself.

275
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,840
Call me if you have trouble.

276
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:03,960
Sir.

277
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,440
Too bad.

278
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
There's no room

279
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,399
for another bed.

280
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,200
Fine.

281
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,600
Your bed's ready.

282
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,839
So comfortable.

283
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Are you sure?

284
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:09,920
Do you really not need me

285
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,039
to swap bed with you?

286
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:13,359
No.

287
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,079
You're just going to sit there
all night?

288
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm happy to.

289
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,880
Your coin box is in the baggage, right?

290
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,279
So comfortable.

291
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,839
The pickle is pretty good.

292
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,079
She slept like that for the whole night?

293
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:38,519
She was probably exhausted.

294
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
You didn't put her in bed?

295
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
She's a poor girl.

296
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,440
Then she needs to be taken care of more.

297
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,480
She doesn't need to be taken care of

298
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,400
or pitied.

299
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,039
This girl

300
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:53,799
is quite proud.

301
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,359
Why didn't she sleep against the wall?

302
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,680
The baggage is heavy.

303
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,480
She carried it all the way

304
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:00,640
on her shoulder.

305
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:01,920
I'm afraid her skin is torn.

306
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,400
It'd hurt her if she leaned on the wall.

307
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,240
How do you know?

308
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,359
She's my maid.

309
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,599
Of course, I know.

310
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,359
I don't get you.

311
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:16,920
She's awake.

312
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,680
Come and have breakfast.

313
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,680
You keep eating.

314
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:35,240
Don't mind her.

315
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,119
What?

316
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,000
Any vegetables?

317
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,839
If these aren't enough,

318
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,839
I'll fetch more.

319
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,680
Live ones.

320
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,599
Live food?

321
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,920
Is this guy a fool?

322
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,559
He'll be the next Master of Wudang.

323
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,039
Your Highness,

324
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,160
what did she mean?

325
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,160
She was asking you

326
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,079
if you have seeds or seedlings?

327
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,440
How come they're alive?

328
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,200
Before they get dug out of the earth,

329
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,799
they're alive.

330
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,519
You're right.

331
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,359
They are alive.

332
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,759
What are you going to do

333
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,880
with these?

334
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,000
To plant them.

335
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,960
We've got vegetables.

336
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,480
We can send them over.

337
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,279
Can't I grow my own vegetables?

338
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,319
You can,

339
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,319
but we don't have
any seeds or seedlings.

340
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,160
Where do you get the vegetables?

341
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,319
We do have a vegetable garden.

342
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,400
Take me there.

343
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:12,720
Come on.

344
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,680
Don't look at me.

345
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,599
It's none of my business.

346
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,800
(Wudang Main Hall)
(Sanqing Hall)

347
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,040
(Sanqing Hall)

348
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,480
Master.

349
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,480
Master.

350
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,720
If it isn't the garden chief?

351
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,240
We've got a crisis.

352
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,799
There were thieves.

353
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,920
Many vegetables have been stolen.

354
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,599
A thorough investigation is required.

355
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,440
Who would steal vegetables?

356
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,079
Could there be

357
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,119
an overrun with rats in mountain?

358
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,559
Master,

359
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,759
they used shovels.

360
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:41,799
Maybe there's a fox spirit.

361
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,160
Just be more careful in the future.

362
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,960
Go.

363
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,599
Master,

364
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,960
fox eats meat as opposed to vegetables.

365
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,640
What is arcanum?

366
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,720
Obtain its essence,

367
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,920
and practice it.

368
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,519
Prodigy utilizes it.

369
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,759
Tools forget it.

370
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
The profound meaning of it

371
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,839
has to be comprehended by yourself.

372
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
You can't ask me for every answer.

373
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,400
Prodigy utilizes it.

374
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,160
Tools forget it.

375
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,119
Prodigy utilizes it.

376
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,079
Tools forget it.

377
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Prodigy utilizes it.

378
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,519
Tools forget it.

379
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,559
Prodigy utilizes it.

380
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,160
Tools forget it.

381
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,319
Miss Jiang Ni,

382
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,720
you mustn't let Master know

383
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,720
that you stole

384
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,920
the vegetables.

385
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,480
I asked you to lead the way,

386
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,680
and I dug the vegetables out.

387
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,079
He can come and speak to me.

388
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,599
It has nothing to do with you.

389
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,400
Still, we'd better keep it a secret.

390
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,640
Are you afraid of him?

391
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:09,759
Would he hit you?

392
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:11,920
My senior?

393
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,799
He never hits me.

394
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,279
Then why are you afraid of him?

395
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,480
Who are they?

396
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,920
Lead the orthodox Taoism of Santian.

397
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:49,440
Mount Longhu.

398
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,599
The No. 1 sect personally approved by
the Emperor.

399
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,039
It's good to stay in Wudang.

400
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,119
When I was in North Liang,

401
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
I had to stay vigilant and suspicious

402
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,559
all the time.

403
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,599
But there's no meat, though.

404
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,680
This is unbearable.

405
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,400
Brother,

406
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,759
come with me.

407
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:52,519
What?

408
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:53,599
Come on.

409
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:00,240
Brother.

410
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,240
This way.

411
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,160
Where are you taking me?

412
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,519
Here.

413
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,000
(Purple Bamboo Forest)

414
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,880
Is this where you live?

415
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,079
Yeah.

416
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,680
There's a cabin inside.

417
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,279
Brother, give me a minute.

418
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,440
(Purple Bamboo Forest)

419
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:08,319
Brother.

420
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,920
Brother, you're awake.

421
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,400
Why did I sleep here?

422
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,759
You didn't fall asleep.

423
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,119
You passed out.

424
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,680
Why did I pass out?

425
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,079
A Taoist with the wooden sword
knocked you out.

426
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,960
A Taoist with the wooden sword?

427
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,359
The one

428
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,880
who lives in the bamboo forest?

429
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,799
He's a Wudang disciple, too?

430
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,319
He didn't hit you, did he?

431
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,440
No.

432
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:36,960
The Wooden Sword Taoist
said I have a peaceful heart.

433
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,079
What did he knock me out with?

434
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,480
Sword energy.

435
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,079
Sword energy?

436
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,079
Is there such a genius in Wudang?

437
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,799
Brother.

438
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,880
Chicken thigh?

439
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,119
Pheasant.

440
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,839
Where did you get it?

441
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,599
I caught one in the bamboo forest,

442
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,599
and roasted it on fire.

443
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,960
I left the thigh for you.

444
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,640
The Wooden Sword Taoist
didn't see you, right?

445
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,119
He saw me.

446
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,319
He didn't stop you?

447
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:14,000
I remember Wudang discipline
is quite strict.

448
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,720
What kind of a Taoist is that?

449
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,319
He's quite nice.

450
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,640
You like this place?

451
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,039
How about we stay here forever?

452
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,720
No?

453
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,039
You'll leave eventually.

454
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,079
Where will I go?

455
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,599
Home.

456
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:39,960
Father said

457
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,640
our home couldn't be without you.

458
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,000
Both our sisters are gone,

459
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,640
and you will leave, too.

460
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,079
What's the point in me going home alone?

461
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,240
Is that even a home anymore?

462
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,880
Father wanted you to help him.

463
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,359
Huangman'er,

464
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,440
do you know why Xu Xiao

465
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,319
sent you to Wudang?

466
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:08,920
Yeah.

467
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
What?

468
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,839
To take away my strength.

469
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:16,039
He told you this?

470
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,039
Yes, he did.

471
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,400
And you complied and came?

472
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,759
Father said if I was strengthless,

473
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,920
you'd be out of trouble.

474
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,720
Can't believe you're so dumb.

475
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,799
I don't mind being dumb,

476
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
as long as you're smart.

477
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,160
Eat the meat, Brother.

478
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,960
Is it good?

479
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:51,680
Yes.

480
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,799
Huangman'er,

481
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm not afraid of trouble.

482
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,119
I'll be right here safeguarding you.

483
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,640
No one can take you away.

484
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm afraid you can't.

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,519
Sir.

486
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,160
How come I haven't seen you these days?

487
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,039
I've been hanging around
in the mountain.

488
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,119
You said I can't safeguard him?

489
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:20,160
What did you mean?

490
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,119
Mount Longhu sent people here.

491
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,720
They came for him.

492
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:25,799
Where are they?

493
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,079
At the door of your house.

494
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,359
That's quite a group.

495
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,480
You return to the forest, Huangman'er.

496
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,480
You mustn't come out

497
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:33,480
unless I call you.

498
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,360
Go.

499
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,239
If I conflict with Mount Longhu,

500
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,000
which side will you be on?

501
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,960
I wanted to

502
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,800
fight the No. 1 sect
in the martial world long ago.

503
00:35:59,079 --> 00:35:59,800
Thank you, sir.

504
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,760
You're welcome.

505
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,519
But keep in mind,

506
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,159
Jian Jiuhuang only asked me
to protect you for two months.

507
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,119
And it'll soon be due.

508
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
(Lead the Orthodox Taoism of Santian
Enlighten All Lives in This Catastrophe)

509
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,119
There are so many people watching.

510
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:43,960
You're still growing your vegetables?

511
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,960
They didn't come for me.

512
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,760
Where is Hong Xixiang?

513
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
Wang Chonglou took him away.

514
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,880
It looks like Wudang is going to

515
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,559
stay out of it.

516
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,920
I'm Xu Fengnian.

517
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,360
Who wants to see me?

518
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,520
(Zhao Xituan Arch-Taoist of Mount Longhu)

519
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:24,639
Master.

520
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:25,520
(Sanqing Hall)

521
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,199
Are you sure they are from Mount Longhu?

522
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,960
Don't let them fool us.

523
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,559
I saw with my own eyes that

524
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,440
it was Zhao Xituan.

525
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
Zhao Xituan, one of the four
Arch-Taoists of Mount Longhu?

526
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,199
Indeed.

527
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,559
Master,

528
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,800
Mount Longhu is powerful.

529
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,320
Their Arch-Taoist came in person.

530
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:49,599
We can't take it lightly.

531
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes.

532
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,760
Junior,

533
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,840
what do you think?

534
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,679
My opinion is, though our sect
is named Wudang,

535
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,519
it doesn't mean we own
the entire Mount Wudang.

536
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,320
We can't take it for our own.

537
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,599
It's a big mountain,

538
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,519
and they can take a tour if they like.

539
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,400
That is, after all,
the Arch-Taoist of Mount Longhu.

540
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:17,719
Yes.

541
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,599
I don't care
if he's an Arch-aoist or not.

542
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:22,400
He came for Xu Longxiang.

543
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,400
It has nothing to do with us.

544
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,519
That's right.

545
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,599
No matter how big the trouble is,

546
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
it has nothing to do with us.

547
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,800
Master.

548
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,599
Xu Fengnian?

549
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:46,840
Yes, that's me.

550
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,239
Where is Xu Longxiang?

551
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,960
Get him out.

552
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,920
I

553
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,440
am going to
take him back to Mount Longhu.

554
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,639
Who are you?

555
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,360
Zhao Xituan of Longhu.

556
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,440
Zhao Xituan?

557
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,920
So the Arch-Taoist is here.

558
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,199
How can you stand here?

559
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,960
I didn't greet you properly.

560
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:08,760
Sir,

561
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,599
let's talk inside.

562
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,599
Where is Xu Longxiang?

563
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,159
I'll go fetch him right away.

564
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,760
Please get inside
and have a cup of warm tea.

565
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,320
Okay.

566
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,639
Are you a match for him?

567
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
We'll find out after the fight.

568
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll draw his attention,

569
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:31,840
and you go to his back

570
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,079
then sneak attack him.

571
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,400
He's the Arch-Taoist of Mount Longhu.

572
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,519
I don't care.

573
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:37,760
Anyone who schemes against my brother

574
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:38,920
won't get away with it.

575
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,360
What about all those Taoists over there?

576
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,199
You put the knife against
the Arch-Taoist's neck,

577
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,400
and what can they do?

578
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,000
If you try to escalate it,

579
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,199
Mount Longhu will make you pay.

580
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:48,920
It's fine.

581
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,800
We'll say the Master of Wudang
told us to do it.

582
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,519
No matter how big the trouble is,

583
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,400
let Wudang take the blame.

584
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,039
This is Mount Wudang, isn't it?

585
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:19,960
It's a humble house.

586
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,280
Please forgive us, sir.

587
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:25,800
Jiang Ni,

588
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,400
clean the bench for the Arch-Taoist.

589
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,519
So he can sit.

590
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,840
It's more convenient sitting down.

591
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,639
Please sit, Arch-Taoist.

592
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,480
It is pretty windy.

593
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,559
I'll close the door.

594
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,559
You mentioned tea, right?

595
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,280
Where's the tea?

596
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,880
Where's the tea?

597
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,760
Where's the tea?

598
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,760
Tea…

599
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,519
Now that we've got the tea leaves,

600
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:24,039
how is the water looking?

601
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,079
Did you put the pot on fire?

602
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,880
I think I did.

603
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,079
It'll take some time
for the water to boil.

604
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,039
Your Highness,

605
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,039
don't panic,

606
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,199
and don't get me wrong.

607
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:51,880
The reason why I came

608
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,400
is that I'd like to take your brother
back to Mount Longhu.

609
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,440
Well, I didn't get you wrong, then.

610
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,559
No fighting. No fighting.

611
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,800
I surrender.

612
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,000
Why doesn't he call for help?

613
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,559
His people will come to his aid.

614
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,920
How do I know?

615
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,119
Jian Jiuhuang asked me to come here.

616
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,000
