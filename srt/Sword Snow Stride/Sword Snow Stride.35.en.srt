1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

(Season 1)

00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 35=

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,350
You're here.

8
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:52,550
Wait for a second.

9
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,350
The carrier pigeon
of the Xuanyuan Family.

10
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,200
We're approaching Wudi City.

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,350
We'd better get prepared.

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,750
There's no harm if you want to see it.

13
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,650
What's this?

14
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11,000
The clansmen of Lyupao'er
have set up a branch sect.

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,525
Someone wants to kill you.

16
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,475
I was bribed to do nothing.

17
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,100
Did you agree?

18
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:19,260
I didn't say anything.

19
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:20,675
He thought I agreed.

20
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,280
Can you do that?

21
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,775
After all, I'm a senior
in the martial world.

22
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,340
I've spent years in the world

23
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,300
and I surely learned many things.

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,375
How dangerous the world is!

25
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:35,775
Don't you care about the clansmen

26
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,450
and descendants of Senior Lyupao'er?

27
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,425
The one who I owed is Lyupao'er.

28
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,050
That's it.

29
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:45,300
Her clansmen have nothing to do with me.

30
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,950
What did Xu Xiao offer you

31
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,735
that you agreed to
escort me to Wudi City?

32
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,450
When I had nowhere to go,

33
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,650
it was Xu Xiao who built
Tingchao Pavilion,

34
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,740
so I could stay away from
the martial world and be true to myself.

35
00:02:57,025 --> 00:02:57,850
Over the years,

36
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,675
I barricaded myself
under Tingchao Pavilion

37
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:00,925
and never stepped out.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,420
It was Xu Xiao again

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,980
who visited
the grave of Lyupao'er for me.

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,220
Just because of that?

41
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,660
It's enough.

42
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,725
Zhao Kai would never expect

43
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:11,900
the inner peace you've been pursuing

44
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:13,650
is so simple.

45
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:17,875
I didn't refer to Zhao Kai's name.

46
00:03:18,175 --> 00:03:19,575
How do you know it's him?

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,225
You know Zhao Kai wants to kill you?

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,525
Fujiang Armor is his man.

49
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,150
Zhao Kai tried to assassinate me

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,740
throughout the journey.

51
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,350
So you know everything

52
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,575
about my meeting with Zhao Kai?

53
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:43,750
Come in.

54
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:47,725
Senior.

55
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,620
I see.

56
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,800
Qingniao, there's a pigeon.

57
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:09,575
I saw it.

58
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,775
Shall we have it roasted?

59
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,575
The pigeon you want.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
Is it some message?

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,250
Why don't you have a look?

62
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,050
I don't think so.

63
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,900
Since it's delivering messages,

64
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:30,825
I'd better let it go.

65
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,340
Do you know where its destination is?

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,820
It was sent by the Xuanyuan Family.

67
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,375
Where do you think it is?

68
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,825
I know nothing about

69
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:45,800
the business of the martial world.

70
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,425
Watch your steps.

71
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,250
Don't fall off the ship.

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
Thanks for your concern.

73
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,575
How did Zhao Kai bribe you?

74
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,000
Senior,

75
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,100
he promised to give me
White Emperor Esoterica of Simplicity.

76
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,300
Isn't that what you want?

77
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
I do want to own it.

78
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,125
But I'd rather own it

79
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,925
when I'm alive.

80
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,380
If I help him kill His Highness,

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,175
North Liang Cavalry

82
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,000
will go after me
to the end of the world.

83
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,300
Are you afraid of Xu Xiao?

84
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:29,575
I'm afraid of His Highness, too.

85
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,100
Was it a test when you didn't

86
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,525
stop me from seeing Zhao Kai?

87
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:37,525
No.

88
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,525
Along the way,

89
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,485
I owe you too much.

90
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,825
You don't owe me anything.

91
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:45,980
So,

92
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,580
whatever decisions you make,

93
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,860
I'm happy to accept it.

94
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,350
What if I promise Zhao Kai
not to stop him from killing you?

95
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,425
I should deal with him myself.

96
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,450
Like I just said,

97
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,600
you don't owe me anything.

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,025
I'm not the center of the world.

99
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,700
Why should everyone help me

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,975
and save me?

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,200
You surely have a silver tongue.

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,260
I really mean it.

103
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,425
Give us a moment.

104
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,660
Try Snakes in Sleeves

105
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,220
and Open the Heaven's Gate.

106
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,580
Show me how clumsy you are.

107
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,860
Right here?

108
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,225
Are you afraid the ship will leak?

109
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,075
Hurry up.

110
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,050
What's wrong?

111
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,425
The move is a mess.

112
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:54,580
I'm ashamed.

113
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,260
But you've got the energy and spirit.

114
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,500
Is it a compliment?

115
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:02,860
After we arrive at Wudi City,

116
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,425
I'll have another fight
with Wang Xianzhi.

117
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,125
To avenge the break of your sword?

118
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,175
There's nothing to avenge.

119
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:10,925
I didn't intend to do that before.

120
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:12,475
Since I've returned

121
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,380
to the Realm
of Immortal-on-Earth by chance,

122
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,260
I want to celebrate it
by having a fight.

123
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,460
After all, there are few people
in the world

124
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,450
who are qualified to fight me.

125
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,000
I bet you'll win.

126
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,500
It doesn't matter
whether I win or lose

127
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:24,945
as long as I have fun.

128
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,100
But you

129
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,100
must be careful.

130
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,220
I'll fight Wang Xianzhi wholeheartedly.

131
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,500
I can't look after you at the same time.

132
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,900
Don't worry about me.

133
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,175
I can protect myself.

134
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,825
If anything happens to me,

135
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,620
help me pass on Snakes in Sleeves

136
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,800
and Open the Heaven's Gate.

137
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,580
Stop.

138
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,725
Don't say such ominous thing.

139
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,025
All my life,

140
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,850
I haven't left anything except for

141
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:57,025
the sword move and the sword intent.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,860
I thought I couldn't find a disciple.

143
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:02,660
But at this late stage,

144
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,775
I've met you and Jiang Ni.

145
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,220
Forget it. I won't say it again.

146
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,275
Just forget I mentioned it.

147
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,575
It doesn't matter
if the move is passed on or not.

148
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,350
Time flies.

149
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,060
After another ten or a hundred years,

150
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,780
who would care about the move?

151
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,925
I'll let them pass on.

152
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,980
Then I'll have nothing to worry about

153
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,975
during the fight.

154
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:56,001
(Greenery Embrace)

155
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:13,860
A pigeon returns.

156
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,300
Where is it from?

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,925
The ship of the son of
Lord of North Liang.

158
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:27,550
Get the ship ready.

159
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,725
It's time to return the favor.

160
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:31,725
Yes.

161
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,100
(Wudi City)

162
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,500
Floating down the river into the sea,

163
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,200
the long journey

164
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,700
finally comes to an end.

165
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,525
Yes.

166
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,660
This

167
00:10:03,225 --> 00:10:05,185
is Wudi City.

168
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,125
What are those on the wall?

169
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:12,075
Over the decades,

170
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,150
numerous masters have come
to fight Wang Xianzhi,

171
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,150
but no one can defeat him.

172
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,675
On the wall

173
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,650
are the weapons left by the defeated.

174
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Old Huang's sword box is over there.

175
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,225
What's wrong?

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,725
Why don't you play the game?

177
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,750
I can't see it clearly right now.

178
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,550
Is there any game
you can't see clearly?

179
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,535
Zhang Julu

180
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,500
sent a letter

181
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:08,260
to Chen Zhibao.

182
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,475
Really?

183
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,740
What

184
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,340
the letter says

185
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,000
doesn't matter.

186
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,300
He wants to raise my suspicion

187
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,150
of Chen Zhibao.

188
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,420
Prime Minister Zhang

189
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,425
is good at

190
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,820
running state affairs.

191
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,375
To go in for intrigues...

192
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,275
Really?

193
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:30,775
He could do better.

194
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:33,300
It's not intrigue.

195
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,475
It's a fair move.

196
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,750
The letter doesn't matter.

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,925
The reaction of yours and Chen Zhibao's

198
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:43,050
doesn't matter, either.

199
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,700
He only needs

200
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:49,220
the generals and officers
of North Liang Army

201
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,200
to know Chen Zhibao
has received such a letter.

202
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,300
That's enough.

203
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:54,350
Yeah.

204
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,150
As long as I'm alive,

205
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,100
North Liang won't slide into chaos.

206
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,180
Since you returned to North Liang,

207
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:05,940
Chen Zhibao has never
stepped out of his barrack.

208
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,380
No one knows

209
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,650
what he is doing now

210
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,020
and

211
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,500
whether he is

212
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:14,050
still in the barrack.

213
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,825
As for the chess game
you can't see clearly,

214
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,220
do you mean Chen Zhibao?

215
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,860
I mean your son.

216
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,075
Fengnian?

217
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,425
What's wrong?

218
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,180
This is what he has done

219
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,025
on the way eastbound.

220
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,250
The Xuanyuan Family?

221
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,575
Mount Longhu?

222
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,550
Yeah.

223
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:53,175
Only by connecting all his moves

224
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,650
could I guess what he wants to do.

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,350
This idiot!

226
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,380
How recklessly bold he is!

227
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,675
He could even keep it from you and me.

228
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:07,575
The pupil surpasses the master.

229
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,550
He is the real

230
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,300
Lord of North Liang after you.

231
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,750
Your mother is dead.

232
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,275
She won't come back.

233
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,880
General.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,700
(Memorial)
The army has assembled.

235
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,750
(Memorial)
We're ready to set out.

236
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,375
Please give the order.

237
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,775
Please give the order.

238
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,740
- Please give the order.
- Please give the order.

239
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,050
(Tablet of Wife Wu Su)

240
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,432
(Memorial)

241
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,100
But you still have your father,

242
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,225
sisters

243
00:13:50,475 --> 00:13:51,975
and brothers.

244
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:53,525
I...

245
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,660
I'm the only one left in my family.

246
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,850
Disarm.

247
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,850
Now,

248
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
he should be in Wudi City.

249
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:43,925
He's thousands of miles away.

250
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:45,950
We can only

251
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,825
wait for the news.

252
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,525
(Wudi City)

253
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,225
After getting off the ship,
it only takes a few minutes

254
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,450
to get in the city.

255
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:26,925
We won't go that way.

256
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:28,550
Which way shall we take?

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,780
Take a detour

258
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:30,975
to the west gate.

259
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,775
Yes.

260
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,475
West gate?

261
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,850
What's special about the west gate?

262
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,975
Old Huang got in the city
by the west gate.

263
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,250
(West Gate)

264
00:15:51,975 --> 00:15:54,050
Is the gate unguarded?

265
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,875
The gate is always widely open.

266
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,225
There are no guards.

267
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:01,780
Wang Xianzhi alone can defeat an army.

268
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,425
Does the doodle look familiar to you?

269
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,325
(The Best Goods)
Yes, it looks familiar.

270
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:07,180
Isn't it the little monk
who went to Mount Longhu?

271
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,200
He came, too.

272
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,660
(The Best Goods)
What kind of style is this?

273
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,060
Why don't the people of the city

274
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,275
wipe the doodles off the wall?

275
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:17,050
Wang Xianzhi doesn't care about it.

276
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,240
The writing...

277
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,220
Forget it.

278
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,075
Don't mind it.

279
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:22,980
Let's go into the city.

280
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,700
Yeah.

281
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,400
Your Highness,

282
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,035
please let Fengzi Battalion go with you.

283
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,580
The battalion going into the city

284
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,125
amounts to North Liang declaring war.

285
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,750
(Wudi City West Gate)

286
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,975
(Wudi City West Gate)

287
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,975
Old Huang got in the city alone.

288
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
That's the way up to the wall.

289
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,900
There are 12 martial slaves in the city.

290
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,940
They are all
Wang Xianzhi's defeated opponents

291
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,775
who admire him from the heart

292
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,935
and willingly stay
to defend the city for him.

293
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,175
Are they the martial slaves?

294
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:14,900
Yes.

295
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,600
In theory,

296
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,900
they should guard
the five floors respectively.

297
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,980
You must fight your way through

298
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:23,945
before you get to the top floor
to fight Wang Xianzhi.

299
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,125
Why they're all here?

300
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,225
Is the rule changed?

301
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,950
They're looking at me.

302
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,620
Everyone knows
you come for the sword box.

303
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,500
Are they going to stop me?

304
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,420
What do you think?

305
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,400
Do you expect them to return it?

306
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,450
Why don't we go up directly

307
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,920
and grab the sword box?

308
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,650
No hurry.

309
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,025
Let's follow Old Huang's steps.

310
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,660
Brother.

311
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,780
Brother.

312
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,125
What are you looking at exactly?

313
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,025
Before his decisive fight
with Wang Xianzhi,

314
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,300
Old Huang had the last drink here.

315
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,475
I need some money.

316
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:42,925
Hey.

317
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,325
Hey.

318
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,675
What's wrong, Grandpa Wei?

319
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,850
Leave him alone.

320
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,175
(Wudi City North Gate)

321
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:20,400
(North Gate)

322
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,425
Are we late?

323
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:23,460
No.

324
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,060
It can't be so calm and peaceful

325
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,660
if Li Chungang and Wang Xianzhi
had a fight.

326
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,475
We arrive

327
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,475
just in time.

328
00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:40,325
(Wudi City)

329
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,220
What's wrong?

330
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,250
Sword God Peach Blossom.

331
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,740
Deng Tai'e?

332
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,700
(Wudi City)

333
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,250
Fujiang Armor.

334
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm honored to see you.

335
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,300
Senior, don't you go inside?

336
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,860
If I go inside,

337
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm afraid the two masters

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,175
couldn't enjoy their fight.

339
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:44,175
Yes.

340
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,740
He came, too.

341
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,700
I'm afraid
the city will fall into chaos.

342
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:02,020
The more chaos, the better.

343
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's find Xu Fengnian first.

344
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:15,625
Well,

345
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,550
what would you like?

346
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:18,980
Do you have wine?

347
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,025
Sure.

348
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,275
We have famous wine
from all over the country.

349
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,740
What would you like?

350
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,410
What did Old Huang have?

351
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,420
Who is it?

352
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,420
A thin old man

353
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,800
who carried a sword box.

354
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,925
He once drank here.

355
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,050
Um...

356
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:36,700
After the drink,
he went up the gate tower

357
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,600
and had a fight with Wang Xianzhi.

358
00:23:39,325 --> 00:23:40,540
Jian Jiuhuang?

359
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,300
Is he the one
who shocks the whole world

360
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,050
with the Ninth Move, Six Thousand Li?

361
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,980
You came to the right place.

362
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,140
The senior had a drink here

363
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,140
before he gathered great heroic spirit.

364
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,020
Then he had a bitter fight

365
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,380
with Wang Xianzhi

366
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,450
that dimmed the sun and the moon.

367
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,400
What did he drink?

368
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,775
I recall it was millet wine.

369
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:58,900
Bring me a pot of millet wine.

370
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,700
All right.

371
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,575
Wait for a minute.

372
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:05,450
Young Master.

373
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,420
Two bowls.

374
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,125
Thanks.

375
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:13,975
Eh.

376
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:14,640
Put it here.

377
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes.

378
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,150
Young Master,

379
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,150
what food would you like?

380
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:24,350
What did he do?

381
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:26,800
He said our wine was great.

382
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,875
What else?

383
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,175
He did nothing else.

384
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,950
Think carefully.

385
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,975
Let me think again.

386
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,180
He ordered two taels of millet wine,

387
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:41,625
half of a catty of pot-stewed meat

388
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,000
and

389
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,500
a plate of peanuts, I think.

390
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,700
What else did he do?

391
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:50,800
After that,

392
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,475
he just sat there,

393
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,975
looking far north,

394
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,125
and raised his bowl now and then.

395
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,660
He seemed to

396
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,000
propose toasts.

397
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,150
Let me drink with you.

398
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,350
Old Huang was just

399
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,850
an ordinary groom
when he was in the mansion.

400
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:39,300
He and His Highness

401
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,750
were just servant and master.

402
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,700
Then His Highness

403
00:26:46,075 --> 00:26:47,175
left North Liang

404
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,180
and started a three-year tour.

405
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:51,350
During the years,

406
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,275
he had been with His Highness
all the time.

407
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:19,820
You ate them all?

408
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,180
I'm full.

409
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,400
Young Master, where are you going?

410
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,650
Young Master.

411
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,780
You have nothing to lose

412
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,140
by learning martial arts..

413
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,410
No hurry.

414
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,675
It's all yours.

415
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,800
Young Master.

416
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,500
I caught a big one.

417
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,275
Look...

418
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:45,000
Old Huang.

419
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,260
Old Huang.

420
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,525
At that time, His Highness

421
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:01,675
didn't know Old Huang

422
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:03,175
was a great swordman.

423
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,450
In his mind,

424
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,975
the name of Jian Jiuhuang
didn't mean anything.

425
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:13,700
The one who had been with him

426
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,400
was Old Huang, the groom.

427
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,725
Old Huang was his companion

428
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,375
and friend.

429
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,825
In the end,

430
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,975
they became each other's family.

431
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,940
I won't stop you

432
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,340
from having this fight.

433
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,025
But you must come back
as soon as you're done.

434
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
No one can roast

435
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,565
so nice sweet potatoes as you do.

436
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,420
I promise,

437
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,660
I'll come back the moment I'm done.

438
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,630
The first thing I do

439
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,750
is to roast sweet potatoes for you.

440
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,660
Your front teeth are broken,

441
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:40,975
yet you still like peanuts.

442
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,675
You're really bad at drinking.

443
00:29:44,275 --> 00:29:45,500
Two taels of millet wine

444
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,980
takes you so long to drink.

445
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,875
Senior Li.

446
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,380
What?

447
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:04,100
Would you please

448
00:30:04,475 --> 00:30:05,850
have a talk with him?

449
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:08,925
Why drag me in?

450
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,975
You're the only one

451
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,525
who can wake him up at this time.

452
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,225
Don't drink too much.

453
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,625
Every time you get drunk,

454
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,140
I have to clean it up.

455
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,800
Old Huang

456
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:47,340
was gone.

457
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,625
I know he was gone.

458
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,875
Senior,

459
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:11,060
I'm not crazy.

460
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:13,050
I just want to

461
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,825
accompany him for a while.

462
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,900
Want to get the sword box back?

463
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:32,700
Sure.

464
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,475
Tell him yourself.

465
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:35,780
Tell who?

466
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,150
This is Wudi City.

467
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,150
Who do you think you should tell?

468
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,180
Wang Xianzhi?

469
00:31:40,775 --> 00:31:42,220
Mustn't I fight my way out
to get to the top floor

470
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,900
before I see him?

471
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,980
That's his rule,

472
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,175
not yours.

473
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,060
Right.

474
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,580
That's his rule,

475
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,820
not mine.

476
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,500
How do you tell him you're here?

477
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
Wang Xianzhi!

478
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,425
Tell me what is
clouds of the nine heavens hanging down

479
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:22,325
and water of the four seas rising up!

480
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,850
Xu Fengnian.

481
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:27,025
We finally find him.

482
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,725
Should we take action now?

483
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:33,325
Wait until

484
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,375
Li Chungang makes move.

485
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:38,380
That's what you want to
tell Wang Xianzhi?

486
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,940
Clouds of the nine heavens,

487
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,450
water of the four seas?

488
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,550
Xu Fengnian,

489
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,475
why do you come to Wudi City?

490
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,250
If you're afraid,

491
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:50,185
shut up and get out of the city.

492
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:51,220
Run back to North Liang.

493
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,275
I'm not afraid!

494
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,425
Don't tell me!

495
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:56,175
Wang Xianzhi!

496
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,125
I don't care about your rules!

497
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:00,580
Today I must

498
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:02,955
get the sword box back.

499
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:04,775
If you dare stop me,

500
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,060
I'll beat you up into sweet potatoes.

501
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,400
Sweet potatoes?

502
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,500
Did he say sweet potatoes?

503
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,400
I think so.

504
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:17,950
Well done!

505
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,820
Got a nerve!

506
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,740
Fantastic!

507
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,625
What did you say?

508
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,740
During my three-year tour
with Old Huang,

509
00:33:27,075 --> 00:33:28,350
what we ate most

510
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,925
were sweet potatoes
stolen from farmers' fields.

511
00:33:30,325 --> 00:33:32,075
I was thinking of it just now.

512
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:34,500
It just blurted out.

513
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:38,150
It has been years since we last

514
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,600
heard someone talking like that
in Wudi City.

515
00:33:40,225 --> 00:33:42,175
That's the spirit
of Lord of North Liang.

516
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,900
I'm afraid Wang Xianzhi can't bear it.

517
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,100
Get ready.

518
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm coming.

519
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,500
Who wants to have a fight?

520
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,750
(Liuchen Shop)

521
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,580
The Second Best, Wang Xianzhi.

522
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,925
Wang Xianzhi.

523
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,700
(The Second Best, Wang Xianzhi)

524
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:26,460
Who else could it be?

525
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,375
I should warn you in advance.

526
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,375
Go ahead.

527
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,125
Even if Wang Xianzhi doesn't come,

528
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,600
there are still 12 martial slaves.

529
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
To get up the gate tower,

530
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,525
it's not easy.

531
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,400
I've made it this far.

532
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,825
Is there any way back?

533
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:42,925
You're right.

534
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,340
You've made it this far.

535
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:45,580
You have no way back.

536
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,775
Swords come to me!

537
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,800
A master, indeed!

538
00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:34,625
(North Gate)

539
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
So many swords.

540
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:03,800
You should probably win.

541
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,300
When one achieves to my realm,

542
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,200
it makes no difference

543
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,375
with one sword or numerous swords.

544
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,675
Then why did you take so many?

545
00:36:09,825 --> 00:36:11,125
Because it looks domineering.

546
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,425
Go take what you have to.

547
00:36:45,675 --> 00:36:46,825
Wang Xianzhi.

548
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,200
As I come to

549
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,540
visit East Sea,

550
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,800
I've borrowed the swords of the city

551
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,850
to fight you.

552
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,450
Sword God Li,

553
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,580
we meet again.

554
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,420
Let's talk after the fight.

555
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,075
Hold on.

556
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,525
Why don't we go to the sea?

557
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,150
No problem.

558
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,300
The world's

559
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,860
bitterest fight.

560
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,250
Good view.

561
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:22,600
That's it.

562
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:26,925
Unfortunate.

563
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,380
With so many swords,

564
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,625
it doesn't matter to have one less arm.

565
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,450
It's different after all.

566
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,740
What a pity.

567
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,260
I don't need your sympathy.

568
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,050
I just missed an arm.

569
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,550
Even if I have no hands and feet,

570
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm not afraid of fighting.

571
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:48,620
It's too ominous.

572
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,750
Can I take back the words?

573
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,500
The power of heaven and earth.

574
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:00,740
Interesting.

575
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,540
Please make your move.

576
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:17,950
Let me break it with my swords.

577
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,300
There is a fight.

578
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,860
Go!

579
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,780
- Let's go to the seaside.
- Hurry.

580
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,550
- Go.
- Go.

581
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,275
Let's go and see.

582
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:41,100
Hurry up.

583
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:43,100
Hurry.

584
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,675
Hurry up.

585
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,800
Over there.

586
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:56,975
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

587
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:57,710
- Follow me.
- Go.

588
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,725
Let's go and have a look.

589
00:40:59,425 --> 00:41:00,425
Hurry.

590
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,250
Sword God Li.

591
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,640
Wang Xianzhi.

592
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,150
They're almost immortals.

593
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,725
Let immortals fight immortals.

594
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,625
Humans

595
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:13,450
fight humans.

596
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:31,325
Well done.

597
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:32,660
Deserves to be rewarded.

598
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,950
Did everyone leave so soon?

599
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:44,420
They all went to the beach

600
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,300
to watch the fight closely.

601
00:41:49,025 --> 00:41:50,350
It's time to do our business.

602
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,000
Please give the order.

603
00:41:57,775 --> 00:41:58,525
Brother.

604
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:01,675
We're going to get the sword box.

605
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,550
It's dangerous.

606
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:04,025
You'd better not go.

607
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,275
I'm willing to stick together with you.

608
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,350
Good.

609
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,475
That's good.

610
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:30,980
Xu Fengnian, you finally show up.

611
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,940
Li Chungang is not with him.

612
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:33,985
Shall we take action?

613
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,300
There are many people around him.

614
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,050
No hurry.

615
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,100
He's going to climb the wall.

616
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:41,175
The martial slaves

617
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,975
must stop him.
