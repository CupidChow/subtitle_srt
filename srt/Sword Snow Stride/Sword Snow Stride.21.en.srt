1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
=Sword Snow Stride=
(Season 1)

6
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,400
=Episode 21=

7
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,980
I said,

8
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,800
no member of the Xu family
is allowed in Xiangfan again.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,270
The Eleventh in the World.

10
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,720
Wang Mingyin.

11
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,120
Good enough.

12
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,900
I lent the Divine Token to you.

13
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,420
My hair can't be messy.

14
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,300
And he isn't Wang Xianzhi.

15
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,970
A wooden sword is enough.

16
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,970
The Eleventh in the World?

17
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,900
I'd like to see what fighters

18
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,170
the world has to offer.

19
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,500
You, again.

20
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,250
I, Wu Liuding of Sword Tomb,

21
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
came with Suwang Sword

22
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,720
and asks for another fight.

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,470
Suwang, the ancient sword that ranks
the second on the famous swords list.

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,820
Where's the sword?

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,820
You'll see it.

26
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,370
Get into the carriage.

27
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,850
Draw the crossbows.

28
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,260
Release the arrows.

29
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,060
Again.

30
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,860
The one who controls Fujiang Armor
Soldiers in the back

31
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,980
may be nearby.

32
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,570
Be careful, everybody.

33
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,350
During the fight,

34
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,100
I'll try to freeze
Fujiang Armor Soldiers for a moment,

35
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,970
and we do the best we can
to break their armor.

36
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,400
If you perform Chixia Swordplay again,

37
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,370
you'll be dead.

38
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,620
I think it's a diversion.

39
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,220
Elder Li is with His Highness.

40
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,050
Don't worry about him.

41
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,470
Save our people first.

42
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,060
Go.

43
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,170
Still alive.

44
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,020
Wood poison!

45
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,650
Wood poison!

46
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,000
Beware of the Wood-armor Soldier.

47
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,500
Wood poison!

48
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,870
Beware of the Wood-armor Soldier.

49
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,120
Which one is the Wood-armor?

50
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,340
I smell sulfur.

51
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,100
That's the Fire-armor.

52
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,700
That's the Earth-armor.

53
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,320
Watch out for his attack from the earth.

54
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,270
They're all monsters.

55
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,140
How do we fight them?

56
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,250
Give me a little more time.

57
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,200
How long?

58
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,340
Wait a bit.

59
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,940
Give me a little more time.

60
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,320
Drop your crossbows.

61
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,700
Draw out your blade.

62
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,460
Go.

63
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,800
- Charge!
- Charge!

64
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
Again.

65
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Again.

66
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,200
Don't worry about them, sir.

67
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,720
How long do you think
you can stall me here?

68
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,150
I'll try my best.

69
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,620
Please stop, sir.

70
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,620
It really is Suwang Sword.

71
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,020
When will the Earth-armor come out?

72
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,070
Be more careful.

73
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,140
As if it's easy.

74
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,470
How do we win if it goes on?

75
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,100
The strongest Golden-armor

76
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,600
hasn't shown up yet.

77
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,000
Your Highness,

78
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,980
it's urgent.

79
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,420
I'd like you to grant me a weapon.

80
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,200
What weapon?

81
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,020
Chana Spear.

82
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,420
The Spear King, Wang Xiu's
Chana Spear?

83
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,660
How is it possible that I have that?

84
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,620
It's in the carriage.

85
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,450
I only need your permission.

86
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,050
Okay.

87
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,750
Snakes in Sleeves.

88
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,900
You are Li Chungang.

89
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
God of Sword.

90
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,150
Shu Xiu!

91
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,550
Give me some time.

92
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,270
Stop him.

93
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,140
Cuihua.

94
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,500
Draw the sword.

95
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,150
Sword, unsheathe.

96
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,020
Go.

97
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,970
Go.

98
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:01,900
Go.

99
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I can't hold on much longer.

100
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,250
If he doesn't die, we will.

101
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
How much longer will

102
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,320
the Earth-armor keep hiding?

103
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, no.

104
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,670
His Highness is in danger.

105
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,750
Shu Xiu, quickly.

106
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,000
Watch out.

107
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,370
Making Immortals Kneel.

108
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,140
The genuine spirit that my attack bears

109
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,980
is to subdue all by means
of the heavenly power,

110
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,860
wiping out the spine and delusion
of the incapable ones

111
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,180
so they shall learn that
once I'm around,

112
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,380
there's no immortal in the world.

113
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,550
She hid her breath well.

114
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,670
And she's a good fighter.

115
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,870
Though Wang Mingyin
was severely injured,

116
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,470
it still wasn't easy to kill him.

117
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,000
Miss Hehe?

118
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,520
What a weird name.

119
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,920
You know her?

120
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,700
Miss Hehe from the sauced beef shop?

121
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,520
Yeah.

122
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,400
That was her.

123
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,950
How is it possible?

124
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,720
What sauced beef shop?

125
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,570
Hey.

126
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,620
Is there a chance?

127
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,800
She risked her life for you.

128
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,800
Move her into the carriage.

129
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,660
I'll try to save her.

130
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,550
And the warriors of Fengzi Battalion.

131
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,600
Please save them, too.

132
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,670
I'm a swordsman, not a doctor.

133
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,620
All right.

134
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,900
I'll do what I can.

135
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,420
Thank you, sir.

136
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,270
Your Highness, watch out for
the Earth-armor Soldier.

137
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,140
He came here as I expected.

138
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,520
How did it go on your end?

139
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,320
Wood and Fire were destroyed.

140
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,270
The Fire-armor burned and blasted.

141
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,860
Lyu Qiantang

142
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,950
overly performed Chixia Swordplay.

143
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,420
Sir.

144
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,620
He's beyond saving.

145
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,270
Please take care of Qingniao
and Fengzi Battalion, sir.

146
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,980
I'll check things out over there.

147
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,750
Your Highness.

148
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,900
Do you have any last wishes?

149
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,370
Please spare the lives

150
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,450
of the remaining Lin people.

151
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,250
Okay.

152
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,620
You have my word.

153
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,500
What about you?

154
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,800
Do you wish to be buried in the
ancestral grave of the Lin family?

155
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,770
I changed my surname.

156
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,250
I don't get to be buried
in the ancestral grave.

157
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,200
Cremate me.

158
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,370
And spill my ashes into the river.

159
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,220
When I'm dead,

160
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,650
I don't want to see those things

161
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,050
or people anymore.

162
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,800
Hey.

163
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,950
When I fought,

164
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,450
I was ready to embrace death.

165
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,900
I know.

166
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,620
I ruined my family.

167
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,250
In the end,

168
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,060
even my family doesn't accept me.

169
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,750
For people like me,
every second on earth

170
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,100
feels like torture.

171
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
I know.

172
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,870
Have I kept my promise?

173
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,770
You didn't get hurt, right?

174
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,020
You've kept your promise.

175
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,020
You live up to the title

176
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,070
of the Third Graduate
of Palace Examination.

177
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,100
For real?

178
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,070
For real.

179
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,520
The path of my life

180
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,520
has reached the end.

181
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,460
It's been so hard.

182
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,070
Curse you, Your Highness!

183
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,970
Curse you, the world!

184
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,740
Grandpa Wei.

185
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:12,770
Here.

186
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,420
Cremate him.

187
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,820
Put his ashes in an urn.

188
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,970
Understood.

189
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,650
I'll handle him.

190
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,720
Your Highness,

191
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,550
please return to the carriage.

192
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,980
(Lin)

193
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,470
The Golden-armor Soldier.

194
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,170
The strongest Golden-armor

195
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,420
attacks right now.

196
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,220
Miss Hehe.

197
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,900
(Miss Hehe, Killer)
It is you.

198
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,470
Yeah.

199
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,380
I didn't expect that it was you
who delivered the message

200
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,220
about Wang Mingyin to the inn,

201
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,420
and that you'd save me.

202
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,500
Twice.

203
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,870
Your hand-blade is sharper
than a real blade.

204
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,470
You survived the first stab

205
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,800
because you're wearing the soft armor.

206
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:06,100
But I should've killed you

207
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,400
with the two kicks.

208
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,580
Have you taken Wang Chonglou's
Dahuangting

209
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,650
for your own?

210
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,370
Miss Hehe.

211
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,110
Hmm?

212
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,570
Are we enemies?

213
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,970
Not really.

214
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,750
But someone paid a thousand taels

215
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,650
for your life.

216
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,460
The Lord of Jing'an.

217
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,820
Why did you save me earlier?

218
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,820
I won't get the taels
unless I kill you with my own hands.

219
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,350
If you're killed by someone else,

220
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,170
I get 500.

221
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,400
My life is worth quite a lot.

222
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,920
I've told you everything.

223
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,300
You can die now.

224
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,520
This isn't any technique
of blade-wielding.

225
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:28,850
You're so heavily injured.

226
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,520
Can you wield the blades again?

227
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,300
Try me.

228
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,100
Are you okay?

229
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,650
I'm fine.

230
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,950
I saw you perform Jian Jiuhuang's
swordsmanship.

231
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,100
From the First Move to the Ninth,

232
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,720
he taught me all.

233
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,270
You practiced for long, right?

234
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,350
It's your last resort.

235
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,750
Is Qingniao okay?

236
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,380
She survives. For now.

237
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,200
Good.

238
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,550
But you're going to die.

239
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,500
Kiddo!

240
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,500
Kiddo!

241
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,650
Shroud our brothers' bodies

242
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:41,650
carefully

243
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,150
and send them back to North Liang.

244
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,020
Is she okay?

246
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,720
You're awake.

247
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,850
Her life was saved.

248
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,180
I'm transferring genuine energy to her.

249
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,660
It's great that she was saved.

250
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,270
You care about yourself.

251
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,850
Little Jiang Ni,

252
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,300
if you attack me now,

253
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,150
I'll be dead for sure.

254
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,450
I lent the Divine Token to the old guy.

255
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,600
I have no way to kill you.

256
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,650
You can have it back.

257
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,700
You're going to die anyway.

258
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,020
It's unnecessary that I attack you.

259
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,470
Is it that serious?

260
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,700
Dahuangting isn't yours.

261
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,420
You're lucky that the genuine energy
hid inside your meridians

262
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,180
and was never dissipated.

263
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,540
The girl made three fatal strikes,

264
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,520
making your genuine energy run backward.

265
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,500
Your chance of survival is slim.

266
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,170
Who would have thought that

267
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,800
a girl who sells sauced beef

268
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
in Lingzhou

269
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,060
is a killer?

270
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
Back in North Liang,

271
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,320
her sauced beef was my favorite.

272
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,170
Still thinking about the beef?

273
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,920
Sir.

274
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,820
Hmm?

275
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,900
Is there a chance for me live?

276
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,180
Yes.

277
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,170
I can save you now

278
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,180
by removing your energy from your core,

279
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,500
stripping you of Dahuangting.

280
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,700
You may stand a chance to live.

281
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,050
Then I'd be useless.

282
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,870
It isn't yours anyway.

283
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,070
Living without the genuine energy
is better than being dead, right?

284
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,420
What's that sound?

285
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,020
Sounds like cavalrymen.

286
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,060
The Lord of Jing'an is coming.

287
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,120
The cavalrymen came at last.

288
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,920
Good for you, Lord of Jing'an.

289
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,580
Keep alert, warriors.

290
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,900
Your Lordship.

291
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,620
