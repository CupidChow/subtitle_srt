(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

(Cangwu Library)

8
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:42,325
Let's bid farewell here.

9
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:43,280
We'll leave by ourselves.

10
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:44,700
Are you really leaving?

11
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,640
Of course.

12
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:46,840
Or should we stay here for dinner?

13
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,799
Xuanyuan Dapan collected
many rare treasures

14
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,719
and books on martial arts.

15
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,280
I don't want to soil my hands

16
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,425
with his stuff.

17
00:01:58,025 --> 00:01:59,025
Is this endless?

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Lord ordered

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,680
that if Your Highness didn't enter

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,959
the mansion of Xuanyuan Dapan,
Guniujiang,

21
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,400
this silk bag should be given to you.

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,799
What if I did?

23
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know about that.

24
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,439
If Your Highness doesn't fail Mount Hui,

25
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,900
Mount Hui won't fail Your Highness.

26
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,950
My father and I are of one mind.

27
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,375
Your father wants to share
his knowledge of martial arts

28
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:37,375
with me.

29
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:39,825
You deserve it.

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,750
I don't want it.

31
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,400
Well...

32
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:46,650
Your Highness.

33
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,520
Xuanyuan Jingcheng entered

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,759
the Realm of Immortal-on-Earth.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,050
His book

36
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,225
is a treasure.

37
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,639
I have my own way to go.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
Why should I learn from others?

39
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,650
This book will be kept in Mount Hui.

40
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,100
It's available at any time.

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,310
You go first.

42
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,319
I want to talk to her.

43
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,950
Let's go.

44
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,750
You leave, too.

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,475
Yes.

46
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:32,840
Well, well.

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,900
You don't have to be so careful.

48
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,039
Let me be frank with you.

49
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,150
You have neither nice boobs

50
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,039
nor a nice butt.

51
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,439
Your face is scrunched up all day long.

52
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:41,800
I have no interest in you.

53
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,879
Hold back your feelings

54
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:47,250
and just do what you should do.

55
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm leaving, my friend.

56
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:52,950
Please stay.

57
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,200
What's wrong?

58
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:15,599
I want to ask you one thing.

59
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,225
Go ahead.

60
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,480
Are you here in Mount Hui

61
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,199
for the sake of chivalry

62
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,400
or are you up to something else?

63
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,639
The Xuanyuan Family in Mount Hui

64
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,600
has been in my plans,

65
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,680
but I didn't know the character of them

66
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,675
before I came here.

67
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,000
I chose to help Xuanyuan Qingfeng
in the end.

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,279
I think it's meant to be.

69
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,519
So, you mean

70
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,125
it's an act of chivalry?

71
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,439
Be as good as you can,
regardless of where it leads you.

72
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,920
But sometimes,

73
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,899
you have to do good deeds first
in order to have a good future.

74
00:04:58,325 --> 00:04:59,560
That's vague.

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,879
What did you borrow a boat for?

76
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,766
I said

77
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:11,725
I wouldn't tell anyone

78
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,720
until the last minute.

79
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,199
For revenge.

80
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:29,575
Jiang Ni.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,959
I can't tell why,

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,439
but what I saw

83
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,399
during this trip to Mount Hui

84
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:38,160
somehow scared me a little bit.

85
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,079
What are you scared of?

86
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:41,160
Xu Xiao.

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,600
Don't fool me.

88
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,759
Everyone in the world
is scared of Xu Xiao,

89
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,639
except you.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,975
I don't believe what you said.

91
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm scared of the day when he gets old.

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,519
My Lady.

93
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,240
Lord ordered

94
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,850
that if Xu Fengnian
didn't take the book,

95
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,625
this silk bag should be given to you.

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,759
If Xu Fengnian doesn't take the book,

97
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,040
he will reach

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,519
the Celestial Realm one day

99
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,120
and he can be a trusty ally
of Mount Hui.

100
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,920
How many silk bags
did my father prepare?

101
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,750
I only have two.

102
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:26,725
The material is fine.

103
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,839
It must've cost him a lot.

104
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,160
Did he use his private money?

105
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,480
He didn't tell me.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,750
(Strategy Written in a Cottage)

107
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,759
It's a pity about the book.

108
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,175
I'm glad you didn't take it.

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,100
Ah?

110
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,519
Why do you say that?

111
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,159
Martial art is not like a stew

112
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,200
that gets better with more ingredients.

113
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,879
You refuse to learn from others.

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,525
Now your state of mind

115
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,050
feels like Snakes in Sleeves.

116
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,075
My state of mind?

117
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:50,775
Um.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
I was thinking

119
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,700
that if I took the book,

120
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,639
she wouldn't owe me anything then.

121
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,840
The Xuanyuan Family is something

122
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,825
I could use later.

123
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,639
Since you said that,

124
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,440
it also makes sense
in terms of the state of mind.

125
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,720
I guess I'm a martial arts prodigy.

126
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:30,200
Father has...

127
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
I know.

128
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,050
He also left you a silk bag?

129
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,925
Maybe he couldn't say it in person,

130
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,900
so he wrote it down.

131
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,931
There is no word on it.

132
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:01,195
Well, I get it.

133
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,091
There is nothing to say.

134
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:07,720
He killed Xuanyuan Dapan

135
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
as an Immortal-on-Earth

136
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,625
and got the retainers
to assassinate Xuanyuan Jingyi.

137
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,080
He left me messages

138
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,979
and taught me to control
the alien officials.

139
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,600
Mount Hui takes on a new aspect

140
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,875
and has a new lease of life now.

141
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,799
He planned these all by himself.

142
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,799
But he still died.

143
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,675
Do you still think he was a weak man?

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,475
Don't you think we blamed him wrongly

145
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:29,775
and misunderstood him?

146
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,080
Where is the son
of the Lord of North Liang?

147
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:39,919
What's his plan about you?

148
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,559
It's not bad for you

149
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,720
to be a royal consort.

150
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:49,320
Your dowry will be
Mount Hui's century-old foundation.

151
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:51,159
You won't be treated badly.

152
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:56,039
Sorry to disappoint you, Mother.

153
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,600
His Highness wants
nothing to do with Mount Hui

154
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,120
and he doesn't want me, either.

155
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,679
It's only for now.

156
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,360
We don't know about the future.

157
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:07,720
You want to sell me to him?

158
00:11:11,225 --> 00:11:12,600
That way we can get what we want.

159
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,875
You want me to count on him.

160
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,559
No one can live

161
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,759
without asking for help.

162
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:21,275
I'd like to be an exception.

163
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,919
It doesn't matter

164
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,279
if you can't be a royal consort.

165
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,759
The world is turbulent now.

166
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,759
We can use the power of North Liang
to sustain Mount Hui.

167
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
Alright.

168
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,840
I won't say anything else.

169
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,600
You've grown up.

170
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,305
You know what you are doing.

171
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:53,000
I want to build a tomb
for my father on the Snowfield.

172
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,440
It's up to you.

173
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:58,985
You don't care about it at all?

174
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,679
The wine he made is good.

175
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,900
When a cup of cinnamon wine is drunk,

176
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,679
two peach blossoms appear on the face.

177
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:15,679
Father wrote it.

178
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,350
He also said

179
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,025
the old laurel tree's fruits

180
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,480
fall down like rain on the mountain
every autumn.

181
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,639
It's proud but not obsequious.

182
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,080
That sounds like the way
he lived in the world.

183
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,775
Now you're saying good things about him.

184
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,800
Isn't it ironic?

185
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,010
Did I ever say anything bad about him?

186
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,950
Father read books for 20 years
for our sake.

187
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:52,919
Finally, he became

188
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,759
the most tolerant Immortal-on-Earth.

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,525
Rest assured.

190
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,080
Father took all his efforts
to achieve what we have now.

191
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,750
I will do anything
to keep Mount Hui standing.

192
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,225
(All I want is for my love
to come back.)

193
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,679
Jingcheng.

194
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm not mad at you anymore.

195
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:06,050
Where is your teacher?

196
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,400
He was summoned to Mount Longhu.

197
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,919
Something went wrong?

198
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,360
Mount Longhu summoned me.

199
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,725
Your Highness,
please get on the road immediately.

200
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,050
Something happened in Mount Longhu.

201
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,559
Those who don't know the fact
must think he is asking me to die.

202
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,350
Since that's what Senior Zhao said,

203
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,775
I'll get us ready to set out.

204
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,159
Mount Longhu invites Your Highness
to come and enjoy the view!

205
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Don't care about him. Let's go.

206
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,039
I can leave.

207
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,279
What about Huangman'er?

208
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,600
Mount Longhu's Arch-Taoists' Office,

209
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,125
the number one sect in the world.

210
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,120
Let's meet them.

211
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,850
(Arch-Taoists' Office, Mount Longhu)

212
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,525
What a big head!

213
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,250
(The Best Goods)

214
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,329
The Best Goods.

215
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:58,525
Well,

216
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,425
does Arch-Taoists' Office
become a shop now?

217
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,300
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

218
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,825
The Best Goods.

219
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:14,275
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

220
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,450
The Best Goods.

221
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,650
We didn't write it.

222
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:25,079
We didn't write it?

223
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,400
Don't follow me.

224
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,359
I'll go there alone.

225
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,100
No!

226
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,039
Huangman'er, be a good boy.

227
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,359
I'll go up there
to deal with some affairs.

228
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,400
Just wait here for me.

229
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,325
I'll wait for you.

230
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:38,925
Um.

231
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,279
Your Highness,

232
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,920
you should bring a maid with you.

233
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,519
No need.

234
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,319
We won't fight.

235
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,599
Even if we will,

236
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:49,359
you girls won't make any difference.

237
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:50,880
Or...

238
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,100
You can't go there with your identity.

239
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,825
Um.

240
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,279
Sometimes I just don't get it.

241
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,975
Do I owe anything to one of you?

242
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:11,325
How about I go with you?

243
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,440
Thank you, Senior!

244
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,799
Why don't you ask me to stay?

245
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,480
You are too powerful to be stopped.

246
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,720
You are almost

247
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,700
as shameless as your father.

248
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
Senior, thanks to
the influence of my family.

249
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,480
All right, let's go.

250
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,160
Just a minute.

251
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,119
This is the end

252
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
of your journey.

253
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,075
After we get to Mount Longhu,
I'll leave the team

254
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,160
and rescue Young Master Longxiang
on my own.

255
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:43,680
When I get back to North Liang,

256
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,680
I'll confess my crime
and ask for punishment.

257
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:51,424
Let's go up there.

258
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:52,050
Um.

259
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:06,900
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

260
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,599
Master!

261
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:17,475
Zhao Xituan has arrived.

262
00:19:21,925 --> 00:19:23,475
Why don't you come out?

263
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:26,550
I'm in the zone.

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,375
Then why did you ask me to come?

265
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,920
It's me who invited you here
to discuss important matters!

266
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,100
Oh.

267
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,359
Danping, you are back.

268
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,250
Forget about
the important matters for now.

269
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,400
What's with the plaque above the door?

270
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,119
I just heard from Master

271
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,599
that it was written by a little monk.

272
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,359
A little monk?

273
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,519
Yeah.

274
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,519
A few days ago, a little monk
came with a girl

275
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,450
to debate doctrines.

276
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,850
He's from Double-Zen Temple.

277
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:03,759
He is still a child

278
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:05,300
and he cares about

279
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,350
the result.

280
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,700
He even made a bet.

281
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,750
Um.

282
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,375
Did he lose?

283
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,925
He lost two games.

284
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,675
We let the juniors debate with him.

285
00:20:18,725 --> 00:20:22,039
The little monk does have some wisdom.

286
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:24,960
He is proficient
in calligraphy and painting.

287
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,475
Why did he write

288
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,300
The Best Goods?

289
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,625
Goods is the little girl's name.

290
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,750
Oh.

291
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:36,625
Well,

292
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,800
what about the big head?

293
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,020
The little monk drew himself

294
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,400
to amuse the little girl!

295
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,119
Interesting.

296
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,475
Why don't you erase it?

297
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,550
Keep it

298
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,600
so the juniors

299
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:53,650
can feel ashamed.

300
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,025
Oh.

301
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,119
Alright.

302
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,480
Forget about the debate.

303
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:01,599
Let's get down to business now.

304
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,375
I've stayed out of this for years.

305
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:06,640
You got me here today specially.

306
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500
How important is it?

307
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,039
It's not that important.

308
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,739
Oh.

309
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:15,480
Just to kill a prince and Xu Fengnian.

310
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:30,725
We just left Mount Hui,
and now we are climbing Mount Longhu.

311
00:21:30,975 --> 00:21:32,500
It's been a busy day.

312
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,750
Senior.

313
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,759
It's not easy to go up Mount Longhu,

314
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,875
and it's even harder to leave.

315
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,575
Let me tell you
about the real situation.

316
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,240
On the surface, there are only

317
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,775
four Arch-Taoists in Mount Longhu.

318
00:21:41,975 --> 00:21:43,450
Zhao Danxia is the Master.

319
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,189
Zhao Xiyi is the oldest by seniority.

320
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,875
Zhao Danping is stationed in the capital
all year round.

321
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,000
Then it's the teacher of Huangman'er,

322
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,350
Zhao Xituan, Taoist Zhao.

323
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,100
As far as I know, the four of them
haven't reached the Celestial Realm.

324
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:55,319
But you said

325
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
that the realm doesn't necessarily
represent the strength.

326
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,125
The four of them

327
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,175
are probably not weaker
than Xuanyuan Dapan.

328
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,025
Why are you telling me this?

329
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,575
Just be frank with me.

330
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,900
Can you take down
the four of them together?

331
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,500
Why would I fight with them?

332
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,839
What if they try to hurt me?

333
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,600
Why would they hurt you?

334
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,025
For world peace.

335
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,400
World peace?

336
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,799
But if Xu Fengnian dies,

337
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,440
Xu Xiao will wipe out Mount Longhu.

338
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,359
Who can compete

339
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,599
with the North Liang Cavalry?

340
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,900
He doesn't have to be dead.

341
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:36,400
What do you mean by that?

342
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:39,125
Destroy Xu Fengnian's Dahuangting.

343
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:40,160
In the future,

344
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,640
after Xu Xiao dies,

345
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,480
there will be internal strife
in North Liang.

346
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:48,039
Xu Xiao has left the capital safely

347
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,575
and he is heading back to North Liang.

348
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,450
The court hasn't made any move yet,

349
00:22:51,575 --> 00:22:52,480
why should we

350
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,900
get ourselves involved in this?

351
00:22:56,725 --> 00:22:58,225
It concerns the national destiny.

352
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,025
How can we be so timid?

353
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,725
Who said that?

354
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,240
The Prime Minister,

355
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,650
Zhang Julu.

356
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,975
It's about

357
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:12,759
the future of Liyang.

358
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,550
Since Mount Longhu

359
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:16,200
enjoyed the benefits

360
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,875
of the court,

361
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:22,225
you should serve your country.

362
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,250
They are using us as their knife.

363
00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:30,480
That's why I said

364
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,340
we only need to destroy his Dahuangting

365
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,160
and keep him alive.

366
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,039
We in Mount Longhu

367
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,525
are not Zhang Julu's retainers.

368
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,450
Xu Fengnian

369
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,125
got his Dahuangting

370
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,700
from Wudang.

371
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,839
Does it ever occur to you
that if he takes over North Liang,

372
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,640
Wudang will take advantage
of the situation and rise up?

373
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,225
We need to nip this in the bud.

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,240
We can blame it on Zhang Julu

375
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,275
after we make it

376
00:23:58,475 --> 00:24:01,725
and let him bear the wrath of Xu Xiao.

377
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
Xu Xiao is no fool.

378
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
North Liang will surely become

379
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,825
Mount Longhu's archenemy.

380
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,075
Don't forget

381
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,720
that Xu Longxiang

382
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:15,400
is your disciple.

383
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Hey!

384
00:24:16,775 --> 00:24:17,920
Don't hurt my disciple.

385
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,640
We won't do anything to him.

386
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,200
Not only that,

387
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:24,275
we will teach him well.

388
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,100
Xu Xiao has only two sons.

389
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,250
Once Xu Fengnian dies,

390
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,880
only Xu Longxiang
will take over North Liang.

391
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,880
If we make it,

392
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,319
the Prime Minister
will owe Mount Longhu one

393
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,519
and the court will praise our loyalty.

394
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,800
Wudang will fall

395
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,519
and the lord of North Liang

396
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,799
will be Mount Longhu's disciple.

397
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,375
We can kill four birds with one stone.

398
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,240
Mount Longhu's centenary goal

399
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,759
will be realized.

400
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,100
Master!

401
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,300
It's time to make a decision!

402
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,275
I'm in the zone.

403
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,720
You can decide.

404
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:08,975
Where is Zhao Xiyi?

405
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,750
He is also in the zone.

406
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,975
Eh.

407
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,759
I still think

408
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,275
we shouldn't do that to Xu Fengnian.

409
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
There is no turning back now.

410
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,800
Did you just say
we needed to kill a prince?

411
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,400
Just an unknown illegitimate prince.

412
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,715
Unknown?

413
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:32,079
How do you know?

414
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,079
What's his name?

415
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:41,075
Who are you?

416
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,850
Zhao Kai.

417
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,119
What's the surname
of the current royal family?

418
00:25:46,975 --> 00:25:48,119
Also Zhao.

419
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,920
You can tell if I can give you
a bright future

420
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,119
with that surname.

421
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,440
Take a look over there.

422
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,279
There is a senior here.

423
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,606
You'll learn any martial art you want.

424
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:59,519
What exactly do you want me to do?

425
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
To kill Xu Fengnian.

426
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,640
You can't kill him!

427
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,720
No, we can't kill him!

428
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,359
But we can destroy his Dahuangting.

429
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,160
Xu Fengnian has many guards around him.

430
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,160
I'm no match for them.

431
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,319
I'm not asking you to fight with them.

432
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:15,880
Just bring him here,

433
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,650
and the senior
will take care of the rest.

434
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
Why me?

435
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,875
Xu Fengnian just got down
from Mount Hui.

436
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:29,039
Tell him Xuanyuan Qingfeng
is up to something.

437
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:30,599
I'm sure he'll be interested in it.

438
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:31,700
After all,

439
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,119
he knows you used to be
a retainer of Xuanyuan.

440
00:26:34,325 --> 00:26:36,359
Then all you need to do

441
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,640
is to lure him here.

442
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:45,050
Li Chungang is beside Xu Fengnian!

443
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:47,125
The old God of Sword.

444
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,000
I wonder if he is still
as powerful as before.

445
00:26:51,575 --> 00:26:53,775
It makes no sense.

446
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:54,825
Well,

447
00:26:55,775 --> 00:26:57,079
you're going to destroy
Xu Fengnian's Dahuangting

448
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,450
and kill Zhao Kai?

449
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:01,325
Zhao Kai wants to instigate a war

450
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,250
so that he can fish in troubled waters.

451
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:05,000
This man is a troublemaker.

452
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,125
We can't keep him!

453
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:09,920
That's still a prince you want to kill.

454
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,800
We can blame it on Xu Fengnian.

455
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,079
It's more whimsical.

456
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,850
Master!

457
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,605
One careless move

458
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,775
might topple Mount Longhu!

459
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,700
We need to take the long view!

460
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:30,650
Just be decisive.

461
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,175
Stop worrying about it.

462
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,000
Xu Fengnian is outside the gate now.

463
00:27:36,325 --> 00:27:37,680
I'll do it myself.

464
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,079
Is this how you discuss with me?

465
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:51,799
You are ready to do it!

466
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,000
People call me
Scholar of Sacrificial Article.

467
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:12,325
They only remember the brush in my hand,

468
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,750
but they forget
that I can also wield a sword!

469
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:35,175
(The Best Goods)

470
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,950
What kind of style is this?

471
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,725
The painting looks familiar.

472
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,650
Please come in, Your Highness.

473
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,125
The vibe doesn't feel right.

474
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,525
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

475
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,799
Senior.

476
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,800
You're not afraid
of the four Arch-Taoists, right?

477
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,640
Why didn't you bring Jiang Ni with you?

478
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,839
What's the use of bringing her here?

479
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,240
Although Cao Changqing doesn't show up,

480
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,975
he has been protecting Jiang Ni
by her side.

481
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,480
If you bring Jiang Ni with you,

482
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,900
she won't stand by and do nothing

483
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,720
if Mount Longhu tries to hurt you,

484
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,450
and then Cao Changqing
will have to step out.

485
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:19,519
You're smart.

486
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,025
I think you know it.

487
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,079
Actually, I'm not that smart.

488
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:25,319
I don't want

489
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,039
to get Jiang Ni involved
in this kind of matter.

490
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:28,319
Xu Fengnian.

491
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,720
What's the matter?

492
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,825
Cao Changqing once warned Jiang Ni

493
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,200
that maybe

494
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:36,240
she would have to make a choice

495
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,175
between you and West Chu one day.

496
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,480
How did she choose?

497
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:41,039
She's not going
to have an answer until then.

498
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,880
Right.

499
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:44,119
What about you?

500
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:46,799
How would you choose

501
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,920
between Jiang Ni and North Liang?

502
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,169
Why should I choose?

503
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,920
North Liang needs to protect
the country. Jiang Ni will go west.

504
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,400
They're in conflict.

505
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,825
The world is vague,

506
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:03,725
and it's hard to tell
what's right and what's wrong.

507
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:05,350
There is no choice that I must make.

508
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:06,960
I won't

509
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,319
put myself in that kind of situation.

510
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,750
North Liang and Jiang Ni,

511
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,839
I want both of them.

512
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:14,319
Senior, let's go.

513
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,425
Let's take a walk
in Arch-Taoists' Office.

514
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,400
Senior?

515
00:30:25,975 --> 00:30:27,450
I could have had both of them.

516
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:14,850
Senior?

517
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,575
Are you okay?

518
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,550
Many years ago,

519
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,375
I went to Mount Longhu.

520
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:27,839
I've heard of it.

521
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,279
You came to Mount Longhu

522
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,200
to challenge Qi Xuanzhen,
the Master at that time.

523
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,750
Actually, I came to ask him
for the life-extension golden elixir.

524
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,319
To save one's life?

525
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,250
Yes.

526
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:40,100
Did you make it?

527
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,200
She died

528
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,279
before I met Qi Xuanzhen.

529
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:20,920
She must mean a lot to you.

530
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,559
How did she die?

531
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:27,975
I killed her myself.

532
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,720
After she died,

533
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:36,325
I went to see Qi Xuanzhen anyway.

534
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,325
I forced Qi Xuanzhen
to have a match with me,

535
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:41,225
as if her death was no big deal.

536
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,960
At that time, we only debated
the martial arts of swords.

537
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,100
We didn't fight.

538
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:47,319
But my sword mind was in turmoil

539
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,839
and I lost badly.

540
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,450
I even fell out of the Celestial Realm.

541
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,119
I fought with other people
after I got down the mountain

542
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:54,925
and lost my arm.

543
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,125
Now it seems like a lifetime ago.

544
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,960
If it weren't for Qi Xuanzhen
to disturb my sword mind,

545
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,100
how would I end up like this?

546
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,850
Was it really Qi Xuanzhen

547
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,075
who disturbed your sword mind?

548
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,625
If Li Chungang wasn't born,

549
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,039
it would be boring.

550
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,720
If Li Chungang wasn't born,

551
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:39,200
the sword way

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,000
would take forever to be discovered.

553
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,440
If Li Chungang wasn't born,

554
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,680
the sword way

555
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:48,799
would take forever to be discovered.

556
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,899
It would be boring...

557
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,240
If I met you at that time

558
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,720
and knew that a man could be
such a scoundrel and have all he wanted,

559
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,100
the result might be different.

560
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:01,650
If she was important to you,

561
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,450
why did you kill her?

562
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:05,519
She tried to kill me,

563
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:07,075
but she stopped.

564
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,400
She was the daughter of my enemy.

565
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:12,440
She couldn't kill me after we met.

566
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,079
Either to kill me,

567
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,000
or to be killed by me,

568
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:15,719
she chose the latter,

569
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,725
and she picked the perfect timing.

570
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,400
What kind of perfect timing?

571
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:22,079
My Mumaniu was broken by Wang Xianzhi.

572
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,639
She was worried
that I would lose my confidence,

573
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,475
so she chose to fight with me
at that time

574
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,875
and got killed by my sword.

575
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,639
I don't understand.

576
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,550
At that time, she and I

577
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,200
were both among the four grand masters.

578
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:41,525
Spear God, Wang Xiu.

579
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
Fujiang Armor, Ye Hongting.

580
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,450
Feng City Lyupao?

581
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,059
Yes.

582
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,000
She thought she could
cheer me up in that way.

583
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,200
Isn't it funny?

584
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Xu Fengnian.

585
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,760
You and Jiang Ni

586
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,075
mustn't make stupid choices like we did.

587
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,625
How about we make a bet?

588
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,050
Regardless of fate

589
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,725
and God's will,

590
00:35:15,525 --> 00:35:16,360
I, Xu Fengnian,

591
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,800
will always choose my own path.

592
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,875
What's the bet?

593
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:26,800
To stay alive

594
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:28,300
and watch me live a bright life.

595
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:32,725
You bad boy.

596
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,320
Senior, let's go.

597
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:35,875
Let me accompany you

598
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:37,275
to take a tour
at Arch-Taoists' Office again.

599
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,275
(Dragons Rising from Lake Ding)

600
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:18,100
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

601
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,750
Senior!

602
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,225
Make an introduction!

603
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,119
I'm Zhao Danping.
Greetings to Senior Li!

604
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,239
Zhao Danping, Scholar of
Sacrificial Article. Taoist Zhao.

605
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,975
What brings you back?

606
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,900
Did you have a hard time in the capital?

607
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,159
God of Sword, you shook the world
with one move of your sword

608
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:41,079
in an unrestrained and appealing way!

609
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,100
How do you

610
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,400
become a guardian of North Liang now?

611
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:49,750
Are you my son?

612
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,600
Ah?

613
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,725
Since you are not my son,

614
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,400
why do you care

615
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,525
what I do?

616
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,039
You are right.

617
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,300
Dahuangting.

618
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,525
You got the wrong person!

619
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,925
My last name is not Da!

620
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:06,975
My last name is Xu,

621
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,175
and I'm Xu Fengnian!

622
00:37:10,075 --> 00:37:11,280
The genuine spirit

623
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:12,679
is rare.

624
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
What a pity!

625
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,199
Why?

626
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm afraid I'll never see it again!

627
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,175
Are you going to be blind?

628
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,559
I could save your life.

629
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,519
I'll only destroy your Dahuangting,

630
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,950
and then

631
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,375
I can let you off.

632
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,650
Senior Zhao!

633
00:37:30,975 --> 00:37:32,960
Is this a decision made by Mount Longhu?

634
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,700
Master didn't issue an order.

635
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,150
Zhao Danping.

636
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:37,800
Don't be so willful.

637
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,159
Master is in the zone.

638
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,575
I can take charge

639
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,639
of these trifles.

640
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,039
I don't think so!

641
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,000
Senior Li.

642
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,719
This is

643
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,925
Mount Longhu.

644
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:53,425
I just figured something out at the gate

645
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,925
and I made a bet with the boy.

646
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:58,525
I want to see what his future holds.

647
00:37:58,975 --> 00:37:59,760
Therefore,

648
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,100
you can't hurt him!

649
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:03,800
But you don't even

650
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,825
have a sword now.

651
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,300
Who said that?

652
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:15,700
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

653
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,400
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

654
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,700
If Li Chungang wasn't born,

655
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,425
the sword way
would take forever to be discovered.

656
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,100
Swords!

657
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,400
Come!

658
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,225
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

659
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,825
(Arch-Taoists' Office)

660
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,079
I don't think so!

661
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,840
What's the matter?

662
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,199
Li Chungang

663
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,500
reentered the Realm
of Sword-Immortal-on-Earth.

664
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,575
Sword-Immortal-on-Earth?

665
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,159
Didn't he fall sharply?

666
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,525
Didn't he even fall out
of the Celestial Realm?

667
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:00,475
How did he become
a Sword-Immortal-on-Earth?

668
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:03,650
God of Sword.

669
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,225
There's no need
to bring Xu Fengnian here.

670
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:19,225
If we fight

671
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,935
with Li Chungang right now,

672
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,475
whether we win or lose,

673
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,350
we will lose one life.

674
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,239
Senior,

675
00:40:35,575 --> 00:40:36,440
I understand.

676
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,914
You have one last chance.

677
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,320
Wudi City?

678
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,400
Wang Xianzhi once broke
Li Chungang's sword,

679
00:40:48,475 --> 00:40:49,555
Mumaniu.

680
00:40:50,225 --> 00:40:51,079
Now,

681
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:53,079
Li Chungang reentered
the Realm of Sword-Immortal-on-Earth.

682
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:54,025
When he gets to Wudi City,

683
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,150
I think he will fight
with Wang Xianzhi once again.

684
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,375
At that time,
there'll be no other God of Sword

685
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:01,280
by Xu Fengnian's side.

(Arch-Taoists' Office)

687
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,775
God of Sword,

688
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:18,800
you entered
the Realm of Sword-Immortal-on-Earth.

689
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,725
Congratulations.

690

Mount Longhu

691
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,719
never wanted to hurt His Highness.

692
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:27,000
What happened today

693
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,679
is a misunderstanding.

694
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:30,480
Who are you?

695
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:31,625
Show yourself!

696
00:41:32,975 --> 00:41:35,480
I'm Zhao Danxia.

697
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:37,039
I'm in the zone

698
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,925
and it's inconvenient for me
to come out.

699
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,525
You are the new master of Mount Longhu.

700
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:44,719
A misunderstanding?

701
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,000
Senior.

702
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,559
I was just curious

703
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,500
which realm you were in.

704
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,159
That was a little test.

705
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,325
Please don't mind.

706
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,450
Are you one of the four Arch-Taoists?

707
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,375
Just a bubble reputation.

708
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,200
The Arch-Taoists among this generation
are something.

709
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,850
I'm overpraised.

710
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,725
Then, we're leaving!

711
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:09,850
Senior.

(Arch-Taoists' Office)
Please go ahead.

713
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:12,900
Come on!

714
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,320
Let's go down the mountain!

715
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,450
Senior!

716
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,500
Take good care of my younger brother!

717
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:20,325
Don't pick on him!

718
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,600
I'm ill-tempered!

Er…
