00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:01,880
(The tassel crowns the knight.
The sword is snow white.)

2
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:03,240
(In the silver saddle,
he rides like a shooting star.)

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,480
(He kills a man within ten steps.
Invincible he is all the way ahead.)

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,040
(He would leave once it's done.
No trace of him is to be found.)

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,775
(Mushan Hall)

8
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:15,599
Lord is known for elegance.

9
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
You do live up to your reputation.

10
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,840
Fengnian, there are no strangers here.

11
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,350
You may just call me Uncle.

12
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:37,240
My greetings, Uncle.

13
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,680
You are just like your father.

14
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:44,400
My son

15
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,900
is way inferior to you.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,759
I'm flattered.

17
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:52,919
You had a misunderstanding

18
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,639
with my son on Chunshen Lake.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,675
He feels embarrassed

20
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,080
to meet you.

21
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:03,225
So, I came with his mother.

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,879
Sorry for it.

23
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,625
Don't you apologize?

24
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:25,879
My apology, Xu.

25
00:03:37,075 --> 00:03:38,400
It's a misunderstanding.

26
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't deserve your apology.

27
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,759
Fengnian is tolerant.

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,879
He has forgiven you.

29
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:12,500
Hey.

30
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,400
Where are you going, sir?

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,039
To the street.

32
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,800
Now?

33
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,759
Lord of Jing'an and Xu Fengnian

34
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:19,875
are all sly.

35
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,120
Don't worry about them.

36
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,550
Lord of Jing'an is in that yard.

37
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,925
Would you go for revenge?

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,920
You don't need to stay with me.

39
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,575
I won't be impulsive.

40
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:45,959
Now I only live

41
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,550
to guard Xu Fengnian.

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
You're devout indeed,

43
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,400
praying every day.

44
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:09,439
You must be blessed by Bodhisattva.

45
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,525
I only wish

46
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,925
for good karma.

47
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,399
By the way,

48
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,759
I heard that you moved

49
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,850
to Mushan Island days ago.

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,879
Yes, for one night.

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,216
Oh.

52
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,950
Wang Linquan on the island

53
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,079
is my favorite general.

54
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,825
Surprisingly,

55
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,199
you're close to him.

56
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,650
You have friends everywhere indeed.

57
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,350
To be honest,

58
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,200
he once served in the army.

59
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,750
He is my senior.

60
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,200
Oh.

61
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,125
I see.

62
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,450
He may stay
for a few more days with you.

63
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,199
He can come back for duty

64
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,075
after you leave.

65
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,550
Sorry, Uncle.

66
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,839
He worked for North Liang before.

67
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,000
He should be back to North Liang.

68
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
That's where he belongs.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
Right?

70
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,000
You have a point.

71
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:40,759
Is it your father's will?

72
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
I have the say

73
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:46,040
on this trivial matter.

74
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,800
North Liang is a fair land.

75
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,079
You are

76
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,920
already the pride of your family,

77
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,920
way better than my son.

78
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,120
Qingzhou is even better.

79
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,775
Especially my aunt.

80
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,575
She's so beautiful.

81
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,399
Aunt, do you also believe in Buddhism?

82
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,160
Our nephew is asking you.

83
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,025
You should reply.

84
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:28,720
Yes,

85
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:30,125
I do.

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,125
In that case,

87
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm supposed to give you a bracelet.

88
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,450
No, thanks.

89
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,079
It shows my care.

90
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,319
Please accept it.

91
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,075
It's a kind gift from Fengnian.

92
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,750
Don't refuse it.

93
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,775
Yes.

94
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,519
One-armed old man!

95
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,639
Give it back to me!

96
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,319
One-armed old man!

97
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,800
Give it back to me!

98
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
One-armed old man!

99
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,240
Give it back!

100
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
One-armed old man!

101
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,818
(Longevity)
Give me the pinwheel!

102
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:02,900
- Wait a minute.
- One-armed old man!

103
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,825
Give me the pinwheel!

104
00:08:03,825 --> 00:08:04,639
Take it.

105
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,319
Go. Go.

106
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,075
Hurry.

107
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:06,850
Wait for me.

108
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,000
Hey, lass.

109
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:11,235
What a coincidence.

110
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,725
(Longevity)

111
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,079
I asked.

112
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,600
Coffins' price goes up again.

113
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,125
I can't even afford a coffin.

114
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,160
Do you wanna die so young?

115
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,079
We're born to die.

116
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,279
You won't fear death
when you see everything through.

117
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:30,300
Be my disciple

118
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,720
and no one will let you die.

119
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:35,200
Look.

120
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:37,475
Isn't it Mr. Wang?

121
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:39,300
Yeah.

122
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,440
It's him.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,475
He's in a hurry.

124
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,840
My lord.

125
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:05,425
Go.

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,425
There's something in my mansion.

127
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:22,519
Fengnian.

128
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,300
See you

129
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,675
some other day.

130
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,440
See you, Uncle.

131
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,800
When I get a bracelet,

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
I'll have it delivered to your mansion.

133
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,600
I saw Wang Linquan in the street.

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,879
But he didn't come to the inn.

135
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,200
He went to the Mansion
of Lord of Jing'an.

136
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,925
Did Wang Linquan change his mind?

137
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,440
There's no turning back.

138
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,279
What?

139
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,080
Does your father know

140
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,159
you've come here?

141
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:39,759
What is it to do with you?

142
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,200
It's urgent. Please tell me.

143
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,750
He doesn't.

144
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,350
Is there a way back to Mushan Island?

145
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,600
Who's going back?

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
You and I.

147
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,600
The ships are all kept by my father.

148
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,440
You can ask him for help.

149
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,200
No.

150
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,360
He can't know it. We'll go back alone.

151
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,759
What are you going to do?

152
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,000
Your father

153
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,480
went to the Mansion of Lord of Jing'an.

154
00:11:15,225 --> 00:11:16,519
Do you suspect my father?

155
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,075
Have you ever thought about

156
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,325
why your father received us

157
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:20,879
with great fanfare?

158
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,879
In the long run,

159
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,440
that he hides his identity

160
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:26,950
is better for North Liang.

161
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,240
Moreover,

162
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,559
why did he insist on getting you

163
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,625
by my side?

164
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,720
Do you know it?

165
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,919
He wants to save your life.

166
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,320
What?

167
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,725
Xu Fengnian went too far.

168
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,799
Father.

169
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,000
Why does Wang Linquan
have the guts to see you?

170
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,240
It's Xu Xiao's idea.

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,799
Xu Xiao?

172
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
Xu Fengnian is young after all.

173
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,475
He made it clear

174
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:09,050
just now.

175
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,575
He wanted

176
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:13,975
Wang Linquan and his family

177
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,750
to move back to North Liang.

178
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,675
Wang Linquan has exposed himself.

179
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,720
He has to go.

180
00:12:21,525 --> 00:12:23,075
If Wang Linquan leaves,

181
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,679
Xu Fengnian

182
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,120
will not be able to leave.

183
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
It looks like

184
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm in a dilemma.

185
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:32,919
If I let Xu Fengnian go,

186
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,440
the court will suspect that

187
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,350
I have allied with North Liang.

188
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,975
If I kill Xu Fengnian,

189
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,320
Xu Xiao will retaliate.

190
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,350
But in fact,

191
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,440
Xu Xiao has left us a way

192
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,575
to satisfy both sides.

193
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:54,300
Keep the Wang family?

194
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,279
Exactly.

195
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:00,475
Wang Linquan has exposed himself

196
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,100
as North Liang's spy.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,960
If we keep his family in Qingzhou,

198
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:06,840
the court will

199
00:13:07,075 --> 00:13:08,759
know our stance.

200
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,279
If the relations between Qingzhou
and North Liang are strained,

201
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,925
the court

202
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,875
will make Xu Xiao see His Majesty.

203
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:20,675
To reassure the court,

204
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,475
keeping the Wang family

205
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,850
may not be enough.

206
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,875
Right.

207
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,450
To clarity our stance,

208
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,375
the Wang family must be wiped out.

209
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:37,720
Is this also Xu Xiao's plan?

210
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:40,759
Otherwise, why do you think

211
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,650
Wang Linquan

212
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,960
exposed his identity openly?

213
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,879
Since he received Xu Fengnian
to the island,

214
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,480
he's been ready

215
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,480
to sacrifice all his family.

216
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,350
Getting his subordinate's family

217
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,525
all killed,

218
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,320
Xu Xiao is cruel.

219
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,320
If he can't even do this,

220
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:09,700
he's not eligible for this game.

221
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,480
That's impossible.

222
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,360
Otherwise, why did your father

223
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,225
urge you to go with me?

224
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,850
That's the way to save my life.

225
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,625
He's your father.

226
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,700
It's part of your father's plan

227
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,875
that our family will be sacrificed!

228
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:33,175
Only if we go back to Mushan Island

229
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,850
can I save your family.

230
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,559
I never play a game

231
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,575
as per others' rules.

232
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:47,039
Fine.

233
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,960
Let's go.

234
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,775
You guys stay.

235
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,399
Don't let anyone know I've left here.

236
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,480
I'll be right back.

237
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,150
If you decided to save the Wang family,

238
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,325
how will you leave Qingzhou?

239
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:00,960
I won't take Xu Xiao's way.

240
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,700
I will make

241
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,100
a way of my own.

242
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:25,650
Serve tea to Mr. Wang.

243
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,675
I don't dare to bother Her Highness.

244
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,559
For so many years,

245
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,975
you've done me

246
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:38,279
a lot of favor.

247
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,675
You deserve this cup of tea.

248
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,300
Thank you, my lord.

249
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,500
I come to beg you

250
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:17,360
to let His Highness go east.

251
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,550
I believe

252
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,639
you've known everything.

253
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,500
Some people leave.

254
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,075
Some people must stay.

255
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,900
I'll stay.

256
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,350
You alone

257
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,519
can't exchange for Xu Fengnian.

258
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,250
My daughter is young.

259
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:47,575
Please spare her life.

260
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,559
Except for her,

261
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,350
all my family will stay in Qingzhou.

262
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,875
Since it's all your family,

263
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,000
no one shall be spared.

264
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,275
Fine.

265
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:18,975
As you wish, my lord.

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll go back to the island

267
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,880
and move my family

268
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,119
to Xiangfan.

269
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,425
Upon your arrival,

270
00:17:31,575 --> 00:17:33,025
I'll have men

271
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,559
escort Xu Fengnian out of Qingzhou.

272
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,725
Don't you hate Xu Xiao?

273
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:00,150
You know nothing about
North Liang's army!

274
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,100
It's the will of the people

275
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,680
that makes North Liang formidable.

276
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,175
You may leave

277
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,279
and think about it.

278
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,600
Tea.

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,850
Get up!

280
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
How shameless you are!

281
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,400
Would you be captivated by him

282
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,925
if you talked more with him?

283
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,960
You think I don't know
he touched your hand?

284
00:19:41,175 --> 00:19:42,500
You shrew!

285
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,839
You feel happy in your heart,

286
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,075
right?

287
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,475
I'm a shrew.

288
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,786
I don't deserve to be your wife.

289
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:10,839
Pei Nanwei.

290
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,675
Did I hurt you?

291
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,050
No.

292
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,550
You hate me.

293
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,525
Why don't you die?

294
00:20:41,225 --> 00:20:42,240
I feared death.

295
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,480
That's why I married you.

296
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,319
Get out!

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,300
If you had cried for mercy,

298
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,825
he might've stopped.

299
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,450
Thank you, Your Highness.

300
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:31,799
There is no boat here.

301
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,839
I've told you

302
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,950
my father kept all the boats.

303
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,000
How will we go to the island?

304
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,960
Miss Wang.

305
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,920
We should hurry.

306
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,519
We must be back before your father.

307
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,425
We can go without the boat.

308
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:00,850
Is this

309
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:03,375
Yuan?

310
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,150
You are knowledgeable.

311
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,450
I thought it was a turtle

312
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,775
when I first saw it.

313
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,925
What are you waiting for?

314
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:16,800
Come up.

315
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:00,825
Stop looking.

316
00:24:01,075 --> 00:24:01,775
There's no word.

317
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,425
Where did you find Yuan?

318
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:07,625
By a lake when I was little.

319
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,700
Then we got familiar.

320
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:13,880
It couldn't be born with a monolith.

321
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,200
Yuan might have a story.

322
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:19,300
Why don't you ask it?

323
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,119
Can it talk?

324
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,775
Yeah.

325
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:22,975
It can also recite poems.

326
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:26,775
Are you still in a mood to joke?

327
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,050
Better than wearing a long face.

328
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,025
Right.

329
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,440
Black! Let's go back to the island.

330
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,775
We need to save people!

331
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,925
Did you name it Black?

332
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,775
It's so black.

333
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,480
Black is a perfect name for it.

334
00:24:56,225 --> 00:24:57,880
Don't let anyone know

335
00:24:58,025 --> 00:24:59,240
you can summon Yuan.

336
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,425
Or you'll be in trouble.

337
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,625
I know.

338
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:06,000
If it weren't urgent,

339
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,680
I wouldn't have let you know.

340
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:08,960
Don't worry.

341
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,375
I won't tell anyone.

342
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,079
Why do you save my family?

343
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,350
Do you need any reason to save people?

344
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,700
Your father planed everything.

345
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,880
Now you're disrupting it.

346
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,400
Lord of Jing'an will have
no turning back.

347
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:38,200
Isn't it hard for you to leave Qingzhou?

348
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,119
Yes.

349
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:44,700
I know it.

350
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:46,400
As long as I steeled myself

351
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:48,359
and followed Xu Xiao's plan,

352
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,759
I could leave safely.

353
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,000
But sometimes,

354
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,500
we should be foolish.

355
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,600
Isn't it better to be smart?

356
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,759
I used to travel for three years

357
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
with a friend,

358
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,079
Wen Hua.

359
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,079
A swordsman.

360
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,800
Was he good?

361
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:19,550
I've never heard about him.

362
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,480
He had a wooden sword with him,

363
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:24,880
and never

364
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:26,640
won a fight.

365
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,345
Wooden sword?

366
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:30,920
He was too poor

367
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,875
to buy a true sword.

368
00:26:34,775 --> 00:26:36,625
How come you had such a friend?

369
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,440
Back then Old Huang and I were
even poorer.

370
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,240
We met him when stealing chickens,

371
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:42,359
and ran away together.

372
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
Then we became friends.

373
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:48,000
Wen Hua

374
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,750
did many filthy things

375
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,575
like pilfering.

376
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,839
His clothes were always shabby.

377
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:56,950
His face

378
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,440
was dirty.

379
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:00,480
He always boasted that

380
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,240
he'd be

381
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,720
a top swordsman.

382
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,400
But no swordsman is like him.

383
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,275
You're right.

384
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,720
I said the same thing to him.

385
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,000
Why did you bring him up?

386
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,160
We once traveled together

387
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,799
on the journey.

388
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,319
At the worst of times,

389
00:27:26,275 --> 00:27:27,279
we nearly starved to death.

390
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,175
Someone offered him 100 taels of silver

391
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,279
to kill people.

392
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,575
Did he do it?

393
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,200
No, he threw the money away.

394
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,500
Was his target an innocent person?

395
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,700
I asked him

396
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,825
why he didn't accept the money

397
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:45,950
since he was starving.

398
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,950
Anyway, swordsmen

399
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,500
were killers.

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,050
What did he say?

401
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,079
He said,

402
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,200
a swordsman

403
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:00,825
might be slovenly

404
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,250
or sloppy,

405
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,599
but he must have a good heart.

406
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:10,559
If a swordsman killed the innocent

407
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,025
solely to survive,

408
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,359
he wouldn't deserve a sword.

409
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:21,839
He was foolish, wasn't he?

410
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,799
He had nothing but a wooden sword.

411
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:25,960
Not very much.

412
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,025
I'm foolish as well.

413
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,599
I listened and agreed with him.

414
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,640
So,

415
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,079
you don't want to sacrifice my family

416
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,680
because

417
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,279
you want to be clean in your heart.

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,900
I might not be a swordsman,

419
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,300
but I wanna be a good person.

420
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,079
Wen Hua said, what he feared the most

421
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,039
was to feel guilty.

422
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,960
So, I don't wanna choose

423
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,875
or compromise.

424
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,050
I only do what I think is right.

425
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,400
Yes, you're foolish.

426
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,559
I wonder how a person like you

427
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,750
should take over North Liang.

428
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,325
Yeah.

429
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:18,525
Perhaps I'm not made for that.

430
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,359
But I wish for a lord in North Liang

431
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,875
like you.

432
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,400
Never trade things off

433
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:34,625
nor compromise.

434
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,119
It sounds foolish,

435
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,839
but it'd be interesting

436
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,200
to have a person like you
take over North Liang.

437
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,675
(Chunshen Residence)
The whole family moves to North Liang?

438
00:30:01,775 --> 00:30:02,880
Any questions?

439
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,880
This matter is big.

440
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,375
Shouldn't we wait until Lord is back?

441
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:09,759
It's Mr. Wang's will.

442
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:11,079
You can ask Miss Wang.

443
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,279
Exactly.

444
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,799
My father ordered you to move now.

445
00:30:14,675 --> 00:30:16,175
It's too hasty.

446
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:17,625
The belongings

447
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,079
haven't yet been packed up.

448
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,425
Take only money and clothes.

449
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:21,720
Leave first.

450
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,519
We'll see to the belongings later.

451
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:24,450
Well...

452
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,800
I'm not lying to you!

453
00:30:30,925 --> 00:30:31,949
That's right.

454
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:25,687
Hurry.

455
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:29,971
Come on. Hurry up.

456
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,240
Give me a hand.

457
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,443
Hey.

458
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,418
This room.

459
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:50,465
Coming.

460
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,024
- Hurry!
- Coming!

461
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,418
Coming.

462
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,775
My lord.

463
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:02,925
- My lord.
- It...

464
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,079
- My lord.
- Hurry.

465
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:05,200
Your Highness.

466
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,039
Why are you back?

467
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:11,650
How did you get out of there?

468
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:12,880
What's going on?

469
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,325
Mr. Wang, you're late.

470
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,700
A ship has set sail.

471
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,375
What ship?

472
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,800
Where is it heading?

473
00:32:18,975 --> 00:32:19,680
Back to North Liang.

474
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,319
Hurry up.

475
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,325
Who will be back?

476
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:22,300
Our family.

477
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,650
We can't!

478
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,875
Nearly half people have gone.

479
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:27,960
The Wang family

480
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,075
cannot leave now.

481
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,119
Who do you think would be the next lord

482
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,600
of North Liang?

483
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,119
No one but you.

484
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,839
In that case,

485
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,700
are you defying my order?

486
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,275
No.

487
00:32:40,275 --> 00:32:41,125
Another two boxes are in that room.

488
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,250
I'm not.

489
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:42,975
It's...

490
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,900
Don't forget anything.

491
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
It's the plan of the General.

492
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,700
Your family shall sacrifice
for my leave from Qingzhou.

493
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,440
Right?

494
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:52,650
Things have changed.

495
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,250
Xu Xiao has changed his plan.

496
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,475
Your family won't be sacrificed.

497
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,400
This is huge.

498
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,800
I'm not deceiving you.

499
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,079
Get aboard now.

500
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,839
In North Liang,

501
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,279
there are many important tasks for you.

502
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,119
Well...

503
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,050
Will the Lord of Jing'an

504
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,160
allow you to leave Qingzhou?

505
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,725
Xu Xiao has arranged everything.

506
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:12,450
Two boxes here.

507
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,425
- Leave now
- See if there are other things.

508
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,400
or you will implicate me.

509
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,094
Don't forget anything.

510
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:16,720
Listen.

511
00:33:16,825 --> 00:33:18,079
I have a warrant from Xu Xiao.

512
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,799
Let me show you.

513
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,100
Come.

514
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,082
Give me a hand.

515
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,935
Hey, you take that side.

516
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,650
Let me.

517
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:25,839
Watch it.

518
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,950
Mr. Wang is drunk. Carry him aboard.

519
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,000
Well...

520
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,146
It's been tied up.

521
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:31,100
Do as he said.

522
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,319
Carry my father aboard

523
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,325
and leave now.

524
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

525
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,950
Did you knock my father out?

526
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,160
Or what?

527
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,100
There's nothing here.

528
00:33:51,275 --> 00:33:52,200
Should we

529
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,775
leave him here to get killed?

530
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,200
Alright then.

531
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,250
Um.

532
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,450
Good girl.

533
00:34:01,925 --> 00:34:02,559
Listen.

534
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,100
You should take care of this

535
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,200
and move as soon as possible.

536
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,625
Leave the burdens behind.

537
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,575
Where are you going?

538
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:09,850
Back to Xiangfan.

539
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,550
Why don't you go back with us?

540
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,075
No, I won't go back to North Liang.

541
00:34:14,775 --> 00:34:16,550
If you go back,

542
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,175
will the Lord of Jing'an
allow you to leave?

543
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,250
I know what to do.

544
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,450
How about

545
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,760
I let Black get you away from Qingzhou?

546
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,800
Qingzhou is vast.

547
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,000
Some places have no waterways.

548
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,500
Moreover,

549
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,400
what about the people in the inn?

550
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,900
How can I leave all of them
to the Lord of Jing'an?

551
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,119
But...

552
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,280
Stop thinking too much.

553
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,599
Or I'll knock you out as well.

554
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,375
Don't you dare!

555
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:39,385
Another box here.

556
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:40,525
Leave here as soon as possible.

557
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:42,700
And take the survivors
in the Lin family.

558
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
I know.

559
00:34:44,925 --> 00:34:46,000
Take care.

560
00:34:46,525 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm going.

561
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,320
We'll wait for you in North Liang.

562
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,119
Sure.

563
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,320
Don't die.

564
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:55,119
I'm waiting for you
to take over North Liang.

565
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,320
And make the world
more interesting, right?

566
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,475
You have my word.

567
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,000
Hey.

568
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,525
Do you need one more maid?

569
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,840
No.

570
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,639
See you.

571
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,159
You fool.

572
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:19,800
Tofu!

573
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,250
Steamed and fried buns.

574
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:33,900
This one.

575
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,650
Sure.

576
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,900
I'll pack it up for you.

577
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,650
Pack it in this ebony box.

578
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,625
Put this bracelet

579
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,950
in such a good box?

580
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,650
Yes, I think it's good.

581
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Steamed and fried buns.

582
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,679
Grandpa Wei.

583
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,159
I went back to the inn

584
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,079
and knew you had come out.

585
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,920
So, I'm looking for you.

586
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,159
You're really here.

587
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:02,725
Have you asked around?

588
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,850
Yes.

589
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:06,775
Zhao Xun once loved Pei Nanwei,

590
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:08,360
but later

591
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,920
Lord of Jing'an married her.

592
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,875
After they got married,

593
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,250
Lord of Jing'an adored her.

594
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,960
Not only in Xiangfan,

595
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,039
it's known in Qingzhou

596
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,050
that she is the apple

597
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,539
of his eye.

598
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,880
That's great.

599
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:23,925
Grandpa Wei.

600
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:25,500
Go to the Mansion of Lord of Jing'an

601
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,325
and tell him

602
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:27,350
that this bracelet is a gift from me

603
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,275
to Her Highness.

604
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:33,775
Wait.

605
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,525
Go get a writing brush and paper.

606
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,300
I'll leave a word

607
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:43,450
in the box.

608
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,000
Um.

609
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,525
Don't you open it

610
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:03,900
and see the bracelet from Xu Fengnian?

611
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,375
If you are angry,

612
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,039
I can return it.

613
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:13,550
Do you think I am

614
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,275
this petty?

615
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,975
Open it.

616
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:21,850
I also want to see

617
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,000
what kind of bracelet it is.

618
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:43,639
Made of leftover materials.

619
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:53,775
Read it by yourself.

620
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,719
Only a small gift.

621
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,519
Please go to the reed marsh
tomorrow afternoon.

622
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,000
I'd like to see you wear it.

623
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,250
Father.

624
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:22,600
What's with the rush?

625
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,875
The Wangs were gone.

626
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:24,760
What?

627
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,600
Wang Linquan and his family
ran away by ship.

628
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,550
All his family?

629
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:36,639
Yes.

630
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,275
They left in a hurry.

631
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,550
When I got the news,

632
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,250
the ship had left Qingzhou.

633
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:45,600
Should I chase them?

634
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:51,239
The navy can't leave Qingzhou.

635
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,125
It's military order.

636
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,200
How to chase them?

637
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,425
Where is Xu Fengnian?

638
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,360
He's in the inn.

639
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,650
But he's already packing up.

640
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,200
He said he'd travel east tomorrow.

641
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,920
Since it's from His Highness,

642
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:25,719
you may accept it.

643
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,325
What about the letter?

644
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,119
He calls me his Uncle.

645
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,280
Tomorrow,

646
00:39:47,925 --> 00:39:49,880
you may go to the reed marsh

647
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,159
and see him off on my behalf.

648
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:57,450
He's the heir of North Liang.

649
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,079
Don't be rude.

650
00:40:01,725 --> 00:40:02,650
Yes.

651
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,280
Xu Fengnian

652
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,960
has put himself and me

653
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,400
both in an impasse.

654
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:38,081
Go get the person in the dungeon

655
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,775
here.

656
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,050
Father.

657
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,175
Zhao Kai pays respect to you, my lord.

658
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:11,225
Tomorrow,

659
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,850
Xu Fengnian will leave.

660
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,600
It doesn't matter

661
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:22,280
if he leaves or not.

662
00:41:22,675 --> 00:41:23,725
It depends on

663
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:26,719
whether you want him to leave.

664
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:31,075
You told me

665
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,100
you were confident to kill him.

666
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,775
I've gathered men

667
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,625
to kill him for you.

668
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:57,600
Not for me.

669
00:41:58,925 --> 00:42:00,475
It'll be for yourself.

670
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:02,400
I know nothing.

671
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:06,375
Yes, my lord.

672
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,550
I'll kill him

673
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:10,325
for a personal grudge.

674
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,500
It has nothing to do

675
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:14,650
with Qingzhou.

676
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:20,975
Then

677
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,175
kill him.

678
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,679
I wonder when and where?

679
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,100
Tomorrow afternoon.

680
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:32,350
