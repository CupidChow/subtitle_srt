1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,480
This is Young Lady's favorite gold hairpin.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,940
This is Young Lady's dowry, a jade bangle.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,940
This is Young Lady's favorite rouge.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,900
Young Lady.

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,770
Where are you?

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,810
I

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,810
am

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,560
back

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,060
home.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,650
Young Lady!

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,230
Young Lady, you're back!

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,060
You're back,

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,270
but this room

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,650
will soon belong to that annoying princess.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,940
Who said so?

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,310
No one can snatch my thing.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm back this time

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
to deal with her!

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,980
Young Lady, you've come around?

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,810
Of course.

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,770
The more I tolerate her,

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,980
the angrier I am.

23
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,810
The more I let go,

24
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,270
the more I lose.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,440
I trusted her so much,

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,900
but she tricked me.

27
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,730
So,

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,440
I can't tolerate it anymore.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,230
Even if I'm leaving,

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,190
I shall leave after defeating her.

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,560
I must reveal her true colors.

32
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,730
You're indeed my Young Lady.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,650
So mighty!

34
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,770
But...

35
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,520
How can we defeat her?

36
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,440
To do that,

37
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,610
we should start with Zhou Han.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,320
[The Blessed Bride]
[Episode 23]

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,560
Waiter!

40
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,020
Yes!

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,560
Bill, please!

42
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,610
Sir.

43
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,860
Keep the change.

44
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,190
Thank you, sir.

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,860
Please come again.

46
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,940
Freshly steamed buns!

47
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,690
Young Lady.

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,110
Our target is eight o'clock.

49
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,690
He's alone. No abnormality for now.

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,770
Something must be off when he's acting weird.

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,810
It proves that we came at the right time today.

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,230
Why is he

53
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,480
so happy today?

54
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,440
Who cares?

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,940
Let's follow him first.

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,860
Let's go!

57
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,900
Are you done with the scoop?

58
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Yes, we're done.

59
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,480
Hurry up!

60
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,020
What an idiot!

61
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,520
I promised to give him the treasure map.

62
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,060
But he goes alone so publicly.

63
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,810
He's even being so flamboyant.

64
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,520
What a smart move, Your Highness.

65
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,430
You expected that he would go there alone.

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,440
Greed made him want to
take the treasure map for himself.

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,270
Of course he wouldn't share it with others.

68
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,150
I know this

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,520
very well.

70
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,520
Then, this man...

71
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,690
Get rid of him.

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
But killing such a person

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,190
would dirty Your Highness's hands.

74
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,940
You're right.

75
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,020
But Ling Qiye

76
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,110
is my beloved husband.

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,650
For the sake of him,

78
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,940
I can do anything.

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Young Lady, why did he come here?

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,650
He must have his reasons for being here.

81
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,190
Later,

82
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,270
we should tie him up right away.

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,980
He likes to kidnap people so much.

84
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
Let's go!

85
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,860
What are you trying to do?

86
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
Someone paid for your life.

87
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,860
For my life?

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,150
Guys, we can talk it out.

89
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,940
What are you doing?

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,190
We are part-time workers.

91
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,520
Part-time workers? Get to work!

92
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,730
I can give it to you.

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
So what if you have money?

94
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
-Move!
-Move!

95
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,400
You...

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,770
Move!

97
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,810
Let's talk it out.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,110
You...

99
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
What are you doing?

100
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,900
Let me go! Let me go!

101
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,440
Who are you?

102
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,980
Let me go!

103
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,360
Let me go!

104
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,560
You're here for money, right?

105
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
I have money.

106
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,190
I'll become super rich soon!

107
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,810
I'll give you the money.

108
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,360
What exactly do you want?

109
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,770
Who wants to kill me?

110
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,360
I have never

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,110
hurt anyone.

112
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,560
Who wants to kill me?

113
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,770
Who sent you here?

114
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,230
Your Highness.

115
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,770
Since you asked sincerely,

116
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,980
I shall

117
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,610
let you die with your answer.

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,650
So you're the one.

119
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,230
So you're the one who wants to kill me.

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,020
Who knew I, Zhou Han, a wise man,

121
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,730
would die in the hands of my own sister in the end?

122
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,610
What nonsense is that?

123
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,730
Do you not believe me?

124
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,400
There is a birthmark

125
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,440
that looks like an orchid on your left shoulder.

126
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,270
Am I right?

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,400
How did you know?

128
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,480
You must have

129
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,860
heard about it from my personal maid.

130
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,520
She told you, right?

131
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
I have

132
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,810
the same birthmark too.

133
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,560
If you don't believe me...

134
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,020
If you don't believe me...

135
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,230
This side.

136
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,230
Our father worked as a butler

137
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,810
at Prince's Residence back then.

138
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,020
Everything was going well.

139
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,900
But that cunning thief from Xuling Manor

140
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,770
always snitched on our father to the Prince

141
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,480
whenever he visited Prince's Residence.

142
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,110
In the end,

143
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,690
our father was punished by the Prince

144
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,110
and died from depression.

145
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,860
You're lying!

146
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,020
Xin.

147
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,940
You are the best plan that I've ever made in my life.

148
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,440
Since our father is dead

149
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,270
and the Prince had mistreated our family,

150
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,060
I did a great deal before I die.

151
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,770
Her biological daughter

152
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,440
was born on the same day as you,

153
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,400
so I switched both of you.

154
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,980
I let my sister become the Princess

155
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,940
and let her daughter

156
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,150
live with hatred

157
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,230
with me forever.

158
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,690
Young Lady, so you're...

159
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,360
You made up

160
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,230
a pretty good story, huh?

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,360
Someone!

162
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,730
Put him in the prison!

163
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,060
I shall

164
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,860
interrogate him myself!

165
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,810
Yes!

166
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,110
Take him away!

167
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,610
Your Highness.

168
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,310
Xin!

169
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,360
Xin!

170
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,560
Take him away!

171
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,230
It's a severe crime to kill your own brother!

172
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,310
You'll be punished by heaven!

173
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,860
