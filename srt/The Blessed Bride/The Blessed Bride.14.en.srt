saying that you are terminally ill?

11

I thought
something was seriously wrong with you.

Seriously?

28

This pill has been passed down
for several generations and is very precious.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,140
It needs to be stored in a special way

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,970
in order to retain
its unique medicinal properties.

31

This way is strange indeed.

what does it do?

This Yangchun Pill is a holy grail product
for nourishing yin and strengthening yang.

To tell you the truth,

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,800
I went to Ling's Residence

40
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,760
last time

41
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,430
to find out

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,220
whether Ling Qiye's feelings for you are sincere.

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,010
It seems that this Ling Qiye

44
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,680
is indeed a qualified husband

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,600
and worth trusting.

46
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,760
Now,

47

I'm passing the last astounding recipe
of the Zhou family

to you.

49

I don't need to act against that Ling Qiye anymore?

54
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,720
Right.

55
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,430
I figured it out after getting sick.

56
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,180
As long as my sister is happy,

what more

58
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,600
could a brother want?

59
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,220
So, you can

60
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,260
give this secret pill to the Ling family.

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,300
Count it as...

a part of your dowry.

63
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,550
Being able to make you come around

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,510
is more difficult than
getting Chang'e to marry Zhu Bajie.

Of course it's effective.
