I'm nowhere near your level.

After all, you would even poison

the little sister you brought up.

I'm not thirsty.

89

What?

90
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,140
You'd even decline such a trivial request, Mr. Zhou?

91
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,800
Or

92

99

I have been impolite.

Please forgive me.

101
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,010
I still have something to do.

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,890
