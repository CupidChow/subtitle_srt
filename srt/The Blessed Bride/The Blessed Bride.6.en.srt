Young Master Ling,

the princess thinks

70

that I didn't deliver her gift,

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,890
and thus blames me?

72

If the princess blames me,

you will have to speak for me.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Actually, I prepared another gift.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,640
I made it myself.

76

I'd like to give it to you.

I really wanted to hit you,

I wouldn't have hit you like that.
