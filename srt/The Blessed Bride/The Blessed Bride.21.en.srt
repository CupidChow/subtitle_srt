Why did you steal the antidote for her?

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,050
I never expected that it would be you.

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,350
So what if I'd stolen it?

5
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,760
Although I like Ye,

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,510
she's someone who Ye likes too.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,930
Of course I would help her.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
I didn't know that though Your Highness
is usually arrogant,

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,760
you are pretty kind.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,220
It's none of your business!

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,890
I save whoever I want to save.

12
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,390
Unlike you,

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,100
a despicable man who only uses poison.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,850
You're already

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,050
not the honorable princess now.

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,180
You are my prisoner!

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,260
Let me ask you.

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,930
Did you feed her the antidote?

19
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,220
Of course I did.

20
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,600
You can't get it back now

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,850
even if you want!

22
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,800
(Did she really feed me the antidote?)

23
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,220
In that case,

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,680
Your Highness

25
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,050
shall take this poison on behalf of her.

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,970
Stop it!

27
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,430

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,890
Long time no see, my sister.

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,220
I almost forgot about you.

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,220
Come at me.

31
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,390
Release her.

32
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,390
You can't even save yourself.

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,970
How dare you ask me to release her?

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,050
Because I know

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,640
you're a person who likes to negotiate.

36
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,510
What do you want?

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,550
Feel free to tell me.

38
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,510
You're indeed my good sister.

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,800
You understand me right away.

40
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,850
I do need your help with one thing.

41
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,930
If you retrieve a treasure map for me
from Ling's Residence,

42
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,550
I'll let both of you go

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,850
and detoxify Her Highness.

44
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,050
Did I ask you to save me?

45
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,140
I don't need your help.

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,050
Forget it.

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,890
I shall show my sincerity first.

48
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,510
Today,

49
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,760
I'll let both of you go first.

50
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,260
Her Highness is dying.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,050
Whether to save her life or keep the treasure map,

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,390
you should know what to do.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,670
Let's go!

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,390
Your Highness.

55
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,390
Are you alright?

56

Her Highness stole the antidote for me,

so Zhou Han got angry

65
