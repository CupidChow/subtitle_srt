to heal my body?

Although I've managed

So

Haven't you run away already?

Young Lady, I was about to escape.

that I crawled across the dog door?

Probably not.

This is bad.

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,940
We can no longer stay here. We'd better run away now.

there's a designated person

You used this dog door last time.

Excuse me, I'll head back now.
