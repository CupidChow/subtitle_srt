I had a dream last night.

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,930
I dreamed that a respected saint

30
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,640
told me that the cash flow of the manor

31

isn't adequate enough.

32
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,640
He told me we shouldn't gamble.

33

I think

Maybe we should quit gambling for a while.

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,430
Really?

37
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,770
So our fun already ended before it even started.

38

Let's not talk about that for now.

39

Madam.

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,390
There is something that I don't understand.

41
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,470
I want to ask you about it.

42
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,680
I want to know

43
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,970
how you serve Young Master on the bed.

44
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,970
I have read many books lately.

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,770
For example,

46
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,180
I have read "99 Reasons
That His Royal Highness Can't Leave You".

47
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,720
But I haven't seen it practically.

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,140
I really can't understand.

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,430
Yue,

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,680
so you didn't serve Young Master on the bed either?

51
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,520
Did you also...?

52
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,520
The concubines here

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,100
all married into the manor
for interests of their own families.

54
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,020
Young Master

55
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,310
has never touched us.

56
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,270
That doesn't make sense.

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,850
With so many beauties around him,
why doesn't he…

58

No wonder

Mr. Lin always comes to our manor.

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,850
Does it mean that we are just covering for them?

63
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,850
No.

64
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,060
Don't you see

65
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,430
that Young Master is yet to decide
who will become his principal wife?

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,850
Young Master

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,100
only touches the person he likes.

68
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,600
And he'd only choose the person
that he loves as his principal wife.

69
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,350
Once he's made up

70
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,470
his mind,

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,850
we are bound

72
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,390
to be abandoned.

73
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,020
These reasons make me speechless.

74
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,890
I think

75
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,220
he must have a dysfunction.
