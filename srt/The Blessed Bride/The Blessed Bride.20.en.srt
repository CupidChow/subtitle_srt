2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,680
How come Your Highness has time
to come here?

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,850
What a rare guest!

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,510
We are both not good people.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,600
So drop the act.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,050
I'm here to ask you something.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,550
You said

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,970
that you can make Ye marry me.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,600
Do you mean it?

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,890
Of course.

11
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,970
I suppose Your Highness know

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,640
that even my sister lied to him,

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,510
but he still forgave her,

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
treated her illness,

15
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,600
and fed her medicine.

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,390
He takes care of her better than I do.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,850
Even I feel ashamed.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,930
If such a man

19
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,890
loves someone wholeheartedly,

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,220
I guess no woman can say no to him.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,260
But, with my help,

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,600
Your Highness will be able to make it happen

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,300
and get your man home.

24
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,890
For real?

25
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,720
I promise.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,390
In that case,

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,760
I shall

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,350
wait for your good news.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,050
Sir, what a good plan!

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,720
After Miss Liuying left,

31
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,300
Princess Luoxin came.

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,680
Did you plan all these?

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,100
Of course.

34
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,760
Don't ask me

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,640
such a silly question again.

36
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,760
Yes.

37
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,430
Why are you here?

38
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,390
I'm not here to pick on you.

39
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,010
Two days ago,

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,010
I bought an antidote at a high price from a place.

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm here to detoxify you.

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,050
Would you be that kind?

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,100
I'm just scared that Ye would be sad.

44
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,600
You're poisoned

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,760
and he needs to find you the antidote.

46
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,470
You only cause him trouble.

47
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,930
You...

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,300
I'm poisoned again.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,430
Young Master.

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,600
Qianmu.

51
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,970
Tomorrow, bring someone with you

52
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,300
to look into the formula of the poison
that got Madam Ying poisoned.

53
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,640
See if you can

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,140
get the formula of the antidote.

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,050
Young Master, what's your plan?

56
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,550
I'll get some herbs for her.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
I'll be back in a day.

58
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,850
How can you do such a thing yourself?

59
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,470
Since the incident in the manor...

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,390
Stop your nonsense!

61
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,800
Hurry up and leave.

62
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,220
Yes.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,850
Who are you?

64
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,640
Someone wants the Princess dead.

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,390
We can't control

66
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,050
our swords and you will be hurt.

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,350
Since you're here with us,

68
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,220
don't you think of getting out of here alive!

69
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,100
The rooster has crowed.

70
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,010
It's time to change shifts.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,220
Where are the people for the next shift?
Why are they not here yet?

72
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,260
Who cares about them?

73
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,140
Never work for a second more
if our boss doesn't pay us extra.

74
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,930
Yes!

75
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,350
-Time to get off work!
-Let's go!
