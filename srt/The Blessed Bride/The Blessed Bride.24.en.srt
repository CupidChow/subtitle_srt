Of course, you make a perfect couple.

Alright. You may get your reward at the treasury.

you will be rewarded.

I am here to take something.

Though this was your room,

But before you two get married,

So don't worry.

29

Don't worry.

37
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,550
I'll not tell the Prince that I'm his sister.

Why don't we go to the Prince's Residence
and reunite with them now?

59

Instead of reuniting with them,

Isn't the treasure map at Ling's Residence?

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,010
The treasure map was split into two parts.

66
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,180
One is at the Prince's Residence

67

Back then, that butler

69
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,260
was chased out because he peeked

70
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,930
on the treasure map at Prince's Residence.

71
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,640
It was not like what he claimed,

72
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,390
"The head of the Ling family snitched on him."

73

Isn't that great?

74
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,300
Now, we shall

75

go to Prince's Residence

76
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,680
and see what the treasure map looks like.

77

At the same time,

78
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,970
we can ask the Prince to do us justice

79

and stop the Princess from being so arrogant.
