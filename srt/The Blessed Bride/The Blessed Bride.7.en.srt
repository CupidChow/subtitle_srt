That's the clever part of her.

170
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,890
Madam Ying decided to sell all the medicines

171
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,140
in the form of lucky grab bags.

172
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,140
The key is "lucky".

173
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,470
Not only are there unsalable medicines in them,

174
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,020
but there are also expensive medicines
such as Lucid Ganoderma and antlers.

175
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,520
There was someone who happened
to get expensive medicines,

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,770
now everyone's trying
to get their hands on a lucky grab bag.

177
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,640
Even I

178
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,640
couldn't resist it.

179
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,770
Slices of a tiger penis?

180
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,970
This is the big deal.

181
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,140
(She actually managed to sell them in this way.)

182
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,640
(It's quite intelligent of her.)

183
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,220
She is kind of smart.

184
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,520
Put it back.

185
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,140
Madam Ying.

186
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,100
Alright.

187
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,640
Allow me to say a few words now.

188
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,600
First,

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,140
I spent no extra money
during the two days when the shop was closed

190
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,390
but raised the awareness
of the people in the city.

191
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,020
I turned those unsalable goods

192
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,520
into precious items craved by everyone

193
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,520
through lantern riddles and guessing games.

194
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,140
This is a fantastic method

195
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,520
that can only be thought of

196
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,140
by an intelligent person like me.

197
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,270
I'm born with a gorgeous appearance.

198
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,770
Many passers-by
didn't plan to buy medicines first,

199
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,720
but seeing a beautiful lady

200
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,140
like me standing there,

201
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,720
they would like to make a purchase too.

202
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,020
As it goes on,

203
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,640
the sales naturally went up.

204
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,220
As for the profit...

205
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,890
You made it.

206
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,470
According to our deal,

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,470
you can go to the accountant's office

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,890
to take five percent of the profit

209
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
as a reward.

210
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,640
Young Master, there's no need to be so formal.

211
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,890
It's all because of the guidance

212
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
you gave me,

213
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,640
and the antidote you offered,

214
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,770
or I would have been long gone.

215
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,890
If I were dead,

216
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,720
I wouldn't be able

217
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,270
to do all these for you.

218
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,470
Let's forget about the money.

219
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,270
Good then.

220
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,600
Are you really going to forget it?

221
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,100
What?

222
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,140
You got a problem?

223
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,600
That's not it. I wouldn't dare to.

224
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,970
But after all,

225
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,520
you've contributed a lot.

226
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,140
It's necessary for me

227
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,390
to give you some rewards.

228
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,350
I'll award you...

229
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,520
with the opportunity

230
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,390
to warm the bed for me tonight.

231
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,430
Young Lady.

232
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,600
Give it to me.
