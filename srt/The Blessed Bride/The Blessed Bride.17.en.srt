I've found out.

167
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,850
Just as you expected,

168
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,930
the first batch of pills delivered here was real.

169
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,180
They do have the effect
of harmonizing yin and yang.

170
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
This batch, which was delivered here recently,

171
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,640
was mixed with a huge amount of sedative herbs.

172
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,680
Mixing such herbs together

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,550
can lead to poor qi and bad blood circulation,

174
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,180
a quiet mind, and loss of sex drive.

175
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,300
It's hard to distinguish them
from their appearance

176
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,350
and the effect of the drug is slow,

177
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,720
so everyone

178
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,140
didn't care much at first.

179
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,640
Is this the batch of medicine
sent by the Zhou family?

180
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,180
Yes.

181
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,300
The incident is due to my misuse of people.

182
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,100
Every affected person

183
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,010
will be treated at Ling's Residence
till they recover.

184
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,180
I, Ling Qiye, will bear the mistake

185
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,970
made by Yue Liuying and the infirmary.

186
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,600
Yes, Young Master.

187
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Is Madam Ying not back yet?

188
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,850
Is Young Master still locking himself up

189
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,300
in the study room?

190
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,010
Young Lady.

191
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,010
The door is open.

192
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
You don't have to crawl
through the dog hole this time.

193
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,350
Please come back.

194
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,470
I guess they will never

195
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,050
open this door for me now.
