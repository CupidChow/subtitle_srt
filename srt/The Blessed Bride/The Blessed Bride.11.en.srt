Nothing.

I'm just a little tired from walking.

Do you know

15

who is the worst person in the world to fight with?

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,100
The wind.

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,730
Why?

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,690
Because when you fight with the wind,

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,100
you cannot hurt the wind,

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
but you would catch a cold.

21
