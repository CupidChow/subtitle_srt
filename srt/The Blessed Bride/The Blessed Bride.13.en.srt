using it a long time ago.

Now, I use it as a backscratcher.

He likes sweet food.

55
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,930
He likes spicy food now.

56
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,930
His favorite color is turquoise.

57
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,930
He said I look best in turquoise,

58
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,680
so he asked me to wear it often.

59

He went to the Imperial Academy with me,

To be honest with you,

Ye.

82

I came to see you as soon as I got back.

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,390
Did you come to see me

84
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,930
or cause trouble for my concubine?

85

Sorry.

You were too young before,

89
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,890
so I did not say much.

Your Highness.

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
I have always seen you as my younger sister.

92
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,430
I have no romantic feelings towards you at all.

93

that you would stop causing trouble
for Madam Ying.
