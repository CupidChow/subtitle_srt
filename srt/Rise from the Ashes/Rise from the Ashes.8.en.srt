1
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:13,184
=Rise From the Ashes=

2
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:16,928
=Episode 8=
(World of Affection)

3
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,267
(What does it mean by such yearning?)

4
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:26,347
(Unbreakable thread signifies my love.)

5
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:30,546
So cheesy and sickening.

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,747
(At the ends of the earth
I'm still hesitant.)

7
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:43,666
(Only wish to meet
the beloved at the perfect time.)

8
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:45,787
Look at these.

9
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,227
He might think I fall for him

10
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:48,227
and want to meet him.

11
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,267
If you don't meet,
it's just romance on paper.

12
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:53,267
Then when would we get the formula?

13
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,986
If you think it's good,

14
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,546
then sign for me

15
00:00:58,626 --> 00:00:59,506
and arrange a meeting.

16
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:15,986
Good day, Uncle.

17
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:18,947
What are you and Xinian doing?

18
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:20,146
What is it?

19
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,666
Ever since you returned home,
you only see Xinian.

20
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:24,947
Father said

21
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,787
that I wasn't respectful enough to you.

22
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:29,387
So I've come to offer some refreshments.

23
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,466
You're thoughtful.

24
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:35,347
You're looking for Uncle.

25
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:37,307
Why did you come to my place then?

26
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:40,307
I have matters to discuss with you too.

27
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:43,666
There have been misunderstandings
between us.

28
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,787
This letter was sent by Shaowen?

29
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:57,986
He may blame me for missing the date,

30
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,466
writing it to question me.

31
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,626
I just don't know how to reply.

32
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,907
You are acquainted with him.

33
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,227
How about

34
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:15,427
you write it for me?

35
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:40,626
Now she's paying more attention
to our whereabouts.

36
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,387
Aren't you afraid
that one day she'll say

37
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,747
that you and I have committed incest?

38
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,427
Why?

39
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:50,867
Are you afraid?

40
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:51,986
What I mean is,

41
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:54,026
for such an inessential person,

42
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,186
you don't need to argue about right
and wrong every time.

43
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,787
This will only bring unnecessary
hostility and trouble.

44
00:03:02,707 --> 00:03:03,387
No.

45
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,666
I do want to argue about
right and wrong.

46
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:07,586
I can't lose on even a small matter.

47
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:11,267
Why?

48
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:12,227
You regret it?

49
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,867
Aren't you afraid that more
of my shortcomings will be revealed?

50
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:16,787
It's fine.

51
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,506
You are worth

52
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:19,546
my risking it all.

53
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,106
You mean my brother has been
coveting my position?

54
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:35,947
Shaoye.

55
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:37,186
I wish to help you.

56
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,986
Haven't you always favored my brother?

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,134
(Shaowen's love letter)

58
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,466
He betrayed me and secretly met
with my sister first.

59
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,827
How could I possibly forgive him?

60
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:54,347
What do you want to do?

61
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,747
I heard that in three days,

62
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,947
the Lin family will go sign
a fireworks contract.

63
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:00,307
I'll have someone pretend
to assassinate you.

64
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,506
Since both you brothers are present,

65
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:05,466
then Lin Shaowen naturally becomes
the prime suspect.

66
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:25,666
It's you?

67
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:32,307
Now I have to invite you
in the name of Xinian.

68
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:34,267
Only then would you come out.

69
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:38,267
Shaowen.

70
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,427
I deceived Lin Shaoye to join forces,

71
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,787
but you are always the one
I want to help.

72
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,066
I'll bribe someone.

73
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,026
In three days, when you go to
the outskirts with Lin Shaoye,

74
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,947
someone will assassinate him.

75
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,387
If it's a success,
you can take his place.

76
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,186
Don't be impulsive.

77
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:54,907
The evil deeds done by Lin Shaoye

78
00:04:54,907 --> 00:04:56,787
are not few in number.

79
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,546
What I'll do has nothing to do with you.

80
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:00,626
If it fails, you just need
to clear your own name.

81
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:05,227
Lianxin.

82
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,707
Go find some ruffians.

83
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:10,986
No.

84
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:13,267
Go find people from Luoshi Pavilion.

85
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:15,747
Just say I have a deal to make
with them.

86
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:17,867
Miss Qingyue,

87
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,747
these people from Luoshi Pavilion
are extremely vicious and evil.

88
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:21,827
So timid.

89
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,307
Just do as I say.

90
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,986
Don't forget I still hold
your deed of sale.

91
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:27,986
Remember who's your master.

92
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,026
Now, go.

93
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:33,827
Yes.

94
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:43,947
Stop drinking.

95
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:45,267
A lady shouldn't drink so much.

96
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:47,907
I must enjoy life to the fullest.

97
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:49,907
You can't hold your liquor.

98
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,867
Being drunk, you're like a puppy.

99
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:07,546
If I ask you a question now,

100
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:09,347
like you just bit me,

101
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,106
is that taking advantage of you?

102
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,666
This is an exception only.

103
00:06:16,707 --> 00:06:17,747
What do you want to ask?

104
00:06:18,427 --> 00:06:19,186
The Cheng family?

105
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:20,747
The Lin family?

106
00:06:21,707 --> 00:06:24,227
Why I have allied with you?

107
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:25,666
Why I didn't expose you?

108
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,666
I want to ask

109
00:06:28,986 --> 00:06:30,066
about you and Lin Shaowen.

110
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,466
This

111
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,707
is not of your concern.

112
00:06:39,347 --> 00:06:40,546
You just need to know,

113
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:42,947
as long as you are an enemy
of Lin Shaowen,

114
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,026
and you want them dead,

115
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,506
then I won't betray you. That's all.

116
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:50,747
No.

117
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:51,867
That's not my question.

118
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:57,066
I want to know...

119
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,466
What are your actual thoughts
on Lin Shaowen?

120
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,066
If you fall for him,

121
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:01,986
you may at any time...

122
00:07:06,186 --> 00:07:07,986
You care about me.

123
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:10,626
But you pretend you don't.

124
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:12,747
Don't change the subject.

125
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,387
I'm worried about you.

126
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:17,347
Then what I care about is...

127
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:23,066
♪Wish to be with you♪

128
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,146
You.

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,264
♪I wash away the blood and tears,
rising from the ashes♪

130
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:37,536
♪Only to realize it's you
waiting behind me♪

131
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:41,824
♪In this life,
there is pain and intoxication♪

132
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,803
♪The vow remains unchanged♪

133
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,546
Just as I expected.

134
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,587
It was just to make him more enamored

135
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,306
and our alliance more stable.

136
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:27,627
(So he will not betray me.)

137
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,106
Nothing else.

138
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:34,346
Right?

139
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,346
To impersonate my uncle,

140
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:41,426
only I can help you.

141
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:42,667
By helping me,

142
00:08:43,507 --> 00:08:44,587
what is your purpose?

143
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:47,467
If an illegitimate daughter wants
to secure her footing,

144
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:49,056
(she needs the help of elders.)

145
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,816
(No matter your resentments,)

146
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,747
(you shouldn't risk yourself)

147
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,587
(to take revenge.)

148
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:56,986
Why?

149
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:58,467
Are you afraid?

150
00:08:58,587 --> 00:08:59,346
It's fine.

151
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:00,587
You are worth

152
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,827
my risking it all.

153
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,346
(It turns out)

154
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,707
(people who climbed out of underworld)

155
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,346
(can still have feelings.)

156
00:09:08,106 --> 00:09:10,186
(This heart clearly died once,)

157
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,867
(yet it still beats.)

158
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,346
(Even if it starts over,)

159
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:16,787
(Cheng Qingyue still fell
into the water,)

160
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:19,707
(and Uncle still became Su Jingyuan.)

161
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,146
(These things)

162
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:24,467
(still happened
at the predetermined time.)

163
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:28,106
(If I still can't control my life
and change the ending,)

164
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,667
(then from the beginning,)

165
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,106
(I shouldn't have...)

166
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:43,827
Sit.

167
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,547
Xinian worried about private meetings
with a man.

168
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:50,026
So she asked me to come over,
as an elder.

169
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:51,627
Hope you don't mind.

170
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,266
You've thought everything through.

171
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:55,986
Xinian.

172
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,066
These are all prepared for you.

173
00:09:58,507 --> 00:09:59,587
If you like anything,

174
00:09:59,587 --> 00:10:01,707
the list of betrothal gifts to follow
can be added to.

175
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:03,426
Last time you wanted to meet me,

176
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:04,986
my sister went there.

177
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:06,627
Now you

178
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,947
bring this to me.

179
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:10,947
You've misunderstood.

180
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,627
Qingyue is but a sister to me.

181
00:10:13,426 --> 00:10:14,346
Of my two nieces,

182
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:15,947
one is the legitimate,

183
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,467
the other has the crafts.

184
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:20,026
It's understandable
that you find it hard

185
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:21,146
to decide for now.

186
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,266
I have no such intention.

187
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,266
I am but a concubine's daughter.

188
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,507
My mother died early
and I had no one to rely on.

189
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:27,747
What I know

190
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,386
is settling the accounts

191
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,547
and doing mundane work with fireworks.

192
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,547
About your marriage,

193
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:34,947
you can't have all the advantages.

194
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:36,667
You should consider carefully

195
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,186
what exactly you want.

196
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:40,026
I just want to marry Xinian as my wife.

197
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:41,346
Xinian.

198
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,346
I will certainly marry you formally.

199
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:45,867
The Lin family's fireworks formula
is well known.

200
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,947
If you can show me the original formula,

201
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,026
I will surely give you

202
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:52,627
what you want.

203
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,066
If it is your wish,

204
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:55,426
I will certainly try my best.
