(Drifting with the Wind)

3
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:23,132
If you don't understand true justice
and decency,

4
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,973
then as your uncle, I will teach you.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:27,293
Justice?

6
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:28,413
Decency?

7
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,092
With both witness and evidence,
isn't that justice?

8
00:00:31,973 --> 00:00:32,733
Father showed mercy

9
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,692
just taking her back home
without publicizing it.

10
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:35,933
Isn't that decency?

11
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,373
Luoshi Pavilion makes explosives
for bandits,

12
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:40,373
refining saltpeter all night.

13
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:42,212
Saltpeter mud is hard to remove

14
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,012
and notice.

15
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:47,212
But if we look closely, who has
saltpeter on the soles

16
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:50,773
must be the one that went to
Luoshi Pavilion to hire killers.

17
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:57,773
Every shop that makes fireworks
has inferior saltpeter.

18
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,973
How can you judge
where it was picked up?

19
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:03,773
It's not like just now
when you relied solely on musk

20
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:06,132
and asked for the horse
and to seize her.

21
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,733
Whether the saltpeter

22
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:09,652
is used for the delightful fireworks

23
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:11,773
or for harmful explosives,

24
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:14,132
why not settle it in court?

25
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:18,373
Yuyang, why resort to such harsh words?

26
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,893
The brothers of the Lin family
are safe and sound.

27
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,293
This is just a minor matter.
Why involve the authorities?

28
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:28,373
Xianzong, I don't think
this is a minor matter.

29
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:30,933
As for you,

30
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:32,692
with such righteousness,

31
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:34,012
later in the court,

32
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,853
will you still testify for someone?

33
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,733
I wouldn't dare.

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,253
I was

35
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,973
forced by Miss Qingyue.

36
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,293
This is the whole story.

37
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:55,973
I have nothing more to hide.

38
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:06,973
This is your deed of sale.

39
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:08,572
You are free now.

40
00:02:14,012 --> 00:02:15,692
I do not know since when

41
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:17,652
you've become different.

42
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,532
But I am genuinely happy for you.

43
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:24,733
After the last act with me,

44
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:27,692
I hope you can be completely free.

45
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:32,773
Lianxin.

46
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:35,453
You came to me for help
with injuries all over.

47
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:37,893
After pointing out my sister,
you said I coerced you.

48
00:02:38,293 --> 00:02:39,813
Would you also want to accuse Father?

49
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,893
Qingyue, you were so sure just now.

50
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:44,853
And now you're in such a hurry
to distance yourself.

51
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,853
Totally different statements.

52
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,652
Miss Qingyue coerced me
with my deed of sale.

53
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,253
But I never thought of taking
someone's life.

54
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,492
Even if I am to be a maid forever,

55
00:02:56,853 --> 00:02:59,333
I would never dare to do such things
against my conscience.

56
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:01,172
You've come to my family since young.

57
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,492
We grew up together.

58
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,652
I've always given you what I have.

59
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,212
Why on earth would you frame me?

60
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:08,652
You betrayed the master.

61
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:09,453
Someone!

62
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,612
Take her out.

63
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:15,373
Even if she is deceitful,

64
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:18,052
Cheng Xinian is well-versed
in streetwise ways.

65
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,453
She has no good conducts.

66
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:21,893
Even if you didn't do this,

67
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,132
what about other misdeeds you've done?

68
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,052
Shaoye.

69
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,253
You always judged people
based on preference?

70
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,413
You invited elders from the Cheng family

71
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:31,612
just to listen to your

72
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,253
nonsense and hurtful words?

73
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,652
When Shaoye heard about killers,

74
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,373
he was worried,

75
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:40,853
so he spoke hastily.

76
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:43,092
I hope you won't blame him.

77
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:46,973
The two families intended to
form a marriage alliance.

78
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,572
I hope it won't harm the good relations.

79
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:51,453
I apologize on behalf of him.

80
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,132
Stop playing the good guy here.

81
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:55,612
It's not just you who should apologize.

82
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,532
Uncle.

83
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,773
I'm afraid that Xinian keeps
making mistakes.

84
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:05,012
If you don't apologize,

85
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,692
I don't mind an investigation

86
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,893
to see whether you really hired killers.

87
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:12,692
Apart from this,

88
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,973
the night before Xinian and I returned,

89
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:16,453
the estate caught fire.

90
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,692
It's quite suspicions.

91
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,813
Better to report it
to the officials too.

92
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:21,853
Since it all started because of you,

93
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,692
then let's go to the court now.

94
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,052
Cheng Yuyang.

95
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,933
I just wanted to protect my sister,

96
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,572
and ended up listening to the slanders.

97
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:39,692
I didn't see her true nature.

98
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:43,012
Well said about not seeing
her true nature.

99
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,132
From now on, I surely will keep
the servants in check.

100
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,492
And I hope you can forgive me.

101
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,333
This

102
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,893
is for my apology to you.

103
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:04,813
It's not just you who should apologize.

104
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:07,172
Xinian.

105
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:09,813
Xinian!

106
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:20,733
Xinian.

107
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,813
It started because of me.

108
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:27,612
Let me take the punishment.

109
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,092
I wonder if Mr. Yuyang is satisfied now.

110
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:35,893
Yuyang.

111
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,333
Xianzong.

112
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,052
Xinian kept facing injustice.

113
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:41,853
Even outsiders can scold her

114
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,012
all because she is weak and alone.

115
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,253
How can she fend for herself
in the future?

116
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:49,973
What do you think about this?

117
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:54,893
Today, I make a promise in front of
the Lin brothers.

118
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:56,893
When Xinian gets married,

119
00:05:57,612 --> 00:06:00,572
I will provide her with a dowry
befitting a legitimate second daughter.

120
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,652
She is good at making fireworks.

121
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:07,333
Why not exchange the surplus dowry
for a shop?

122
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:08,532
No need.

123
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,293
Just add it to the dowry.

124
00:06:17,893 --> 00:06:18,813
But today's incident

125
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:21,212
must be buried.

126
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:25,172
Qingyue.

127
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:30,172
Let's go.

128
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:33,973
See yourselves out.

129
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:48,172
Qingyue.

130
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,612
Didn't we agree

131
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,572
to have Xinian marry him
to pave the way for you?

132
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:53,612
Why did you make a scene today?

133
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:54,893
Father.

134
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:56,492
The original plan

135
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,933
was to have Lin Shaowen's heart
all set on me.

136
00:06:58,933 --> 00:06:59,973
That's how we can succeed.

137
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,813
But now he only thinks about
Cheng Xinian,

138
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:06,773
as if he has been bewitched.

139
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:08,733
If she marries him,

140
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,333
what should I do then?

141
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:13,692
I had not expected

142
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,253
that Cheng Xinian could actually
have such ability.

143
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:19,092
I've always listened to you.

144
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,132
But when it comes to Shaowen,
I can't control my feelings.

145
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:24,733
You have said that

146
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:26,492
he belongs to me,

147
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,092
and so does his heart.

148
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:32,413
And the imperial merchant's wife
can only be me.

149
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,692
But now he loves Cheng Xinian only.

150
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:37,492
Even Uncle defends her
in every possible way.

151
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:39,212
Cheng Yuyang.

152
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:41,813
Now he has to meddle in everything.

153
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:43,652
I might as well send him back
to the estate.

154
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,373
Uncle is not like a patient at all.

155
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,333
He always favors Cheng Xinian,

156
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,492
not as an elder at all.

157
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,572
It's a matter of romantic affection.

158
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:55,853
Romantic affection?

159
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:04,253
If they really committed incest,

160
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:07,373
wouldn't it tarnish our reputation?

161
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:11,453
Qingyue.

162
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,092
Now listen to me.

163
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:17,933
Now I finally understand

164
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:19,693
what a person who is in great fury

165
00:08:20,012 --> 00:08:21,452
and rolls her eyes

166
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,653
would look like.

167
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:24,893
I didn't expect

168
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,933
to be so happy to have someone
to back me up.

169
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:28,773
If you like it,

170
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:30,092
I'll back you up

171
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:31,372
for hundreds of times.

172
00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,813
Lin Shaoye was too arrogant and foolish.

173
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,292
I'll teach him a lesson for you someday.

174
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:39,533
That won't be necessary.

175
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:41,933
You said that such insignificant people

176
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:43,533
would bring unnecessary troubles.

177
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,613
Such good memory you have.

178
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:49,212
You didn't speak to me
the past few days.

179
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,252
Are you still angry?

180
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:52,653
Yes.

181
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,092
When I think of someone wants
to marry me off grandly,

182
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:57,132
I get even angrier.

183
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,172
I feel like smashing walls.

184
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,573
I want to strap explosives on someone

185
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,853
and blow him up.

186
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,212
If you blow me up,

187
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:05,853
who will back you up?

188
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:07,773
Talk back again,
and I'll sew your mouth.

189
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:09,292
Such a temper.

190
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,372
Who dares to marry you?

191
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,773
Even if I become a nun,
it's not your concern.

192
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:14,172
No way.

193
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:15,573
It's not up to you.

194
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:19,372
Then

195
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:21,653
how can I relieve your anger?

196
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:25,452
Give me your hand.

197
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:27,813
My hand?

198
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:41,372
Well then,

199
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:42,813
now we're even.

200
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,653
That's not enough.

201
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:49,052
You've been cooped up these days.

202
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,132
I'll take you out for fun in the wild.

203
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:52,132
Okay?

204
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:53,292
