(Burning Heart)

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,200
Cheng Yuyang's diaries have been buried
under the estate's grounds.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,441
All sorts of trivial matters.

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,488
Boss, what's the use of this?

6
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,760
Cheng Xianzong burned the diaries
on purpose. That's fishy.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
What Cheng Yuyang has written down
may contain hidden clues.

8
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:42,881
You had me look into that scar face
at the Cheng's Mansion.

9
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:46,656
He's a deceased person removed
from the household registration book.

10
00:00:46,656 --> 00:00:49,056
Cheng Xianzong sent those two
to test me.

11
00:00:49,056 --> 00:00:50,560
He even mentioned the Su family.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,824
It seemed he not only suspects
that I am not Cheng Yuyang,

13
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,584
but also my relationship
with the Su family.

14
00:00:55,584 --> 00:00:57,650
As for what the Lin family did,

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,328
if Mr. Cheng knew it
but didn't report it,

16
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:04,051
he fears about your grudges as the Sus'
descendant, and becomes cautious.

17
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,650
If he was involved,
then boss and lady boss...

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,331
What he did has nothing to do with her.

19
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,051
We've been aware of
your affection for lady boss.

20
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:19,090
Indeed, we are still waiting to drink
your wedding toast

21
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,290
after the investigation.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,090
Find the clues.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,290
When will we finish this?

24
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,170
This bracelet has an excellent gleam.

25
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,770
It's a rarely seen treasure
in recent years.

26
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,531
This was given by my father.

27
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,971
He really showed some genuine sincerity.

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,730
Father's care is what I most wanted
in my childhood.

29
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:14,570
But now, I have grown up.

30
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,011
If you're not happy,
you don't have to marry him.

31
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,531
If I don't marry him,
then whom should I marry?

32
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,051
Marry...

33
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,690
Think it over before you answer me.

34
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:38,090
Marry anyone you want.

35
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,331
You had it all figured out
from the start.

36
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,491
Isn't it the fastest way to use me?

37
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,971
The shortcut to destroy the Lin family.

38
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,730
Why wouldn't I marry?

39
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,811
You've thought it through? No regrets?

40
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,811
This is also your choice, isn't it?

41
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:09,770
You said compared to romance
or yourself,

42
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,491
there are more important things to do.

43
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,491
A woman wears flowers,
while a man wears a ring.

44
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:32,130
I thought I would wear
this complete floral jade all my life.

45
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:39,690
Don't you have anything to say to me?

46
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,051
Qi and Lian will protect you
secretly at the Lin family.

47
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:57,210
Consider the five shops as my gifts
for your dowry.

48
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:03,290
I will prepare the wedding dress
you like.

49
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:11,971
So you'll have status and a fallback
at the Lin family.

50
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,451
You are really a generous ally.

51
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,851
(Love, compared to the rest,)

52
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,371
(is too slight, isn't it?)

53
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:58,491
(Elegant and Harmonious)

54
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,331
Do you think this is alright?

55
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,290
Move it up to the right.

56
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,971
She's just a concubine's daughter.
How can it be so extravagantly?

57
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,971
The fireworks made by Xinian
are unparalleled.

58
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:11,491
She can help our family secure
the imperial merchant title.

59
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:16,640
(Head of the Lin Family)

60
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:21,632
(All Corners)

61
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,840
Can she really make this?

62
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:25,570
I've seen it with my eyes.

63
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,210
I will make her fall in love
with me completely

64
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,650
and become our mainstay.

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,491
But I have one more request.

66
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:37,290
Say it.

67
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,891
It's about the original formula.

68
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,610
Now, tell me in detail.

69
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:47,840
(Wedding)

70
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,931
(Cheng Qingyue, we have finally
come to this.)

71
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:16,411
Do you think that I wouldn't know
what you're up to?

72
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,891
What is this?

73
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,290
Since Lianxin left,

74
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,851
do you think there's any of your plans
that's not under my control?

75
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,210
Even if our goals are the same,

76
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,730
you must re-enact the drama of spouses

77
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:44,451
turning on each other for me.

78
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,971
It seems there is more than one
who can't hold back.

79
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:10,811
They are all but willing
to take the bait.

80
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,650
What's the matter? Feeling shy?

81
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,888
We are finally husband and wife.

82
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,130
We are finally husband and wife.

83
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:11,410
I sent Qi and Lian to get you back,

84
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,490
only to find that it wasn't you.
You really are here.

85
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:19,170
You played the villain to get me back
from the wedding.

86
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,090
How could I not come?

87
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,731
I just escaped first.

88
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:26,651
Every second you were late
was tormenting me.

89
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:28,851
