(Truth in the Plan)

3
00:00:28,052 --> 00:00:28,736
Xinian.

4
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:31,293
Xinian.

5
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:33,532
Are you okay?

6
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:34,373
Wake up.

7
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,773
I feel so terrible.

8
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:43,652
It seems our relationship

9
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,172
has been seen through by others.

10
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,732
Su Jingyuan.

11
00:01:00,612 --> 00:01:01,692
Shaowen.

12
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:04,773
Why are you here?

13
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:06,933
Father sent me to find Xinian.

14
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:08,652
Is she here?

15
00:01:09,092 --> 00:01:09,813
Well...

16
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,293
I'm not sure.

17
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,493
Su Jingyuan.

18
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:20,532
I like...

19
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,052
What did you say?

20
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:28,652
Because I like you too much.

21
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,692
So I dare not look.

22
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,973
I can only hide you in my heart.

23
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,652
Haven't you said before

24
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:40,493
that we were just uncle and niece,

25
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,172
that we were just allies,

26
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:43,652
merely using each other?

27
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:47,333
I don't want to be just allies with you.

28
00:01:48,532 --> 00:01:51,813
But I'm afraid of giving my heart
to the wrong person again.

29
00:01:56,692 --> 00:02:00,373
What I told you was not a dream at all.

30
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:05,973
It was the fate of my previous life.

31
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,933
Your kindness to me

32
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,212
may just be a simple gesture.

33
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:16,973
But for me,

34
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:22,933
it's a warmth I've never felt
in my life.

35
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,612
Xinian.

36
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:31,413
I really like you a lot.

37
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:32,572
But I don't dare.

38
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:35,813
I'm afraid in the end I'll lose you too.

39
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,013
If we don't start,

40
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:47,532
then there's no loss to fear.

41
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:49,732
Right?

42
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:55,373
Once started,

43
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:58,973
then there is no need to fear of loss.

44
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,293
You always make fireworks

45
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:02,893
for your family and others.

46
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,212
Someone should

47
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:05,893
set off fireworks for you.

48
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:07,893
They belong only to you.

49
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:10,052
She's been living on my estate for years

50
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,212
under my care.

51
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:13,293
If you take it as favoritism,

52
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,373
I will admit it. So what?

53
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:18,092
- Su Jingyuan. Don't leave me.
- Cheng Xinian.

54
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,172
Cheng Xinian.

55
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:23,692
Cheng Xinian.

56
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,373
See who I am.

57
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,013
Su Jingyuan.

58
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,212
(Even if this is a trap,)

59
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,493

I'll let you off this time.

66
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:24,692
Next time,

67
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,052
I will never let go off you.

68
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,172
Mr. Cheng sent you

69
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:40,532
for what matter?

70
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,212
This time,

71
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:45,973
I will be there

72
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:47,373
behind you.

73
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:52,132
Father said

74
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:55,013
recently Xinian has been learning
business from Uncle.

75
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:57,333
But they often meet alone outside.

76
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:59,132
I'm worried that Xinian...

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,532
No need to beat around the bush.

78
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:03,853
Xinian is usually straightforward
and bold.

79
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:05,652
But she is not out of virtue.

80
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:07,572
I can't doubt her because of you

81
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:08,493
every time.

82
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,092
You don't believe me?

83
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,413
When did you start to change

84
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:12,692
and favor Cheng Xinian?

85
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:14,333
You lost your mind.

86
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,252
Then let's see who is losing mind.

87
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:24,572
Uncle has lost his propriety
in his closeness to Xinian.

88
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,092
Now they are lying together.

89
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,853
Do you still want to defend them?

90
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:29,092
I am going to Father right now.

91
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,973
Let him see what she has done.

92
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:32,413
You can't go.

93
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,212
She has done such disgraceful things.

94
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:35,933
And you even want to protect her?

95
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,132
I said you can't go.

96
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:46,373
Have you made enough trouble?

97
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:57,413
You're awake.

98
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,853
It really is you who arranged
the meeting.

99
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,252
Father sent me to find my sister.

100
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,172
Uncle, you've done
such a disgraceful thing

101
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,732
and even slandered me.

102
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,132
This is the note I received.

103
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,373
Although it imitated Uncle's
handwriting,

104
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,773
the imitator didn't know...

105
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,252
My handwriting starts from top left

106
00:06:20,652 --> 00:06:22,333
and ends at bottom right.

107
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:24,732
I care about the layout.
It can be checked.

108
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,252
This is the note I received.

109
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,293
It imitated Xinian's handwriting.

110
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,453
But

111
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,572
the writer's wrist strength is weak
and unsteady.

112
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:33,732
Not like me.

113
00:06:34,013 --> 00:06:35,893
I have lived on the estate for years.

114
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,413
When I write, the strokes are heavier.

115
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,532
If we were meeting in secret,
why would we write notes

116
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,013
and give others leverage?

117
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,692
I was sent by my father to find her.

118
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,692
Even if someone wanted to frame you.

119
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,373
You and Uncle share a bed.

120
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:54,813
Could this possibly be false?

121
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,092
The meeting was a trap.

122
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:58,212
Wasn't sleeping on the same bed
also a trap?

123
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,493
We were drugged by someone.

124
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,532
If a doctor comes,

125
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:03,052
he will find remnants on us.

126
00:07:03,293 --> 00:07:04,612
Our clothes are neat.

127
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,532
Nothing happened at all.

128
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:08,453
You...

129
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,813
Mr. Shaowen.

130
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,092
Still have doubts?

131
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,532
Not anymore.

132
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:26,373
Don't be too smug.

133
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:30,373
Qingyue.

134
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,813
You couldn't hire killers properly.

135
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,692
You couldn't drug us properly.

136
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:38,612
You even failed at your adeptness
in framing us.

137
00:07:39,413 --> 00:07:41,132
You truly are

138
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,853
a good-for-nothing now.

139
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,132
No wonder

140
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,532
Mr. Shaowen would be

141
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:47,973
greatly disappointed with you.

142
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:52,572
Then let's wait and see.

143
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,893
What I want,

00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:56,572
