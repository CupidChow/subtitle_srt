(True Feelings in Feigned Play)

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,170
Are you still angry about
your father's bias?

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,610
Mind your own business.

5
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:29,291
Then, do you want to eat?

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,530
I'll buy some pastries and fruits.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,610
No.

8
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,771
Go to Luoshi Pavilion?

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,731
No.

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,811
Then I take you to go shopping?

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,971
To watch some acrobatics?

12
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,371
To go on an outing?

13
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:43,971
To see flowers?

14
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:46,570
No. No. No.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,090
Then let's make new fireworks?

16
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,336
Okay.

17
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,451
Today,

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,931
you've come alone.

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:16,530
I'm afraid the elders of your family
are not pleased

20
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,731
with the marriage.

21
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,971
The elders of my family

22
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:23,170
all like Xinian very much.

23
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:24,851
For the engagement,

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,971
to show intimacy,

25
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,891
I have come in person.

26
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,451
The gifts are different

27
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,731
from what you promised.

28
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,010
If your promise is unreliable,

29
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:35,610
how can our family agree
to this marriage?

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,771
Mr. Yuyang.

31
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,251
This is not the formal proposal.

32
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:39,931
Moreover,

33
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,371
our original formula is not
to be divulged.

34
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:43,331
It seems that

35
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,570
Xinian doesn't want it,

36
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,371
but you are obsessed with the formula.

37
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,210
You have promised it.

38
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,291
Now you can't offer it,
so you quibble over who wants it.

39
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,891
Yuyang.

40
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:57,210
You want the firework formula
of the Lin family?

41
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,451
The new fireworks of our family
are all made by Xinian.

42
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:04,771
Xianzong, don't you know

43
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,010
that if Xinian leaves,

44
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,050
we will lose a great asset?

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,811
If you show sincerity and reciprocates
with the formula,

46
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,331
is there any problem?

47
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,451
That's not the case.

48
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,170
When our families become one,

49
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,010
the fireworks business can last longer.

50
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,971
Your scheming sure is loud and clear.

51
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,210
You promised my niece.

52
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,610
But now you want to gain without giving.

53
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:25,130
Shaowen, do you sincerely wish
to marry me?

54
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,570
Of course.

55
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:31,291
Father.

56
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,771
I just wanted to test Shaowen.

57
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,291
That's why I asked Uncle
to propose conditions.

58
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,090
Now that he's full of sincerity,

59
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:39,771
naturally I'll consent.

60
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,650
Xinian.

61
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,090
Uncle.

62
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,130
It's a misunderstanding.

63
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,411
Shaowen.

64
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,610
Xinian is a concubine's daughter.

65
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,291
She'll marry into
the imperial merchant family.

66
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,891
If there is no support from an elder,

67
00:03:00,891 --> 00:03:02,570
I worry she would be aggrieved.

68
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,610
So I carefully considered
the betrothal gifts.

69
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,690
I hope you will not take offense.

70
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,170
You always say I am biased against you.

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,490
But what parents do not wish the best
for their children?

72
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,731
If you truly want it,

73
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:21,130
I will definitely support you.

74
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,851
But no matter what happens,

75
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,650
you must remember,

76
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,331
the Cheng family

77
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:29,251
will always be your home

78
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:31,811
and your backing.

79
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,331
How can you easily agree
to this marriage?

80
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:49,931
I won't allow it.

81
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,411
Who are you to ask me?

82
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:55,371
My uncle?

83
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:56,610
Accomplice?

84
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,170
Ally?

85
00:03:58,731 --> 00:03:59,610
Or what?

86
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:01,291
You've said that

87
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:03,371
we're not just allies.

88
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,411
Not allies?

89
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,570
Then what are we?

90
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,490
I was determined long ago.

91
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:20,690
Even if I truly marry him,

92
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,811
I might not get the real formula.

93
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:25,331
But if I don't marry him,

94
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,891
when can we get what we desire?

95
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,210
What you want

96
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,490
is just a pretext to enter
the Lin family,

97
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,971
a pawn to help you succeed.

98
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,931
The success is within sight.

99
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,411
Why do you, the player,
have second thoughts?

100
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,570
You don't need to force yourself now.

101
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,690
- I'll...
- You have plotted for years,

102
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:45,650
with so many subordinates.

103
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,851
If you could get it,

104
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,251
would you need to disguise as my uncle?

105
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,451
Lin Shaowen is not a good man.

106
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,210
If you have to live with him,

107
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,731
I am afraid you will get hurt.

108
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,811
I have said

109
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:07,530
I was willing to exchange.

110
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,090
You clear the name of the Su family.

111
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,530
I take revenge on the Lin family.

112
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,530
What's not good about it?

113
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,672
We shelter under the same roof.

114
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,130
No need to take the lightning strikes.

115
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,891
It's never been for you.

116
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,210
Don't think too highly of yourself.

117
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,251
Hopefully one day,

118
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,010
I can wash away all the filth

119
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:45,291
and set out pure and clean.

120
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,771
(Our original formula is not
to be divulged.)

121
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,891
(Yuyang.)

122
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,891
(You want the firework formula
of the Lin family?)

123
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:08,851
Father.

124
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:11,931
Why were Cheng Xinian and Shaowen
engaged today?

125
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,050
You agreed with me...

126
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,170
Shut up!

127
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,331
Father.

128
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,130
What's the matter?

129
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,891
I have verified Cheng Yuyang's
identity twice.

130
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:27,971
There were no problems.

131
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,690
But today

132
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,090
why did he take an interest
in the Lin family's formula?

133
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,331
You are suspicious of Uncle?

134
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,331
Uncle was sick for a long time
and did not leave the estate.

135
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,331
But after they came back,
he's been very close with Xinian.

136
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,490
And her behavior is not like
the country girl as before.

137
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,010
Instead, she's always showing off.

138
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,851
Back then I spared her

139
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:54,010
because I thought her hereditary skills

140
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,251
could someday be of great use.

141
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:57,331
And there's this Cheng Yuyang.

142
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:00,530
After he went to the estate,
I never thought he could come back.

143
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,050
Keeping them

144
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,371
has instead become a trouble.

145
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,971
For both of them,

146
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,090
I cannot be soft-hearted anymore.

147
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,690
Boss.

148
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,050
As for the incense burner,

149
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,451
luckily you replaced it in advance.

150
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,530
Something's off.

151
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,411
It's harmless to common people.

152
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:25,731
For someone poisoned,

153
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,090
it will be more poisonous.

154
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,731
Smelling it frequently has a
remarkable effect on coughing.

155
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:32,931
After Old Mr. Cheng died,

156
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,931
Cheng Yuyang was sent away
due to his illness.

157
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,451
To avoid infecting others,
he lived in isolation.

158
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,090
But we checked Doctor Huang's
former apprentice.

159
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,731
And the oddness of Cheng Yuyang's body

160
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:43,851
clearly showed that he was poisoned.

161
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,251
He died from poisonous food
over the years.

162
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,570
If he was murdered,

163
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,610
our investigation

164
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,090
will be noticed, no matter how cautious.

165
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:54,690
Withdraw our people.

166
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,411
Be more vigilant.

167
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,530
- Yes.
- Yes.

168
00:07:58,931 --> 00:07:59,530
Poisoned.

169
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:26,912
You hand.

170
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,450
What if I want to harm you?

171
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,450
How could a single sting harm me?

172
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,971
At the worst to vent the anger I caused
during the day.

173
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,330
Boring.

174
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,330
Cheng Yuyang was poisoned.

175
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,611
I said he had been poisoned.

176
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,851
I got it.

177
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,531
My uncle had been poisoned.

178
00:09:03,531 --> 00:09:04,771
You fear that I was poisoned.

179
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:07,691
That's why you rushed to see me, right?

180
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,891
Although my uncle and I lived
in the same estate,

181
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,210
everything we ate and used was separate.

182
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,010
My uncle was seriously ill.

183
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,651
What the main house sent were tonics.

184
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,250
No one was suspicious.

185
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,771
Whether it's illness or poison,

186
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:27,931
I have neither.

187
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:28,891
Whatever.

188
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,410
I'm just afraid you'll die before
you marry into the Lin's.

189
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,571
All will be in vain.

190
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,250
Why?

191
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:37,691
You should worry
that I'd become a widow.

192
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,330
Turns out your mouth is poisonous.

193
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,651
Let me help you detoxify it.

194
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,891
- Detoxify.
- You're the poisonous one.

195
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,250
Since

196
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:58,130
my uncle had been poisoned,

197
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,571
then the corpse can no longer be kept.

198
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:02,450
Rest assured.

199
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:03,691
I'll handle it.

200
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:06,891
(Thus far in this life,)

201
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,410
(even if everything)

202
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,771
(is unpredictable and
all comes to naught in the end,)

203
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,531
(I still want it)

204
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,290
(to go right.)
