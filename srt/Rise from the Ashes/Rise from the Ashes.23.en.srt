=Episode 23=
(The Next Life)

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,170
Actually, I lied last time.

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,891
Because I couldn't face you,

5
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:30,931
I told a lie that was easier to say.

6
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:37,891
This jasper means lifetime commitment.
I can't bear to return it to you.

7
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,891
How could I not understand
your feelings?

8
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:00,650
It's so dangerous by my side.

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,491
Yet I still want to keep you by my side.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,011
Now, I've thought it through.

11
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,570
No matter whose daughter you are,

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,371
I want to grow old with you.

13
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,250
Xinian. Xinian.

14
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,610
You've been poisoned.

15
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:36,690
Xinian.

16
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,051
I only know that if it were me dying,

17
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,331
you would do the same for me.

18
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,032
If it's predestined somehow,

19
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,520
before the ending and
when we are still alive,

20
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,851
I'm not running away.
I must come looking for you.

21
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,371
I have lived twice.

22
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:11,770
Hatred and unwillingness
drove me forward.

23
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,811
You concern and warmth made me stop.

24
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,411
With this love,

25
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:33,811
I am so happy.
My life has not been in vain.

26
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:36,931
Xinian.

27
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,570
So saying goodbye during the day

28
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:54,170
is so warm under the sun.

29
00:02:57,851 --> 00:03:01,811
It doesn't feel as sad as I thought.

30
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:09,650
If there's another life after this,

31
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,931
don't make me wait too long, okay?

32
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,011
Okay.

33
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:25,770
I really want to wander the world
with you.

34
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,331
Xinian. Xinian.

35
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,971
Xinian.

36
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,371
Can you wake up?

37
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:06,880
Xinian.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,331
The doctor said the poison
has been removed from her body.

39
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,610
Then why hasn't she woken up yet?

40
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,491
Maybe she doesn't want to.

41
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,011
If we can awaken her will to live,
there's still a glimmer of hope.

42
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,331
Who are you? Who are you?

43
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,491
Who are you? Don't go.

44
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,650
Xinian, your parents originally worked
for Cheng Xianzong.

45
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,210
They were talented in fireworks art.

46
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,531
When disaster befell my family,

47
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,971
they witnessed Cheng Xianzong's
evil deeds and were brutally murdered.

48
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,451
At that time, you were still a child
with no memories.

49
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,451
Cheng Xianzong kept you
by his side for his own benefit.

50
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:11,690
Unexpectedly...

51
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,170
Father, don't leave me alone
in the estate. I'm begging you.

52
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,851
Let go! You were always a jinx.

53
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,451
How dare you talk back to me?

54
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:24,170
Letting you live was giving you face.

55
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:31,392
Father, am I not your child?

56
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:35,570
Am I not your child?

57
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,851
You are not a child who was abandoned
even by your birth parents.

58
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,210
And you won't be without me.

59
00:05:48,411 --> 00:05:51,011
I will always stay by your side.

60
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,931
Xinian.

61
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,610
Help me!

62
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:14,090
(Cheng Xinian, you'll never meet
a good end in any of your lifetimes.)

63
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,770
Why?

64
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,491
I have another niece.

65
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:41,568
I hear she married you,
but you killed her. Is that true?

66
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:42,971
It wasn't me.

67
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:58,451
After all, on that estate,
both of us were living a hard life.

68
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,416
If you are aware down there,

69
00:07:02,176 --> 00:07:04,811
your uncle has avenged you.

70
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:11,971
In your next life, don't suffer again,
and be born into a good family.

71
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:14,971
(Your father and mother)

72
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,851
(- are upright and kind-hearted.)
- Father, Mother.

73
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,610
(You would've been a child
who is loved.)

74
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,531
(You should have been treated equally.)

75
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,051
(A good girl deserving of love.)

76
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:33,451
(You and I were meant
to walk this path together.)

77
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:35,891
Go back. Return to his side.

78
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,210
(We'll walk the road ahead together.)

79
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,690
Go back.

80
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,770
(I will never leave you alone again.)

81
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,531
Go back, child. Live well.

82
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,704
I will live well.

83
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:11,491
I will live well. Father, Mother.

84
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,090
(I originally thought my life would be
tiring and short.)

85
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,851
(I never expected that in this life,)

86
00:08:26,971 --> 00:08:30,410
(it would be so beautiful and so long.)

87
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,611
Su Jingyuan.

88
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,811
It really was you.

89
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:05,792
It turns out that the lifesaving
gratitude I held was misdirected,

90
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:12,651
and the person who saved me and
cherished me in past and present lives

91
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,250
has always been you.

92
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,651
When I was gathering information,

93
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:22,571
I heard someone crying for help
and couldn't bear it.

94
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,410
Only on the day we met at the estate
that I realized it was you.

95
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,851
But you did not remember it at all.

96
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,450
You attributed my kindness
to someone else.

97
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,651
How could I have willingly given up
my whole life for misdirected gratitude?

98
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:49,450
It's not too late to realize now.

99
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:57,851
No, it's not.
I've always had too little.

100
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:00,130
I'm so afraid of losing even you.

101
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,931
Your kindness told me
not to drown in regret and resentment.

102
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,891
It awakened me and kept me alive.

103
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:20,731
Perhaps it's heaven's mercy
that allows us to accompany each other.

104
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,330
Neither of us did anything wrong.

105
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,051
We don't have to endure
unwarranted suffering.

106
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,370
If all the heartbreaking agony

107
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,931
can ultimately bring you to me,

108
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,490
then everything is worth it.
