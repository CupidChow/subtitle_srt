(Common People)

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,660
With the fireworks and the jasper
as witness, I must not fail you.

4
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,581
One person and a pendant.
Till death do us part.

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,141
My lady.

6
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:56,660
Shaowen.

7
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,860
(You disdained me in the previous life.)

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,400
(Now you are no longer worthy
to have me.)

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,340
My lady.

10
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,912
Xinian? Where is Qingyue?

11
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,856
She was burned by the fireworks and
thus couldn't come.

12
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:23,581
Shaowen, I...

13
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,501
Qingyue has always been good at
making fireworks.

14
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,380
How could she get burned? Was it you?

15
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:33,740
So this is the way you think of me.

16
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,740
You have indeed changed your heart

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,664
and fallen for Xinian, right?

18
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,941
Qingyue, I...

19
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,901
We have always shared
a sibling-like bond.

20
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,220
If I have ever crossed the boundary,

21
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,700
I apologize for it.

22
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,660
So I am the one overstepping bounds?

23
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,340
Qingyue.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,720
The new fireworks just now
were exceptionally brilliant.

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,061
I know you appreciate Xinian's talent.

26
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,901
But think it over. I'm the legitimate
and eldest daughter in my family,

27
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,621
and the one my father values most.

28
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:29,700
Everything in my family will be mine.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,220
Does it still matter who made
the fireworks?

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,860
If you're with me, you can ensure
the title of imperial merchant.

31
00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:41,820
And you would be greatest contributor
of your family.

32
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:50,541
Qingyue, the greatest contributor
is my elder brother.

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,300
As long as he lives,
it will always be him.

34
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:59,141
As for me... Forget it.

35
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:04,101
I understand.
If you have any hesitation...

36
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,941
This is my true heart.

37
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,740
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:25,740
Fine, I know what to do now.

39
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,621
Master Cheng's fireworks trial
was a great success.

40
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,581
With the noble's endorsement,
it ought to be celebrated.

41
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,340
Why are you so dispirited and sad?

42
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:57,660
Witnessing his glowing fireworks
and charms,

43
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,260
why should I be sad?

44
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:04,981
The sadness in your voice
can't deceive anyone.

45
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,260
Being sad always has a reason.

46
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,541
The Flower Festival has always been
the day to pledge love.

47
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,501
You loved him.

48
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:20,501
You've also longed to confess your love
here and now.

49
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,141
It's alright. I'm here.

50
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,300
(You saved me from the fire
when I was alone and desperate.)

51
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,461
From that moment, I wanted to spend
my life repaying you.

52
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:42,780
Xinian, I didn't save you
for you to repay.

53
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,501
I had no idea you were
so grateful to me.

54
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,992
But it can only be Qingyue.

55
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,901
Because only she can change my status
in my family.

56
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,061
Shaowen, the one who truly knows
how to create fireworks is me.

57
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:01,260
I can give everything for you

58
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,660
to preserve your
imperial merchant status,

59
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,941
and make you the greatest contributor
of your family.

60
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:11,421
Xinian, the greatest contributor
of my family is my elder brother.

61
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,461
As for me...

62
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,941
- Forget it.
- No.

63
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:21,581
Whatever you want, I will
spare no effort to get it for you.

64
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:27,501
Even if all that's left in your heart
now is sorrow and hatred,

65
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:31,296
you will remember
and be reluctant to let go

66
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:33,380
of the true heart you once gave to him.

67
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,981
This play is really well written.

68
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,021
You know I don't want to bring it up.

69
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:53,260
You also know the turmoil in my heart.

70
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,581
Why pine for the true heart
that was mistakenly given?

71
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,421
The mistake was never
with your true heart,

72
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,501
but with the person who trampled on it.

73
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,780
How can you cry after setting off
such beautiful fireworks?

74
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,981
The trial launch was successful.
I have a gift for you.

75
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,220
Come on. I'll show you.

76
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,340
I've repeatedly made concessions
for you.

77
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:00,021
Is this how you repay me?

78
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,981
