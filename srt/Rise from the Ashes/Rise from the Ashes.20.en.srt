=Rise From the Ashes=

2
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:16,704
=Episode 20=
(Fate's Follies)

3
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:24,576
I knew right from the start
you were never Cheng Yuyang.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,441
What exactly is your relationship
with the Su family?

5
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,921
Who are you to ask questions here?

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,441
Facing death,
yet you don't know what to say.

7
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:35,800
Just go ahead and kill me.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,001
Do you really want to know?

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,160
Then go ask the Su family yourself
in the underworld.

10
00:00:43,481 --> 00:00:46,200
I won't let you die so easily.

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
I will turn you into a human swine,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,120
keep you alive,
and make your life worse than death.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,240
I'll speak. The Lin family didn't have
the guts to commit genocide.

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,961
Cheng Xianzong found
the Luoshi Pavilion.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,264
The Cheng and Lin families
were in decline.

16
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:12,001
Their only chance was to collude
to steal the Su family's formula.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,120
The two families have
so much leverage over each other

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,521
That's why they had a marriage alliance
despite the disparity in their statuses.

19
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:28,401
Boss.

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,041
(The mastermind behind the extermination
of the Su family was Cheng Xianzong.)

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,240
Remember, the Cheng family
will always be your home.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,361
Father's affection was what I wanted
the most in my childhood.

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,680
You actually still care a lot
about your father.

24
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:04,001
Maybe I always hoped he would treat me
just like he did with Cheng Qingyue.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,600
Even if just once.

26
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:16,120
The bracelet he gave me on the day
I agreed to the marriage,

27
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,001
I've never had the heart to wear it.

28
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,401
(The Cheng and Lin families
were in decline.)

29
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,961
(Their only chance was to collude
to steal the Su family's formula.)

30
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,152
(He finally got what he always wanted.)

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,921
(It should be returned to
its original owner.)

32
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:38,881
(The Su family's formula.)

33
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,720
It's been so long. Why hasn't he come?

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,264
Qi, Lian.

35
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:51,732
Where is your boss?

36
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,881
What happened?

37
00:03:00,841 --> 00:03:04,160
Where is he? Can you take me to him?

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,320
Lady boss.

39
00:03:10,561 --> 00:03:12,881
Miss Cheng, our boss...

40
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,521
He won't be coming anymore.

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,680
We finally got what we wanted.

42
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,521
Why didn't you come?

43
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:46,921
Ever since I've known you, you've always
had a response for everything.

44
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,760
You're not an impulsive person.

45
00:03:50,881 --> 00:03:54,240
Something serious must have happened
for you to not respond like this.

46
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,961
I'm not someone
who can't shoulder responsibility.

47
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,240
If it's a matter of your life,

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,441
I would rather you not leave me
out in the cold

49
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,120
and take it all on alone.

50
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:21,280
We've been in the same boat
facing fate together.

51
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,521
Let's just end this here.
It's better for both you and me.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,481
I don't believe it.
You said we could travel everywhere.

53
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,720
What about the future you promised me?

54
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,081
This time,
I did not love the wrong person.

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,921
You must be too heartbroken.

56
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,561
So you want to hide away
by yourself, right?

57
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,640
If you think silence is for my own good

58
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:08,320
and can keep me out of danger,

59
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:13,841
then you're underestimating yourself
and me even more.

60
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,001
Are you so confident
that I am doing this for you?

61
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:36,481
The alliance has ended.
It's time to wake up from the dream.

62
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:46,001
Su Jingyuan. Su Jingyuan.

63
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,961
Su Jingyuan?

64
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,280
You heard her call him Su Jingyuan?

65
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:09,001
Father, who is Su Jingyuan?
Do you know him?

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,921
Qingyue, are you sure there was
no one else besides you?

67
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,640
Father, who exactly is Su Jingyuan?

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,120
No wonder the men I sent out
didn't come back.

69
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:31,640
If he lives, then the Cheng family
might be wiped out.

70
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,561
But rest assured.

71
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:38,720
I will definitely eradicate the problem
to prevent future troubles.

72
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:47,081
Are you going to find your uncle again?

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,361
If nothing, then stay away.

74
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,041
I am the rightful heir,
the center of all hopes.

75
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,120
Yet after you came back,
all the care was only for you.

76
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,881
He is nothing but a fake.

77
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,561
I'm not surprised by his judgment.

78
00:07:04,961 --> 00:07:08,081
Looking down on you makes him a fake?

79
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,120
You think too highly of yourself.

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,041
Stay stubborn as you wish.
Father will definitely take action.

81
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:19,481
I'll let you to taste what it's like
to lose the person you love.

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,600
They were blood-related brothers.

83
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,680
How could they break their bond
over your baseless suspicions?

84
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,200
Although Father is stern, he would not
act rashly out of emotion. Ridiculous!

85
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,640
Then we'll see who becomes
the laughingstock.

86
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,441
There's no uncle. He is Su Jingyuan.

87
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,680
My goodness. I didn't expect to see
that expression on your face.

88
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't know since when,

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,320
you've become inscrutable and
nauseating.

90
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:02,640
Seeing you with a defeated look
makes it worthwhile.

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,441
He is not Su Jingyuan. He is my uncle.

92
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,521
Su Jingyuan has already been
killed by him.

93
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,200
I called out Su Jingyuan

94
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,521
because it was a murder case
involving my uncle.

95
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:15,680
Your mindless actions will only
harm our family.

96
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,721
I should have gotten rid of you
from the start.

97
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,200
If you dare to kill me,
Father will never let you off.

98
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,961
You will become a murderer,
and you won't die easily.

99
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Xinian, I am your elder sister.

100
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,440
I won't talk about Uncle anymore.

101
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:39,921
Xinian, I just want our family
to prosper.

102
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:43,961
It's for our family and our own good,
Cheng Xinian.
