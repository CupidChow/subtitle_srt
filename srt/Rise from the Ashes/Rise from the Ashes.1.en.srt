=Rise From the Ashes=

00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:16,846
=Episode 1=
(Reborn from Flames)

3
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,812
(Lin's Mansion)

4
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:35,424
(Second daughter of the Cheng family,
Cheng Xinian)

5
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,944
(Second son of the Lin family,
Lin Shaowen)

6
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:40,747
How beautiful the fireworks are.

7
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:42,666
It's a pity that the one who made them

8
00:00:43,227 --> 00:00:44,626
will no longer be able to see them.

9
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:47,747
Lin Shaowen.

10
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:49,747
You divorced me to marry another woman.

11
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:51,466
You won't die easily.

12
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:52,586
Cheng Xinian.

13
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,546
You still spout nonsense
even on the brink of death.

14
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:57,827
Aren't you clear about what you've done?

15
00:00:57,827 --> 00:00:58,787
Over these years,

16
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,907
I eliminated your elder brother,

17
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,586
and seized Lin family's power for you.

18
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,546
I made fireworks for you

19
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:07,787
to keep the imperial merchant status.

20
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:09,066
I gave up my own business

21
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:11,867
to have a child with you.

22
00:01:12,227 --> 00:01:13,666
Yet you made me

23
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:16,707
lose my own child.

24
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,026
Lin Shaowen.

25
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,106
You won't die easily.

26
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:25,586
Well, let's see who dies first.

27
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:31,307
Cheng Xinian.

28
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,066
You've researched so many
fireworks formulas.

29
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:35,747
But you prefer death over sharing them.

30
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:37,307
Now, my business has succeeded.

31
00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:39,106
I'll marry the legitimate daughter.

32
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,227
How can I be threatened?

33
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:44,347
Lin Shaowen.

34
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:48,787
To die a thousand times would be
too easy for you.

35
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:51,707
In this life,

36
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:57,626
you will never get what you want.

37
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:01,707
Fine then.

38
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:04,387
Wait until you're burnt into ashes,

39
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,146
and take your fireworks formulas

40
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:07,666
to Death.

41
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,227
Why?

42
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,546
Why?

43
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:38,427
(You entrusted your love and profit,)

44
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,307
(and made every step strategic,)

45
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,106
(yet you loved the wrong man)

46
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:43,466
(and died by misfortune.)

47
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,787
(Great fire will burn away
the mistaken thoughts.)

48
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,506
(If you could do it all over,)

49
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,747
(would you make changes)

50
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:52,066
(to your fate of eternal doom?)

51
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:54,907
(If given another chance,)

52
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,827
(I wish to have no regrets or hatred)

53
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,787
(and can tell good from evil.)

54
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,747
(Wish all gratitude or grudges settled.)

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
(Three years ago)

56
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:46,240
(Cheng family's old estate)

57
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,347
(Xinian,)

58
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:53,546
(stay happy.)

59
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:55,586
(Wish you good fortune.)

60
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,707
(I am currently at the estate,)

61
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:01,387
(yet to return to the main house.)

62
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,186
(There's still time for everything.)

63
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:05,666
(But I have no one to rely on at home.)

64
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,506
(Only uncle)

65
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,827
(still remembers me.)

66
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,867
Let's see who dies first.

67
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,907
(The Cheng Xinian of the past
is already dead.)

68
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:30,947
(Starting anew in this life,)

69
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:32,907
(not coveting the flourishing world,)

70
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:36,106
(all I want is for those who hurt me)

71
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:38,227
(to pay a price.)

72
00:04:42,986 --> 00:04:43,787
Uncle.

73
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,146
I am Xinian.

74
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,747
I need to talk to you.

75
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:47,584
You...

76
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:52,586
Are you okay?

77
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,066
- What's up?
- Help.

78
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:54,947
Help me.

79
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:10,986
Is he dead?

80
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:13,707
Someone! Come here!

81
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:14,947
Someone!

82
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,626
(He's not my uncle.)

83
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,186
(Why did he die here?)

84
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,747
(If someone deliberately harmed him,)

85
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:25,907
(I can't escape being involved.)

86
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,186
Cheng Yuyang.

87
00:05:35,747 --> 00:05:36,867
I won't harm your life.

88
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,787
I've come to ask just one thing.

89
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,427
Were the Chengs involved in

90
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:42,387
the Su family's extermination?

91
00:06:08,832 --> 00:06:11,712
(Eldest son of the Su family,
Su Jingyuan)

92
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:22,466
Greet your uncle.

93
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:29,666
It was inconvenient to disturb you
at the estate back then.

94
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,186
Now finally I get to meet you in person.

95
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,626
In the future, my husband's business

96
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:36,787
will need some support from you.

97
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:38,747
Of course.

98
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:39,427
Xinian.

99
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:42,267
So the uncle I knew in my past life

100
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:44,626
had always been a fraud.

101
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,344
(Cheng Xinian's uncle, Cheng Yuyang)

102
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:55,296
- Sir.
- Sir.

103
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:56,626
Dispose of the body.

104
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:57,827
- Yes.
- Yes.

105
00:06:59,066 --> 00:06:59,867
People in the yard

106
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,066
have all been drugged.

107
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:02,986
Should we just...

108
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:04,586
Don't harm the innocent.

109
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:18,976
