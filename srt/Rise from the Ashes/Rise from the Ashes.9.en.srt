(Hard to Follow One's Heart)

3
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,003
Boss.

4
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:21,404
Lianxin came yesterday.

5
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:22,244
Got it.

6
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:28,924
I thought Shaowen was hard to deal with.

7
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,083
Turns out he's easy to handle.

8
00:00:31,964 --> 00:00:33,643
The colder I am, the harder to get me,

9
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:35,404
and the more anxious he becomes.

10
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:53,404
Last night,

11
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:55,964
you kissed me too.

12
00:00:58,483 --> 00:00:59,404
Su Jingyuan.

13
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:01,884
Do you really

14
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:04,123
want to marry me off to Lin Shaowen?

15
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:08,123
Do you

16
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:11,284
have feelings for me?

17
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,844
I can see right through
your little schemes.

18
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,083
Cheng Xinian.

19
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:22,244
Don't think that I am

20
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:23,603
as easy to control as Lin Shaowen.

21
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,083
I am not that foolish.

22
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:30,244
So that's how it is.

23
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:37,284
Compared to what we want to do,

24
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:38,764
such feelings of love

25
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,123
are not worth mentioning.

26
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:41,523
Right?

27
00:01:46,203 --> 00:01:46,884
Of course.

28
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:49,244
On the wedding day,

29
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:50,924
Uncle, please

30
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:53,563
prepare a wedding dress for me,

31
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,844
the wild woman.

32
00:01:59,123 --> 00:02:00,163
As you wish.

33
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,043
As an elder,

34
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,163
I will marry off my niece

35
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:07,924
in a grand and glorious ceremony.

36
00:02:17,324 --> 00:02:17,964
Shaowen.

37
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,643
This new store in Sanchuan Town

38
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:22,083
looks good

39
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:23,123
and expandable.

40
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:24,643
What do you think?

41
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:25,924
Your idea

42
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:26,964
is naturally excellent.

43
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:31,764
Today you seem

44
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,163
a bit distracted.

45
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:34,804
It's nothing.

46
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:38,884
Shaowen.

47
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,483
Are you worried why the killers
from Luoshi Pavilion

48
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,804
haven't arrived yet?

49
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:45,123
I am crystal clear

50
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:47,523
about what you want to do.

51
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,563
You plotted with Cheng Xinian

52
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:09,724
to get rid of me for good.

53
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,444
I've sent someone to their house.

54
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:13,724
What else do you have to say?

55
00:03:14,364 --> 00:03:15,523
Shaoye, I really didn't.

56
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:16,523
Gentlemen.

57
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,083
Don't destroy the harmony.

58
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,924
May I say a word?

59
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:25,804
Now that everyone is here,

60
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:28,083
then

61
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,804
we might as well talk it through.

62
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:32,884
Qingyue.

63
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:35,083
Tell us what you told me this morning

64
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:36,603
in full detail

65
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:38,203
again.

66
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:39,324
Yes.

67
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,043
Lianxin reported to me

68
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,724
that Xinian wanted to harm Shaoye.

69
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,244
I didn't believe it.

70
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,603
But then Lianxin disappeared.

71
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,163
When we found her again,
she was covered in bruises.

72
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,203
Miss Xinian is infatuated

73
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:54,284
with Mr. Shaowen for a long time.

74
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,764
To help Mr. Shaowen rise,

75
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,643
she had me hire some killers

76
00:03:58,643 --> 00:03:59,804
I told you about my feelings.

77
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:00,724
I...

78
00:04:00,724 --> 00:04:01,364
Shaowen.

79
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:03,603
You haven't cleared your name yet.

80
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:06,683
What killers?

81
00:04:07,043 --> 00:04:08,163
It's likely all a deception,

82
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,123
except Luoshi Pavilion.

83
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:10,083
Qingyue.

84
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:11,844
How could you take such risks?

85
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:14,203
Don't do anything foolish for me.

86
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,123
You got it?

87
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:18,483
And you, Cheng Xinian.

88
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,523
Being keen to take credit and show off
is one thing.

89
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:23,163
But hiring killers

90
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,764
is unforgivable.

91
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:27,724
How would you guys

92
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:30,764
explain this to us?

93
00:04:32,284 --> 00:04:32,884
Xinian.

94
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:34,203
Come here.

95
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:40,123
First you said I conspired with Shaowen,

96
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,244
but then you claimed it was all
my doing.

97
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,364
What you said didn't add up at all.

98
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:47,003
Did you really think it through
before confronting with me?

99
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:49,483
It was indeed Miss Xinian's orders.

100
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:51,284
I was telling the truth.

101
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,764
Qingyue accused me of hiring killers.

102
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:57,563
With only Lianxin as the witness

103
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,643
is insufficient.

104
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:01,444
Everyone knows that Lianxin
grew up in our family

105
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,043
and was only recently assigned to me.

106
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:05,483
If Qingyue took advantage of Lianxin
in some way,

107
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,523
this blatant frame-up

108
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:09,804
would leave me defenseless.

109
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:10,523
Indeed.

110
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,603
A single testimony may not suffice.

111
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,083
There is already a witness,

112
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:19,804
and so is the evidence.

113
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,244
I have heard

114
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:24,563
that Luoshi Pavilion is ostensibly
a pharmacy.

115
00:05:25,203 --> 00:05:27,123
They have musk with a lingering scent.

116
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,804
A young lady

117
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:30,563
is impossible to carry the smell
of musk.

118
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,404
If a horse smells it,

119
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:33,364
it will surely go mad.

120
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:34,844
Xinian.

121
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,043
Shall we bring a horse right now

122
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:39,563
to prove your innocence?

123
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,724
If you planned to frame me up,

124
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,804
what fragrance couldn't you
have put on me?

125
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,764
Then can you tell where you were
on that night?

126
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,364
You can't prove it, right?

127
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,764
If you truly are innocent,

128
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:57,924
why can't you even say where you were?

129
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,364
What is the harm with you admitting it?

130
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,244
Father would at most scold you.

131
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:04,203
Why make a big fuss at the Lin's?

132
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,203
Do you think your life
is too satisfying,

133
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,523
so you keep provoking me?

134
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,404
Xinian, you...

135
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,444
With both witness and evidence,

136
00:06:16,284 --> 00:06:18,324
how dare you still act unbridled
in our home?

137
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:19,444
Someone!

138
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:20,643
Send her

139
00:06:21,123 --> 00:06:21,764
to the Yamen!

140
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:23,364
Shaoye, calm down.

141
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,764
Such a jinx.

142
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:25,404
Someone!

143
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,523
Take her back.

144
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:30,563
Stop!

145
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,603
You want to bully her

146
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:40,844
by helping outsiders

147
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:42,563
and embarrassing yourselves.

148
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:43,683
If you want a witness,

149
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:44,523
I am the witness.

150
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:45,764
Xinian

151
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:47,483
was learning business with me.

152
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:50,444
Is that the truth if you say
that she was learning business?

153
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:51,284
What?

154
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:52,804
As an elder,

155
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,483
I can't even vouch for my niece?

156
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:56,483
Over the years,

157
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:58,844
she has endured so much humiliation

158
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,683
and shed so many bitter tears.

159
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,083
Every one of you knows it.

160
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:04,483
She had no protection
from elders before.

161
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:05,523
Now she does.

162
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:08,964
You provoked Cheng Qingyue and
seduced Lin Shaowen.

163
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,203
Cheng Qingyue made a move
as you planned.

164
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:12,844
Why do you seem disheartened?

165
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:18,163
Ostensibly, Luoshi Pavilion
is a medicine store.

166
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:19,884
In fact,

167
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:21,884
it deals in human lives.

168
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,563
Cheng Qingyue is hypocritical.

169
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,404
But she is still a noble lady.

170
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:28,724
Having come this far,

171
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,683
she has truly devoted herself
to Lin Shaowen.

172
00:07:33,364 --> 00:07:34,483
Every word of Lin Shaowen

173
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,043
seemed to be with concern for her.

174
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:39,244
He was enticing her to hire killers
from Luoshi Pavilion.

175
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:41,203
With ill intentions,

176
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,603
they will bring troubles.

177
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:44,764
If anything,

178
00:07:45,244 --> 00:07:46,764
I won't let her implicate you.

179
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:48,884
I will protect myself.

180
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,003
After all these years,

181
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:53,724
I have come through.

182
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,964
I don't know what slander you have heard

183
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,364
or what benefits you've received.

184
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:58,444
Why the favoritism?

185
00:07:58,804 --> 00:07:59,563
Favoritism?

186
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:03,444
She's been living on my estate for years

187
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:04,724
under my care.

188
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:06,884
If you take it as favoritism,

189
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:09,244
I will admit it. So what?

190
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:31,615
♪Like withered petals,
entangled with memories♪

191
