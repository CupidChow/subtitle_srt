(Alliance with You)

3
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,060
You know that I care about you the most.

4
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,461
Why would you think of me this way?

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,100
Xinian. Let me explain.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,660
I won't compete with you for Shaowen.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,461
Xinian.

8
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:32,021
Let go.

9
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,981
Cheng Xinian, what are you doing?

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,501
Mr. Cheng,

11
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,700
Xinian pushed Qingyue into the water.

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,540
- Qingyue.
- Father.

13
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:45,501
Father, I didn't do anything.

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,021
(Head of the family, Cheng Xianzong)
Father.

15
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:48,140
Don't blame Xinian.

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,580
I was too careless.

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,740
Cheng Xinian.

18
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,700
Your jealousy should have a limit.

19
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:54,580
If anything serious happens to Qingyue,

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,021
your death would not make up for it.

21
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:58,100
(It turned out that)

22
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:00,301
(I underestimated you.)

23
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,461
Qingyue.

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,060
Qingyue.

25
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:07,421
Are you okay?

26
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,540
Sit down.

27
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:20,941
Are you alright?

28
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:23,901
Shaowen. It was my own fault.

29
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,700
You are still defending her.

30
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:27,540
Cheng Xinian.

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,260
Don't blame her.

32
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,341
Don't go too far.

33
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:33,781
Cheng Xinian.

34
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:35,341
How dare you?

35
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,660
Lin Shaowen.

36
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,620
I originally thought you were
a gentleman.

37
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,941
I would have saved my sister.

38
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:43,021
Yet you picked up a drenched maiden

39
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,941
and held her like this.

40
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,620
How would she face people after this?

41
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:48,821
Shaowen was anxious to save her.

42
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,461
Don't be too harsh
for a sudden incident.

43
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,700
Qingyue, what happened here?

44
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,421
How did you fall into the water?

45
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,421
Don't blame Xinian.

46
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:56,540
It was my fault, Father.

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,381
A snake approached just now.

48
00:01:58,381 --> 00:01:59,381
To protect her from it,

49
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,901
I wanted to push her away
but lost control.

50
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:06,540
You...

51
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:08,180
Please punish me.

52
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,861
Why say all this when you're hurt?

53
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,341
Call the doctor! Someone!

54
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,060
Master.

55
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,021
Come on.

56
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:14,700
Someone!

57
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:15,421
Master.

58
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,140
Xinian.

59
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:18,580
I was too impatient and wronged you.

60
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,301
I'll take you to a doctor.

61
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,100
(Today is just the beginning.)

62
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,781
(Everything I lost and
entrusted mistakenly,)

63
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,021
(I will take it all back.)

64
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,381
It's been a day now.

65
00:02:49,341 --> 00:02:50,821
You acting weird

66
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,781
would only arouse Father's suspicion.

67
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:56,260
Now you are starting to control me.

68
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,180
You and I have returned home together.

69
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,501
We share weal and woe.

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,781
I don't want you

71
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,580
to get in my way.

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,301
When you begged me,

73
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,180
you said you needed the elder's help.

74
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:09,461
Now I have become a stumbling block?

75
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,301
Anyway, I've taken over
Cheng Yuyang's identity.

76
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
If you have concerns,

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
we can part ways immediately.

78
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:21,341
Are you kicking down the ladder,

79
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:23,021
dear

80
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:23,861
Master

81
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:25,341
Su?

82
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,501
Yuyang.

83
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,821
(On the day of returning)

84
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:30,180
After you fell ill, you insisted in
moving to the estate.

85
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,260
Now, it has been over ten years.

86
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,421
To me, you are still like the way
you were.

87
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,781
Today

88
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,580
you look quite different.

89
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,220
Having too much medicine

90
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:46,421
made my face look bitter.

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
Yet you look just like our father,

92
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,461
very handsome.

93
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,781
Lately, Lin Shaowen, the youngest son
of the Lin family

94
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,140
will come to discuss some matters.

95
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:58,100
He has a marriage alliance
with our family.

96
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,821
You can help check out the situation
for your nieces.

97
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,620
Yes.

98
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,901
(Lin Shaowen, that rat.)

99
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:06,220
I heard the marriage
hasn't been settled.

100
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,740
Will Qingyue or Xinian marry him?

101
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:13,620
For a matter as important as marriage,

102
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,461
we must consider
the Lin family's opinions.

103
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,540
Cheng Yuyang had been ill for years

104
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,140
and hadn't healed.

105
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,981
Even if I can muddle through,
I must have a backup plan.

106
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,941
Now I have spoken in public that
after my death

107
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,981
I'd entrust my estate to your family.

108
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,781
Your father, in turn, would hesitate
to act against me rashly.

109
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:33,700
There are some things

110
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,781
I wish to give to my nieces

111
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,981
as gifts.

112
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,220
How could you say such things?

113
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,660
My health

114
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,740
is deteriorating day by day.

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,981
If I...

116
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,341
Yuyang.

117
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,620
We are brothers. You must not
speak of it again.

118
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:54,821
Since it's Yuyang's good will,

119
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,381
then accept it.

120
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,100
Although my father is strict,

121
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,901
he would not go so far as to harm
his own brother.

122
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,220
As long as you pretend to be

123
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,260
the real Cheng Yuyang.

124
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,740
He would not dare to act.

125
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,381
However, I always feel that

126
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,260
the real Cheng Yuyang...

127
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,620
Died a strange death.

128
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,021
Are you okay?

129
00:05:19,341 --> 00:05:20,180
- What's up?
- Help.

130
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,660
Help me. I don't want to die yet.

131
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,301
She was out of character today.

132
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,140
What happened?

133
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,901
Lianxin reported on her recent status.

134
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,220
Nothing strange.

135
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:38,620
But I always feel that

136
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,381
she has suddenly changed into
another woman.

137
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,140
The way she looked at Lin Shaowen is
unlike her usual admiration.

138
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,421
We have long been betrothed
to the Lin family.

139
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:50,981
I know your heart is with Shaowen.

140
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,301
He is more accomplished than Shaoye.

141
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:53,941
But

142
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:55,540
after all he is not

143
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,100
the heir to his family.

144
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,180
If you marry into their family now,

145
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,260
wouldn't that be a disadvantage?

146
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,700
You're thorough.

147
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,620
After the Sus' extermination,

148
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,100
the gunpowder formula has been
in Lins' hands for years.

149
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,260
But they haven't come up with
new products.

150
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:13,021
The nobles are dissatisfied.

151
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,220
I wonder

152
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:18,140
how long the Lin family can maintain
their imperial merchant status.

153
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,861
Therefore,

154
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,620
you must not marry into
the Lin family soon.

155
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,421
Xinian must pave the way for you first.

156
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,060
With her serious and desperate
character,

157
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,421
if she can truly help Lin Shaowen
manage the Lin family,

158
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:33,140
it will not be late for you to enjoy
the fortune then.

159
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:35,461
I have raised her for so many years

160
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,861
merely for this purpose, after all.

161
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,580
You've worked hard for our sake.

162
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,901
I will find a way to ease your worries

163
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,301
and make Xinian
marry into the Lin family willingly.

164
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,941
Her endless feelings

165
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,981
will eventually be of use.

166
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,301
I know

167
00:06:51,781 --> 00:06:53,781
you can reassure me the most.

168
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,060
(I had always wanted to gain
father's appreciation.)

169
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,461
(But in the end,)

170
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:08,260
(I was just a pawn.)

171
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,981
Boss.

172
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:10,861
Our people

173
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:12,821
haven't found any news
of Cheng Yuyang's doctor.

174
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:14,021
Should we use some means?

175
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,861
Search everywhere and find him.

176
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,781
Boss, isn't that your little niece?

177
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,341
Check the estate to see if we

178
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,220
miss anything.

179
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:23,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

180
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,941
Cheng Xinian.

181
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,461
Why are you here alone?

182
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:40,901
What happened?

183
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,501
Alone.

184
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,140
Right.

185
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,941
People say the Cheng family is thriving.

186
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,700
But I have always been alone.

187
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,381
Su Jingyuan.

188
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,180
I have always been alone.

189
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,301
From life to death,

190
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:00,060
everyone will be alone.

191
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,861
But for every lonely poor soul,
the heavens will

192
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,140
bring down a rain

193
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,821
and set off special fireworks.

194
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,541
I just left for a day.

195
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,500
Why are you so disheveled?

196
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:25,941
They are just the same.

197
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,901
I shouldn't hold any expectations.

198
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,021
Once you let go,

199
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,661
you can take a chance.

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,861
The Cheng family wants to use me.

201
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,981
I will bring down them to oblivion.

202
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:37,821
Is this your revenge?

203
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,621
Not only that.

204
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,021
I need your help.

205
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,340
What do I get in return?

206
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,621
When the Su family was wiped out,

207
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,300
the formula for gunpowder
was lost overnight.

208
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,140
Then the Lin family rose to prominence
by making fireworks

209
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,584
and became the imperial merchant.

210
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,420
You are a descendant of the Su family.

211
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,380
You seek revenge,

212
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,220
right?

213
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,100
The Cheng family's business isn't big,

214
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,460
mostly relying on collaboration
with the Lins.

215
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,100
The Lins have been
the imperial merchant for long,

216
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,861
but their innovation wasn't smooth.

217
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,981
On the inside,

218
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:13,661
I will gradually master
the Lin family's fireworks making.

219
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,821
On the outside,

220
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,460
after gaining trust through
pretended cooperation,

221
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,500
I will ensure they never recover.

222
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,901
It's what the Su family's descendant

223
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,941
wants the most.

224
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:24,581
Isn't it?

225
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,260
It sounds easy.

226
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:28,581
But what are your chances of success?

227
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:29,541
Just now,

228
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
I noticed that you cannot bear
to see a woman cry.

229
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:36,300
I cannot stand this overwhelming
sorrow and resentment.

230
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,781
My bargaining chip

231
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,661
is to risk my life and soul.

232
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,901
I have never considered you as a woman.

233
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:45,701
For our alliance,

234
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:47,140
I only want the results.

235
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,300
Alliance?

236
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:53,460
Sounds like a relationship
that will break with backstabbing.

237
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:55,300
It's better to say

238
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,941
we are friends.

239
00:09:58,112 --> 00:09:58,821
Good.

240
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:00,701
Friend.

241
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,306
(Luoshi Pavilion)

242
00:10:08,661 --> 00:10:09,661
Anything?

243
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,821
Doctor Huang fell to his death
while gathering herbs days ago.

244
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,340
We also found that his former
assistants and staff

245
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,380
all fled and moved away overnight.

246
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,021
So, Cheng Yuyang was indeed murdered
by someone.

247
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,901
But Doctor Huang, who has always been
taking care of my health,

248
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,180
has been missing.

249
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,941
I can only go in a few months.

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,701
The Lin family can't innovate.

251
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,460
Their business is not as good as before.

252
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,581
Many of their business

253
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:37,861
have been annexed by us.

254
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,300
Has the Lin family noticed?

255
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,220
Not at all.

256
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,621
We've done it in secret.

257
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:44,100
They don't have many
skilled businessmen either.

258
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,021
Now, the Lin family only

259
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,941
has the title of imperial merchant.

260
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,981
They look noble, but lack vigor.

261
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,140
You have truly spent a lot of effort
planning over the years.

262
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,220
When we get the formula as evidence,

263
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,420
bring them down.

264
00:10:59,420 --> 00:10:59,941
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,140
Sir.

266
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,581
When we targeted the Lin family,

267
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:04,661
we discovered some shops.

268
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,380
Although unimpressive,

269
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,500
they also profit from opposing
the Lin family.

270
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,180
We have investigated.

271
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,661
The boss behind them

272
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,581
is Mr. Cheng.

273
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,621
The Cheng family?

274
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,500
You must look into what exactly
the Cheng family intends to do.

275
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,220
Yes.

276
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:23,380
Also,

277
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,861
carefully investigate what secrets
this thing holds.

278
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,340
Tomorrow,

279
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,821
send someone to procure some incense.

280
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,180
Smelling it frequently

281
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,861
has good effects on coughing.

282
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,661
- Yes.
- Yes.
