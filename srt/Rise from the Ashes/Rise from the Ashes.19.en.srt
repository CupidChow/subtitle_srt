=Episode 19=
(Turning the Tables)

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,440
Boss, we've been ambushed.

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,480
Boss, is your wound okay?

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,079
It's nothing. Let's return to the city.

6
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,199
Old grudges and new enmities,
let's settle them all

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,616
Okay.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,159
Boss, we've brought lady boss
safe and sound.

9
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,119
Is everything okay?

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Rest assured.
They think I'm in Mingjiang.

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,920
Lin Shaowen signed a big deal
with my people.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,679
In a few days,
they will be at their wits' end.

13
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,504
Are you hurt? What happened?

14
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,199
It's nothing.

15
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,520
- Let me see it.
- It's fine.

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
Let me take a look.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,800
I'm fine.

18
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,279
This is the best healing for me.

19
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,199
Rare to see the pure white flower
among the weeds.

20
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,239
Indeed, it's rare.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,239
Because it only blooms
where the rotting corpses are.

22
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,559
Rotting corpses? How would you know?

23
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,360
As a child, when I visited
my family's tomb every year,

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,920
it would bloom by the graves.

25
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,320
Because those painful memories
make you feel insecure?

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Then when did you actually start
to trust me?

27
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:32,759
Because I've discovered you are
a person with a void in your heart too.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
We are of the same kind.

29
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,239
We both have an obsession to pursue
even if it means risking our lives.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,719
But in the end, if my hands

31
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,639
are tainted with blood,
as if on the brink of an abyss,

32
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,800
unable to leave the ship,
nor to reach the shore,

33
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,559
what should I do?

34
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,559
That depends on your role on this ship.

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,920
Are you the helmsman, a passenger,
or the one who maintains the mast?

36
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:17,320
Then which of them do you think
I should be?

37
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,520
I hope you're not a person.

38
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,759
I hope you're just an oar.

39
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:32,520
When the mast falls, the ship is wrecked
and people are drowning to death,

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,639
you can still drift in all directions.

41
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,040
With over a hundred big orders,

42
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:59,079
yet not having the materials
for fireworks in hand,

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,279
we are unable to deliver the goods.

44
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,759
How could it come to this?

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,704
Saltpeter is nowhere to be found.

46
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,719
Someone must've done this on purpose.

47
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,559
It's because you've offended someone.

48
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:11,920
Do you really think you can
do business? Father.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
For imperial merchant selection,

50
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
if this matter isn't resolved
before the news reaches the capital,

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,888
the Emperor will think that our family
does not deserve the position anymore.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,312
Only after the Su family's extermination
did we obtain this position.

53
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,599
He is still causing trouble
for the family, Father.

54
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:38,239
I have said not to mention anything
related to the Su family ever again.

55
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,480
I still have a batch of goods

56
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,872
which can solve this urgent crisis.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
You have no place to speak
as a woman. Father.

58
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,800
If you don't want to live,
then I won't bring it up.

59
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,840
Xinian, we're family. Don't speak as if
we are strangers.

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,159
Shaowen, with such a virtuous wife,

61
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,320
you truly are blessed.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
But I didn't come to help Lin Shaowen
for nothing.

63
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,279
If the Lin family takes my goods
and settles the immediate predicament,

64
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,888
you must return all the shops
that are part of my dowry,

65
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,000
and you have to compensate me
with three of your shops.

66
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,320
Otherwise, just forget I said anything.

67
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,840
Xinian, I shouldn't have taken
your dowry. I will return it to you.

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,360
But my family's shops...

69
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,679
You are neither the manager
nor the heir of the family.

70
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,679
Do you have a say in this?

71
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,800
Father, even if you think
I am incompetent,

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,920
you can't let the Lin family

73
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,119
fall into the hands of
such a malicious couple. Father.

74
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,320
Father, I'm discussing business
with you.

75
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,400
Bad news travels far,
while good deeds go unnoticed.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,079
If we don't fix this problem quickly,

77
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,079
do you think the Lin family will have
any chance in next month's selection?

78
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,144
(Receipt for a loan from Cheng Xinian)

79
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,040
I've demanded three shops
from the Lin family.

80
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,960
They are marginal shops like
fireworks tubes, packaging,

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,800
and scrap recycling shops.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,480
They won't think much of it.

83
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,840
But in reality, in these fireworks tubes
and recycled scrap,

84
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,400
there is residue of gunpowder.

85
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,639
And the materials used for packaging

86
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,759
can reveal what components
the gunpowder consists of.

87
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,559
If direct evidence can be found,
along with the original formula,

88
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,360
it can be proved that they've been
profiting from the Sus' formula.

89
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,800
So I'm giving these three shops to you.

90
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:55,279
If you're so pleased,
why not help me find a certain medicine?

91
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,239
What medicine?

92
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:01,119
I want Lin Shaowen to be childless
and end his family line.

93
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,559
Please.

94
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,400
(I once gave my all to you,)

95
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,040
(yet you made it impossible for me
to have my own children.)

96
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
What do you want from me?

97
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,880
A mere nominal couple.

98
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:44,679
Given how things have turned out,
don't feel like I owe you.

99
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,599
Then, is it I who owes you?

100
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,496
You have lost the shops
and trust of the clan elders.

101
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,199
Only I can help you turn the tides,

102
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:56,832
as long as you give me the formula.

103
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:00,599
As expected, you set a trap,
hoarding goods in secret,

104
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,079
forcing me into this corner.

105
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,599
How can you blame others
when you step into a trap yourself?

106
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:07,936
Why is this happening?
Haven't I done enough for you?

107
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,040
You said you liked upright
gentlemen, so I became one.

108
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,832
I never minded your affair
with your uncle.

109
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,640
I thought you were good with numbers
and at making fireworks.

110
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,399
A virtuous wife helping me rise.

111
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,119
Yet now, you have set up a trap
to kill me.

112
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,439
Indeed, to you, marrying a wife
has always been a transaction.

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,920
From the beginning,
you've set yourself up for a dead end.

114
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,159
You used to love me only.

115
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,519
Why has it come to this?

116
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,159
Don't you owe me your life?

117
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,760
Now I will have you pay it back.

118
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Dare to harm her,
and I'll take your life.

119
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,439
Stop right there.

120
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,360
As long as she is my wife for a day,

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,359
she will be part of my family
until she dies.

122
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,239
You two have committed
such an immoral act.

123
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,760
If I report to the authorities,

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,880
aren't you afraid to lose your
reputation and be drowned in the pond?

125
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:21,760
Then go ahead to wail in the streets.
No one will stop you.

126
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
But I guarantee something
that will spread faster

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,079
is that you have gone mad,

128
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:29,680
deluding that your wife
is involved in immoral affairs.

129
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,640
A mad second son like you

130
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,960
will have nothing to do
with the Lin family's business.

131
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,159
You despicable wretch.

132
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,479
By seniority, I'm the uncle.

133
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,040
If you insist on calling Xinian "aunt",
I won't mind.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
I'll leave it at that. From now on,
look out for your own fortune.

135
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,760
If you exchange with the formula,

136
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,880
I can help you turn the tables
in the Lin family.

137
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,239
Dream on.

138
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,239
Don't waste words.
If he wants to die, no one can stop him.

139
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,720
Shaoye is the legitimate son.

140
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,728
No matter what happens, he will always
be left something in the end.

141
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,560
But you have played the scholar
for so many years.

142
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,920
When you brothers turn against
each other,

143
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
you'll know where to go begging.

144
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:29,119
Wait a moment.

145
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,648
I can give you the original formula.

146
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,119
But you must fulfill your promise
and oust Lin Shaoye.
