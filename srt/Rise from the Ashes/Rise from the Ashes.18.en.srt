00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:16,288
=Episode 18=
(Such Impermanence)

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,120
Do you know what Xinian
has been up to recently?

4
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,560
I don't want to hear about
what she's doing from you.

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
Cheng Xinian is plotting with Shaoye.

6
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,881
She intends to take
the Lin family's shops from you.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Either she wants to use her coldness

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,912
to incite your desire to compete,

9
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:02,361
or you want to win her over
or to acquire her firework skills,

10
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,200
as long as you stand against her,

11
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,361
she will definitely not give you
any benefits.

12
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,600
She has been sincere to me since young.
She wouldn't do that.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,321
People change as they grow up.

14
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,640
What do you suggest we do?

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,112
If I really go against her,
what will the Cheng family think?

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,024
Her relationship with Uncle
is definitely not ordinary.

17
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,801
But neither of them represents
the Cheng family.

18
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,321
Only I am the one our father
cares about the most.

19
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,240
He will definitely help me
with all his might.

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,001
Moreover, they are the ones
plotting against you first.

21
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:41,720
So they can't blame us for repaying.

22
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:58,368
(Little Pavilion)

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,801
You went to my brother today?

24
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:04,001
You are well-informed.

25
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,200
This ledger is from my brother,

26
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,672
just as Qingyue said.

27
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:18,961
What do you want, Cheng Xinian?

28
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,841
We are married. We should act as one.
Do you understand?

29
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,361
What are you dissatisfied with?

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,760
Don't forget that I rescued you
from the fire.

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,481
You promised me, swearing by your life,

32
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:31,801
that I saved your life
and you would be devoted to me.

33
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,001
But what is this now?

34
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:41,792
Cheng Xinian, you are my wife.
You belong to me.

35
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,001
I won't let you betray me.

36
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,744
Next time, it won't just be a headbutt.

37
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:49,881
You'll not have offspring for sure.

38
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:52,120
What on earth have I done for you
to treat me this way?

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,712
Finally, your true face.

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,321
It's been a long time since I've seen
this side of you.

41
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:04,961
I gave you a chance, my trust
and dignity.

42
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,041
Yet now you're being treacherous.

43
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,280
You're pushing me.

44
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:12,881
From today on, I won't let you take
a step out of this room.

45
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,280
You no longer need to manage
those five shops.

46
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,992
You were used to lurking behind women.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,801
You even want to claim my dowry
as your own.

48
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:23,648
Such a hypocrite truly opens my eyes.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,801
So this is what you think of me.

50
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,160
You've worn the mask
of a hypocritical scholar for so long,

51
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
that it has muddled your mind.

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,441
Feel free to take the shops.

53
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:35,680
But if you want to know how
to make fireworks,

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,120
even if I gave you my brain,
you wouldn't be able to learn.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,521
I've never failed to get what I want.

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,841
(Why can't she come back?)

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,361
Won't you seek justice for
your own daughter?

58
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,160
Now she has married into the Lin family.

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
She is already part of the Lin family.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,216
Fine, if you don't care, I will.

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,401
Stop right there.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,361
Cheng Yuyang, do you realize

63
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:16,600
even outsiders are saying
that you and Xinian have an affair.

64
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,760
Is the speculation
of others more important,

65
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,801
or your own daughter's life?

66
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:24,801
But now the shop is short on materials.

67
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:27,200
The priority is to go to Mingjiang
to stock up.

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,280
Next month they will join
the imperial merchant selection.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,560
At that time,
there must not be any mistakes.

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,240
Xinian has been treated this way,
but you still...

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,680
You keep defending her.

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,680
It will only make things harder.

73
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:44,041
To you, rumors and gossips are nothing
but trifles.

74
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,200
But she is now married
into the Lin family.

75
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,801
What will be the consequences
if her reputation is ruined?

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,481
Don't you know it?

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,441
You gave your shops to Shaowen.

78
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,200
He replaced the staff and
took the fireworks.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
This is equivalent to giving five stores
to my family.

80
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,120
My parents still have to praise you.
You're setting me up.

81
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,961
Is this what you think?

82
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:38,560
That's the truth,
yet you want to deny it?

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,481
A concubine-born daughter
is just a disgrace.

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,640
If you've gone mad, go get treatment
and don't bother me.

85
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,200
Cheng Xinian! Just wait and see.

86
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,640
So many guests came
one after another. It's quite lively.

87
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,720
Now you know what it means to
go for wool and come home sheared.

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,921
You're not pretending anymore,
showing your true colors.

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,961
Though detestable,
it's also interesting.

90
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,401
There's no need to pretend
in front of a loser.

91
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,680
Seeing you come to this point,

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,321
I can't help but feel happy.

93
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:20,841
Uncle won't be back
in a short while, will he?

94
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,760
How does it feel, having no one
to back you up? Is it unpleasant?

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,321
I'm used to it. I've come this far
over the years just like that.

96
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,560
It's just that all the old hands
in the shops have been replaced.

97
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,481
The Cheng family's shops are
in the hands of the Lin family.

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,801
Don't you understand what this means?

99
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:44,200
Just a change of staff.
The imperial merchant has its own rules.

100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,441
Casting pearls before a swine.

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,424
You're married into the Lin family.
Why care about the Cheng family's shops?

102
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,760
It's you who doesn't understand.

103
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,640
I wonder how long it will take
for you to learn to behave.

104
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,312
