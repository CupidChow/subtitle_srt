00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:12,640
=Rise From the Ashes=

2
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,916
=Episode 24=
(Together for Life, Never to Betray)

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,320
(There's just a month left
from the day I died in the past life.)

4
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,840
(Accidents have been happening.)

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,601
(I don't know if I can get through
this safely.)

6
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:41,401
What's on your mind?

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,561
My injury has healed. We'll depart
for Yingtian Prefecture tomorrow.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,401
I have thought it over. I'll go alone.
You don't need to come.

9
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,240
You fear for my safety.

10
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,001
If you died, how could I live alone?

11
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:05,481
Cheng Xianzong wanted me
to show up alone last time.

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,921
He doesn't care about
the evidence I hold.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,280
He knows those are just
inanimate objects.

14
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,680
But I can mobilize Luoshi Pavilion.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,840
For them, the massacre of the Su family
was vividly in sight.

16
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:22,240
He is very clear that I am
the most important witness.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,401
What he wants is my life.

18
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,881
I won't agree, as Cheng Xianzong
is also my enemy.

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,961
From the day you entered my heart,

20
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:41,481
I found that when I used a sword,

21
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,280
it has become heavier
with my hesitation.

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,521
Rest assured. I am no longer alone
and throwing all in.

23
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:56,680
I will certainly protect myself
and our future.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,481
Although I cannot be compared
with your sword

25
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,481
and my frame may be small,
I have strong muscles.

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,840
I can be your human shield.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,401
If you need a hand,
I'll be your assistant.

28
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:15,720
If you need my heart,
I'll give you my true heart.

29
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:23,121
How can I bear to lose a hand and
be heartbroken?

30
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:42,601
Indeed, it was as I expected.

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,921
You and Su Jingyuan acted separately.

32
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:47,121
He went to draw Father's attention.

33
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:50,041
But the real evidence is in your hands.

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,881
Going to Yingtian Prefecture
to file a complaint?

35
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:58,881
You guessed wrong again.
The real evidence is in his hands.

36
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,401
Then you need to hear my plan.

37
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,561
Cheng Xianzong will surely ambush you
on the way.

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,921
The people he trusts must be involved
in the massacre of the Su family.

39
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,280
If you expose Cheng Xianzong,
you can still save your lives.

40
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,041
If you don't atone for your sins,
there is only one way out, death.

41
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,720
And you'll pretend to travel light.

42
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,320
Actually, you will send a letter first
to inform Yingtian Prefecture.

43
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,481
Then capture them all in one fell swoop.

44
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:32,680
Only the incompetent resorts to
armed conflicts.

45
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:37,160
As long as I hold you back,
there will be someone to meet him.

46
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,760
You all just wait
to receive the punishment you deserve.

47
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't come any closer.

48
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,360
If we die together,

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,200
you all deserve to die
from the Su family's gunpowder.

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Indeed, as Father said,

51
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,561
you disregard the grace of being raised.
You heartless wretch.

52
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,561
It is always what Father says or wishes.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,160
He let you take the blame and
face death, and yet you complied.

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,840
You would willingly degrade yourself,

55
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,601
driven by greed and ambition,
to be his puppet executioner

56
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:06,720
and a sacrifice?

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,840
What are you to judge my father?

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,521
Now everything is as you wished.

59
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:14,320
You schemed to take Lin Shaowen away
and become the imperial merchant's wife.

60
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,441
You've wronged me.

61
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:17,561
What more could you possibly
be dissatisfied with?

62
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:20,160
I simply do not care
for what you desire.

63
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,601
It's you who are desperately sick
and yet utterly unaware.

64
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,720
You've lived your life as no more
than a tool.

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,001
Have you even once acted
out of genuine ease and happiness?

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,521
Wearing the mask for too long
destroys your true heart and face.

67
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:39,921
All that remains are an empty shell
and a vain name. You have nothing.

68
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,200
Don't put on this condescending act
of understanding me so well.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,680
You don't deserve this love.
You don't deserve it.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,921
At least the old Cheng Qingyue,

71
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,561
who would endure needle pricks
when practicing embroidery,

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,081
was still a person deserving my respect.

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,680
Is it worth it to spend a lifetime
trying to satisfy insatiable desires?

74
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,561
Stop now. If you become worthless,

75
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,561
he will not hesitate to kill you.

76
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:34,720
(Although the outcome is not
satisfactory,)

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,240
(I have done all that I can.)

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,961
I will switch your gunpowder.

79
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,001
Because I fear you would risk your life.

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,001
I am determined to keep you safe.

81
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,800
(Lin's Mansion)

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,224
(Cheng Xianzong, Lin Xiyuan,
you engaged in private deals,)

83
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:07,040
(falsely accused the good as thieves,
and disregarded human lives.)

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,320
(The culprit Cheng Xianzong will
be executed, his property confiscated.)

85
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,320
(Lin Xiyuan is to be exiled
three thousand miles away.)

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,200
(The Su family has suffered.
Given their unwavering dedication,)

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,401
(I will restore their position of
imperial merchant and their mansion.)

88
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,320
Xinian. Xinian. You've come.

89
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,921
I beg you. Let me out.

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,760
I can give you treasure and banknotes.

91
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
I beg you to let me out.

92
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Do you think you can cover up
the evidence and truth every time?

93
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,561
Everything leaves a trace.
Your crimes are unforgivable.

94
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,601
If I hadn't taken you in back then,
you would have already been dead.

95
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,041
You owe me your life.
You ungrateful wretch.

96
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,960
You owe me. You should pay it back.

97
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:39,264
(Memorial Tablets of Cheng Wenqin
and Jiang Ti)

98
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,264
(Memorial Tablets)

99
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,200
You're not Cheng Xinian. Who are you?

100
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,320
The Cheng Xinian you manipulated
has long been dead.

101
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,561
I've avenged all grudges and resentment.

102
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,320
From now on, I will not take orders
from anyone.

103
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,840
Nor do I want to lose anyone again.

104
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:22,841
Go to the netherworld to atone
for your sins.

105
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:32,200
(Memorial Tablets of the Sus and Chengs)

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,560
Xinian.

107
00:08:39,961 --> 00:08:43,440
I'm sorry, all of you. I'm sorry.

108
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:47,400
I beg you to let me go.

109
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,961
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

111
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,881
(Su's Mansion)
(What do you want to be in afterlife?)

112
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:59,041
(No matter the past or future lives,
we but lament the present moment.)

113
00:08:59,921 --> 00:09:02,560
(Life is interesting and hopeful,
with love and companionship.)

114
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,360
A bit more to the left. Good.

115
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:07,360
Boss.

116
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,681
Lady boss.

117
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,240
Boss.

118
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:10,600
Lady boss.

119
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,121
Congrats!

120
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,515
(A bow for vindication.
A bow to ancestors.)

121
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:20,000
(For meals and peace in every year.)

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,875
(Move forward hand in hand
on this earth.)
