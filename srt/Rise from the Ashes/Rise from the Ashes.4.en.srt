(Live to Please Me)

3
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,700
Your chess skills have improved greatly.

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,019
Shaowen, you flatter me too much.

5
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,619
No need for modesty. I speak the truth.

6
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,499
Truly a match made in heaven.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,740
A perfect couple.

8
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,260
He may also be your future husband.

9
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,059
That look in your eyes

10
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:36,820
is as if you want to kill him.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,780
Uncle.

12
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,340
Please stay out

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,979
of my private affairs.

14
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,260
Shaowen.

15
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:51,900
Mr. Cheng.

16
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,979
My father has sent me this time...

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,820
To consult with you

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,539
about proposing marriage to Qingyue.

19
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,499
In my heart, there has always been
only Qingyue.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,019
After marriage, I will cherish her
and grow old with her.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,260
My father has sent me here

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,459
to discuss with you

23
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,099
about cooperation

24
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:12,539
on jointly manufacturing fireworks.

25
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,340
My family is still using
the old formula.

26
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,380
It's outdated and lackluster.

27
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,579
Moreover,

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,459
the ending of this formula's
former owner...

29
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,300
Every time we use it...

30
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,579
What happened

31
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,780
- to its former owner?
- Yuyang.

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,900
I told you.

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,579
Any family that makes fireworks

34
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,740
should not mention the past.

35
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,220
Yes, Xianzong.

36
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:31,820
I just forgot.

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,059
Last year's Mid-Autumn Festival,

38
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,659
you had newly made fireworks
that amazed everyone,

39
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,820
including the court.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,940
Why don't we collaborate?

41
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,820
We have nice offers.

42
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:43,380
I've long intended this.

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,059
It's just that the fireworks
were made by...

44
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,860
Upon a new idea.

45
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,099
I wouldn't call it amazing.

46
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,179
Qingyue.

47
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,059
How much more can you surprise me?

48
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,019
She truly makes me proud.

49
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,979
About last year's stunning
dragon and phoenix fireworks,

50
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,420
Qingyue deserved credit for
appraising them.

51
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,220
But the whole family knows

52
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,860
that most of them are crafted by Xinian.

53
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:09,940
If you are truly sincere,

54
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,539
it would be better to let my young niece

55
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:14,979
work with you.

56
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:15,780
How about that?

57
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:16,820
Yuyang.

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,179
You've been ill and confined
to the estate.

59
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,619
There are many things you don't know.

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,019
Both ladies are exceptionally talented.

61
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,380
If we could work together,

62
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,940
it would be even better.

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,860
Okay.

64
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,619
I'll listen to the elders.

65
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,300
- Of course...
- That would be the best of course.

66
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,940
That is very good.

67
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,499
You agreed on my behalf without
even asking me.

68
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,260
You really consider yourself
as my uncle?

69
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:03,900
Doing business with him

70
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,740
is for the sake of our pact.

71
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,059
Your grievances with him

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,499
have nothing to do with me.

73
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,420
If you have any plans,
you should discuss them with me,

74
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,740
rather than leaving no room
for negotiation.

75
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,860
We are in a partnership.

76
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,059
I am not your subordinate.

77
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,059
It was unexpected.

78
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,820
I couldn't let you refuse.

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,900
Fine.

80
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,099
It won't happen.

81
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,380
But I must remind you

82
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,059
not to let emotions

83
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,380
cloud your judgement.

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,579
I am well aware of the vengeance
yet to be settled.

85
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,459
But I can't help being angry.

86
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:51,979
These things

87
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,139
bear you no grudges.

88
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,019
Why did you damage them?

89
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,300
In the past, only Cheng Qingyue
had them.

90
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:01,179
I was envious.

91
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,740
Now that I have them,

92
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,179
I'll smash them as I want.

93
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,179
Envy.

94
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,019
I have been alone since childhood,

95
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,740
living a miserable life,

96
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,099
dodging and fleeing.

97
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,619
I couldn't get a decent meal.

98
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,139
I could only knock things out of others.

99
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,579
The dirty, ruined,

100
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,860
unwanted by others.

101
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:34,780
Then I got something to eat.

102
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,860
This isn't actually envy.

103
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,179
It is longing but not being able
to have it.

104
00:04:39,619 --> 00:04:40,940
You can only destroy it first.

105
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,539
Let others discard it.

106
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,940
Only then could you have it.

107
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,539
No matter what,

108
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,059
you have family.

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,780
I envy you.

110
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,579
What about being alone?

111
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,220
Even with family,

112
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,659
I'm still alone.

113
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,420
At least for now,

114
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,220
you are not alone.

115
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,659
After fulfilling your wish,

116
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:36,220
what do you want then?

117
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,380
Live without disgrace.

118
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,700
Die in my proper place.

119
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:44,099
And you?

120
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:47,860
Live to please me.

121
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,139
Die in my proper place.

122
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,820
What a way to live to please me!

123
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,820
(Rather than like a flower,
diffusing dimly fragrant)

124
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,260
(and scheming with others,)

125
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,099
(better to grow wings)

126
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,700
(to fly away)

127
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,740
(and be free.)

128
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,059
Xinian.

129
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,380
So you are truly here.

130
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,820
Tomorrow,

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,179
I wish to invite you to
my family's storehouse.

132
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:26,139
Is that okay?

133
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,019
Okay.

134
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:34,659
Early tomorrow morning.

135
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,740
I won't wait.

136
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,940
(The formula for
the Lin family's fireworks)

137
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,659
is prohibited from being taken outside.

138
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,019
So I must trouble you to personally
come and see.

139
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,700
The saltpeter to sulfur ratio
indeed follows the old formula.

140
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,420
The key now is in how to use
the fuse layout

141
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,539
to display more variations.

142
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,260
You truly know the ropes.

143
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,619
On the Flower Festival,

144
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,220
my family will showcase
the newest fireworks.

145
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,579
Please enlighten me.

146
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,700
You truly know when to bend
and esteem the worthy.

147
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,340
- Xinian.
- Don't get up.

148
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,659
Just stay bowed like this

149
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,099
for two hours.

150
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:17,619
Then I'll agree.

151
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:18,740
You...

152
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,059
Since you've come to me,

153
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,139
the court must be dissatisfied
with what you've made.

154
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:26,860
To keep your title

155
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,499
or to contend for a moment's success.

156
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,659
You'd better think it through.

157
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,059
If the firecracker falls,

158
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,499
then you can do this business yourself.

159
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,820
You wanted me to do business
with Lin Shaowen

160
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,539
for this formula.

161
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:06,900
I didn't forget.

162
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:23,968
(Just kidding)

163
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:24,940
You...

164
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,059
I've recited every formula
of theirs I've seen.

165
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,419
It shows that

166
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:40,500
they got the nitre and sulphur ratio

167
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,900
from the original formula.

168
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,940
But it still requires some time to
research the ingredients for gunpowder.

169
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,059
I've been planning day and night
for what you want.

170
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,299
Shouldn't you also show some sincerity?

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,259
This batch of goods

172
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:05,179
is in Lin Shaowen's charge.

173
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,419
Now there's an issue with
his fireworks' fuse,

174
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,059
whether you can win him over

175
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,780
is up to you now.
