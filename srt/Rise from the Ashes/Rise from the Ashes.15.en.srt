00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,935
=Episode 15=
(The Precious Jade)

3
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:25,204
Yuyang.

4
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,136
Come here.

5
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:30,524
Take a look at the Chicken-Blood Stone
brought back from the south.

6
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:36,885
It's cool to touch,

7
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:38,285
then becoming warm.

8
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:40,005
It is of top quality.

9
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:42,485
Back then,

10
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:44,084
when Father passed away,

11
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,485
the Su family sent an invaluable
Chicken-Blood Stone carving

12
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,724
as a funeral gift.

13
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:52,365
You were scared by its bright red color.

14
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,445
Since then,

15
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,244
you've disliked jade or gems.

16
00:00:57,564 --> 00:00:58,604
But today

17
00:00:59,845 --> 00:01:01,524
you seem alright.

18
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,285
I've lived in the estate
for so many years.

19
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:09,965
You have never come to visit.

20
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,325
So many years have passed.

21
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:15,325
People always change.

22
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:16,845
I was scared then.

23
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,485
But now,

24
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:20,244
what is there to be afraid of?

25
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:23,524
You have a point.

26
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:25,925
Your looks now

27
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,805
are also very different from before.

28
00:01:28,084 --> 00:01:28,965
If people didn't know,

29
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:31,684
how could they tell we are brothers?

30
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:37,164
You reminisce about the past.

31
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,084
What are you trying to say?

32
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:42,485
I just feel pity

33
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,765
that you were frail and ill.

34
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,485
And it has left a scar on your abdomen.

35
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:48,405
Now that you are of age to take a wife.

36
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:50,005
This old ailment

37
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,204
won't be a big problem?

38
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:55,285
Why?

39
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,164
Even I can't have a look?

40
00:01:59,084 --> 00:01:59,805
It's not that.

41
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,244
I can't trouble you.

42
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:02,524
I'll do it myself.

43
00:02:04,765 --> 00:02:05,564
Master Xianzong.

44
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:06,204
Master Yuyang.

45
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:07,684
There is a fire.

46
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:08,204
What?

47
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,204
Go have a look.

48
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:16,244
There is a fire.

49
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,564
Put out the fire.

50
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:21,885
What happened?

51
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:24,124
It's dry and easy to catch fire.

52
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,005
No one lives here.

53
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,084
Go put out the fire.

54
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:26,805
Are you okay?

55
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:27,724
I'm here.

56
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,765
Two cun above the navel.
An oblique scar one cun long.

57
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:31,885
An accidental fire?

58
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:33,204
Are you alright?

59
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:35,564
Be careful.

60
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:36,885
- Don't get hurt.
- Father.

61
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:37,405
Father.

62
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:38,845
- My betrothal letter and gifts.
- Careful.

63
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:39,405
Father.

64
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:39,965
What?

65
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:40,564
I'll go get it.

66
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:42,325
Yuyang.

67
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:51,845
Yuyang.

68
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,925
How did you get this scar?

69
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:55,885
I was plagued by illness.

70
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,405
A few years ago,

71
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:58,684
I fell at the estate.

72
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,805
Almost died with no one to save me.

73
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:04,325
Most of our family live
to a ripe old age.

74
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,244
It's okay for a man to have a few scars.

75
00:03:07,244 --> 00:03:08,485
I was thinking

76
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,524
that you've reached the age
to get married.

77
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,044
How about I...

78
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:12,845
Xianzong.

79
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:13,604
No need to worry.

80
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:16,644
I have my own plans.

81
00:03:21,965 --> 00:03:22,965
Thank you

82
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,684
for saving the betrothal letter.

83
00:03:26,524 --> 00:03:27,684
Marriage matters most.

84
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:28,885
You must be careful.

85
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:30,684
Before the wedding,

86
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,244
there must be no more mishaps.

87
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:34,965
I will heed Father's and

88
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:36,724
Uncle's teachings.

89
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:39,204
Boss

90
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,524
asked us to check the scars
on Cheng Yuyang.

91
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:43,365
That will bring troubles.

92
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,285
I'll handle it.

93
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,925
The maid who served tea said

94
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,965
two strange guests had arrived.

95
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:50,965
One of them has a scar on his face.

96
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,285
Lady boss.

97
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:56,485
You must leave.

98
00:03:56,485 --> 00:03:57,084
I'll handle it.

99
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,365
Go!

100
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:17,564
Offering gifts again?

101
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,244
I'm not to be in debt to others.

102
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:25,365
I saw some puffed-up,
lively little fish,

103
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,485
just like someone.

104
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,564
Thanks to you today.

105
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,005
Being afraid of fire,
yet you took a risk for me.

106
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:37,885
We are in mutual dependence.

107
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:38,805
I should have.

108
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:43,644
I didn't expect your father
to react so quickly.

109
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:46,244
Cheng Yuyang must have secrets
unknown to others.

110
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,765
My father sent me to the estate

111
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:50,965
and ignored me.

112
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:54,005
Every birthday and festival,

113
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,885
only my uncle would send me gifts.

114
00:04:56,925 --> 00:04:58,524
Although I seldom met him,

115
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:00,124
he was kind to others.

116
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:02,724
He always gave with care and
left something for me.

117
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:04,445
Even if he is gone,

118
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:06,005
his gifts remind me of him.

119
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:07,765
Then, in the future,

120
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:09,445
I must be

121
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:10,805
even better to you

122
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,684
to live up to the status of an uncle.

123
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:17,204
In fact, my uncle is only a few years
older than me.

124
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,925
He contracted a disease and
was sent to the estate as a child.

125
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,656
He rarely contacted people here.

126
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,204
I only remember

127
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:30,204
one year he sent his diary back here.

128
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,524
Afraid of the disease,
my father burned it.

129
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:33,644
Cheng Yuyang

130
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:34,885
was keeping a diary?

131
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,164
Last year, my uncle fell critically ill.

132
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,005
I was brought back for a few days

133
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,365
and almost died in a fire.

134
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,325
When I awoke,

135
00:05:47,285 --> 00:05:48,765
it was Lin Shaowen who had saved me.

136
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,044
Help.

137
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:08,644
But I didn't see his nature.

138
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,845
But why would Lin Shaowen save you?

139
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,044
Lin Shaowen often came to see
Cheng Qingyue.

140
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:15,765
It might have been a coincidence.

141
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:18,285
Or perhaps it was divine pity,

142
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,965
thinking that I shouldn't die.

143
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,044
I did ask him about it later.

144
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:31,564
He really did save me that year.

145
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,524
As for me,

146
00:06:34,325 --> 00:06:36,365
I am not the type to be ungrateful.

147
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:39,285
But you don't have to be that grateful.

148
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:44,524
You seem off.

149
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:47,644
Are you

150
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,644
jealous now?

151
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:50,485
Yes.

152
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:51,885
I love to be jealous.

153
00:06:56,805 --> 00:06:59,164
I hope that the water basin
in your room is not just

154
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:00,885
for fire prevention,

155
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:04,925
but also for happiness.

156
00:07:05,285 --> 00:07:06,044
I also hope

157
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:08,164
that you can forget
the past displeasures.

158
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,244
From now on,

159
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:10,724
no more fears.

160
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:27,925
(If)

161
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,765
(Lin Shaowen hadn't saved you,)

162
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,365
(would everything be different?)

163
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,564
(I thought that gratitude and grudges
would all end,)

164
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:37,765
(so I could die without fear.)

165
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,365
(But now, fear arises from love.)

166
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:42,644
(I'm afraid of dying,)

167
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,524
(but I'm even more afraid of
losing you.)

168
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:59,204
Shaowen was sincerely generous to you

169
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,365
and didn't mind the meager dowry.

170
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,925
If it were Qingyue to get married,

171
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,124
you would prepare a lavish dowry, right?

172
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:11,244
There is a set amount for dowries
for you two.

173
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:13,845
Why upset yourself?

174
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:17,444
Either way, I won't

175
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:19,364
die from upset.

176
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,124
Haven't I lived anyway?

177
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:25,965
Xinian.

178
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,925
I know you've been wronged these years.

179
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:34,444
When Qingyue's mother was alive,

180
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:36,845
she treated you badly.

181
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:41,765
I had my reasons.

182
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:52,765
This

183
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:57,364
is the hereditary jade bracelet
of our family.

184
00:08:58,805 --> 00:08:59,605
Originally,

185
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,444
it was the dowry for
the legitimate daughter.

186
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:05,645
Unexpectedly,

187
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,204
you'll get married first.

188
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,605
I just hope you can remember

189
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:20,044
that even if you are married,
