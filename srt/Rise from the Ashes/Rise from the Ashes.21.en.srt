(Love Unrequited)

3
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,030
Xianzong, what happened to Xinian?

4
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:30,229
Can't I call you home now
without using Xinian as a pretext?

5
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:34,709
I asked you to purchase goods from
Mingjiang earlier. Where did you go?

6
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,669
Of course I went to purchase goods.

7
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,749
Then did you hear about the Su family
in Mingjiang?

8
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,309
It's the Su family that was wiped out
ten years ago?

9
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:10,870
But you should have known
about it already, right?

10
00:01:13,669 --> 00:01:19,008
Xianzong, is there something wrong
with this tea?

11
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,430
Whether there is anything wrong
depends on the person drinking it.

12
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,309
Father. Qingyue is now insanely bent on
taking revenge on me,

13
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,430
not caring about our family.

14
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,629
Someone told her that our family
has old ties with the Su family.

15
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,589
So she slandered that Uncle
is Su Jingyuan,

16
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,189
forcing you to go against Uncle and me.

17
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,589
If Uncle really is Su Jingyuan,

18
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,749
would I betray
my imperial merchant husband

19
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:48,352
and be with the Su family's descendant?

20
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,749
She slandered me for having an affair

21
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,550
to force me to give up my title.

22
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,070
Who stands to benefit?
Father, you surely know.

23
00:01:58,669 --> 00:02:01,189
The reason why Qingyue
knows of Su Jingyuan

24
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:08,030
is that Uncle and I indeed
met Su Jingyuan at the estate.

25
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:12,229
What? You've met Su Jingyuan?

26
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:17,669
Yes, but Su Jingyuan is already dead.

27
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,709
He was killed accidentally by Uncle.

28
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:22,350
Cheng Xinian.

29
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,510
Su Jingyuan sneaked into the estate

30
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,229
to press Uncle about the extermination
of the Su family.

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,629
Uncle, fearing the involvement
of the Cheng family,

32
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,189
accidentally killed him and
buried him here.

33
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:48,189
Yuyang, Xinian, you must not
bring it up again in the future.

34
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,189
Whose corpse was that?

35
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,430
My man who was sent to investigate
on the day we met,

36
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,830
killed by Cheng Xianzong's men.

37
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,550
In Luoshi Pavilion, he practiced
martial arts the most diligently.

38
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:35,910
He always said when we all
had better days,

39
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,109
he would have the capping ceremony
and get married.

40
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,589
But he lost his life for me.

41
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:50,030
It's not your fault.
It's the sin my father committed.

42
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,830
As his child, I have no place
to persuade you.

43
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:57,589
You know it all?

44
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:03,149
It was about my father and
the extermination of the Su family.

45
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:07,789
Cheng Xianzong was the mastermind.

46
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,749
The Lin family had no idea
about Luoshi Pavilion at first.

47
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,990
Your father insisted on extinction.

48
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,309
This is the formula given
by Lin Shaowen as promised.

49
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,950
And embedded in this floral jasper
is my own saltpeter formula.

50
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,189
Originally, our future was in it.

51
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,109
It turns out that some things ultimately
cannot be completed by two people.

52
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:18,309
Meetings lead to partings.

53
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,990
This is as far as we can go.

54
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,229
Even if the world is cold and
people are cruel,

55
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,269
at least you have a home,
a place to return to.

56
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,309
I have no regrets about it.

57
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,830
Every one of your close relatives

58
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,669
was killed by random blades that night.

59
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,430
You have survived through
such difficult times.

60
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,229
Even if my father and I are not close,
he has given me my life.

61
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,070
I have partaken in benefits he reaped
through exploiting your family.

62
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,189
How can I face you in the future?

63
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,510
I remember our covenant.

64
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,789
I will carry things through.

65
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:28,229
Su Jingyuan.

66
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,910
You have never wronged me.

67
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,709
Nor have I ever been able to
let go of you.

68
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,470
Don't let it linger into sadness.
Forget about me.

69
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,229
Before we file the complaint,
keep an eye on the scar-faced man.

70
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,149
We will compel him to testify against
Cheng Xianzong to avenge the Su family.

71
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,350
Except the orders deliberately offered
to Lin Shaowen,

72
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,350
we've taken over the business
aimed at the Chengs.

73
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,390
Business restraint is temporary.

74
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,669
It's to distract them

75
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:41,870
and to buy time for reporting
to Yingtian Prefecture.

76
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,990
Boss, why didn't we stay
at Luoshi Pavilion these days?

77
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,390
Instead, we stayed at the estate.

78
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:49,589
They are suspicious of my identity.

79
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,990
If they couldn't find me,
it would be hard to explain.

80
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,470
It's better to stay at the estate,

81
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,550
so that they know where I am
but can't restrain me.

82
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,990
Then you and lady boss won't just...

83
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:09,550
As I say, her father's doing
has nothing to do with her.

84
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,350
As clever as she is,

85
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,830
sometimes thinking too much
actually prevents playing dumb.

86
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,030
Although our parents are long gone,

87
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,096
how can one articulate the feelings
between parents and children?

88
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,912
Indeed. After all, her life was given
by her father.

89
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,910
How can she just let go?

90
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,189
Leave me be for a while.

91
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,149
I didn't expect you to have such a side.

92
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,389
What's wrong?

93
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:06,784
The business you gave me
is under Cheng Yuyang's name, right?

94
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:08,870
It allowed me to turn things around.

95
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,710
So now we are in the same boat.

96
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,870
When our interests went against
each other, you treated me in that way.

97
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:22,910
Now that you've benefited,

98
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,469
you can speak with me amicably again.

99
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,469
You seem to have no feelings.

100
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,349
I know you've been lonely.

101
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,950
You took the favoritism your uncle
showed you as the only warmth.

102
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:39,950
But I can provide protection for you.

103
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,149
As long as you're willing,
I will not let you down.

104
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,990
I read the letters between
your father and Qingyue.

105
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,229
They still have doubts
about Cheng Yuyang's identity.

106
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,030
So who is he exactly?

107
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:04,469
Even today, my father still sees me
as an ungrateful person.

108
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,790
Xinian, you and I have had no hope of
inheriting family business since young,

109
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,509
subjected to much neglect and grievance.

110
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:18,830
We had to get used to it,
to see things clearly,

111
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,910
to value people by price,
and to put profit first.

112
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,030
But weighing of pros and cons
is not what I wish for.

113
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:27,070
I want to achieve true glory.

114
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,870
But if I have no plans,
I will have nothing at all.

115
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,750
I thought you would understand me
better than anyone else.

116
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:36,950
Don't lump me together with you.

117
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,670
You always pretend to be forced.

118
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:45,349
In business, as well as
in marriage and inheritance.

119
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,070
Why should I be considerate of you?

120
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,630
When I was truly considerate of you,
how did you treat me?

121
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,269
What do you mean by that?

122
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,549
Let go of me. You don't deserve to know.

123
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,349
You'll never see your beloved
Su Jingyuan.

124
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,509
I've given you my all.

125
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,469
But you can't be persuaded.
You just ignore it.

126
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,149
For him, you can act recklessly,
not considering consequences.

127
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,189
Have you fallen in love with him?

128
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,149
What does my business
have to do with you?

129
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,870
I am your husband after all.

130
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,088
You used to be so devoted to me.

131
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,070
Why has everything changed now?

132
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:39,910
When you adored me before,
were you also sincere like this?

133
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,830
If something happened to me,
would you also be so anxious?

134
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:50,790
