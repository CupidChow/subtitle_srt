I'm braver than you think.

Are you?

Even if I need to do more,

14

as long as I can achieve the goal.

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,556
I don't care about it.

16
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:11,010
If you have such determination,
it's good.

17
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:36,970
Have you ever heard the rumors

18
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,128
that your shrewd and calculating manner

19
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,329
is not the virtue a demure lady
should possess.

20
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,729
I've heard it. You just said it.

21
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,249
What virtues should a demure lady
have then?

22
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:56,050
With a pretty shell, sitting at home
and depleting wealth?

23
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,769
I earn my keep with hard work.

24
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,648
If you're envious,

25
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:05,169
then I wish you all the success
and fame.

26
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,090
How dare you say I'm good for nothing?

27
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,169
Is this the attitude you should have
towards me?

28
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,329
How could it be? You are
the Cheng family's legitimate daughter.

29
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,769
Talented men flock to you
as ducks to water.

30
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:17,169
Isn't it easy for you?

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,450
Even dyed, the inside of the saltpeter
is still dirty.

32
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,930
Isn't it?

33
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,570
Some people may wear gold and silver,
but their hearts are still dark.

34
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,169
What you are skilled at is nothing but
what boors do.

35
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,930
All my talents and grace as a lady,

36
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,370
which of these have I not mastered
through training?

37
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,528
Do I not want to learn,
or do you think I'm unworthy?

38
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,249
You know well.

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,689
Making fireworks is what we boors do.

40
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:56,329
Then why is your Shaowen so fascinated?

41
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:57,689
Even you, the legitimate daughter,

42
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,809
took credit you didn't deserve,
just to show off.

43
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,450
Do you think anyone would believe you?

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,329
Do you know what Lin Shaowen
is thinking?

45
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,169
He might not be as innocent
as he appears to be.

46
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,504
He's full of ambitions and aspirations,

47
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,480
yet can only hide behind
his elder brother.

48
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,890
What he truly wants

49
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,890
is probably more than just
the Lin family.

50
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,010
Can you handle it?

51
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,530
You don't need to pretend
to be his confidant.

52
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,850
If you act recklessly again,

53
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,530
Father will discipline you.

54
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,930
Fine. As long as you have
a clear conscience,

55
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,249
I would welcome punishment
of the heavens joyfully.

56
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,570
(To fulfill your wish,
meet me at Lou Wai Lou.)

57
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,329
Mr. Yuyang, what do you need?

58
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,809
If you don't know, why did you come
upon receiving the letter?

59
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,809
You are so smart.
There's no need for modesty.

60
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:29,329
Please.

61
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:31,410
Thank you.

62
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,370
This Dongbai from Yueyang
is a tribute tea over the years,

63
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,209
picked before Grain Rain
and considered top grade.

64
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,129
But how much difference can there be
before or after the rain?

65
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,744
Only a little over ten days ahead,

66
00:04:43,744 --> 00:04:45,284
but why can it be the tribute?

67
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,050
Yet the latter can only flow
into the common market.

68
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:54,329
What do you think of the reasoning
behind it?

69
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,769
The order of seniority is the nature.

70
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,530
How could it be changed by man's doing?

71
00:05:05,249 --> 00:05:07,289
It's common
that first come, first served.

72
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,809
But the latecomer can still lead.

73
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:17,090
If you could marry my niece,
with our two families joining forces

74
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,570
and the formula in your possession,

75
00:05:20,329 --> 00:05:22,010
you'll get the imperial merchant status.

76
00:05:22,609 --> 00:05:25,289
As for your elder brother,
there's no need to mention.

77
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,970
Formula? I don't understand
what you're talking about.

78
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:39,769
Why must a clever man speak
so obliquely?

79
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,769
If you offer the formula
as a betrothal gift,

80
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,209
I guarantee you will get
everything you desire.

81
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,249
I truly don't understand.

82
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,769
If that's the case, consider it
a wasted effort on my part.

83
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:01,890
Please wait.

84
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,090
There are things I am unaware of.

85
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,370
Some matters are not within my control.

86
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:25,209
But I'd like to know, which lady
are we talking about?

87
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:29,010
Naturally, it's with the one
you have an affection for.

88
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,729
If you don't sleep now, it will be dawn.

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,570
Tomorrow's trial must go smooth.

90
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,329
What did Lin Shaowen say?

91
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,209
If he wants you to marry him, he must
give us the formula as a betrothal gift.

92
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,129
I only asked you to feel out
his intentions.

93
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,689
I didn't say to deal with him
face to face so soon.

94
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,209
You certainly know how to use me
to your advantage.

95
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,570
Changed my mind at the last minute.
You regret it?

96
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,209
It's just that I didn't expect him
to agree so readily.

97
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,570
Really didn't expect myself
to be valued so highly.

98
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:32,850
I guess he only knows of the existence
of the original formula.

99
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,410
But he has no idea where it is hidden.

100
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,129
Of course.
He's never been regarded as the heir.

101
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,890
It's just like your relationship
with Cheng Qingyue?

102
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:47,010
She's just a young girl kept sheltered.

103
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,168
Once she heard that revealing to help
Lin Shaowen seize the family wealth

104
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,890
would make him utterly devoted to her,
she became impatient.

105
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,090
What's left for reason or strategy?

106
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,530
But how do you know Lin Shaowen so well?

107
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,209
For years, he's been devoted to studies.

108
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,169
He helped with the accounts due to
his father's and brother's entrusting.

109
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,209
The Lin brothers seem to be friendly,
respectful, and the most inseparable.

110
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:16,810
Without deep-seated affection,
there is no deep-rooted hatred.

111
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,690
