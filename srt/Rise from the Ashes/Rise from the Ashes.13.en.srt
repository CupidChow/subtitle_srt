(Blessing or Curse)

3
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,291
You seem very pleased.

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,010
Not at all.

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,010
I thought you would not harm me.

6
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,130
I didn't expect you to be untrustworthy.

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,170
Uncle.

8
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,090
I was wrong.

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,811
What?

10
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,490
I was wrong.

11
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,010
Then swear there won't be a next time.

12
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:03,371
There can be no next time.

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,050
But you have to tell me.

14
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,090
Before they came in,

15
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,530
what happened between us?

16
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,490
Then I assure you there won't

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:12,891
be a next time.

18
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,371
Today you've taken advantage of me.

19
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:23,170
I can't

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,931
just let it go.

21
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,090
That was just the effect of the drug.

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,970
If I made a mistake,

23
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,931
you were responsible too.

24
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,650
Each gets fifty hits.

25
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,411
You want to get even with me?

26
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,691
It's not that easy.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,530
Then what do you want?

28
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,970
How do you want me
to take responsibility?

29
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:44,450
I am a straightforward person.

30
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,530
Since you started it,

31
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,931
you have to see it through.

32
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:51,450
That's hard to say.

33
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:53,851
What if a charming man
falls in love with me?

34
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,090
You dare?

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,371
Don't even think about it.

36
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,691
Xinian.

37
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:11,970
Xinian.

38
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,811
Xinian.

39
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,970
May I have a word with you?

40
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll have a word with Xinian.

41
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,170
Mr. Yuyang, you don't have to follow.

42
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,211
Uncle is not an outsider.

43
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:35,650
He was also involved.

44
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,931
Shouldn't the three of us
clarify things?

45
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,130
Xinian.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,411
I'm not here to ask about the incident.

47
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,490
The rumors between you and Mr. Yuyang
are baseless.

48
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,331
I've trusted you all along.

49
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,450
Let me wipe it.

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,891
Don't touch me. I can do it myself.

51
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,650
Nothing happened between us.

52
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:04,530
You were meeting him in private here.

53
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,130
Shameless.

54
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,411
What are you talking about?

55
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,411
Xinian is deeply in love with you.

56
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:15,130
She would never be so foolish.

57
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,970
You framed me.

58
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,891
You have committed such indecency.

59
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,130
Qingyue kindly persuaded.

60
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,771
How dare you blame her?

61
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,970
Cheng Xinian.

62
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:31,130
I did not expect you to be so cheap.

63
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,450
Marrying you

64
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,050
is the greatest regret of my life.

65
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,771
Uncle.

66
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,090
Beat him up.

67
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,450
That's enough.

68
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:04,891
What are you doing?

69
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,691
This bit of grievance

70
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,771
is nothing compared to me
being dishonored.

71
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,050
Just now, I thought you would be
on my side.

72
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:18,490
Now you remember that I can
do fireworks,

73
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,931
so you've seen through it.

74
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,891
You don't trust me at all.

75
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,610
You only think of the benefits.

76
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,731
Xinian.

77
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,050
I know it's not easy for you.

78
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:27,530
I've never doubted you.

79
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:29,050
I want to take care of you.

80
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,731
But you always distrust me.

81
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:32,610
Do you know how my uncle treats me?

82
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,891
True trust is in

83
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,970
the heart and actions, not in words.

84
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,170
I've been alone and helpless
since childhood.

85
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,650
Only my uncle has shown me care
and goodwill.

86
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,450
Today I was framed up.

87
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,450
You suspected me.

88
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,450
I vented my anger.

89
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,331
From now on, we'll part ways,

90
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,090
as if we never knew each other.

91
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,891
Xinian.

92
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,130
How could I not understand you?

93
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,970
I just don't know how to express
my feelings.

94
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,450
When I go home,

95
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,411
I will immediately beseech my father

96
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,211
to make the marriage proposal.

97
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,291
I have never doubted you.

98
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:09,811
Please rest assured.

99
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,691
In my heart,

100
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,891
there's always only been you.

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,170
Then let's do as we agreed.

102
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,170
The formula is a betrothal gift.

103
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:20,851
As for the marriage,

104
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,130
naturally, I will agree.

105
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,891
You can rest assured.

106
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,371
Qingyue.

107
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,530
Calm down a bit. Don't hurt yourself.

108
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,010
Father.

109
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,211
Since childhood,

110
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,170
I've keenly remembered your words
to be talented and virtuous,

111
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,570
all wishing to satisfy you

112
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,050
and to be liked by everyone.

113
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,811
All of a sudden,

114
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,570
everyone loves her,

115
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,610
trusts her,

116
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,450
and favors her!

117
00:05:58,211 --> 00:05:59,731
Why is that, Father?

118
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,090
You once told me

119
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,130
that Lin Shaowen only had me
in his heart,

120
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:11,771
and the legitimate daughter
of our family must also be me.

121
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,570
But now, everything has changed.

122
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,371
Changed.

123
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:17,211
- Child.
- What should I do in the future?

124
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,811
Everything I've done

125
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,771
has been in vain.

126
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
What's the point of living?

127
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,291
Don't talk like that, Qingyue.

128
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,570
The elders of the Lin family care most
about the identity.

129
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,331
I will talk to them personally.

130
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:31,851
They will surely change their minds.

131
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,610
The Cheng family

132
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,450
and the Lin family.

133
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,251
I promise you that they're all yours.

134
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,291
Definitely all yours.

135
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,931
She's not Cheng Xinian.

136
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:43,090
She must have been possessed
by an evil spirit.

137
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:43,931
Evil spirit.

138
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,970
Cheng Xinian is an evil spirit.

139
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,411
What are you talking about?

140
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,650
Don't scare me.

141
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,731
I'm afraid.

142
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,331
Don't be afraid.

143
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,490
Lin Shaowen wants all the benefits.

144
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,691
It's hardest to make him favor one.

145
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,170
With such determination,

146
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:08,691
he won't change easily.

147
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,010
If my father

148
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,891
even has the slightest
expectation of me,

149
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,970
it might be more advantageous.

150
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:19,371
If he could remember

151
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,530
I am also his...

152
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:33,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

153
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,771
Actually,

154
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,811
you still have expectations of him.

155
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,291
You hope that he can also

156
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,411
be a good father to you for once.
