(Unexpected Feelings)

3
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:22,395
Put it there.

4
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:23,554
Look.

5
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:24,835
The Luoshi Pavilion.

6
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:25,435
Boss is back.

7
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:26,432
- Boss.
- Boss.

8
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:27,904
Lady boss.

9
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:30,194
- Boss.
- Who is your lady boss?

10
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:32,715
I just know to call you lady boss.

11
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:33,514
I know nothing else.

12
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:35,034
Lady boss.

13
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:36,235
Please sit.

14
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:38,194
- Okay.
- Come.

15
00:00:38,194 --> 00:00:39,355
It's your first time here?

16
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:41,248
Please.

17
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:45,216
Come on.

18
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:46,875
Guys.

19
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,715
- The lady boss. Greetings.
- See?

20
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,474
It's all for you.

21
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,634
Nice meeting you.

22
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:51,744
Sit.

23
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:54,074
Take a sit.

24
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,634
Come on.
Bring her favorite grapes.

25
00:00:58,875 --> 00:00:59,715
Lady boss.

26
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,034
Here. The grapes.

27
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:02,835
These are tasty.

28
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:05,994
These must be delicious.

29
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:09,395
Ever since our boss took over
Luoshi Pavilion,

30
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:10,875
he's with a girl for the first time.

31
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,795
It's been almost ten years.

32
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:13,674
I've never seen

33
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:14,674
him bringing a woman

34
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:15,994
alive back before.

35
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:18,435
Eat this.

36
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:25,154
It's our first meeting.

37
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:26,955
A toast to our lady boss.

38
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:27,474
Cheers.

39
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:36,554
Come on, eat.

40
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,674
You've drunk so much.

41
00:01:37,674 --> 00:01:38,474
Exactly.

42
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,235
Guys.

43
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,715
Who will make another toast?

44
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:43,994
Right, let's toast to lady boss.

45
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:45,674
Come on, a toast to lady boss.

46
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,915
Come on.

47
00:01:47,915 --> 00:01:48,795
Try harder.

48
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:50,114
Come on.

49
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:50,674
Almost there.

50
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:51,915
Over the years,

51
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:54,154
you've been planning so much.

52
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:56,395
The Lin's is the imperial merchant.

53
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:59,154
It's really difficult to bring them
to justice.

54
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,395
Fortunately,

55
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:03,835
you have their company.

56
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,315
They are orphans just like me.

57
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:10,755
We wandered everywhere and met.

58
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,674
Rootless

59
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:13,994
with no attachments,

60
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:15,875
yet we are like brothers.

61
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,275
You are the only son of the Sus.

62
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,395
With a wealthy and flourishing family,
you must

63
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:22,835
have lived happily.

64
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:24,795
After your family was ruined,

65
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,235
you were alone and helpless.

66
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:28,554
How could it

67
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:30,634
be easy?

68
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,194
Compared to never having had happiness,

69
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,594
having it and then mercilessly
robbed of it

70
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,235
is even more cruel.

71
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:43,315
All that's past now.

72
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:48,835
After settling this,

73
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:50,994
what do you want to do?

74
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,235
I want to take care of the brothers
at Luoshi Pavilion,

75
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:58,395
revitalize my family,

76
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,835
and make the best fireworks once again.

77
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,114
And you?

78
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,034
I...

79
00:03:11,114 --> 00:03:12,875
I have never dared to hope for a future.

80
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,074
Why would you think so?

81
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:17,755
Do you believe in

82
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,994
past and present lives,

83
00:03:19,474 --> 00:03:20,674
and karma?

84
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,634
I tend to believe in instant karma.

85
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:26,715
Neither love nor hatred lasts overnight.

86
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,514
I had a very long dream.

87
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:33,994
In that dream,

88
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:36,915
I loved the wrong person.

89
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:43,235
(I willingly stood behind him,)

90
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,074
(plotting everything for him)

91
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:48,435
(and giving him my all.)

92
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:55,435
(In the end,)

93
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,034
time and time again,

94
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,994
he burned through my heart.

95
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:08,554
He cursed me to never meet a good end.

96
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:12,634
(- A great fire...)
- Why?

97
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:15,994
(A great fire burned away all
my persistent obsession with him)

98
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:18,994
and completely awakened me.

99
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,114
I want him to know how it feels

100
00:04:24,154 --> 00:04:25,194
to shed all tears,

101
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:27,915
with only the taste of blood left.

102
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,514
How is this not karmic retribution?

103
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:40,554
Don't think about it anymore.

104
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:46,474
You just have to believe

105
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:48,634
that with me,

106
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:50,194
there will be a future.

107
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:52,355
In the future,

108
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:55,074
you don't need to shed tears.

109
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:57,194
Only laughter.

110
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,755
Only the future.

111
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,915
If there could be a future,

112
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:15,835
I want to make

113
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:18,955
the fireworks that carry my name,

114
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,994
to give the other half of the jasper

115
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:25,755
to a good person,

116
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:28,634
and to have

117
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:30,715
a small home

118
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,915
that shelters from the wind and rain.

119
00:05:35,315 --> 00:05:36,755
I want to have my own children,

120
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:39,915
aging happily

121
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,795
and ordinarily.

122
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:44,275
Good.

123
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,435
Shaowen.

124
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,194
Shaoye.

125
00:05:58,194 --> 00:05:59,634
The clan elders have decided

126
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:01,755
you don't have to deal with

127
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,074
future business.

128
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:06,235
Shaoye.

129
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,074
If it's because of recent ledger issues,

130
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,315
I can come forward to explain.

131
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,194
Shaowen.

132
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:12,395
Your ambition lied in
the official career.

133
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,395
Now,

134
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,514
why are you thinking about business?

135
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,994
No. It happened too suddenly.

136
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,554
Did I do something wrong

137
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,674
that displeased the clan elders and you?

138
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,474
Shaowen.

139
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,235
Focus on your imperial exams.

140
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:28,114
About business,

141
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:29,755
you don't need to worry.

142
00:06:38,755 --> 00:06:40,875
Most of Lin's shops are in the name
of Lin Shaoye.

143
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:42,474
But he is not good at it.

144
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,395
In reality, the accounts are handled
by Lin Shaowen.

145
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:46,154
Presumably,

146
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:48,114
before the imperial merchant selection,

147
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,755
Lin Shaowen has plans

148
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:50,715
to fool Lin Shaoye.

149
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,074
So he can pull things back
from the brink.

150
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,355
Given this,

151
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:56,074
we'll sabotage his plans.

152
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:57,355
Boss.

153
00:06:57,715 --> 00:06:59,514
You seem to really dislike Lin Shaowen.

154
00:07:00,194 --> 00:07:01,355
Such kind of man is

155
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,315
not worth being liked.

156
00:07:03,235 --> 00:07:03,994
It's nonsense.

157
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,275
Boss.

158
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:06,634
Whom to like?

159
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,355
What nonsense?

160
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,795
Collect more of their weaknesses.

161
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,235
Take action against the Lin's business.

162
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:15,715
Make it difficult for them to recover.

163
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:18,235
But you said before

164
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,795
that due to the discord between
Cheng brothers,

165
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:21,755
put the plan on hold,

166
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,395
and deliver them a blow on

167
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,514
imperial merchant selection.

168
00:07:25,355 --> 00:07:26,315
She was so heartbroken.

169
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:27,955
I can't wait anymore.

170
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:29,835
You do this

171
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:31,674
for lady boss?

172
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,795
It's just moving the plan forward.

173
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:37,875
Any progress with the Cheng family?

174
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,235
The Chengs and the Lins thrived
simultaneously.

175
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:41,355
But now,

176
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:42,355
thanks to the lady boss,

177
00:07:42,674 --> 00:07:44,674
fireworks are the Cheng's most
profitable business.

178
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:46,194
Yet, before Cheng Xianzong,

179
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:48,594
his family had never
dealt with fireworks.

180
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:49,554
Keep digging.

181
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:54,634
As for that Lianxin,
ask our men to take care of her

182
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:56,835
and make arrangements for her.

183
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:58,355
Okay.

184
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,034
We won't worry lady boss.

185
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:54,354
If you take my testimony as favoritism,

186
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,555
I will admit it. So what?

187
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:00,994
If it's what

188
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:02,755
my heart's desire,

189
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:06,354
then,

190
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:07,994
being controlled

191
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:10,994
isn't necessarily a bad thing, right?

192
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:31,114
