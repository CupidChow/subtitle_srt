00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,216
=Rise From the Ashes=

2
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:16,603
=Episode 2=
(New Lease on Life)

3
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:20,733
Come out.

4
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:37,413
To impersonate my uncle,

5
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,212
only I can help you.

6
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,333
You inquired about
the Sus' extermination.

7
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:45,652
Presumably

8
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:47,733
you have a connection with them.

9
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:50,052
He died.

10
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:51,813
You were not shocked.

11
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,092
(You even put on his clothes.)

12
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:55,413
(Everyone knows)

13
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,733
(Cheng Yuyang was sickly and
never met anyone.)

14
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,012
You've always wanted

15
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:03,012
to take his place.

16
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:06,092
Who are you?

17
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:08,172
Why should I believe you?

18
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:12,692
The Chengs' illegitimate daughter.

19
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,532
Cheng Xinian.

20
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,853
I have lived on his estate
for five years.

21
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,532
If I say you are my uncle,

22
00:01:22,092 --> 00:01:23,453
no one will suspect.

23
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,253
By helping me,

24
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,212
what is your purpose?

25
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,333
If an illegitimate daughter wants to
secure her footing,

26
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:35,612
she needs the help of her elders.

27
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,813
Isn't it good to each take what we need?

28
00:01:38,052 --> 00:01:38,848
My

29
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:39,893
dear

30
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:41,172
uncle?

31
00:01:57,973 --> 00:01:59,132
So you are also afraid.

32
00:02:01,293 --> 00:02:03,012
You were imposing and elusive
as a spirit.

33
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:03,973
Of course I am afraid.

34
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,253
You do not seem like a typical maiden.

35
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,413
Sharp-tongued.

36
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:10,413
You had time to watch me change clothes.

37
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,492
Why didn't you escape?

38
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,773
What do you think of a maiden?

39
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:21,733
It's useless to wipe.

40
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:23,492
Press down hard.

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,813
Since we are to be allies,

42
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:31,413
I should know

43
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:32,453
your name.

44
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:36,052
Su Jingyuan.

45
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:40,012
It's on fire!

46
00:02:41,853 --> 00:02:42,624
Leave.

47
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:44,973
Leave quickly.

48
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:48,773
Fire...

49
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:00,893
I hurt you just now.

50
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:01,973
We are even.

51
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:03,813
You look quite clever.

52
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,733
Why didn't you run from the fire?

53
00:03:06,172 --> 00:03:07,733
And you still want to cover for me?

54
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:09,012
I can.

55
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:10,333
It's just...

56
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,012
I was once trapped in a fire
and almost died.

57
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:14,612
That left me with a fear of fire.

58
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:16,652
It's irrelevant to our plans.

59
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:17,733
If you say so.

60
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:19,333
I saved your life.

61
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,612
Do your job well.

62
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:22,853
Next time if you don't run,

63
00:03:23,172 --> 00:03:23,733
I won't care.

64
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,733
I'm self-aware.

65
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,012
Let's keep safe.

66
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:30,572
Sir.

67
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,413
(Maid, Lianxin)
She set the fire.

68
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:33,612
Lianxin?

69
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:34,733
Do you know her?

70
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:37,172
You don't know it.

71
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:40,293
She is an uncommon maid by my side.

72
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:42,172
Lianxin.

73
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:43,532
In this lifetime,

74
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:47,813
the only person I trust is you.

75
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,293
Why did you betray me?

76
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,773
I've had enough of your hypocrisy
over the years.

77
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:55,893
Even your father and your husband
hate you.

78
00:03:56,413 --> 00:03:57,413
You deserve

79
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,212
what you got.

80
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,132
You set a fire deliberately

81
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,532
and betrayed your master.

82
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,733
Better to kill you outright.

83
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:11,293
That would be too easy for her.

84
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:16,532
Miss Xinian.

85
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,893
So it turns out that from this moment,

86
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:21,373
you've been wanting to kill me.

87
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:23,853
I've always been loyal to you.

88
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:26,052
So loyal you are.

89
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,893
Small acts yield thanks,
but large ones, grudges.

90
00:04:29,572 --> 00:04:32,092
It's ridiculous that I used to
regard you as close as a sister.

91
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,813
You feigned loyalty

92
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,253
just for more benefits

93
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,492
and more advantages.

94
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,453
Miss Xinian.

95
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:43,492
From the beginning, you have been
with Cheng Qingyue.

96
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:45,973
Why did she put you by my side?

97
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:48,012
What does she really want?

98
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,733
Miss Xinian, I really don't know.

99
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,253
I've tasted excruciating agony.

100
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,293
I don't mind letting you try it.

101
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,733
Miss Qingyue threatened me
with my deed of sale.

102
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:01,333
She wants you to stay here forever,

103
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:01,933
just in case

104
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,893
that Mr. Lin Shaowen develops
feelings for you.

105
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,012
I'll spare your life.

106
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:17,212
But from now on,

107
00:05:17,572 --> 00:05:18,933
you'll have to work for me.

108
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:21,293
Although I don't hold your deed of sale,

109
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,612
I could still take your life

110
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,652
and your young brother's.

111
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,773
I'm willing to follow your orders.

112
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:31,453
Get lost.

113
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:37,733
(Cheng Qingyue, wait for me.)

114
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,373
(I will repay you double in the future.)

115
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,453
(We'll return to the mansion
due to the fire.)

116
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:43,773
(You can get revenge.)

117
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,773
(And I can find some evidence.)

118
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,933
Why keep such a rat around?

119
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:51,692
It's most useful to keep a person
who is afraid of death.

120
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,172
Perhaps later,

121
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,813
I could give a fatal blow to the enemy.

122
00:05:55,893 --> 00:05:57,413
If she can betray her master today,

123
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,572
she could also betray you in the future.

124
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:00,813
What's the fear for?

125
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:02,973
She already took you for Cheng Yuyang.

126
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:04,532
Even if she betrays,

127
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,012
it would only confirm your identity.

128
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,333
Either way, you don't lose.

129
00:06:08,212 --> 00:06:10,092
Consider it my sincerity of alliance
with you,

130
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:11,692
Uncle.

131
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,692
Then I need to thank you.

132
00:06:14,813 --> 00:06:16,492
You've already seen my sincerity.

133
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,413
When I need your help,

134
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:19,853
I hope you won't hesitate.

135
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:21,212
Otherwise,

136
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,813
just as I can lie for you,

137
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,933
I could also expose you.

138
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:27,612
Is that so?

139
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:30,293
Anyway, Lianxin has already
gone back to report.

140
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:32,212
Even if you want to kill me now,

141
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:33,572
it's too late.

142
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,052
You're quite clever.

143
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,652
Lianxin

144
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,132
is not just my witness,

145
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:38,973
but yours too.

146
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,012
Instead of contending with me,

147
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,572
you might as well join me in
learning more about my real uncle

148
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,132
to avoid being exposed in the future.

149
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:49,293
Originally, the plan worked.

150
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,052
But Miss Xinian was saved
by Master Yuyang.

151
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,612
To avoid exposure,

152
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,692
I had to rush back to report.

153
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:56,692
Trash.

154
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:58,453
Keep an eye on her.

155
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:00,572
(Eldest daughter, Cheng Qingyue)
Shut your mouth.

156
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:01,973
Only then can you save your life.

157
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:05,984
(Cheng's Mansion)

158
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:20,973
(The scores must be settled)

159
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,212
(one by one.)

160
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,132
Such twin lotuses are really rare.

161
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,973
A single stalk with twin flowers

162
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,172
snuggling up.

163
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:35,532
Alas, the blooming period is ending.

164
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:37,293
One must perish

165
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,773
in exchange for sustaining

166
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,532
the other one.

167
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,172
Xinian.

168
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:49,893
I know that you've cared about Shaowen
the most since childhood.

169
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,532
If you truly love him,

170
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,652
I'm willing to never see him again.

171
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,413
Rather than fighting endlessly

172
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,212
with sorrow and misery,

173
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:01,413
better to become flowing water,

174
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,373
delighting in freedom.

175
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,253
Xinian.

176
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:07,453
Why are you suddenly like this?

177
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,092
Miss Qingyue threatened me
with my deed of sale.

178
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:13,212
She wants you to stay here forever,

179
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,333
just in case

180
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,853
that Mr. Lin Shaowen develops
feelings for you.

181
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:20,613
If you like Lin Shaowen,
then you can have him.

182
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,252
I will not compete with you.

183
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:24,212
But for your own selfish desires,

184
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:26,292
you would murder someone.

185
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:29,332
You know that I care about you the most.

186
00:08:30,372 --> 00:08:32,052
Why would you think of me this way?

187
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:35,332
Xinian.

188
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,412
