Rest assured.

7
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:36,963
We've always been on the same side.

8
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:49,363
Xinian.

9
00:01:03,883 --> 00:01:04,602
Xinian.

10
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,002
The design drawing,

11
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,602
I've never seen it before

12
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:08,602
or conceived of it.

13
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,443
The world's fire-making craftsmen

14
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,843
are not even close to your
brilliant talent.

15
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,363
Collaborating with us, you'll certainly
shine brightly.

16
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,482
Please take your empty promises

17
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:21,723
and leave.

18
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:29,843
Xinian.

19
00:01:30,642 --> 00:01:31,323
Xinian.

20
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:33,283
What on earth has happened to you?

21
00:01:33,283 --> 00:01:34,883
What have I actually done

22
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:36,763
that makes you despise me so?

23
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,202
I thought you hit me

24
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,602
due to my manners last time.

25
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:41,243
You made me bow at my home,

26
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,162
even without reason,
but I followed through.

27
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,283
So what exactly did I do wrong

28
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:46,562
to make you so displeased?

29
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,803
The accounts are perfectly settled.

30
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,082
I never knew before

31
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:55,202
that you could manage accounts and
the household.

32
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:57,202
Trivial matters

33
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:58,883
only amused you.

34
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,243
What's trivial to you

35
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:02,923
are actually

36
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,883
quite special to many women.

37
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:14,243
You actually achieved it.

38
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:16,042
It really had to be you.

39
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:18,443
What you desire,

40
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:20,482
I will surely accomplish it for you.

41
00:02:21,763 --> 00:02:22,763
Having you

42
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,082
is enough for my life.

43
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:32,562
Where is the formula?

44
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,363
It's here.

45
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:34,562
Where is it?

46
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,562
Don't you feel the slightest bit
of pity for me?

47
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,723
Aside from being Mrs. Lin,

48
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:43,763
I've long since had no other status
of my own.

49
00:02:45,403 --> 00:02:46,883
With the title of imperial merchant,

50
00:02:47,283 --> 00:02:48,403
I won't divorce you.

51
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:51,642
But you must hand over all
the firework formulas.

52
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:52,923
Why?

53
00:02:53,763 --> 00:02:55,243
Even my last bit of usefulness

54
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:56,803
must be exploited by you?

55
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,482
The one who used the marriage and
the business

56
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:01,883
to control and threaten me

57
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:02,723
was you.

58
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:04,642
I was willing to give everything.

59
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,682
You call this controlling
and threatening

60
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:07,723
instead of love?

61
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:12,576
Love?

62
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:15,482
You used the fireworks formula
to control and blackmail me.

63
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:16,403
I detest it utterly.

64
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:19,042
I got what you threw and
gave what you took.

65
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,042
I was totally blind.

66
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:25,162
You'll never get what you want
in this lifetime.

67
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:30,763
From the start,

68
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,923
you've done it all willingly.

69
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,202
I have never forced you.

70
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,682
- (All sweet talk, full of deceit.)
- Xinian.

71
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:41,403
Tell me.

72
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:42,562
I'll make amends.

73
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,602
Is that so?

74
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,803
You'll make amends?

75
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:49,602
Of course.

76
00:03:50,002 --> 00:03:51,122
Shaowen.

77
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:53,883
Qingyue.

78
00:03:55,963 --> 00:03:56,843
Shaowen.

79
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,443
Why are you here?

80
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:02,522
I am feeling unwell today.

81
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,243
Qingyue.

82
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,642
You've been in poor health.

83
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:08,883
The wind is chilly.

84
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:09,923
You must take care.

85
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:11,723
Shaowen.

86
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:14,363
I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

87
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:15,763
Qingyue.

88
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:17,443
Qingyue.

89
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:19,323
Xinian.

90
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:20,883
Qingyue suddenly feels unwell.

91
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,082
I will take her to the doctor.

92
00:04:22,243 --> 00:04:23,443
About making amends,

93
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:24,323
I'll come back later.

94
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:25,696
Let's go.

95
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:27,923
Are you okay?

96
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:28,562
I'm fine.

97
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,443
Take it slow.

98
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:33,723
Qingyue.

99
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,082
Why come out when it's so windy?

100
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:38,283
Have some rest when the weather is bad.

101
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:51,363
Does it hurt?

102
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:52,763
It's fine.

103
00:04:57,482 --> 00:04:58,522
Why block with your hand?

104
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,323
You have iron-made palms?

105
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,042
It's nothing to me.

106
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,923
But even if you stabbed him,

107
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,883
you could merely scratch him.
What's the use?

108
00:05:06,482 --> 00:05:08,283
Looking at that despicable man

109
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,763
wavering all the way

110
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,283
infuriated me to no end.

111
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:15,723
If you hate him,

112
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,122
your hit must count.

113
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:19,963
Don't do something foolish on impulse.

114
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,763
You've been enduring hardships for long.

115
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:23,443
Yet you still rely on me, after all.

116
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:26,682
If you really think so,

117
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,323
I have nothing to say.

118
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,562
You have masters of various skills.

119
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:39,323
Destroying the Lin family would be
all too easy.

120
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,642
But to overturn the case,

121
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,162
you need evidence.

122
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,642
You can't let the Su family end up being
known as

123
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,682
a family slaughtered

124
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:47,482
by bandits.

125
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:48,883
You must give the Su family

126
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:50,883
complete and total justice,

127
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,803
and pass down

128
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,122
the gunpowder skills.

129
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:02,522
I spared your life.

130
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,243
But don't repay me with it.

131
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,403
No matter your resentments,

132
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,202
you shouldn't risk yourself

133
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,162
to take revenge.

134
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,843
That would be too easy for them

135
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,042
to atone for their sins.

136
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:17,122
Qingyue and my father want me
to marry into the Lin family,

137
00:06:17,723 --> 00:06:19,162
so they could take advantage.

138
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,002
I will marry Lin Shaowen,

139
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,562
and make them crumble from the inside.

140
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,243
If you take such a risk,

141
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:29,803
how will you retreat intact later?

142
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:31,923
That will depend on my abilities.

143
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,002
Becoming his wife

144
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:36,482
will make it easier to get
the original formula.

145
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,082
It's all pros for you.

146
00:06:39,522 --> 00:06:40,803
What are you dissatisfied about?

147
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:44,002
I am satisfied surely.

148
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:56,243
Shaowen.

149
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:00,883
You were determined to persuade Father
to cooperate with the Cheng family.

150
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,283
(Eldest son, Lin Shaoye)
Now it's the delivery date.

151
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:04,602
Where's the goods?

152
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:08,283
The Cheng family didn't
accomplish anything.

153
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,843
My sister let her emotions interfere and
caused a delay.

154
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,162
I won't stand by and do nothing.

155
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:30,723
Qingyue.

156
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:32,162
What is the fuse?

157
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:35,682
The fuse

158
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:36,202
naturally...

159
00:07:36,202 --> 00:07:37,642
The fuse naturally is there.

160
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:46,803
In the past, an exposed fuse was not
very aesthetic.

161
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,323
I tried to conceal it within the casing

162
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:50,883
to make it look more like a whole.

163
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:56,323
Well, others' fireworks
use cotton thread as a fuse.

164
00:07:56,562 --> 00:07:57,803
Yours

165
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,243
is green, huh?

166
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,403
It's naturally Qingyue's doing

167
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:05,803
with great care.

168
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,602
It's not a big deal.

169
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,403
It's just a different color. That's all.

170
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,602
The ordinary fuse

171
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:14,723
is made of cotton thread
soaked in kerosene.

172
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,082
While yours is made with hemp rope

173
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,643
wrapped with saltpeter powder.

174
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:22,002
I didn't expect you to know so much.

175
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,483
Wrapping with oil paper can reduce
dampness and misfires.

176
00:08:25,763 --> 00:08:27,923
It also prevents spillages during
transportation.

177
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:29,763
It's more appropriate and worry-free.

178
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:33,402
(So it turns out Xinian made
these fireworks.)

179
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:34,883
That's very good.

180
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:37,723
Tomorrow is the Flower Festival.

181
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,723
We will try setting off fireworks,

182
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:41,362
with beauties accompanying us.

183
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,963
We aim for both cooperation and
marriage alliance.

184
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:46,723
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

185
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:52,763
Xinian, would you like to join me
tomorrow?

186
00:08:57,563 --> 00:08:58,683
I have no other intentions.

187
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:01,122
I just want to exchange ideas with you

188
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,002
about fireworks.

189
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,162
Sure.

190
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,643
People often get engaged
on Flower Festival.

191
00:09:09,202 --> 00:09:10,282
Such a beautiful scenery.

192
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:11,883
How can we miss it?

193
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:13,763
Good.

194
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:25,603
Cheng Qingyue does have some skills.

195
00:09:27,122 --> 00:09:29,603
You don't really believe
Cheng Xinian's nonsense,

196
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,803
thinking that she made them?

197
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:32,843
That was because her sister
felt for her.

198
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,723
But she lost sense of proportion.

199
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,442
I used to think that the Cheng family
was of low status,

200
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:41,002
unworthy of us.

201
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:42,883
Now it seems

202
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:44,483
it's not like that.

203
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:48,002
So you mean...

204
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,843
I am to inherit the family business.

205
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,963
This Cheng Qingyue

206
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,322
could be my virtuous wife.

207
00:09:56,723 --> 00:09:57,723
But if you say it,

208
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,603
I won't compete with you.

209
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:01,322
Shaowen.

210
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:02,763
You must think it over.

211
00:10:03,643 --> 00:10:04,402
I dare not.

212
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:17,963
For what happened today,

213
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,883
Lin Shaoye must think
my good-for-nothing sister

214
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:22,483
was the one who had made the fuse.

215
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:27,122
He might be thinking of competing with
Lin Shaowen for Cheng Qingyue.

216
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:32,402
You might as well sound out
Lin Shaowen's intentions

217
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:35,082
to facilitate the smooth progress
of our plan.

218
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:38,843
If you want me to.

219
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:40,202
Uncle.

220
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:44,122
I am getting increasingly
close to Lin Shaowen.

221
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,923
You should be happy.

222
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:51,042
Why do you seem not very pleased now?

223
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,442
You want to entice Lin Shaowen
to marry you and then seek revenge.

224
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,643
But have you thought about your life
afterwards?

225
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,322
You really take yourself as my uncle?

226
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:03,322
You're even worried about my future.

227
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,402
I'm more concerned

228
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:08,042
if you can successfully secure
the original formula in their hands.

229
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,803
What I promised,
I will see to it myself,

230
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,723
as long as I make Lin Shaowen
fall completely in love with me.

231
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,242
Why would he fall in love with you?

232
00:11:18,162 --> 00:11:20,442
You probably don't even know
how to seduce a man.

233
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,122
So you know?

234
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:38,803
You think that this could scare me?

235
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:40,963
I am braver

236
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,242
than you think.

237
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:44,843
Are you?

238
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:47,763
You don't believe it?

239
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:50,002
Then try me.
