(Facing the Outcome Together)

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,944
(Little Pavilion)

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,090
What are you doing?

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,570
Xinian, even if you have been wronged,

6
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,130
I have raised you up.

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,051
No matter what, we are a family.

8
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,371
Where is Su Jingyuan now?
Take us to him.

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,491
Xinian, it's hard to tell right from
wrong, but I'm closer than him to you.

10
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,650
You should know what is more important.

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,690
True, there's no absolute right
or wrong.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,170
But there's good or evil in a person.

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,650
That's why I'm duty-bound.

14
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:01,344
It's impossible for you to use me
to find him.

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,811
Is he that important to you?

16
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:06,531
He is not important to me at all.

17
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,210
It's more important for me to prevent
you from getting what you want.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,971
He is just hiding in Luoshi Pavilion.

19
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:19,411
Father wants more than his whereabouts.

20
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:23,730
Don't you want to know
if he would risk his life for you?

21
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:29,331
I'm afraid your calculations
will come to nothing.

22
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:32,730
He will not surrender himself for me.

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,811
He will do what he intends to do,
no matter what.

24
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,491
Once there is a soft spot, there are
some things he has to give up.

25
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:43,891
Take her back.

26
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:49,331
Let go of me. Let go!

27
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:55,451
Boss, both the Lin family and
the Cheng family

28
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,891
have set traps just waiting for you
to jump in.

29
00:01:57,891 --> 00:02:00,210
Yes, we can't just watch you
walk into your death.

30
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,570
The only way I can win is if I go alone.

31
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,851
Don't worry. I will come back alive,
together with her.

32
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:07,552
Boss.

33
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:08,292
Boss.

34
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,124
Boss.

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,931
Let her go. I've come alone.

36
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,570
To kill or to maim,
I'll leave it all to you.

37
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,491
But first, let Xinian go.

38
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,931
I would like to see if you two

39
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:36,570
are truly a passionately devoted couple.

40
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,690
A life for a life.
Nothing could be fairer.

41
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,971
If I die, how can I ensure
Xinian's safety?

42
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,250
You don't have to die.
But I can kill her right now.

43
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,411
Okay, don't be impulsive.
I'm coming over. Don't hurt her.

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,610
There is a secret within this jasper.
I will never take it off.

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,290
Now that I am in your hands.

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,290
You should let me see Xinian
one last time.

47
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,451
Fine, then I will grant you that.

48
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,250
Kill him.

49
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,690
You must hold on. Wait for me.

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,090
What are you waiting for? Go get him.

51
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,971
- Yes.
- Yes.

52
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,610
We have finally come to this point.

53
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,371
What do you want? Make it quick.

54
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,690
Do you know? Ever since I met you,

55
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:27,011
I have become increasingly greedy.

56
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:32,411
Because no one has ever said
she would give her all for me.

57
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:36,650
After that, I wanted even more.

58
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,130
I can't do without you more than ever.

59
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,811
But I don't know since when

60
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:43,371
you've changed into a different person.

61
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:48,320
It's like you can predict
every thought of mine.

62
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:53,931
Every step tells me what I want
is what I shouldn't have.

63
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,971
Even the affection you once had
for me, I couldn't attain.

64
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,851
Whether you can or should obtain,

65
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:04,250
you may strive for it
with your own hands.

66
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,851
But the deceit and exploitation of yours
to satisfy your desires

67
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:12,770
make some things beyond your reach
even in death.

68
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,371
Your greatest weakness
is loving yourself so much

69
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,170
that it surpasses everything.

70
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,770
If every step is left
to your discretion,

71
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,451
it will make the one
giving her heart for you

72
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:35,130
doomed to destruction and
buried in a sea of flames.

73
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,411
Can your conscience bear
such satisfaction?

74
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:51,170
From the moment you were willing
to risk your life to save him,

75
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,570
I knew it's him you love.

76
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,971
I also knew that I could
no longer have your love.

77
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:03,971
You also told me about the hope
no one understands and the fawning love.

78
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,090
Even if I possess it, what's the use?

79
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,531
They lured Su Jingyuan
to Eastern Ferry, Huaiyin Post.

80
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:33,931
This is what you wanted so badly.
You would even kill me for it.

81
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,170
It's all in the saltpeter.

82
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:38,610
I give it to you for your conscience.

83
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,331
If you can show the fireworks
to the world one day,

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,371
let it represent my freedom.

85
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:48,290
My life would not be in vain.

86
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,011
This is the first time you smiled to me

87
00:07:54,851 --> 00:08:00,331
without mockery or scoffing,
but a smile from the heart.

88
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,731
Cheng Xinian went to save Su Jingyuan.

89
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,490
Both of them fell from the cliff
as their horse fell.

90
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:28,530
Shaowen. You sent Cheng Xinian
to her death.

91
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,691
What's the use of going now?

92
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,090
Nonsense.

93
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,370
If that person really is Su Jingyuan,

94
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,490
then he is the archenemy
of both our families.

95
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,130
If Cheng Xinian is having an affair
with him, will she help us?

96
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,490
I told you to take a gamble with me

97
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,370
and tell her about the correspondence.

98
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,571
Yet you were still unable
to find out the truth.

99
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:54,571
She would rather die
than stay a bit longer for you.

100
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,170
The sincerity you desire
is but a pipe dream.

101
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,811
I am the unchanging support
you can rely on in this world.

102
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,170
Don't you get it, Shaowen?

103
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:11,130
After all, she is your sister.
How could you...

104
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,530
Only a biological sister can count.

105
00:09:30,851 --> 00:09:32,170
You're not hurt, are you?

106
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,611
And you? Are you injured?

107
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,691
You're injured.

108
00:09:49,811 --> 00:09:54,370
It's nothing, just a scrape.
It's not a big deal.

109
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,851
They shouldn't be able to find
this place soon.

110
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,611
It was urgent just now.
So I had to hold you and jump.

111
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,090
I knew the trees on the cliff
could save us.

112
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,731
I know martial arts and can
withstand it. But what about you?

113
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,250
It's fine. With you here,
I knew everything would be alright.

114
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:23,051
How did you know that the trees
on the cliff could support us?

115
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,330
That's all in the past now.

116
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:32,090
When you were exiled in the past,
were you hunted time after time?

117
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,891
You've survived before
by jumping off like this?

118
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:43,232
Besides "I'm sorry",

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,130
what else can I say? What else can I do?

120
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,370
None of this is your fault.
You've done nothing wrong.

121
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:06,611
You're having a fever. Come here.

122
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,051
It's okay, I'm here.

123
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,891
