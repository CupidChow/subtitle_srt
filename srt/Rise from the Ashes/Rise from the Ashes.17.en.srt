Once everything is settled,
I'll reclaim my identity as Su Jingyuan.

28
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,679
Luoshi Pavilion will
disappear completely.

29
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,159
If you want the travel around,

30
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,971
I'll take you across mountains and
rivers to see the beautiful world.

31
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,491
If you want a peaceful life,

32
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,210
we'll retire from the world
and live in the countryside.

33
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,048
No matter where,

34
00:02:47,072 --> 00:02:49,610
I will stay by your side
until death do us part.

35
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,931
You've thought it so thoroughly.

36
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:57,331
It seems as if you've thought about
these words a hundred times.

37
00:02:57,331 --> 00:03:01,491
Not just a hundred times,
but thousands of times.

38
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:08,411
The procedures, the ceremonies,
none of these matters.

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,411
I am your wife. As long as I am alive,

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,650
even if just for a moment,
I want to be with you.

41
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:24,371
How wonderful it would be
if time could stop right here.

42
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:28,331
Will the future you speak of come true?

43
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,411
It will come true, yes?

44
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,210
(The bride was switched
on the wedding night.)

45
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,971
Who knows when they will discover it.

46
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:58,570
These fools are definitely still
sharing the same bed.

47
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,130
The thought of continuing the charade
makes me feel sick.

48
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,531
Rest assured. I will think of a solution
as soon as possible

49
00:04:13,531 --> 00:04:17,650
to bring the Lin family to ruin,
forcing them to hand over the formula.

50
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,730
But I don't want you to...

51
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,011
Hesitation only leads to defeat.

52
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,770
I'm inside and you're outside.

53
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:32,610
Rest assured. The trap is set.
They will surely fall for it.

54
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:36,451
Your safety is of utmost importance.

55
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:40,770
Even if it takes longer,
there's no rush.

56
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,011
But I am anxious.

57
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:49,090
I'm anxious for our future
to arrive soon.

58
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,210
Mrs. Lin, shouldn't you be
in the bridal chamber...

59
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,290
Shut up and lead the way.

60
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,371
Okay.

61
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,931
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

62
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,090
And carrying so many things?

63
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,770
The estate was burnt
and I had to recuperate.

64
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,811
Now Xinian is married.

65
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:17,891
The estate has been renovated.
It's not suitable to bother you.

66
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:21,051
Why speak as if we're not family?

67
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,891
I still hope that you will marry soon

68
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,290
and have a lively celebration.

69
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:27,770
A few days ago, I saw you
entertaining guests.

70
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,130
I thought you did not want me
to stay here anymore.

71
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,130
How could I drive you away?

72
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,851
Moreover, Qingyue has not yet
been married.

73
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,331
- Why not stay longer?
- Bad news.

74
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,570
Miss Qingyue left a letter,

75
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,011
saying she would marry Lin Shaowen

76
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:42,090
and asking you to leave her be.

77
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,690
What?

78
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:45,408
(Wedding)

79
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,931
Xinian.

80
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,064
So it's true. Yesterday I was drugged
and lost consciousness.

81
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,411
I heard that the one getting married
was Qingyue.

82
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:04,051
Switching brides?
Adultery without a wedding?

83
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,130
How could you commit
such an indecent act?

84
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,650
Qingyue, what on earth is going on?

85
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,891
I don't know. Shaowen, what should I do?

86
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,891
Don't touch me.

87
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:18,170
You are so senseless.
How can you reassure father?

88
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,690
How would the clan think of you?

89
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,690
Lin Shaowen, is this how you treat me?

90
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,851
- No. I...
- If so,

91
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,331
then please draft a divorce letter
for me to satisfy them.

92
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:33,610
But the Cheng family won't cooperate
with you anymore.

93
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,931
- Xinian.
- Xinian.

94
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,331
Our fireworks business has just won
favor with the nobles.

95
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:42,811
Don't give up on our cooperation
over this trifle.

96
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:46,650
Trifle? They used me
as a stepping stone,

97
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,051
shamelessly humiliating me.

98
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,730
How can you still expect me
to work for you,

99
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,451
with the final credit going
to your family?

100
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,371
You took everything from me,
yet you still won't let me be.

101
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,531
You drugged me and clouded my mind.

102
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,451
It wasn't me. I didn't do it.

103
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,931
Xinian. Qingyue set me up.

104
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,290
The one I've wanted to marry is you.

105
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,210
Shaowen.

106
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:12,971
Shut up.

107
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,051
Xinian, believe me.
I will make her leave right away.

108
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:19,250
Your position won't be taken.

109
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,051
Lin Shaowen,
how can you be so heartless?

110
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:26,610
If you do this,
you will humiliate the Cheng family.

111
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,170
Xinian is valuable to the Cheng family.

112
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,090
Only she knows how to make fireworks.

113
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:44,331
So this is the reason you wanted
to marry me.

114
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,210
Xinian, rest assured.

115
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,931
Even if Qingyue stays here,

116
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,331
you are the only one who will be
the rightful Mrs. Lin.

117
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,290
Lin Shaowen.

118
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,130
I don't want to see you all.

119
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,411
Clean the house for me to live alone.
No strangers are allowed to come in.

120
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,330
(Favor one
and treat the other as trash.)

121
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,931
(Despise one,
and treat the other like a treasure.)

122
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,931
(It's not that someone isn't
good enough,)

123
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,170
(but that they're never worth it.)

124
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,490
You want to cooperate with me?

125
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:42,731
You are Lin Shaowen's wife.

126
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,130
He shared the bed with another woman
on the wedding night.

127
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:52,250
What use do I have for a marriage
in name only?

128
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,731
Compared to being the wife
of an imperial merchant,

129
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:59,530
I'd rather take my compensation
and return to the Cheng family.

130
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:03,170
It seems that you are truly angry

131
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,611
and determined to burn your boats.

132
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,771
The patriarch of the Lin family
is your father.

133
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:11,051
But the one manages the ledgers
is Lin Shaowen.

134
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:15,731
In the end, what will you have?

135
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,688
Whatever they think or do can't
escape my eyes.

136
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,450
The Lin family will be in my hands
sooner or later.

137
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,691
But in the eyes of the nobles and
the clan elders,

138
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,731
all these shops are in your name.

139
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,184
Lin Shaowen's deficit

140
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:34,330
can easily be blamed on you.

141
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,290
Lin Shaowen keeps a low profile,

142
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:39,771
but holds high prestige within the clan.

143
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:48,330
Aren't you afraid that he'll
take control of the Lin family?

144
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,691
Great-uncle, as you know, my wife
has been studying new formulas.

145
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,011
I'd like to see the Su family's formula.

146
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,130
In the future, your share
in our shops will be doubled.

147
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:02,611
Have some tea.

148
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,490
