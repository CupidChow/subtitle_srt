Open the gate!

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Open the gate!

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Open the gate!

6
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,960
Open the gate today!

7
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,280
Open the gate!

8
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,340
Open the gate!

9
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,800
Open the gate!

10
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,340
Open the gate!

11
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,280
Open the gate!

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,560
Open the gate!

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,760
Open the gate!

14
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,860
Open the gate!

15
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,260
I'm afraid I'll be late.

16
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,460
I'll go to the temple.

17
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,660
I'll go to the temple.

18
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,860
I'll go to the temple.

19
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,060
I'll go to the temple.

20
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,260
I'll go to the temple.

21
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,460
I'll go to the temple.

22
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,660
I'll go to the temple.

23
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,860
I'll go to the temple.

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,060
I'll go to the temple.

25
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,260
I'll go to the temple.

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,460
I'll go to the temple.

27
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,860
I'll go to the temple.

28
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,260
I'll go to the temple.

29
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,460
I'll go to the temple.

30
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,660
I'll go to the temple.

31
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,860
I'll go to the temple.

32
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,260
I'll go to the temple.

33
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,460
I'll go to the temple.

34
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,860
I'll go to the temple.

35
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,260
I'll go to the temple.

36
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,460
I'll go to the temple.

37
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,860
I'll go to the temple.

38
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,260
I'll go to the temple.

39
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,460
I'll go to the temple.

40
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,420
Untie me,

41
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,460

57
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,980
I am here to see you.

58
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
I will not go to the court.

59
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,980
I am not qualified to be the minister.

60
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,980
I am grateful.

61
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
General Lin, please rise.

62
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Please accept my edict.

63
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I heard that you came back.

64
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,980
His Majesty is not free.

65
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,980
He came to the capital personally.

66
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,980
He was persuaded by Lord Zuo.

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,980
General Lin, please change the uniform of His Majesty.

68
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,980
Let's go back to the palace first.

69
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,980
His Majesty will personally prepare a feast for you.

70
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Your Majesty, I received the medical report.

71
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,980
After I have been treated, I will go back to the palace to accompany His Majesty.

72
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,980
I will personally ask His Majesty for punishment.

73
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

74
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,980
What is this?

75
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Is he sick?

76
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,980
It's been 1000 years since he got sick.

77
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
He is not as sick as Yue Yu.

78
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
How could he be so sick?

79
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,980
I told you.

80
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,980
You are the one who is not good at making your own money.

81
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
He is not well yet.

82
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,980
You should go.

83
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Let's go.

84
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
He is not well yet. He can't walk.

85
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,980
You should go if you can't walk.

86
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,980
After half a month, the master will return.

87
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Don't say that he is sick.

88
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,980
He is dead.

89
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,980
You should go back with me.

90
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Fourth Young Madam, I think you haven't eaten anything hot for the past 10 days.

91
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,980
I have cooked a lot of food today.

92
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I have finished eating and I am on my way.

93
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,980
If you don't open the door again, I will be here in ten boxes.

94
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,980
How dare you!

95
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
I am hungry.

96
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Slow down.

97
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,980
We have been sick for so long. We can't afford to eat.

98
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
You are not hungry.

99
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
You can eat slowly.

100
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,980
But this time, I am afraid that I will get sick.

101
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,980
You are sick, so you will be here.

102
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
I am sick.

103
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,980
You are still sick.

104
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,980
You have been sick for so long.

105
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,980
They haven't asked about the doctor yet.

106
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
They have been sick.

107
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,980
I am sure that they are sick.

108
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,980
I am a person who will die.

109
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,980
You can't be surprised by my parents.

110
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Now that you are here, you are really in a good mood.

111
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,980
But these years, the housekeeper and the woman are looking for a job.

112
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,980
They are worried that you will be paid for it.

113
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,980
These years, I am worried about these few letters.

114
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,980
It is still the first time in the world.

115
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
But I am sick.

116
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,980
If they take it, I will die of illness.

117
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Have you finished eating?

118
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,980
After eating, you should come with us to eat.

119
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,980
The housekeeper hasn't changed. I will eat with you.

120
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
Young Master,

121
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,980
I am here.

122
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Thank you.

123
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
What did the Fourth Madam say? She is also the master of the children.

124
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Is it necessary for you to be the master of the seven worlds?

125
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,980
She is just a girl who is not in the house.

126
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,980
She is just a girl who is not in the house.

127
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,980
She is just a girl who is not in the house.

128
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,980
She is really the master of the seven worlds.

129
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,980
Can you open the door?

130
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,980
If you don't open the door, I will break in.

131
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
What are you doing?

132
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
What are you doing?

133
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,980
I don't believe it.

134
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,980
I can't take you away from me, right?

135
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
I...

136
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,980
You go back with me.

137
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Go.

138
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,980
Ah-Qi!

139
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,980
Who told you to put this knife in the door?

140
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,980
You intentionally hurt me, right?

141
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Master Li.

142
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Master Li, I am afraid that I forgot.

143
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,980
A few days ago, I ordered the housekeeper to tell me that

144
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,980
there are too many people in this house.

145
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Master Li said that I came here to think about it.

146
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
I didn't come to serve you.

147
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,980
He asked me to prepare these plants.

148
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,980
I heard that Master Li knocked on the door.

149
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,980
I was afraid that the plants would look for you.

150
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,980
So, the housekeeper quickly took these things out.

151
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,980
Actually, you didn't know that Uncle Li broke in.

152
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,980
You are just a little girl.

153
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,980
It's hard to do.

154
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Don't talk! Don't talk!

155
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
You...

156
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Miss, don't use those words of no one to punish me.

157
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
I know that you don't have the heart to do it.

158
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,980
But you can only blame yourself for being stubborn.

159
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
You locked yourself in the private room.

160
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
That's to teach you a lesson.

161
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,980
You can't do anything that will ruin the whole family.

162
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,980
You are so hard-working.

163
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Miss, you are so kind.

164
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Although I am grateful to you,

165
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,980
I am so hungry right now.

166
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Uncle, you made that wrong move and I caught you.

167
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,400
Don't think it should hurt my head.

168
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,780
Don't give up.

169
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,980
Have you seen it?

170
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
Look.

171
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,780
I don't want to know what's wrong.

172
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,940
Father,

173
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm afraid something can happen.

174
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,100
You universick me.

175
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,860
The superman Hu Heng

176
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,060
comes backwordhting

177
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:44,320
now.

178
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,980
How can he handle this?

179
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm so worried about this situation.

180
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:59,260
You know

181
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,760
that

182
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,500
I understand.

183
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,560
But I think that you saved Madam

184
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,380
for instigating her to suffer.

185
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,440
These are things you need,

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
and you shouldn't还有那么多花�ated

187
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,480
thinking about her illness.

188
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,180
Today, I need your help

189
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,480
to make her ignore.

190
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,900
My young master is not fit for working at home right now

191
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,840
and she can't bear the burden of the tents.

192
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
It's not what Madamian in this world

193
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,540
used to have.

194
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,580
He's just now in her!?

195
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,880
How can you worry now?

196
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,440
How dare he take her to the car!

197
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,240
Don't move.

198
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,040
Don't be old.

199
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't be cold.

200
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I will go by myself.

201
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,040
The old man is going to the carriage.

202
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
It seems that Dong Ze is not on the carriage.

203
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,040
You have to practice that.

204
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Where did the old man come from?

205
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,040
He is obviously a little girl.

206
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,840
Which house is this woman's dress so dirty?

207
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
What are you looking at?

208
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,640
Get on the carriage.

209
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
What is the look like?

210
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,640
Hurry up.

211
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,640
Hide away.

212
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,040
Oh, yes.

213
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,440
How can I be a thief in this carriage?

214
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
This is the most important thing.

215
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
Isn't it Li Guan Fu's body?

216
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,640
Hurry up.

217
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
He is a servant.

218
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
Hurry up.

219
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:43,840
Hurry up.

220
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
This is not Li Guan Fu's body.

221
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,240
This is the man who has not bathed for many days.

222
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,240
Man?

223
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,240
Hurry up.

224
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Hurry up.

225
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Hurry up.

226
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Hurry up.

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,040
Hurry up.

228
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,640
Hurry up.

229
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,440
Hurry up.

230
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,040
Hurry up.

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Hurry up.

232
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,040
What kind of man is he?

233
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
He is stinky.

234
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,840
The only one who is a servant can come back early.

235
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,640
What are we going to eat?

236
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Who will come back to save me if I am a father and mother?

237
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,240
My future life is good and bad.

238
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Maybe you.

239
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
Then of course you don't have to go back to your current position.

240
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Everyone is bullied.

241
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
You have to hurry up and take the patient back.

242
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
You are so anxious.

243
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
You don't know what to do.

244
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
But it's not hard to do.

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,240
Naturally, it's the city.

246
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,640
It's more important than being a hostage.

247
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,040
This Fourth Madam.

248
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
This character.

249
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
She is a man.

250
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,440
She is a man.

251
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,040
This Xiao Yuan Yi.

252
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,440
A second-hand man.

253
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,840
What good is it?

254
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
He is not married by the wolf.

255
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,640
This...

256
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,240
Let's go.

257
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,840
Let's go.

258
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,640
By the way,

259
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,040
didn't you take her in the morning?

260
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,440
Yes.

261
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
She is bitter.

262
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
She can bear me.

263
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I have three children and I am grown up.

264
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,040
When did you all two wake up?

265
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,240
It must bevoice distinction.

266
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,240
Spencer and my son.

267
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,000
Alright, bro.

268
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Don't you know.

269
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,640
Did you ever see someone yesterday?

270
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,240
Are the disaster in theера good?

271
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:46,640
Yes.

272
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
But the two is too upset.

273
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,240
I'm just worried

274
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
that he's telling me all the time.

275
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,240
I just don't have time to shoot the kill,

276
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Why is it so fast?

277
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
My son is back.

278
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,240
My son is back.

279
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
My son is back.

280
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
It's been more than a decade.

281
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,240
God bless.

282
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
God bless.

283
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,240
My son is back.

284
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Aunt.

285
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,240
You're back.

286
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
You're back.

287
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,240
Where's my son?

288
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Yuan Yi.

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
Yuan Yi.

290
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
Your favorite son.

291
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,240
I know.

292
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Son.

293
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
I know.

294
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,240
I know.

295
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Yuan Yi.

296
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
It's been more than a decade.

297
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
It's still the old man's job.

298
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Go and have a look.

299
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I don't know when I'll be home.

300
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
I need some snacks.

301
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
I'll buy you some snacks.

302
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,240
I don't know how to treat my mother.

303
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Son.

304
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Son.

305
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,240
Mother.

306
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Dan.

307
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Dan.

308
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Mother.

309
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Father.

310
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Mother.

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
You're back to your senses again.

312
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
You're back to your senses again.

313
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
You're used to being in the countryside.

314
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Why haven't you changed?

315
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
You're so unfilial.

316
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,240
You should have been the mother of the countryside.

317
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,240
How could you three brothers...

318
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
Mother's head is really sharp.

319
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Not as sharp as it was.

320
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Son.

321
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Aunt.

322
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
You've been fighting outside for years.

323
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
You've been worried about your health.

324
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
It seems that you're not as sharp as you were.

325
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
You must be healthy.

326
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,240
We're relieved.

327
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Aunt.

328
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
For the past ten years,

329
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,240
have you been at home?

330
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Please don't worry.

331
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Oh, right.

332
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Where's Niao Niao?

333
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Why didn't she come to pick us up?

334
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
She's not here.

335
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Put the carriage aside.

336
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,240
Stop the tea.

337
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Stop the carriage.

338
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
General.

339
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Stop us.

340
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
The imperial court order to arrest the suspect.

341
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Come on.

342
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Search the carriage.

343
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Wait.

344
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,240
The carriage is the wife of the Prime Minister,

345
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
the Prime Minister's wife.

346
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
There's no other way.

347
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
My lady,

348
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
you're not well-matched.

349
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,240
How could you let the man search the carriage?

350
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,240
The officer's residence is closed.

351
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
I'm sorry.

359
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm sorry.

360
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Although you're fora 뒤五将家人,

361
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
you shouldn't take actions in accordance with the customs.

362
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,240
How can you delay public affairs of generals?

363
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,740
All generals should follow him

364
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,240
who treated me like a stray dog in public.

365
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't get my hands dirty.

366
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I wonder if you're really being searched.

367
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Even the court want this,

368
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
I include most of it.

369
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
It's industrial.

370
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Just that,

371
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
before searching the carriage,

372
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,760
Please come up to the Mr.誦.

373
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,160
Say it.

374
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:01,080
Mr. or something?

375
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,760
But general is seriously a thing.

376
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,020
If the grass islaughing,

377
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
it might make them burn out and they may try to incite somebody.

378
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,720
At that time, its more passportable!

379
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,360
General, we are rich in excesses.

380
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,420
If we could live very well,

381
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,520
you would have to be more sincere.

382
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,600
Not only sincere,

383
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
we will know that by just getting the grass burn.

384
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,100
General,

385
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,960
even though my house is big,

386
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,600
you can still get rid of it,

387
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,600
I can't kill him! I can't kill him!

388
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I can't kill him! I can't kill him!

389
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Young Master! Young Master!

390
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,100
Young Master, we still can't listen to him.

391
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,600
We should ask this young lady to search the car.

392
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Young Master!

393
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Young Master!

394
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,600
He fell down!

395
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm sorry, Young Master!

396
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Don't kill me!

397
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

398
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Don't worry.

399
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Commander Li, the general said to let him go.

400
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Why are you still unwilling to leave?

401
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
You're dead!

402
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
If you want to live, don't talk nonsense.

403
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Just press it.

404
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Be careful!

405
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't regret it.

406
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Young Master!

407
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Young Master! Young Master!

408
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,600
Please forgive me. I'm the new general in the city.

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
You're all the members of the City Council.

410
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Please forgive me.

411
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,600
The car you just parked was really the wife of the city?

412
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
You really are her uncle?

413
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
You're so naive!

414
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Madam is a big man.

415
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,600
She used the wrong thing that she did.

416
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
But now, you're still trying to save the old man.

417
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Even if you're the wife, you can't keep her safe.

418
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
The new general almost killed the whole Chen family.

419
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
I'm just trying to save them.

420
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I just want to live.

421
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Madam, your father, mother and you can only come back in half a month.

422
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,600
You really want to be strong?

423
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Master and your brother-in-law are back?

424
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
They're still in a hurry.

425
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
If they really put you in their hearts,

426
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
how could they be angry with you?

427
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Young Master, you're the wife of the city.

428
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
You're the young lady in the city.

429
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
You're the one who killed the people.

430
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,600
How could you know that?

431
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Young Master, you're the wife of the city.

432
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
You're the old man.

433
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Young Master, you're the wife of the city.

434
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
You're the young lady in the city.

435
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
You're the wife of the city.

436
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
You're the young lady in the city.

437
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
You're the wife of the city.

438
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You're the young lady in the city.

439
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You're the young lady in the city.

440
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,600
You're the young lady in the city.

441
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
You're the young lady in the city.

442
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
You're the young lady in the city.

443
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
You're the young lady in the city.

444
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Son, you're like a mother.

445
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Come on, open your mouth.

446
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Son,

447
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
as I said,

448
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
it's not all right.

449
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,600
The wife of the city is in a bad mood.

450
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
We sent her to the countryside.

451
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
We just want to teach her a lesson.

452
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Besides, we...

453
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Stop, stop, stop.

454
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Hurry up.

455
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Madam!

456
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Something happened, Madam.

457
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
What happened?

458
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Madam, what happened?

459
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
The wife of the city is in a bad mood.

460
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
She's in a bad mood.

461
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
What's wrong?

462
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
What are you doing?

463
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
What's wrong, Young Master Dong?

464
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
You just said,

465
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,600
no one has a wife.

466
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Young Master Chang.

467
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
Yes.

468
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Master.

469
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Master, save me.

470
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
The young lady was in a bad mood.

471
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
She was thrown into the closet and died.

472
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
She was killed by blood.

473
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Today, the housekeeper suddenly came up to the door.

474
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
He said, even if she died,

475
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
she would drag the young lady back to death.

476
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Then where is my home?

477
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Father.

478
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Mother.

479
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
You're finally back.

480
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Miao Miao.

481
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
What should we do?

482
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Miao Miao.

483
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
This is my Miao Miao.

484
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Why is she so drunk?

485
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Father.

486
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Mother.

487
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Miao Miao.

488
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,600
You're finally back alive.

489
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Mother.

490
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
I've been working outside for 15 years.

491
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I thought that someone would take care of me

492
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
when I was at home.

493
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I was sure that I would be fine.

494
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,600
I was afraid that she would be taken to the hospital.

495
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Master.

496
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
You're blaming mother.

497
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
I was old.

498
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I was so angry.

499
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Son.

500
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
You haven't been home for so many years.

501
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
You bought me a new heart when you came back.

502
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,600
You were so unfair to your daughter.

503
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
But mother.

504
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
I've been in a bad mood for so many years.

505
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Mother.

506
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
Master.

507
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
Miao Miao.

508
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Miao Miao.

509
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
When you and father passed away,

510
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
what did your brothers say?

511
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,600
They said that you've grown up and that you want to laugh at me.

512
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
But now you're so clear.

513
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,600
You want mother to die.

514
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Uncle Xu.

515
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
It's my fault.

516
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I heard about it all the time.

517
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,600
So I'm so worried about mother.

518
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,600
She almost killed my mother's nephew.

519
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
We sent her to the village.

520
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
We wanted to raise her.

521
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
But mother died so badly.

522
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,600
I've been so worried about her for 11 years.

523
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I...

524
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I don't even wear the same clothes as you.

525
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,600
I can't even be a stupid woman.

526
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Who are you?

527
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
We're from the Cheng family.

528
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Aunt.

529
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
We're not strangers.

530
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
We're the sisters of my sister.

531
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,600
We've been with me in the army.

532
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
We're strangers.

533
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Come on.

534
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Take this old man to the kitchen.

535
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Yes.

536
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Let him rest.

537
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Oh, my god.

538
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
Son.

539
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You've been away for 15 years.

540
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Son.

541
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
You...

542
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
You're so worried about me.

543
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
You're so worried about me.

544
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Do you still have mother in your eyes?

545
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
Aunt.

546
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
It's a new week.

547
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Aunt.

548
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Come here.

549
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Come here.

550
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Come here.

551
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
Come here.

552
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
You're so worried about me.

553
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Come here.

554
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Aunt.

555
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Aunt, I'm sorry.

556
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Come here.

557
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
Come here.

558
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Come here.

559
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Come here.

560
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Come here.

561
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Come here.

562
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Where's the room?

563
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
This floor.

564
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Let me go.

565
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Aunt.

566
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
Aunt.

567
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Go.

568
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Aunt.

569
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,680
Aunt, drink some soup.

570
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,240
No matter how much I love my granddaughter,

571
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,680
I can't just keep my own body.

572
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,240
Her parents don't want me to love my granddaughter.

573
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm afraid that Cai Yi has been taking care of her daughter

574
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,320
for so many years.

575
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,720
I can't imagine

576
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,600
how many years it has been.

577
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,320
You don't care about the care.

578
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,880
We have to take care of each other

579
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,800
and take care of the little baby.

580
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,920
We have no labor and no hard labor.

581
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,040
We can't be sick.

582
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,640
But in a few days,

583
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,520
we'll be so exhausted and crying.

584
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,080
Don't worry. You can take care of it yourself.

585
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Mrs. Lao is really funny.

586
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
It seems that my wife is the one

587
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,400
who doesn't want to take care of your son.

588
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,320
In this world,

589
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
no mother-in-law

590
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,760
is willing to abandon the child in the castle.

591
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
No one is forcing her.

592
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,880
Qing Cong.

593
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,360
You're so shameless.

594
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,080
How dare you!

595
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,400
Come on!

596
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,360
Let's have a good talk!

597
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,680
What are you talking about?

598
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,480
Did Qing Cong say something wrong?

599
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,000
The little bird was just a joke.

600
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,120
But now, she says

601
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,480
she's afraid that our wife won't want to take care of her son.

602
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,360
She's not filial and she's hard-working.

603
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,560
Uncle Xu,

604
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,000
what you said is too hurtful.

605
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,160
You know that

606
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,680
Mrs. Lao is lying in the bed

607
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,880
and pitying her.

608
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,960
But you know that

609
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,880
in the ordinary life,

610
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,560
Mrs. Lao is so gentle and gentle.

611
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,600
She's so gentle and gentle.

612
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,680
She's so gentle and gentle.

613
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,880
The world is full of people.

614
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,800
It's better for a girl to have a father and a daughter.

615
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,760
But let me ask you something.

616
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,800
Uncle Xu,

617
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,360
isn't filial and gentle

618
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,120
your role as a eldest son?

619
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,240
Your Highness.

620
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,280
Your Highness.

621
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,080
You're awake.

622
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,880
I'll get up.

623
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I'm sorry for the trouble you've caused.

624
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,800
You're still sick.

625
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
Don't you need these gifts?

626
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,960
Mrs. Lao is worried about me.

627
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,280
It's the first time

628
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,320
that Mrs. Lao has seen me

629
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,280
since she was a child.

630
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,640
I've never been in the palace before.

631
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,080
I'll give these gifts to you today.

632
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,280
I'll give them to you.

633
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,200
Miss.

634
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
Miss.

635
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,760
Get up.

636
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,240
Get up.

637
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Hurry.

638
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,840
Your Highness, you're not sensible.

639
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,640
You're not against me.

640
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,920
It's my duty.

641
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
Good boy.

642
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
Take a rest.

643
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,600
My daughter is sick.

644
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,240
She's been ill for a week.

645
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,840
You'll blame her for being impolite.

646
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,240
I'm a father.

647
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,880
You can't even ask her a question.

648
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,400
I'll die then.

649
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,120
I'll pay her a life sentence, okay?

650
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,520
You married a married man

651
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,040
and you're paying her a life sentence.

652
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,960
What's the point of this?

653
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,080
Why would mother find her a wife?

654
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Since you came into our family,

655
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,920
no matter how big or small,

656
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,720
you're always drunk.

657
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,760
We're just good friends.

658
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,960
Right.

659
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,680
Do you still think I'm a father?

660
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,120
Don't say anything else.

661
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,480
You've been out for so many years.

662
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,400
You've been rewarded so many times.

663
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,160
You've been blessed so many times.

664
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,240
You're not against me.

665
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
You're not against me.

666
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,680
I'm just an orphan.

667
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm just being kept from you.

668
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
Mother.

669
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
It's late.

670
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
Please come to visit your daughter.

671
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,480
Please go back to your room and rest.

672
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
I'll rest.

673
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
You'll be happy

674
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,160
when I'm in the coffin, right?

675
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,480
I can't breathe.

676
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,280
I need to find a place to breathe.

677
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,040
Your Highness, please rest.

678
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
I'll serve the kitchen

679
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,320
to cook something you like.

680
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,440
Then, what can I eat?

681
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
actually just a desk

682
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,600
This is the seat at which the princes land.

683
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,200
I gotta go.

684
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,840
Be careful.

685
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,640
Wait forocation again.

686
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,880
I'll bringStill not reported.

687
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,480
What's that?

688
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,960
He's a good-for-nothing.

689
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,560
He's a good-for-nothing.

690
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,680
He's not the only one who's bothered by the female lead.

691
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,880
He's also a good-for-nothing.

692
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,240
A good-for-nothing?

693
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,000
He shouldn't have let go of his tears.

694
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,440
You're good at catching him.

695
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,360
You're really a good-for-nothing.

696
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm impressed

697
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,720
with your great-for-nothing.

698
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,320
What do you mean?

699
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,840
Do you know my wife?

700
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,520
I don't know her.

701
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,000
But I can't say

702
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,680
I don't know her at all.

703
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,240
Take a closer look.

704
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,600
These are the people

705
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
who found out about the rescue.

706
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,840
I heard that it's a portrait.

707
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,680
I wonder if they really

708
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,800
got involved in the rescue.

709
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,800
Why would they?

710
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,960
General Lin.

711
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,440
Hold on a sec.

712
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,680
Take a seat.

713
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,320
Send a prop,

714
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,200
so Commander Chen will see it.

715
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,960
Or rather, how do you say

716
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm from Handığın City?

717
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,340
Who are you?

718
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm you.

719
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,460
Do you know

720
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,380
who Du VAJOU is?

721
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,020
He's the most last to run a family

722
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
His country will have many riches and power

723
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,300
He is the King's last to rule the city

724
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,380
But what does he have?

725
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
Help!

726
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Help!

727
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,780
Shi!

728
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
It's me!

729
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Uncle! What's going on?

730
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,180
This is all your good daughter.

731
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,980
General, you should be thirsty. I'll cook dinner.

732
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,980
Who is it?

733
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,580
You think I'm not talented enough?

734
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,980
General Lin, this...

735
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,380
There must be a misunderstanding.

736
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,780
The situation of the Governor of Dong Can,

737
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,180
I'm sure that Cheng Xiao Wei knows better than I do.

738
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,780
He's been greedy for military information and evidence.

739
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,980
Today, I came here to tell Cheng Xiao Wei

740
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,980
that no matter how high the military power is,

741
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,580
I will not let you know when I'm in the state.

742
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,180
It's not what I expected.

743
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,180
No, I'm just happy.

744
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
Mr.Yi.

745
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Mr.Yi.

746
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,380
You sayhh.....

747
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,180
